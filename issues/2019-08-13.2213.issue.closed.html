<p>Is it possible to use WiFi when booted from the ReaR recovery media?</p>
<p>When booting from ReaR on a laptop, I noticed a message, about starting
the DHCP daemon, that stayed on screen an unusually long time (maybe
over a minute) compared to the boot time in a VM, before finally
arriving at the login prompt.</p>
<p>On the laptop with WiFi enabled but no ethernet cable plugged in, there
was no network connectivity. After plugging in an ethernet cable and
waiting a bit, the network connection works.</p>
<p>It's unclear to me whether ReaR supports WiFi connections at all.</p>
<p>If so, does ReaR store the necessary information such as SSID, access
point, password, perhaps via config file variables that must be set? Or
can a WiFi connection be set up manually once booted from ReaR?</p>

<p>There is nothing speaking against WiFi support in ReaR, just so far
nobody provided code for this. Most of ReaR usage seems to happen on
servers or desktops/laptops with an Ethernet connection (maybe also due
to the higher and more reliable transfer speeds).</p>
<p>If you want to submit a pull request then it will be very welcome.</p>
<p>If your inquiry is about reducing the boot time for a laptop without a
network connection then please update the title and description and
provide more details.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply @schlomo.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>To clarify, does this mean that ReaR could in principle support WiFi but
that it is not currently implemented?</p>
<p>Is it possible to establish a WiFi connection manually in the recovery
environment, or does it require some implementation in ReaR?</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm not sufficiently well-versed in neither ReaR nor
networking to make a pull request, but I'm happy to help with testing.</p>

<p>No, your first interpretation was correct. I will make another issue for
the slow boot as that may be unrelated.</p>

<p>Yes, there is no code at present to copy the required files and daemons
for WiFi support to the rescue system. That is the reason why manually
activating WiFi is currently not possible.</p>

<p>@adatum<br />
regarding how the main networking setup happens in the recovery system
see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2214#issuecomment-521217612">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2214#issuecomment-521217612</a></p>
<p>Regarding manual WiFi setup:</p>
<p>Use COPY_AS_IS and PROGS in your etc/rear/local.conf to specify the
needed files<br />
and programs for WiFi setup to be included into the ReaR recovery
system.</p>
<p>After you booted the ReaR recovery system log in as root and manually<br />
set up WiFi networking.</p>
<p>When you know the right commands to set up WiFi networking you can<br />
automate that via NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS,<br />

<p>@adatum<br />
a general side note regarding "using ReaR on a laptop":</p>
<p>Current ReaR is primarily meant to be used to recover server systems<br />
where the user usually has many same pieces of server hardware<br />
(or many same kind of virtual machines) so that same replacement<br />
hardware (where "hardware" could be also virtual hardware) is
available,<br />
cf. the section "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a></p>
<p>Usually when one particular laptop hardware breaks down<br />
there is no "fully compatible replacement hardware" available<br />
because the currently sold laptops are already different.<br />
As far as I know in particular WiFi hardware changes all the time.</p>
<p>This means to recreate the system on different replacement hardware<br />
is what we call a "migration" and in this case arbitrary issues could
get<br />
into your way up to the point that it is impossible to recreate the
system<br />
with ReaR (with reasonable effort).</p>
<p>This does not mean ReaR usually fails to recreate on different
hardware<br />
but it does mean you should be prepared that it may not work with ReaR<br />
so that you would have to install the system anew from scratch,<br />
cf. "Be prepared for the worst case" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a></p>

<p>@jsmeix</p>
<p>Thanks for the warning about potential failure to recreate on different
hardware. I hope that there is at least a good chance of success if the
replacement hardware is supported by the built-in drivers in the linux
kernel. But I'll keep this possibility in mind.</p>
<p>The more likely migration scenario is adding or upgrading an SSD and
wanting to change the file system mount points and/or partition sizes.</p>
<p>Back on the subject of WiFi, I was able to get a connection by adapting
<a href="https://www.blackmoreops.com/2014/09/18/connect-to-wifi-network-from-command-line-in-linux/">this
guide</a>:</p>
<p><code>PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" iw wpa_supplicant wpa_passphase )</code></p>
<p>Then in the ReaR recovery environment I did:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ip link set wlp2s0 up</code></li>
<li><code>wpa_passphrase [SSID] &gt;&gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></li>
<li>Enter WiFi passphrase at prompt</li>
<li><code>wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</code></li>
</ol>
<p><code>iw wlp2s0 link</code> indicated the WiFi connection was established.
Sometimes it would take a few moments for pings and dns to get working.</p>
<p>I also tried</p>
<p><code>NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip link set wlp2s0 up' 'echo "Enter WiFi passphrase:"' 'wpa_passphrase [SSID] &gt;&gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf' 'wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf' )</code></p>
<p>which prompts for the password during the boot process, and upon login
the WiFi connection is up and running. There might be a more elegant way
of doing this, but at least it works and gives me lots of options.
Thanks for the pointers @jsmeix !</p>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You mentioned</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After you booted the ReaR recovery system log in as root</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but I've noticed that the login always logs in as root no matter
what is typed at the login prompt. Is that normal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>nano</code> seems to be glitched in ReaR. Moving the cursor over text
    file contents changes what is displayed on screen. It seems to shift
    some characters over by a space or so. Almost as though the cursor's
    "view" can lag or skip relative to what it should be displaying.
    <code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code> seem unaffected.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>@adatum<br />
thank you for your explanatory description how you made WiFi work in
your case.<br />
This can help a lot to be able in the future (as time permits)<br />
to implement a generic working way to support WiFi in ReaR.</p>
<p>Regarding your notes:</p>
<p>Yes, root (without password) is the only user in the ReaR recovery
system.<br />
Who can boot a machine from an external boot medium can do anything<br />
he wants so root login without password from the ReaR recovery medium<br />
does not make anything worse.</p>
<p>I never used nano but I guess it may not work well in the ReaR recovery
system<br />
because the ReaR recovery system is very minimal, for example it has
no<br />
localization support (only plain US ASCII),<br />
cf. the section about "Character encoding" in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style">https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style</a><br />
and the recovery system has likely no special terminal support<br />
(basically only the plain Linux kernel console - perhaps you could<br />
specify appropriate kernel command line parameters for the console)<br />
or things like that what nano might need to run normally.<br />
With sufficient additional things in COPY_AS_IS you can enhance the<br />
ReaR recovery system files as you need but this makes it bigger but<br />
the current usual use case of ReaR is to recreate (many) server
systems.<br />
Because the ReaR recovery system is specific for each system where<br />
is was made by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup", users who have many servers<br />
need to store many ReaR recovery system ISO images which is the reason<br />
behind why the ReaR recovery system is as small as reasonably
possible.<br />
Of course what is considered to be reasonable depends on the particular
case,<br />
for an example cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041</a><br />
see also the part about "MODULES=( 'all_modules' )" in<br />

<p>Since ReaR 2.5 there is in default.conf MODULES=( 'all_modules' )<br />
cf.
<a href="http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5">http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5</a><br />
so that "there is at least a good chance of success if the replacement<br />
hardware is supported by the built-in drivers in the linux kernel".</p>
<p>But substantially changing the disk layout can get soon complicated.<br />
To do that you would have to adapt the disklayout.conf file to the
right<br />
values that match the changed disk(s) on the replacement hardware<br />
or during "rear recover" you could adapt the diskrestore.sh script,<br />
see in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc</a><br />
in the section "Restore to different hardware" the parts<br />
"The Ad-Hoc Way" versus "Planning In Advance".<br />
The screenshots therein are a bit outdated (the current user dialogs
look different)<br />
but the general information is still right.</p>
<p>When you have the replacement hardware already availabe so that<br />
you can play around with it and do trial and error attempts<br />
using RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL (see its description in default. conf)<br />
can help here (but the actual changes need to be done manually),<br />
for an example see in particular<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-236547810">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-236547810</a><br />
and for a possible pitfall in a special case see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-237544630">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-237544630</a></p>
<p>When you do not have the replacement hardware already available<br />
(e.g. because your laptop has fallen down the stairs and broken into
pieces<br />
so you had to buy a new one that is available right now in the next
shop)<br />
and you intend to do a substantial change of the disk layout at the same
time,<br />
then you likely run into too many various kind of issues at the same
time.</p>
<p>But usually laptops have only one single disk and usually a SSD should<br />
behave same as a traditional spinning harddisk (except special kind<br />
of NVME-like "disks") so the only usual change should be that the new
disk<br />
is much bigger than the old one was.</p>
<p>Normally it should work straightforward to migrate a single disk onto<br />
a new bigger single disk, cf. AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS<br />
and its related config variables in default.conf<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L372">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L372</a></p>
<p>A precondition to make migrating onto a bigger disk "just work" is
that<br />
the last partition on the disk is the one and only one that should be
enlarged.<br />
E.g. it would be bad to have the swap partition as the last one on the
disk<br />
(in such cases one must do the migration adaptions manually).</p>

<p>I'm really glad about MODULES=( 'all_modules' ). Thanks for adding
this. I think it's great for increasing versatility with little to no
cost.</p>
<p>For disk replacement or addition, yes, I think I will have to become
well-acquainted with disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh and manually
edit. In the future I plan to add an NVME SSD to my desktop, and I try
to think ahead to make migration easier. I'm not sure if ReaR is the
right tool for that. Given the rarity and uniqueness of such events,
it's fine if it requires manual intervention. In any case, that's not
urgent now.</p>
<p>About the nano glitch, this bug report is the closest description I've
found:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1412575">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1412575</a>
The video attachment demonstrates the problem well. It's not clear what
the issue was, with the suggestion that it may have to do with the
terminal.</p>
<p>As for the root login on the recovery system, of course it makes sense.
It's just confusing to be asked to log in, though, since there is no
anticipation of user accounts and since anything typed as the username
gets accepted and logs in as root. Maybe in the future the login prompt
can be omitted?</p>
