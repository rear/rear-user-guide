<p>Description of the issue:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After re-creating the RAID 5 array (6 x 2TB WD Green HDD's),<br />
same settings as used for the previous 12 months<br />
(including the generation of the three ReaR backup copies),<br />
the server fails to boot using either the backup or backup with
Autorecover,<br />
with Kernel 6.3.0.0.rc5 or 6.4.0-0.rc2.<br />
In all cases I cannot get it to progress past <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#103;&#101;&#116;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;">&#103;&#101;&#116;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;</a>,<br />
with it failing with the following message:</p>
<pre><code>[$TIME] systemd [1]: /usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service:44: Failed to resolve instance name in DefaultInstance="%I": Invalid slot
</code></pre>
<p>I am not clear where the problem is coming from,<br />
or where the DefaultInstance %I is referring to,<br />
so I am seeking the assistance of some more knowledgable folks here<br />
to try and find out the next steps in solving this.</p>
<p>It is clear that it is referring to line 44 of the file that is found
at<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty%40.service">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty%40.service</a></p>
<p>however I am not clear on where or what it is looking at for the
"DefaultInstance" - the "Invalid slot" appears to indicate it is looking
at some hardware-related location in the server, however I am not sure
why that may have changed, as there has been no hardware changes for the
past 12 months</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Workaround, if any:<br />
    None - I have not found a way to get the server to start. It is not
    able to start even with Recovery.Target or Emergency.Target added
    into the GRUB config line via the ReaR terminal acreen (TAB at the
    selection)</p>

<p>Does the problem appear when booting the ReaR rescue system, or after a

<p>I suppose that "the server fails to boot using either the backup or
backup with Autorecover" means booting the rescue image, but this is not
entirely clear. In this case, you should not add emergency.target nor
rescue.target to the kernel command line, because the rescue image does
not support those targets AFAIK. I suspect that the getty messages are
related to a terminal that can not be found, but getty.service is
referred to only as
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty%40tty0.service">getty@tty0.service</a>,
and tty0 should exist always ...</p>

<p>Correct - it is whilst trying to recover the server due to a "collection
of things going wrong", with DNF5 upgrade, php8.2, etc - so my decision
was "well, I have got three back-ups, so wipe the disk array and
re-load", but lo and behold, not are working......</p>
<p>I have just tried all the saved images on another machine that has a
functional load of Fedora 37 Server, and the same errors occur on that
machine.</p>
<p>So given that the backups also fail on a second machine, in the same
way, it does not appear to be a hardware or Array configuration issue on
my main machine.</p>

<pre><code>Have you ever booted the rescue image successfully on that server in the past?
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, I have restored from a ReaR backup multiple occasions on the same
hardware, including after re-building the disk array, when additional
disks were added in.</p>
<pre><code>And what happens when you don't add the emergency.target part to the command line?
</code></pre>
<p>The last logs I can see are that sysinit.service fails, and it appears
to be related to the fact the <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#71;&#101;&#116;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;">&#71;&#101;&#116;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;</a> is failing, the machine
locks up and will not respond to any keyboard commands (as expected, for
a Getty problem)</p>

<p>That is a good question - I will need to explore that. I an no guru on
SSH and such, if you have any guidance on how that could be done. The
machine has no OS, or configuration on it, so how could I get the rescue
image to the dead machine?</p>

<p>The rescue image is the thing that you are booting, so I see you have
been able to get that to the machine. After you boot, try ssh to the
machine, it could respond even if the console is locked up (assuming
that you have network configured of course).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>do you have the error messages from sysinit.service? It should run even
before getty is started.</p>

<p>I would try to pass some systemd debug options on the kernel command
line to find out what's wrong. E.g.
<code>systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=console</code>. I have never used
this though - I have never seen before a case where ReaRs
sysinit.service fails and even getty.service does not work.<br />
Note that
<code>Failed to resolve instance name in DefaultInstance="%I": Invalid slot</code>
does not appear anymore - I suspect it was related to your attempt with
emergency.target.<br />
By the way, do you have a way to attach a serial console to the system?</p>

<p>Ah, the screen pictures are from the serial console? I thought that it
is was PC console (monitor on VGA + keyboard). And what is the serial
console device, is it ttyS0? In that case edit the kernel command line
to remove console=tty0 (because tty0 is the PC console, not the serial
console).</p>

<p>Yes - sorry, my bad for not being clear...... I checked another Fedora
server that is all at default, the serial terminal is tty1, so I am
assuming that it should be the same as the one I am trying to ressurect,
as I had not changed it from the default</p>

<p>I have managed to get my terminal to scroll back through the logs.....
finally.</p>
<p>Below it can be seen that the problem with DefaultInstance="%I" is still
present when the target is not set to emergency.target or
recovery.target.</p>
<p>This appears to be the problem, as it is causing /etc to not be
populated, and it fails to start.</p>

<p>I checked notes from my experiments with the ReaR rescue image bootup...
there were messages</p>
<pre><code>systemd[1]: /usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service:46: Failed to resolve instance name in DefaultInstance="%I": Invalid slot 
systemd[1]: /usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service:46: Failed to resolve instance name in DefaultInstance="%I": Invalid slot 
systemd[1]: Failed to populate /etc with preset unit settings, ignoring: Invalid slot

<p>and the rescue system was working properly nevertheless. From this I
conclude that the messages are harmless and not the source of your
problem.</p>

<p>My apologies - I am not a Sys Admin, so maybe I am using the wrong
terminology.</p>
<p>I know that I have a plugged into the multi-pin D socket for a VGA
terminal on the server box - it has always worked, and when I run the
command "tty" on a different server, running Fedora 37, it replies
"/dev/tty1". I assume that the system with the problems that I am
experiencing is likewise, as it was set up and configured in the same
manner.</p>
<p>Thanks for all of your input, and your notes/experiments, so I will
consider that to not be the source of my problems.</p>
<p>I have tried to load the backup (all three from different dates) onto
the secondary server, I get the same result, so I conclude it is not
something related to hardware.</p>
<p>I will need to keep digging.</p>

<p>Maybe only <code>systemd.log_level=debug</code> then? Also, try deleting all the

<p>Small steps forward.....</p>
<p>On another HP server, I ran ReaR, got quite a few errors about various
files not found, etc, however that gave me another ReaR backup file that
I could try on my main machine, and YES, it booted up :-)</p>
<p>Also I found the backup logs from the three backups that fail, so now I
have a "recipe" for a backup that has worked, I will have to go through
line-by-line to see where things are going wrong.</p>
<p>One thing of note was that in the backup that worked, there was no
"CONSOLE=" entries in the bootloader execute line - I am baffled as to
where they came from or why they appear in the other three backups.</p>
<p>I also manually set the VGA Mode setting "VGA=" to 795, that gave a much
more readable set of text for the logs,</p>
<p><img alt="No_CONSOLE_VGA795" src="https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/13631259/eb35d33a-36fb-428e-8439-cf95c8006fd9" /></p>
<p>From here it looks like the first thing that fails is
systemd-udevd.service.</p>
<p>Thanks you very much pcahyna, for nudging me along the path to a point
where I am starting to see the "forest instead of trees" and with the
working and non-working logs, hopefully I can make progress toward
resolving this issue.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I found this Red Hat issue</p>
<p><a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6317011">https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6317011</a></p>
<p>which looks remarkably similar, however I do not know how I might be
able to edit the .conf file that is refered to when it is within a
backup - any suggestions on how this may be done would be greatly
appreciated.</p>
<p>I will leave this open at present, so I can post updates or ask further
questions on this specific topic.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>@jsmeix - Seeking your support for this problem.</p>
<p>I have three ReaR back-ups, which appear to have all been successful,
however after a complete hard-disk array re-creation (due to later
problems with DNF and PHP, not related to this issue), none of the
backups will restore to the same disk arrangement from which the
back-ups were taken.</p>
<p>I have had no issue at all with restoring backups in the same manner
over many years with ReaR, on the same machine, as well as previous
servers, so it is confusing to me why it will now not restore.</p>
<p>I am not able to get any debug logs, however I do have the complete logs
that were saved on the USB drive with the created backup
(rear-servnet.log), the latest instance is attached for your reference.</p>

<p>Hi @GreasyMonkee sorry for the late reply. If you have an image that
boots on your server, you could restore your server by using
/var/lib/rear/layout and the backup (backup.tar.gz if you are using
NETFS) from your non-working image inside your working image.
(/var/lib/rear/layout encodes the storage layout of the system that you
need to recreate and backup.tar.gz contains the backup of the files.)</p>

<p>I am not a Red Hat or Fedora user so I cannot actually help<br />
when issues are specific for Red Hat or Fedora.</p>
<p>This issue is not really clear to me<br />
but as far as I see it seems it is about<br />
that the ReaR recovery system fails to start up<br />
on replacement hardware that is somewhat different<br />
(in particular with a re-created RAID array)<br />
compared to the original system where "rear mkbackup" was run.</p>
<p>What happens is that on the replacement hardware<br />
the ReaR recovery system boot menu is shown and<br />
GRUB loads the ReaR recovery system kernel and initrd<br />
and the ReaR recovery system kernel starts but then<br />
during systemd startup phase various things go wrong<br />
with various inexplicable systemd error messages.</p>
<p>A very generic thing that I am wondering about is<br />
whether or not that replacement hardware can<br />
successfully start up any other installation system?</p>
<p>For example an original Fedora installation image<br />
or an installation image of another Linux distribution?</p>
<p>@GreasyMonkee<br />
does it work - only as a test - to install Fedora<br />
from scratch with an original Fedora installation image<br />
on that replacement hardware?</p>
<p>If this works, you may (as some kind of "last resort")<br />
install the exact right Fedora version that matches exactly<br />
the one on your original system where "rear mkbackup" was run<br />
from scratch with an original Fedora installation image<br />
on that replacement hardware and afterwards "overwrite" that<br />
by restoring the backup of the files that you made with ReaR.<br />
Probably this may not result a perfectly clean system<br />
but perhaps (or hopefully) it may result a usable system.</p>
<p>By the way:<br />
In your<br />

it seems you run "rear mkbackup"<br />
but no "backup" stage is run because:</p>

<p>This issue is not really clear to me<br />
but as far as I see it seems it is about<br />
that the ReaR recovery system fails to start up<br />
on replacement hardware that is somewhat different<br />
(in particular with a re-created RAID array)<br />
compared to the original system where "rear mkbackup" was run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I may not have been clear in my writing - the hardware layout is
identical, nothing was changed - it was that the array was cleared and
re-created to remove the image which was damaged (due to PHP upgrade and
the new DNF_5 - which has no roll-back for history in the initial
release......)</p>
<p>I have installed a clean Fedora 37 version which is working as a test. I
had tried to install a Fedora Rawhide (Fedora 39) image, but there are
some apparently known issues with GRUB boot-loader (tried different
versions of RUFUS.exe to create the bootable image, all result in "452 -
out of range" error).</p>
<p>As suggested, as a last resort I am moving everything over from the
de-compressed "backup.tar.gz" from the latest backup, t o this work able
version so that I can hopefully recover most of the functions.</p>
<p>I will also try pcahyna's suggestions as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to you both for your time, shall update if I find anything</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
thank you so much for the explanation<br />
why that log file looks bad but is OK!</p>
<p>I will fix that piece of code (I know it but I had no idea<br />
that this piece of code has such bad effects when one does<br />
not have it in mind when looking at a log file from a user)<br />

<p>... which would not help much, because, IIUC, the "rescue" stage
unmounts it and "backup" mounts it again. Sigh.</p>

I fixed things for now with a minimal code change in<br />
output/USB/Linux-i386/830_copy_kernel_initrd.sh<br />
i.e. simply have the</p>
<pre><code>LogPrint "Saving current (unfinished) $RUNTIME_LOGFILE as $USB_PREFIX/$logfile_basename"
</code></pre>
<p>before the current (unfinished) RUNTIME_LOGFILE gets copied<br />
so the last message in the copied log file should<br />
hopefully sufficiently indicate that it is<br />
an unfinished copy of RUNTIME_LOGFILE.</p>

<p>From the other thread I referenced from Pete Batard, there are some
serious issues with Fedora (and Ubuntu) together with GRUB, so that may
well be precipitating the issue.</p>
<p>If it is indeed an issue with GRUB, is there a way that the modified
GRUB files can be "inserted" or such for an existing ReaR backup?</p>
<p>I know it is a long-shot, but I am prepared to give anything a
try.......</p>

<p>UPDATE 08-07-2023.</p>
<p>I created a completely new installation of Fedora Rawhide (FC39), and
added a couple of applications, plus required ones for running ReaR.</p>
<p>I then created a ReaR backup using a new USB drive, formatted using
"rear format". When I attempted to boot from the created backup, the
exact same behaviour as documented above has occurred.</p>
<p>Fedora Rawhide is still using Relax and Recover version 2.6, not sure if
there is an issue from the use of this slightly older release (latest is
2.7 from the ReaR documentation I have found)</p>
<p>The config file used was site.conf, with the following options set:</p>
<p>OUTPUT=USB<br />
BACKUP=NETFS<br />
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000</p>
<p>Attached below is the debug log (using -D to capture all the messages).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11994807/20230708-1723_servnet_rear_debug.log">20230708-1723_servnet_rear_debug.log</a></p>
<p>I can provide the complete backup file, if required for de-bugging
purposes.</p>
<p>I am submitting this is the hope that whatever is the issue may be
identified and corrected - I no longer am hopeful of recovering the data
from the original backups where the problem first occurred, but to save
others the same pain of rebuilding a system from "scratch" when the
backups do not work.</p>

<p>To clarify, did you do the change on a functional system, make a new

<p>I made a completely new backup. To use your existing backup, you should
not modify the content of backup.tar.gz, but of initrd. Let me find out
how to do this</p>
<h4 id="pcahyna_commented_at_2023-07-21_1016"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26300485?u=9105d243bc9f7ade463a3e52e8dd13fa67837158&v=4" width="50"><a href="https://github.com/pcahyna">pcahyna</a> commented at <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017#issuecomment-1645348480">2023-07-21 10:16</a>:<a class="headerlink" href="#pcahyna_commented_at_2023-07-21_1016" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So the recipe is: find initrd.cgz from your bootable medium and unpack
it somewhere:</p>
<pre><code>cd /var/tmp
mkdir rear-root
cd rear-root
zcat ~/initrd.cgz | cpio -i
</code></pre>
<p>change the file</p>
<pre><code>vi etc/scripts/boot
</code></pre>
<p>and repack the initrd</p>
<pre><code>find . ! -name "*~" | cpio -H newc --create --quiet | gzip &gt; ~/initrd-new.cgz
</code></pre>
<p>replace <code>initrd.cgz</code> on your bootable medium by <code>initrd-new.cgz</code> and
boot (keep a backup copy of the original bootable medium of course).</p>

<p>Yes, with some twists and turns......</p>
<p>By changing the initrd contents, the checksum fails.</p>
<p>for some reason I could not nail down, I was getting a situation where
there was no bootloader being created on the recovered system.</p>
<p>To get around that issue, I then loaded another one of the three backups
on the menu selection from ReaR following the intial boot.</p>
<p>I have confirmed that the modification of "commenting out" the line in
the skeleton file, and generating a new backup, that restores correctly
without any modification of the saved initrd file.</p>

<p>Oops, I have not thought of that. Otherwise, are you satisfied with the
outcome now?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your assistance, with your help I have managed
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recover files and databases that were critical</li>
<li>found a resolution to address the issue which caused the problem</li>
</ul>
<p>If I understood correctly, there has been a change in the Fedora rawhide
package, to ReaR 2.6-11.fc39 ?</p>
<p>I am OK for this topic to be closed.</p>

<p>There has been no meaningful change, what you are seeing is just a dummy
Release number bump. The Fedora maintainer is unresponsive.</p>
<p>I will reopen the issue, just not as a support question, because it is
still a bug.</p>

<p>@pcahyna could you finally understand why mounting <code>/sys</code> causes a
problem? Can we just disable mounting it or does it get auto-mounted
somewhere else?</p>

<p>@schlomo I don't know unfortunately, I haven't investigated this. Since
it is affecting more and more users (probably it is a feature of some
recent systemd version that is getting into distros), I think I will
just change the code to something like <code>mountpoint /sys || mount /sys</code>.</p>

anything AFAIK.</p>
