<p>@pcahyna raised the question why I like to merge / rebase master into a
PR branch before merging that branch into master.</p>
<p>Here is my reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>GH let's us merge a branch if there are not git merge conflicts, but
    that doesn't tell us if the code will continue to work with current
    master</li>
<li>Merging / rebasing onto master <strong>before</strong> merging the PR branch
    allows GH to run all the checks and actions on the codebase that
    would be the result of merging the PR into master. That means that
    we get a higher confidence that ReaR will continue to work after
    merging the PR.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003</a>
is a nice example for this, the change in the <code>Makefile</code> has an impact
on
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/62b9afac5c2aba542075c3692cf93a0fe280c8a2/.github/workflows/build-packages.yml#L26-L30">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/62b9afac5c2aba542075c3692cf93a0fe280c8a2/.github/workflows/build-packages.yml#L26-L30</a>
which can be observed only after I merged current master because at the
same time I fixed a but in this workflow that prevented it from working.</p>
<p>Therefore I'd like to propose to <em>always</em> merge/rebase master before
merging a PR branch.</p>
<p>Let's talk about this here, what would be reasons against doing this?</p>
<h4 id="pcahyna_commented_at_2023-06-06_1514"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26300485?u=9105d243bc9f7ade463a3e52e8dd13fa67837158&v=4" width="50"><a href="https://github.com/pcahyna">pcahyna</a> commented at <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3004#issuecomment-1578957847">2023-06-06 15:14</a>:<a class="headerlink" href="#pcahyna_commented_at_2023-06-06_1514" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I am not too concerned by this problem, in my experience it does not
happen often in practice.</p>
<p>If you want to be on the safe side, I prefer to rebase the PR branch on
top of the current master rather than merging master to the PR branch.
The additional merge clutters the history a bit.<br />
Rebasing the PR branch before merging is often advisable anyway, because
one may need to improve commit messages and/or squash commits that
correct mistakes in previous changes into the commits that they fix (to
avoid cluttering the final history with commits like "do A" and then
"correct the mistakes made while doing A").</p>

<p>I wonder if it could be rather confusing when<br />
(at a possibly longer time after a PR was merged)<br />
others who like to understand what a PR was about<br />
(e.g. to analyze if a PR is the reason for a regression)<br />

<p>When I look at the merge commit<br />

it only shows the actually intended code changes of<br />

i.e.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd">https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd</a><br />
shows the same as<br />

<p>In particular the additional changes in the PR<br />

<p>Well, maybe it is not confusing when thinking about what the PR was
about, but it still needs additional brain power if you need to decipher
the history in detail because of more parallel lines in your "git log
--graph" output that one will need to keep track of when reading it. It
becomes much more difficult to determine which line of development (with
all its commits) belonged to the PR and which belonged to the master
branch or another branches. I.e. I now have to think whether the commit
<code>jsmeix@suse.com 62b9afac5c2aba542075c3692cf93a0fe280c8a2 Mon Jun 5 13:44:07 2023 +0200</code>
belongs to the PR or not. In this case, it is fairly easy, because there
are not many commits and I recognize my own name in the PR branch. But
think about the possibility where there are long-running branches with
many other commits happening in the meantime, and you don't recognize
the names of their authors.</p>

<p>100% agree that rebasing is much better than merging, need to see if the
"Update" button on GitHub can be configured to rebase instead of merge.</p>

<p>Now I am wondering if it could be rather confusing while a PR is "work
in progress" (i.e. before it is merged) for the one who is currently
working on "his" PR and also for others who like to understand what
the PR is about (e.g. to review the code changes in a PR) when
additional commits appear in a PR that do not belong to the actually
intended code changes of the PR?</p>
<p>@pcahyna your <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003#issuecomment-1576685594">#3003
(comment)</a>
looks as if you got confused while you were working on your #3003 by
the unexpected additional changes in your PR because of a "Merge
branch 'master' ..." commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was not really "confused", but having an unrelated (merge) commit
appearing in my branch is certainly a bit of complication.</p>

<p>For me asking the PR author to rebase would be the best option. Doing it
for them (using WebUI or otherwise) would be confusing for the PR author
who might be working on the branch in the meantime and now is forced to
update and rebase their unpushed changes etc.</p>
