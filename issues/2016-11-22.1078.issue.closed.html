<p>It would be very useful if rear supported the backup and recovery of
ntfs / Windows OS partitions for people who multiboot Linux with
Windows, like I do in work.</p>
<p>I'm only expecting rear backup and recovery to work from under Linux and
I'd be happy enough if that's the only way it ever worked but now that
Ubuntu officially runs under Windows (10) there is maybe scope in the
future for having rear work under the Windows 10 bash shell? I'm not
really bothered if that is not possible but I do feel the ability to
backup and restore NTFS is a bit of a must. Windows support has been the
first question I have been asked with 2 of the first 3 people I have
told about rear.</p>
<p>I can't remember the details now but I know that if you install Windows
and leave it to its own devices it creates at least one boot / recovery
partition as well as the OS partition but if you manually install it it
can live happily in one NTFS partition, or at least that was the case
with Windows 7. I mention this as it could be we can only get this
working if the user has a simple config like that ie no fancy Windows
boot partitions etc.</p>
<p>I don't know what rear does when it backs up a multiboot Linux system
(ie dual booting Debian and OpenSUSE for example) yet but if I was
backing up a Linux/Windows dual-boot machine I'd be expecting two
separate archives to be produced.</p>

<p>Functionality you are describing here, could be done by simple mount of
NTFS volume + backup its content (e.g. using tar). I'm not sure if ReaR
is needed for such operation.</p>

<p>The same could be said for Linux. I know how to manually back up and
restore Linux and Windows but rear is supposed to make the process
easier and that's why I'm interested. More people will be interested in
rear if it handles more use cases, the major missing one being Windows.</p>

<p>So what you are proposing is "just" a NTFS support in ReaR?</p>

<p>Yes, or I'd like to know why it has been decided not to support NTFS /
Windows?</p>
<p>As it stands, I can only recommend rear to people who only use Linux but
I'd like to be able to recommend it to people who multiboot with Windows
too. As it stands I'd have to tell them they have to stick with
Clonezilla unless they want to backup Windows separately and at that
point you may as well do both with Clonezilla or fsarchiver or whatever.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to use as a pre-configured rear setup but at least
Clonezilla handles Windows as well as Linux.</p>

<p>Let's keep<br />
"having rear work under the Windows 10 bash shell"<br />
out of this issue and focus on<br />
"backup and restore NTFS".</p>
<p>In general regarding backup and restore see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769</a><br />
and therein see in particular the initial description<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769#issue-133203316">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769#issue-133203316</a><br />
that reads (excerpt):</p>
<pre>
By design ReaR operates on the filesystem level.
That means that anything not mounted
is out of scope for ReaR.

The design goal of ReaR was to take a
backup / layout snapshot of a running system
</pre>

<p>Regarding backup of files on a NTFS filesystem:</p>
<p>It should "just work" to mount the NTFS filesystem<br />
somewhere and mention that "somewhere" in<br />
the BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE array.</p>
<p>I think the current missing part is the restore of<br />
files on a NTFS filesystem during "rear recover".</p>
<p>To do that one needs to:</p>
<pre>
"Simply" create a NTFS filesystem under Linux and
mount it so that one can "just" write (i.e. restore) files there.
</pre>

<p>Isn't this a showstopper for NTFS?</p>

<p>I unfortunately don't know exact reasons behind not including NTFS, but
I'm personally not brave enough to read NTFS partitions directly from
Linux (mainly because I don't like messing up with anything related to
Windows ;-) ).<br />
I can however take this challenge and try to recover WIndows with ReaR ,
after all it might be fun ...</p>

<p>I think the code in<br />
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh<br />
is an intentional showstopper for NTFS filesystem recreation<br />
because currently there is no such thing in ReaR.</p>
<p>But I guess what goes into the backup should be<br />
independent of filesystem layout recreation code.</p>
<p>I.e. I think one can get any mounted (i.e. accessible) files<br />
into the backup regardless whether or not ReaR could<br />
recreate the matching filesystems.</p>
<p>But I never ever tested anything with NTFS<br />
because I do not at all use that filesystem<br />
(in particular I do not use Windows).</p>

<p>Good to hear you guys aren't opposed to NTFS support although its
clearly not something you have much personal interest in, not being
Windows users.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to hear how you get on gozora. As I said, I think
you'll find it much easier to backup and restore Windows if you manually
create an NTFS partition first and then install Windows into it as this
circumvents the Windows boot partition. Ideally though ReaR would be
able to handle backing up and restoring stock Windows (7/8/10) installs
which involve more than one partition.</p>

<p>Thanks Vlad! Sorry to have to inflict a lesser OS on you! :)</p>
<p>So what does rear do when you are backing up a multiboot machine? Does
it pack every distro/OS into one tarball or does each OS get archived
separately? I ask because in a multiboot config I would like to have the
option to only restore specific OSs/partitions instead of all or
nothing. I'd expect auto recover to restore them all but hopefully
manual recovery would let you choose.</p>

Anyhow, I was able to recover my MSDN account so I can run tests with

<p>@danboid and to answer your question. I'd guess that all OSes will be
packed to single archive.<br />
Assuming that I'll be able to recover Windows with ReaR during my tests,
and we have at least small chance that something like this is possible,
we can start discussion what would be the best way to implement it.
Until than it is just wase of time ;-)</p>

<p>Thanks for highlighting all the obstacles between the current state of
rear and what would be required to get individual OSs recovered jsmeix -
seems there is quite a lot to do to get to that stage.</p>
<p>In the past I've successfully used Clonezilla, ntfsclone and fsarchiver
to backup and restore NTFS partitions (mainly Windows 7 and XP) under
Linux but I understand the need to reduce deps and I've not tried
cloning Windows 10 yet.</p>

<p>In the past (during my mkCDrec times) I first zero-ed the unused space
in NTFS volumes and just used <code>dd</code> + <code>compress</code> to dump the NTFS
volumes. That worked quite well, but I must admit I still believe

<p>I have a private secret ultimate plan<br />
( who will attend FOSDEM 2017? ;-)<br />
why I probably would like to implement support for<br />
"Multiple Backup Methods" at some time in the future.</p>
<p>For a possible use-case for "Multiple Backup Methods" see<br />

may show another possible use-case for "Multiple Backup Methods":</p>
<p>Use a generic backup method (e.g. 'tar') to backup and restore<br />
files on usual Linux filesystems and use another specific backup<br />
method to backup and restore a Windows NTFS filesystem.</p>

<p>gozora:</p>
<p>I forgot to mention partclone.ntfs. I think thats got more features than
ntfsclone. IIRC partclone is what clonezilla uses. The advantage
fsarchiver has over these is that it can restore images onto smaller
target partitions than they were cloned from, provided there is enough
space for the files.</p>

<p>One cannot have all:<br />
Unusual filesystems plus all features of usual filesystems.</p>
<p>In general using 'dd' for disk partitions:<br />
This could be a nice generic way how ReaR could<br />
backup and restore any "foreign" filesystems<br />
(even filesystems that cannot be mounted under Linux).</p>
<p>Of course on a multi-boot system "rear recover" can probably<br />
not recover "foreign" bootloaders (except all systems are booted<br />
by a Linux bootloader that is supported by ReaR - i.e. Grub).<br />
But at least after "rear recover" the user would have all his files
back.<br />
Hopefully he can boot his "foreign" systems manually via<br />
appropriate "foreign" external boot media.</p>

<p>Sorry for being OT but I've been wondering about two things related to
rear I hope one of you will kindly answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can I use the same USB drive, once it has been formatted and used as
    a rear recovery drive for one host, to recover multiple different
    host or is it one recovery drive per host?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I lose / accidentally format or whatever my recovery stick whilst
    I still have the backup on a network share but I don't have a
    working machine just like the one I'm attempting to recover
    currently running to do a <code>rear mkrescue</code>, is there a way to create
    a working recovery USB drive or ISO that would be capable of
    restoring such a rear backup using any old Linux box?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm asking these question here because I seem to be having trouble
subscribing to your mailing list you don't seem to have an IRC channel.</p>

<p>I asked colleagues about their experience with<br />
ntfsprogs (e.g. mkfs.ntfs) in particular<br />
if it actually works reliably in practice.</p>
<p>I got only very little response.<br />
I assume only a few use NTFS filesystems.</p>
<p>So far what I got as replies:</p>
<pre>
It works fine for me, and has done so for some time.

The only caveat I have for ntfs-3g is that it's
handling of 'unclean' NTFS partitions is
very conservative, probably with good
reason.

It will not allow RW mounting of an unclean
ntfs filesystem, which means you might
need to use a Windows machine to run
a filesystem check before you can use
it fully again with ntfs-3g.

So I wouldn't use ntfs as a filesystem
of choice, but it no longer gets in my way
when I need to use it.
</pre>

<p>plus a subsequent reply in particular regarding<br />
handling of 'unclean' NTFS partitions:</p>
<pre>
This causes small problem with dualboot
machine from Win8+.
Default powerof  for this systems
are Hybrid Sleep and NTFS partitions
are everytime flagged as unclean + some
data can be wrongly journaled. 
So this feature needs to be disabled on
dualboot systems with shared NTFS partition.
</pre>

<p>The unclean mounting through having hybrid sleep / Fast Startup enabled
also applies to Windows 10 as well as W8. Fast Startup is enabled by
default but its easy to disable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Control Panel in the small icons view and click on Power
    Options.</li>
<li>Click on Choose what the power buttons do.</li>
<li>Click on Change settings that are currently unavailable.</li>
<li>Uncheck Turn on fast startup (recommended).</li>
</ol>

<p>Just a short ping that I'm still alive and working hard on this topic.
Unfortunately I don't have so much spare time as I would like and things
are progressing quite slow as Windows is not so happy with
(unintentional) damages I'm causing. I never thought how fragile it is
when handled from inside Linux.<br />
I was however able to use <em>ntfsclone</em> to make <strong>working</strong> copy of my
Windows 10.<br />

<p>@gozora<br />
only an untested idea regarding experiments with NTFS:<br />
Perhaps for the very first experiments with NTFS<br />
you can leave out Windows and use it only on Linux,<br />
i.e. create a NTFS with mkfs.ntfs, mount it, put some<br />
files therein, and enhance ReaR to work with that<br />
(first all only on Linux). When this works, one can<br />
try out how far it also works with a NTFS filesystem<br />
that was created and is used by Windows.</p>

<p>@jsmeix Yep, that is stage 3 of my tests (stage 1 install windows :-)
and stage 2 restore it without ReaR intervention just to get some first
slaps from this technology).<br />
First problem I need to solve is that ntfs does not identify as <em>NTFS</em>
but as <em>fuseblk</em> (which I guess covers all possible fuse file systems)</p>

<p>@jsmeix my thoughts are the usual: Pull requests are welcome as long as
they don't break ReaR for non-NTFS users. Changing the ReaR architecture
to accommodate the new features will require a lost of discussions. The
goal of ReaR is to be the best DR solution for Linux users, whatever
their use case might be.</p>
<p>That aside, I would strongly recommend to integrate another backup tool
like clonezilla into ReaR and to have that tool take care of all the
non-Linux stuff. AFAIK that already even handles partition resizing and
other useful things that you probably don't want to invent again.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update Vlad - its good to hear you have cloned W10 OK
with ntfsclone. That's a solid start but I'd like to remind you all that
I would be hoping for the ability to restore partitions onto smaller
ones that have enough space to hold the files which, last I checked, is
a feature that fsarchiver allows that the other tools do not. IIRC
fsarchiver is written by the same guy who wrote partclone, which is what
CZ uses hence this is a limitation of CZ I'd like to not inherit.</p>
<p>If ntfsclone can do this now then great!</p>

<p>In general "don't break ReaR" is mandatory, cf.<br />
"Maintain backward compatibility" in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style">https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style</a></p>
<p>Regarding<br />
"I would strongly recommend to integrate another backup tool<br />
like clonezilla into ReaR and to have that tool take care<br />

<p>I do very much appreciate this!</p>
<p>When ReaR should also support non-Linux stuff<br />
via other backup tools, it means support for<br />
"Multiple Backup Methods" is a precondition<br />
so that users can use one backup tool for their<br />
Linux stuff (e.g. 'tar') and additionally another<br />
backup tool (e.g. Clonezilla or even dumb 'dd')<br />
for their non-Linux stuff.</p>
<p>For my "private secret ultimate plan" I also need<br />
support for "Multiple Backup Methods" so that<br />
users can use one kind of "backup" tool like 'zypper'<br />
to get RPM package installed and additionally another<br />
backup tool like 'tar' to get afterwards config files<br />
and/or whatever data files installed so that the<br />
final result is a ready-to-use system.</p>
<p>Therefore I will try to implement support for<br />
"Multiple Backup Methods" in ReaR.<br />
But currently I have no good idea how I could cleanly<br />
implement that without changing too much in ReaR.</p>

<p>We may not forget <strong>ReaR</strong> is used by thousands of users in Linux
production environments, which do not care about Windows (as these run
on separate servers or VMs). Therefore, I strongly would avoid
backup/restore of NTFS file systems as we cannot guarantee the data
integrity at all (it would only be a best effort).<br />
Believe me - I've seen it before with mkCDrec - and I would like to
avoid that history repeats ifself.</p>

<p>I fully agree that we must first and foremost care<br />
about current ReaR users and their use cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand NTFS support might be also<br />
of interest for business production environments<br />
in particular for company laptops and workstations<br />
with Linux/Windows dual-boot installations?<br />
But I have zero personal experience with such use-cases.</p>

<p>Hello guys,<br />
I don't think that anybody here really wishes to break current ReaR
code!<br />
I however think that @jsmeix have a good idea with support of multiple
backup methods. If this is done carefully, it would be good start for
implementation of alien file systems like NTFS (or anything else Linux
can handle). Of course it can go either way, but I guess it is worth to
try it.So if you need some help on this topic, count me in!</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,<br />
I basically know what I've needed to know about restoring WIndows (NTFS)
under Linux.<br />
Currently it looks like (at least from my point of view) that we can't
put something like this into ReaR without lots of changes which could
potentially affect lots of users which are running highly production
Linux environments (as mentioned by @gdha in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-262924422">comment</a>
with which I fully agree btw.).</p>
<p>"Multiple Backup Methods" mentioned by @jsmeix could be a way how NTFS
could find its place in ReaR. As mentioned earlier, it can be a dead
end, but it is worth a try.</p>

<p>@schlomo I just had a quick look on clonezilla (I never used i before),
and at first glace it looks like it can't make backups of running
system. You need to boot clonezilla live medium in order to make magic
happen.<br />
So inmplementing clonezilla into ReaR would basically mean "just"
putting all the clonezilla binaries into ReaR rescue/recover medium.
Which can be easily done by user with help of arrays <em>REQUIRED_PROGS</em>
or <em>PROGS</em>.</p>

<p>@gozora you precisely describe the situation with regard to ReaR and
non-Linux stuff. Obviously the non-Linux stuff is not active while Linux
runs. So using tools from clonezilla should work perfectly well.</p>
<p>You are right that clonezilla does not take backups of running systems
which is exactly why ReaR (and previously mkCDrec) was invented. ReaR
takes care of the running Linux and out-tasks everything else to
clonezilla or another tool.</p>
<p>@gdha you are right with your experience. I would hope that ReaR's
modular design is sufficiently robust to give existing users stable use
while still allowing new use cases to be added.</p>

<p>Hello @danboid<br />
"easy-ish way" is very relative. We need to look here for a compromise
(which is at least for me quite a challenge) between not breaking
current ReaR mission and implementing something new. Once I have idea
how to do this, coding would be piece of cake.<br />
I'm not abandoning your idea and still continue working on it, because
as I stated couple of times, it is worth trying.</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,</p>
<p>I've tested fsarchiver as you suggested, but somehow I don't have a good
feeling about making backups of NTFS on filesystem level. The thing is
that I was able to restore my Windows 10 with fsarchiver, I've however
stumbled across hundreds of messages like follows during backup:</p>
<pre><code>[errno=31, Too many links]: oper_save.c#349,createar_item_winattr():winattr:lgetxattr(/Windows/WinSxS/x86_microsoft-windows-i..mentation-migration_31bf3856ad364e35_11.0.10240.16384_none_facb7050c43c1570/WininetPlugin.dll,system.ntfs_dos_name): returned negative attribute size
</code></pre>
<p>According to my quick research, this problem have something to do with
hardlinks and old DOS names. The reason why you didn't had trouble so
far was that you've backed up Win7.<br />
I've found following
<a href="https://tuxera.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=30738">thread</a> describing
all this in more depth.<br />
A quote from mentioned discussion:</p>
<pre><code>WinXP did not use hard links, so there should be no problem. 
Win7 has begun to use hard links gradually, 
and Win8 uses a lot of hard links.
</code></pre>
<p>and another even more relevant</p>
<pre><code>DOS names are an obsolescent feature, 
only useful for running very old applications,
but the major issue is that fsarchiver does not 
restore files which have dos name errors.
</code></pre>
<p>So as a result I was able to restore my OS and it even booted, I was
however missing ~800 files. This proves to me that fsarchiver should not
be used for OS backup/restores and if ReaR have to be anyhow involved in
NTFS backups/restores, I'd much rather avoid interaction with filesystem
layer and use ntfsclone.</p>
<p>Any feedback is more then welcome ;-)</p>
<p>V.</p>

<p>My idea to implement NTFS support would be just to introduce another
backup method (e.g. NTFSCLONE), and use "Multiple backups" feature
recently implemented by @jsmeix.<br />
Doing NTFS support this way, should not have any bad effects on existing
ReaR code.</p>

<p>@gozora<br />
what about dumb 'dd' as a simple generic "backup" method<br />
because I think that should work for any unmounted filesystem<br />
(strictly speaking for any block device that is not in use)<br />
in particular it should work for any alien filesystem<br />
and probably even for so called "raw" devices.<br />
Of course 'dd' is dumb and slow and whatever else,<br />
but I think it would at least "simply work" where real<br />
backup methods do not or cannot work.</p>

<p>@jsmeix in general I have nothing against dd and it should work
perfectly fine.<br />
I don't care about slowness until tool is reliable. But that one thing
that <em>ntfsclone</em> knows better is "where NTFS data ends" (that is mine:
"however ntfsclone looks to me just like a bit smarted brother of dd").
Hence <em>ntfsclone</em> will not copy whole block device 1:1 but stops after
there are no more data to backup.</p>

<p>Hmm, thinking of it now, input parameters for <em>dd</em> and <em>ntfsclone</em>
should be quite same. So maybe we could do something like
BACKUP=BLOCK_CLONE with some configuration options for tool to be used,
like:</p>
<pre><code>BACKUP=BLOCK_CLONE

<p>Thanks for the update Vlad!</p>
<p>I don't have any comment regarding those errors you are getting from
fsarchiver because I haven't tried it with Windows 8 or 10 yet. I'll try
to have a go with it later.</p>
<p>Going off what you say it sounds that if you can reliably detect NTFS
partitions then rear should use ntfsclone and maybe use dd as a NTFS
fallback and for alien filesystems.</p>

<p>@gozora<br />
I look forward to your pull request :-)</p>
<p>I think the user needs to specify the block device<br />
he wants to BLOCK_CLONE, e.g. something like<br />
the following:</p>
<p>/etc/rear/sda3.conf</p>
<pre>
BACKUP=BLOCK_CLONE
BLOCK_CLONE_DEVICE="/dev/sda3"
BLOCK_CLONE_TOOL="dd ibs=2M obs=2M"
</pre>

<p>/etc/rear/sdb2.conf</p>
<pre>
BACKUP=BLOCK_CLONE
BLOCK_CLONE_DEVICE="/dev/sdb2"
BLOCK_CLONE_TOOL="ntfsclone -f --ignore-fs-check"
</pre>

<p>/etc/rear/sdc.conf</p>
<pre>
BACKUP=BLOCK_CLONE
BLOCK_CLONE_DEVICE="/dev/sdc"
BLOCK_CLONE_TOOL="dd ibs=8M obs=8M"
</pre>

<p>where e.g. on /dev/sda3 there is an alien filesystem,<br />
on /dev/sdb2 there is NTFS, and /dev/sdc is a raw device.</p>
<p>And finally there is the "tiny complication" ;-)<br />
that ReaR must do the partitioning, i.e.<br />
ReaR would have to create at least the right<br />
block devices (i.e. partitions) for the alien filesystems...</p>

<p>Regarding partitioning for alien filesystems:</p>
<p>As an initial step let the user specify what to do<br />
e.g. something like /etc/rear/sdb2.conf</p>
<pre>
BACKUP=BLOCK_CLONE
BLOCK_CLONE_DEVICE="/dev/sdb2"
BLOCK_CLONE_DEVICE_SETUP="parted -s /dev/sdb mklabel ... ; parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart ...  ; parted -s /dev/sdb set ... type ... ; ..."
BLOCK_CLONE_TOOL="ntfsclone -f --ignore-fs-check"
</pre>

<p>and later implement the automatism.</p>

<p>I have the gut feeling that partitioning for alien filesystems<br />
should not be done with the current ReaR layout code<br />
but kept strictly separated from it.</p>
<p>I think during "rear -C base_system recover"<br />
nothing about alien stuff should happen.</p>
<p>I think any alien stuff should happen strictly separated<br />
from recreating the Linux base system.</p>
<p>Simply put:<br />
I would prefer that any alien stuff can never ever cause issues<br />
for recreating regular Linux systems.</p>

<p>hello @jsmeix exactly this can't be done with <em>parted</em>.<br />
WIndows used MBR code that is hard to recreate. To my opinion best way
is just to copy MBR 1:1 like:<br />
<code>dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc bs=512 count=1</code><br />
This will copy bootloader code + create partitions.</p>

<p>Well I'm poor as well, but some time ago I've exchanged my soul for MSDN
membership :-).<br />
This is what I have so far:
<a href="https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/1db133f0a74bf3094f5196fe874543c50d3bed5a">https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/1db133f0a74bf3094f5196fe874543c50d3bed5a</a><br />
It is surprisingly small amount of code compared how much time it took
me to make it work :-).</p>
<p>I want to use existing ReaR code used for NETFS backups (at least for
mounting and unmounting) without creating even a minimal chance for
breaking something that works. So far this is just quick and dirty as I
needed to get mount functionality on board as quick as possible, so I'm
fully aware that some protos might not even work (so far I've done tests
only with <em>nfs://</em>) so I rely on comments from you guys about possible
implications of such approach ;-)</p>
<p>I've used following MO for Ubuntu Mate / Windows 10 dual boot:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is most simple scenario when every OS is located on single
    physical HDD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HDD with Windows 10 have 2 partitions (1. boot; 2. c:\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 config files in <em>/etc/rear</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<pre><code>root@mate:/etc/rear# cat base_os.conf
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://beta.virtual.sk/mnt/rear
BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/media/*' )

root@mate:/etc/rear# cat windows_boot.conf
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE
BACKUP_URL="nfs://beta.virtual.sk/mnt/rear"
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="windows_boot"
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sdb1"
BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sdb"

BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX=".img"
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

BLOCKCLONE_PROG=ntfsclone
BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV="/dev/sdb2"
</code></pre>
<p>Now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Backup Ubuntu Mate<br />
<code>rear -C base_os mkbackup</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backup Windows 10 partitions<br />
<code>rear -C windows_boot mkbackuponly</code><br />
<code>rear -C windows_data mkbackuponly</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Restore part (which does not exist currently) could look like:<br />
<code>rear -C base_os recover</code><br />
<code>rear -C windows_boot restoreonly</code><br />
<code>rear -C windows_data restoreonly</code></p>

<p>@gozora<br />
regarding "every OS is located on single physical HDD":</p>
<p>I think that explains the difference between my proposal<br />
using parted to create a partition for Windows and your way<br />
using 'dd' for the Windows MBR.</p>
<p>What I had in mind was a dual boot system on a single disk<br />
(i.e. what I think most normal users have e.g. on their laptops)<br />
where GRUB is used as bootloader for Linux and Windows.<br />
In this case I think it should work to use parted to create<br />
a partition for Windows and afterwards that partition<br />
is filled up with a 'dd' image of Windows.</p>
<p>What I do not know if after such a recovery<br />
GRUB can still boot Windows.</p>

<p>This is something I must check, Windows have some limitations in regards
of on which partition it is installed on ...<br />
I have a foggy feeling for an example that you can't install windows on
other that first partition.<br />
In any case parted will still be useless.</p>

<p>Hi Vlad</p>
<p>My work drive looks like this:</p>
<p>Disk /dev/sda: 238.5 GiB, 256060514304 bytes, 500118192 sectors<br />

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes<br />
Disklabel type: dos<br />

<p>Device Boot Start End Sectors Size Id Type<br />
/dev/sda1 * 2048 718847 716800 350M 7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT<br />
/dev/sda2 718848 247420927 246702080 117.7G 7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT<br />
/dev/sda3 247420928 500118191 252697264 120.5G 83 Linux</p>
<p>sda1/2 = Windows 8<br />
sda3 = Arch</p>
<p>IIRC you don't have to install Windows in the first partition but it
does always replace GRUB or whatever bootloader you are using with the
Windows bootloader at install time, hence why you should install Windows
first then Linux or other operating systems, if you are multi-booting.</p>
<p>Are you saying your current alien fs rear implementation doesn't support
Windows being installed on a separate drive? I'd agree that having both
installed on the same HD is more common but having Windows and Linux
installed on separate drives is also a common config.</p>

<p>Fist, this is not "implementation", let's say it is just a "concept"
:-)<br />
Second, just opposite, I just tested situation when each OS was
installed on separate disk. Having all this mess on one disk would be
certainly more challenging. ;-)</p>

<p>Hello all,<br />
Just a short update on my "progress".<br />
I've managed to restore that parody of OS, in spite of its vital
resistance... (It looks to me that MS guys wants reinstall to be only
option how to bring it back to life.)<br />
The biggest problem tends to be partitioning.<br />
Windows looks to need exactly same partitioning layout to be able to
boot. ReaR however seems to create partitions on approximate basis.
Small example:</p>
<p><strong>Original OS</strong></p>
<pre><code>root@onepart:~# parted /dev/sda unit s print
Model: ATA VBOX HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 73400320s

<p>Hmm, I just found #492 talking something about shifting partitions when
recovering to disks of different sizes. Exactly my case. I'll try to
restore to same sized disk ...</p>
<h4 id="gozora_commented_at_2016-12-10_1053"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12116358?u=1c5ba9dcee5ca3082f03029a7fbe647efd30eb49&v=4" width="50"><a href="https://github.com/gozora">gozora</a> commented at <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-266199885">2016-12-10 10:53</a>:<a class="headerlink" href="#gozora_commented_at_2016-12-10_1053" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>With same sized disks situation looks a bit better. However extended
partition is not correctly created even for same sized disk. It appears
that Linux simply doesn't care, but Windows (again) refused to boot.<br />
Extended partition was create as follows by ReaR rescue/recovery media:</p>
<pre><code>/dev/sda3       36388862 73400319 37011458 17.7G  f W95 Ext'd (LBA)
</code></pre>
<p>But it should look something like</p>
<pre><code>/dev/sda3       36388862 73398271 37009410 17.7G  5 Extended
</code></pre>
<p>So two thing went wrong</p>
<ol>
<li>End of extended partition is shifted by 2048 sectors</li>
<li>LBA flag was incorrectly set for extended partition</li>
</ol>
<p>As this could affect ReaR regular (Linux restore) operations as well,
I'll try to find code responsible for this and correct it. I somehow
have the feeling that shift by 2048 will not by coincidence.</p>

<p>Hello @danboid ,</p>
<p>Today I've managed to make successful restore in both discussed
scenarios (having Windows &amp; Linux on same and on separate disks).<br />
I'd very much appreciate if you could give it a try. You can download
code from my Github page:<br />
<code>git clone -b disk_clone https://github.com/gozora/rear.git</code><br />
During testing, please bare in mind that code is certainly not perfect
and it might happen that you will not be able to recover your OSes at
all! So don't do tests on systems/data you will need ;-).<br />
Here is my configuration that worked for me:</p>
<p><strong>General settings for ReaR</strong></p>
<pre><code>root@onepart:/etc/rear# cat local.conf

<p>In general on "same hardware" replacement disks<br />
(in particular same disk size, ideally same disk model<br />
basically only the disk UUID is different)<br />
ReaR should recreate identical partitioning.</p>
<p>Reasoning as far as I understand it:<br />
In disklayout.conf ReaR stores the values in bytes.<br />
During "rear recover" parted should be called with<br />
that byte values so that one should get the partitions<br />
recreated with the same byte value positions on the<br />
replacement disk. This should result an indentically<br />
recreated partitioning - as far as I can imagine.</p>
<p>Regarding "extended partition is not correctly created<br />
even for same sized disk":<br />
I never used ReaR with extended partitions.<br />
Perhaps there is a bug in ReaR or in parted<br />
or whatever else?<br />
Regarding parted:<br />
There is the alignment-type option for parted.<br />
Perhaps it is parted's alignment that results that<br />
recreated partitions can be a bit shifted?</p>

<p>Hello @jsmeix</p>
<p>Honestly, I did not study layout code as there were no complaints about
it and like said before, I don't want to break existing code.<br />
To overcome this I've put following
<a href="https://github.com/gozora/rear/blob/disk_clone/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh#L248">code</a>
into <em>layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh</em>, which
will (re)create partitioning on disk where Windows resides, 1:1 with
original (only limitation here is that target disk must be same size or
larger than original).<br />
I know that in #1107 you've started campaign against use of <em>sfdisk</em>,
but I think, due my recent experience, that once we use <em>sfdisk</em> to get
data from msdos and <em>sgdisk</em> for gpt, all should be OK.</p>

<p>Hi Vlad</p>
<p>Great news! I doubt I'll have time to test it today but I'll try it as
soon as I get the chance.</p>
<p>I realise you say its very experimental so I just wanted to confirm:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In your testing, did you try totally removing all partitions (esp.
    the Windows ones) before attempting a recovery?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should this work with both BIOS and EFI Windows installs? Maybe it
    makes no difference?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would it be possible to backup and restore with one config file, one
    backup comand and one restore command? Seeing as the two Windows
    configs look very similar apart from the partition, it would be nice
    if this could be made less redundant. Maybe this is just purely
    prototypical and not what it'll work like when finished?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which version of Windows have you been testing with? Windows 10 Home
    64-bit?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have no problem with any kind of dirty hacks<br />
that are needed to make things work for now<br />
as log as it is well documented in the code<br />
so that later it could be cleaned up if possible, cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style">https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style</a></p>
<p>As far as I know sfdisk does not work with GPT.<br />
When you need sfdisk can you implement a test<br />
that errors out if a GPT partitioning is there?<br />
Something like</p>
<pre>
is_true "$BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING" && [[ "$label" = "gpt" || "$label" == "gpt_sync_mbr" ]] && Error "BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING does not work with GPT"
</pre>

<p>Such a test should happen during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"<br />
and not when it is too late for the user during "rear recover".</p>

<p>You can always create your own custom shell script, which will do all
work for you. And yes this is just a prototype, all fancy staff can be
considered once we have basic concept working ;-)</p>

<p>This is what I had on my mind, unfortunately once I've installed Windows
it created msdos type of partitioning, so all current code is related to
msdos.<br />
I guess that Windows will use GPT once I switch for EFI, then I'll adapt
code accordingly.<br />
But first I need to know that it works for somebody else (except me) as

there a preferred distro for testing rear with? Preferred for me would
mean its quick and easy to install both the OS and rear so ideally a

<p>Hi Vlad!</p>
<p>I'm most of the way to creating a suitable test env for this now, I
think. I cloned a Win 10 VM, resized its OS partition and installed
CentOS 7 (minimal) into a third (XFS) partition. CentOS seems like a
good distro for testing rear because rear is already in the CentOS repos
so I installed rear with yum to get the extra deps then removed it
before cloning your repo and doing a <code>make rpm</code> and installing the rear
rpm.</p>
<p>The only thing left to do now before I test (I think) is to put the four
rear config files into place but I wanted to make sure there aren't any
extra options I may need? My plan is to create a samba share on my VM
host and have rear backup to/ restore from that. That should be
possible, right?</p>
<p>I expect I'll be able to get away with using almost exactly the same
config files as you used Vlad but I'm wondering why the following lines
in local.conf are required?</p>
<p>GRUB_RESCUE=n<br />
BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING="yes"<br />
BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sda"</p>
<p>I thought rear always backed up the MBR, or that was the impression I
got seeing as I didn't use any of these options previously and GRUB
recovered fine?</p>
<p>Are there any other options you might suggest I use given my test plan?
I'm hoping I'll only have to do this once! :)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes that should be fully OK, you just need to adapt following config
options (in <em>local.conf</em>) to match your backup location.</p>
<pre><code>BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://beta.virtual.sk/mnt/rear
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure you can adapt them to suit your needs ;-)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You are totally right here, ReaR does all that partitioning and savig
stuff just right, for Windows however we need a bit more to make the
magic happen.<br />
You can forget about GRUB_RESCUE ( I should remove it long time ago ),
but<br />
BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING and BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV are
important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING<br />
    As Windows uses some strict boot code (see
    <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-266099227">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-266099227</a>),
    I was not able to make it boot with ReaR default partitioning code.
    Once you use this option, partitions will be created EXACTLY same as
    on original OS. This however have some limits. Biggest limit is that
    you must restore to same or greater disk than original. Restoring to
    smaller disk will simply fail with some error message (some off
    topic) that I've probably did not changed yet, sorry!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV<br />
    Tells ReaR where to look for partitioning data. In other words you
    put here disk (without partition number) where is your WIndows
    located. If you have just one disk sharing WIndows and Linux it will
    be most probably <em>/dev/sda</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration is a bit clumsy but I'm working on it to make it
better and maybe even simpler.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with testing!</p>
<p>V.</p>

<p>ReaR does not backup the MBR.<br />
During "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" it remembers<br />
the partitioning in disklayout.conf and<br />
during "rear recover" it recreates the partitioning<br />
from scratch (via diskrestore.sh).<br />
I.e. during "rear recover" one gets a new<br />
from scratch written MBR or GPT via<br />
"parted mklabel msdos" or "pated mklabel gpt".</p>
<p>For alien systems this recreating the partitioning<br />

<p>After jumping through hundreds of hoops, I've backed up my dual-boot
Win10/CentOS 7 VM as you described and I'm currently cloning my test VM
just in case recovery fails.</p>
<p>I presume my only way to recover is to use those three separate commands
ie auto recovery currently won't auto restore all three partitions for
me, yet? Manual recovery is the only option for recovering NTFS right
now?</p>
<p>Should NTFS support get merged, would I be able to use auto recovery and
have NTFS partitions auto-recovered?</p>
<p>Back soon with the results...</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,</p>
<p>What is your idea, about how recovery should work?</p>

<p>When I boot the recovery iso, I would expect auto-recovery to restore
all partitions (on all drives) by default. Is this not the default
behaviour?</p>

<p>Honestly, I don't know if ReaR can do something like this. I saw some
"automatic recover" option in ReaR rescue/recovery system but I've never
used it.<br />
I think it is a matter of taste, I for example don't think starting
recovery automatically is a good idea and prefer more control over it.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that this is final stage how this patch will behave, but
cosmetics can be done after we have something working ;-)</p>

<p>I've just tried the automatic recovery option but, as I expected from
your response, it didn't work:</p>
<p><code>ERROR: Backup archive 'backup.tar.gz' not found.</code></p>
<p>If you are recovering a multiboot system, recovering all partitions in
auto-recovery mode seems like the only sensible default to me.</p>
<p>I'll try a manual recovery now...</p>

<p>I would not agree here, Imagine that only your Linux installation is
broken (Windows is running just file). In such case restoring Windows

<p>What should auto-recovery do then, if it doesn't restore all partitions?</p>
<p>IMO you should only need to do a manual recovery if you DON'T want to
restore all partitions - but that's just me.</p>

<p>@jsmeix will it work with "Multiple backup methods"?<br />
Like I said before, I've never tried it out, but my idea is that
"automatic recover" just runs <code>rear recover</code> after boot.<br />
We would need
<code>rear -C base_os recover; rear -C windows_boot restoreonly; rear -C windows_data restoreonly</code>
instead.<br />
Maybe another variable in default.conf (AUTOEXEC) would be handy ;-) ?</p>

clean up the currently single-big-and-fat "recover" workflow

Currently "rear recover" is not prepared to skip only
certain parts...
</pre>

<p>Regarding<br />
will it work with "Multiple backup methods"?</p>
<p>As far as I understand it for NTFS backup and restore<br />
using "Multiple backup methods" is mandatory because<br />
the NTFS backup and restore is a separated<br />
and totally different backup method compared to the<br />
backup method that is used for the basic Linux system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whilst both backup and recovery seemed to proceed without
errors, recovery failed. Surprisingly, neither Windows nor CentOS would
boot after recovery although at least GRUB seemed to get restored OK.</p>
<p>Whilst CentOS (7 minimal install iso) seems like a good choice for
testing rear to me, its not perfect for testing NTFS support as you have
to add the EPEL repo to get ntfs-3g and ntfsprogs and EPEL doesn't work
until you disable SSL for its repo. Also, the COS installer didn't
detect my Windows install so I had to manually add it to the GRUB
config.</p>
<p>Another hiccup on my way to creating the backup was that I was unable to
disable fast boot under Windows 10 when running it under QEMU/KVM, which
prevented me cloning the Windows data partition straight away. Rather
than forcing ntfsclone to ignore the unclean partition, I rebooted into
Windows and then shut it down using the command:</p>
<p><code>shutdown /s /f /t 0</code></p>
<p>After booting back into CentOS, I was able to backup the Windows data
partition without using the force switch.</p>
<p>My config local.conf looked like:</p>
<pre><code>OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="username=dan,pass=MyAmazingPassword"
BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.168.35.5/rearshare

GRUB_RESCUE=n
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" ntfsclone )

BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING="yes"
BLOCKCLONE_SAVE_MBR_DEV="/dev/sda"
USE_DHCLIENT=yes
</code></pre>
<p>The other config files I kept identical to the Vlad's but I also left
/etc/rear/os.conf in-place as it seemed harmless to me:</p>
<pre><code>OS_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer
OS_VERSION=7
</code></pre>
<p>I will attach screenshots of the errors displayed when I try to boot
Windows. Push Enter, F8 or F9 does nothing (in true Windows stylee).<br />

<p>Hello @danboid,<br />
I know these screens!!! (maybe I should start to consider to switch to
NT support :-) ). I've got exactly these screens when partitions had
different parameters!</p>
<p>Could you please do following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>on your source OS<br />
    Get partition parameters (and put them here) of your disk where
    Linux and Windows are installed like:<br />
<code>parted /dev/sda unit s print</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>boot ReaR rescue/recovery system and restore Linux only with:<br />
<code>rear -C base_os recover</code><br />
    Once done trigger same command (and post result here)<br />
<code>parted /dev/sda unit s print</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This way you can access a running ReaR recovery system<br />
from remote via ssh and then it is usally easier to get<br />

<p>You've prob noticed in my last attached screenshot that sda1 was aligned
differently after the original recovery than when I restored base_os a
second time. After restoring a second time, the sectors match those on
my cloned VM but this didn't make it boot.</p>

<p>@danboid this just hit me in the head, you wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst both backup and recovery seemed to proceed
without errors, recovery failed. Surprisingly, neither Windows nor
CentOS would boot after recovery.</p>

<p>I'm interested in unbootable Centos, do you know what was the problem
there? Did you saw at least Grub2 menu?</p>

<p>I must be blind or something ..<br />
Your OS where you've run <code>rear -C base_os mkbackup</code> have this partition
layout:</p>
<pre><code>Number  Start      End         Size       Type     File system  Flags
 1      2048s      1026047s    1024000s   primary  ntfs         boot
 2      1026048s   89001983s   87975936s  primary  ntfs
 3      89001984s  130023423s  41021440s  primary  xfs
</code></pre>
<p>and same numbers are shown on your screenshot after you've done
<code>rear -C base_os recover</code></p>

<p>Yes, I see the GRUB2 menu fine but all 3 Centos options fail to boot.
The CentOS progress bar reaches the top, turns white and then booting
stops.</p>
<p>If I edit the GRUB entries for CentOS to remove <code>rhgb quiet</code> so that it
shows the boot messages you can see it only gets as far as loading
Network Manager before it gives up.</p>

<p>That is fully OK, that is effect of BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING. I
was describing this earlier. ReaR does not create exactly same
partitioning with original. And in order not to break current code, I
just let let ReaR to run original partitioning code and once it is
finished, I just rewrite it again so it matches original. (this might
change in the future).</p>
<p>I'm a bit concerned with your last screenshot. In general Linux should
be able to boot regardless if you try to restore windows or not. This
might be some problem not related to NTFS topic. I'll try to reproduce
it somehow. :-).</p>
<p>Just for summary, can you please describe exact commands you've used for
backup and for restore + add content of files in /etc/rear directory?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'll attach my exact config files tomorrow but I believe I've already
given you enough info for you to recreate my rear config exactly - at
least as far as the rear confg files are concerned.</p>
<p>I had the same thoughts as you wrt Linux not booting. Does rear do any
kind of checksumming for creating the backup archives? I know clonezilla
asks if you want to perform checks before and after you clone when you
use its advanced mode. Maybe I can force rear to do checksums with an
additional option? As I said, no errors were reported during the backup
process for all three partitions, same goes for when I was restoring
them.</p>
<p>CentOS, probably because its the most popular RHEL derivative, is THE
most popular (Linux or Windows) server OS in the UK, by a long shot so I
suspect its one of the most popular server OSs worldwide alongside
Debian, RHEL and Ubuntu. CentOS pretty much is Linux as far as the
datacentres in the UK are concerned. rear HAS to work with CentOS, if
nothing else.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to try it with CentOS 6 too as that prob has
more installations than C7 presently.</p>

<p>Some other things I should mention:</p>
<p>I installed CentOS 7 minimal x86-64 (64-bit) to a single XFS partition
with no swap and no boot partition. The installer does nag at you for
not creating a swap partition but I've been swapless for years now and
happy! I realise this isn't always an option such as people who use
suspend to disk - they need swap.</p>
<p>I used gparted on systemrescuecd to shrink my Windows data partition to
make way for the CentOS partition. Prob doesn't matter but...</p>
<p>I used the virtio network adapter under QEMU for my test VM. I gave it
2GB RAM but other than that, it is virt-manager defaults for the VM
hardware.</p>
<p>My samba server was running on the same (Arch Linux) box as the VM but I
still had to punch holes in the firewalld config for smb to work. Again,
this is likely unrelated but worth noting if you wanted to replicate my
testing method.</p>
<p>I made sure I installed ntfs-3g, ntfsprogs and all the usual samba
packages under C7.</p>
<p>The KVM VMs are stored in qcow2 files.</p>
<p>I used the C7 installer defaults as far as filesystem options are
concerned.</p>
<p>I can't think of anything else worth mentioning right now...</p>

<p>I presume you are mainly (only) a Suse user? Do you work for them? I've
not tried (open)suse in years so its time I gave it another go really.</p>
<p>I decided some time ago to never use BTRFS. It's just a mess. I run
FreeBSD 11 on my home server because FreeBSD has more mature ZFS support
than Linux. I'd like to see a Linux distro that supports ZFS as well as
FreeBSD does but licensing makes that tricky or impossible.</p>
<p>I prefer to use XFS under Linux but in some cases ext4 is the only
option or a better fit. In kinda related news Wayland is finally coming
of age but I just have no hope for BTRFS. It seems fundamentally flawed
and poorly designed from everything I hear about it. Maybe bcachefs will
bring a good, modern filesystem to Linux that distros can actually use?</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,</p>
<p>Hope you still remember me ;-). I was off during weekend playing Kerbal
Space Program, somehow missing mood to solve problems, but now I'm back
:-).</p>
<p>In
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-268026797">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-268026797</a>
I've found reason behind unbootable Linux. I don't have patched it yet,
but if you disabled SELinux and rerun backup, your Linux should boot
just fine.<br />
For a case you are not familiar with SELinux you need to edit
<em>/etc/sysconfig/selinux</em> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>- SELINUX=enforcing
+ SELINUX=disabled
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>reboot
rear -C base_os  mkbackup
</code></pre>
<p>Now for Windows part. Once you've finished with recovering your Windows
data partition try to poke a bit your MBR like this AFTER last part of
NTFS restore is done:</p>
<ul>
<li>while in ReaR rescue/recovery system you should have file
    <strong>sda_mbr.img</strong> (or simmilar) in <em>/var/lib/rear/layout/</em></li>
<li>execute
    <code>dd if=/var/lib/rear/layout/sda_mbr.img of=/dev/sda bs=446 bs=1</code> and
    <code>reboot</code></li>
<li>now Windows should boot just fine</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this time it will work for you just fine. I'll of course implement
this (somehow) into ReaR so user will not need any "hacking" in future.</p>

<p>Hi Vlad</p>
<p>No probs about the wait! I do realise you have a life outside of
developing ReaR! I've not played Kerbal Space but one of my co-workers
at my last job was a fan of that.</p>
<p>As for the CentOS boot prob with SELinux, it seemed obvious when you
suggested it. I was surprised I must've never tried cloning a box that
had SELinux enabled before as otherwise I would've disabled it, which is
something I normally do on a COS/RHEL install I'm actually using.</p>
<p>More importantly for this ticket, I just ran:</p>
<p><code>dd if=/var/lib/rear/layout/sda_mbr.img of=/dev/sda bs=446 bs=1</code></p>
<p>On my rear test VM and as you say, Windows 10 boots fine now! Yippee!</p>
<p>Good work Mr G!</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,</p>
<p>I've updated my <a href="https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block_clone">ReaR
fork</a>, with patched
code according latest findings we've made.<br />
I've also made successful test with restoring Windows 7, so the basic
idea looks to be working.<br />
Now I'll take care about cloning of disks using <code>dd</code>. Hope it will be
same fun ...</p>
<p>Happy holidays everybody!</p>

<p>Thanks for the update Vlad!</p>
<p>Has anyone else tried the ntfs-cloning yet apart from me and you?</p>
<p>Do you plan to streamline or improve it any more or is it pretty much
done now?</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,</p>
<p>As far as I know you are that only privileged tester so far (apart from
me ;-) ).</p>
<p>No it is not yet done, I'll try to add at least GPT/UEFI support. Except
that, I think that anybody can write improvements to code so only time
will show how all this would develop.</p>

<p>Hello @danboid,</p>
<p>Documentation for BLOCKCLONE backup method was merged today to upstream
code.<br />
As only known user who actually tested BLOCKCLONE, I'd appreciate if you
could have a look on
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc">documentation</a>
and tell me your thoughts on it.<br />
I've tried to write is as easy as possible, but it is quite hard to keep
a distance especially if you are documenting your own code.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>V.</p>

<p>With<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1172">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1172</a><br />
"BLOCKCLONE backup method"<br />
and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1180">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1180</a><br />
"BLOCKCLONE documentation"<br />
merged<br />
there is now NTFS support in ReaR<br />
so that I consider this issue to be solved.</p>
<p>Again @gozora contributed a very valuable part to ReaR.<br />
Many thanks for that!</p>
<p>@danboid<br />
now it is your turn to test if the<br />
BLOCKCLONE backup method<br />
also works for you.<br />
In case of issues:<br />
For each separated issue a separated GitHub issue<br />
should be created to keep separated things separated.</p>

<p>@danboid<br />
for using the BLOCKCLONE backup method<br />
a prerequirement is understanding how<br />
"Using Multiple Backups for Relax-and-Recover"<br />
works, see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc</a></p>

<p>Great to see NTFS support for rear! Thanks for all your hard work
@gozora ! I will never actually use BLOCKCLONE mode for NTFS but I
understand the need for a fallback.</p>
<p>I will try to give blockclone mode a test soon but I'm short of free
time now until I get a new place to live sorted. I got told last weekend
I have to move out of my house by the end of Feb.</p>
