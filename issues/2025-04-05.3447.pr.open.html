<p>How was this pull request tested? Basic test performed with normal
    umount so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description of the changes in this pull request:<br />
    Issue #3429 is about "The new umount_mountpoint_retry_lazy
    function
    <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408</a>
    versus the already existing umount_mountpoint_lazy function - try
    to make a single generic ReaR umount function for all cases"<br />
    However, after carefully looking at the code we feel it would be
    better to merge all kind if umounts in one function and that is
    within the main function "<strong>umount_mountpoint</strong>".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this first version of the PR we did not (yet) remove the 'lazy'
argument with the function umount_mountpoint, nor the two remaining
<em>lazy</em> functions "umount_mountpoint_lazy " and
"umount_mountpoint_retry_lazy" to protect the existing calls to these
functions in ReaR.</p>
<p>When the ReaR maintainers agree with the new code (or after updates) we
can start cleaning up the remaining lazy functions.</p>

<p>My main worries with "just killing some process"<br />
comes from what I learned from @pcahyna during his<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611</a><br />
and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625</a></p>
<p>Excepts from his initial descriptions<br />
in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611</a></p>
<pre><code>If for any reason unmounting the NFS directory
mounted at outputfs fails (for example,
there is a process using this filesystem),
ReaR proceeds to
rm -Rf -v /.../outputfs
as part of the exit tasks.
This removes the old backup directory.
It will also destroy the backup directories
for other machines, if multiple machines are configured
to use the same NFS directory.
A similar problem was reported as
https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/465
and after being fixed it was reintroduced
in a misguided "fix"
(PR https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/782,
https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4e9c2a1b05f87762fb06355cf959b24eacc21f62)
in ReaR 1.18.
</code></pre>
<p>and in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625</a></p>
<pre><code>Replaced the various
rm -rf
of the mountpoint by rmdir
(this fixes https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611)
and added lazy umount in case normal umount does not succeed.
If build dir is kept, propose a safe way to remove it to the user
(rm -Rf --one-file-system instead of just rm -Rf
where the user would risk to remove everything
in their mounted filesystem if still mounted.)
</code></pre>
<p>In those cases it was "just 'rm -Rf' some directory"<br />
instead of a careful way how to properly deal with<br />
when the correctly intended task "rmdir directory" failed.</p>
<p>In this case here it could be "just kill some process"<br />
instead of a careful way how to properly deal with<br />
when the correctly intended task "umount directory" failed.</p>
<p>In both cases when the correctly intended task failed,<br />
not the reason behind the failure is carefully handled,<br />
instead the whole problem is disregarded and ReaR even<br />
somewhat "brutally" proceeds in case of those failures<br />
which could lead to disastrous outcomes, e.g. as in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2611</a></p>
<p>The worst outcome when ReaR itself causes a disaster is<br />
that then ReaR may no longer be perceived by its users<br />
as a reasonably trustworthy tool for disaster recovery<br />
after they found out how certain ReaR code behaves.<br />
No software is free of issues, but one can relatively<br />
easily see if code tries to behave careful or not.</p>
<p>In general this would be against<br />
"Try hard to care about possible errors"<br />

<p>@jsmeix<br />
Personally, I’ve never had an issue with the <code>umount_mountpoint</code>
function itself.<br />
That said, I have experienced problems with NFS hangs - especially when
dealing with cross-WAN NFS mounts.</p>
<p>In general, WAN-based NFSv4 over TCP tends to be more reliable than
plain NFSv3. However, WAN NFS is often subject to QoS policies that
throttle the bitrate to a crawl over time. This typically happens when
backing up large amounts of data over NFS. If the NFS server doesn’t
receive input for a while, it may send a RST (reset) signal to the NFS
client. As a result, the ReaR process on the client - usually via <code>tar</code>
- keeps waiting for input that never arrives, causing the NFS mount to
hang.</p>
<p>This situation is made worse in enterprise environments, where ReaR is
often run in unattended mode, and where the outcome of the backup isn't
closely monitored. If backups are scheduled weekly, this can lead to
subsequent jobs also hanging.</p>
<p>While you can kill the <code>tar</code>, <code>cpio</code>, and <code>rear</code> processes, there’s
usually one process that remains unkillable and becomes a zombie.<br />
A lazy unmount of the temporary ReaR directory does work, but needing to
do so is a clear sign that ReaR has already failed.</p>
<p>As for killing the process - it might be a heavy-handed approach, and I
wouldn't object to removing that logic and simply reporting the issue.
However, allowing ReaR to continue in that state isn’t much better,
since its behavior becomes unreliable from that point forward.</p>
<p>Is this ReaR’s fault? I’d argue no. In my opinion, NFS is simply not a
great transport mechanism for backups.<br />
As Didac pointed out in his talk, rsync offers much more robust recovery
mechanisms compared to NFS.</p>

<p>@gdha<br />
thank you so much for your background information,<br />
in particular what happens "out there in the wild".</p>
<p>I have nothing against killing a process in principle.<br />
What worries me is only when such things happen<br />
unconditioned and/or in a hardcoded / automated way<br />
where the user has no influence.</p>
<p>For example when ReaR is running in unattended mode<br />
this would be a condition to do an automated killing<br />
of processes which use a mountpoint.</p>
<p>We also have '--non-interactive' mode where I think<br />
this mode is also meant for such cases - regardless<br />
that currently "rear help" tells</p>
<pre><code> -n --non-interactive   non-interactive mode; aborts when any
                        user input is required (experimental)
</code></pre>
<p>where "user input is required" is not exactly this case<br />
but I think the meaning is same, i.e. when ReaR comes<br />
to a point where ReaR would need user input how to proceed<br />
then in non-interactive mode ReaR would abort.</p>
<p>What seems to be missung is that when "rear recover"<br />
is run in 'unattended_recovery' mode that then<br />
not also NON_INTERACTIVE=1 is set, i.e.<br />
'unattended_recovery' mode does not automatically<br />
also mean 'non-interactive' mode.</p>
<p>I think 'non-interactive' mode is the more generic mode<br />
while 'unattended_recovery' mode is a special kind of<br />
the 'non-interactive' mode so 'unattended_recovery' mode<br />
should implicate 'non-interactive' mode.</p>
