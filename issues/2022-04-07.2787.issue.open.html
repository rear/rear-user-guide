<p>It's related to the issue
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786</a></p>
<p>To reproduce the issue, change the UUID of the UEFI partition:</p>
<p>disklayout.conf before the change:</p>
<pre><code>fs /dev/vda1 /boot/efi vfat uuid=ACC0-624F label= options=rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=winnt,errors=remount-ro
</code></pre>
<p>fstab before the change:</p>
<pre><code>UUID=ACC0-624F          /boot/efi               vfat    umask=0077,shortname=winnt 0 2
</code></pre>
<p>Then change the label:</p>
<pre><code>mlabel -N 12345678 -i /dev/vda1 ::
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the cron.d job (or new systemd job) will recreate the rescue iso
because the layout changed:</p>
<pre><code>30 1 * * * root test -f /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf &amp;&amp; /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
</code></pre>
<p>New disklayout.conf:</p>
<pre><code>options=rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=winnt,errors=remount-ro
</code></pre>
<p>But the /etc/fstab file that will be used during the recover, and that
should be patched, is still the one in the backup, thus the old one with
old UUID.<br />
And the patch will fail ... (without a warning :D).<br />
And the system will not boot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workaround, if any:</li>
</ul>
<p>A rescue ISO should not be built if the required data in the backup is
not updated also.</p>
<p>The recover of the system layout should rely on the data in the rescue
ISO and not on the backup.<br />
Thus all the files that should be patched to update the UUID should be
embedded in the rescue.</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>@bwelterl<br />
thank you for your enlightning issue report!</p>
<p>I have to think a bit deeper about it - it looks complicated.</p>
<h4 id="jsmeix_commented_at_2022-04-07_1411"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50"><a href="https://github.com/jsmeix">jsmeix</a> commented at <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787#issuecomment-1091793474">2022-04-07 14:11</a>:<a class="headerlink" href="#jsmeix_commented_at_2022-04-07_1411" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Problem summary as far as I see it:</p>
<p>What should ReaR do when UUIDs in restored files like /etc/fstab<br />
do not exist on the recreated system?</p>
<p>Cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785#issuecomment-1091773765">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785#issuecomment-1091773765</a><br />
(excerpt):</p>
<pre><code>When the filesystems get recreated with the UUPDs from disklayout.conf
old and new UUIDs are the same in FS_UUID_MAP (which is the usual case)
so finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh won't change anything.
</code></pre>
<p>So the recreated UUIDs are normally consistent with what is in
disklayout.conf<br />
but they can be inconsistent with what there is in restored config
files.</p>
<p>So comparing UUIDs in disklayout.conf with the actually recreated
UUIDs<br />
(e.g. via FS_UUID_MAP) won't help to detect that inconsistency.</p>
<p>My immediate idea is a simple test as a start:<br />
When a actually recreated UUID does not appear in a config file<br />
it could indicate that something is fishy with this particular UUID<br />
or all is well because that kind of UUID is never used in a config file.</p>

<p>yeah, I know that the cron job is in RHEL 8.</p>
<p>concerning systemd job, I don't see any in the sources right now and
this issue shows that it may be a bad idea.</p>

<p>Whether or not there is a cron job doesn't actually matter here<br />
i.e. it doesn't matter how "rear mkrescue" got launched.</p>
<p>The issue is that there can be inconsistencies between<br />
what gets recreated according to disklayout.conf<br />
and what gets restored from the backup and<br />
currently ReaR cannot detect that because the current<br />
FS_UUID_MAP stuff only detects when there are inconsistencies<br />
between what is in disklayout.conf and what was actually recreated<br />
(i.e. different UUID recreated than what is in disklayout.conf) so<br />
<strong>currently ReaR cannot migrate restored files from the backup</strong><br />
in most cases because nowadays filesystem UUIDs are normally<br />
successfully recreated with the UUIDs in disklayout.conf</p>

<p>If the backup is taken after <code>mkrescue</code>, one can detect the problem, by
running <code>checklayout</code> before taking the backup.<br />
But if the backup is taken before <code>mkrescue</code> (and that's the case of the
cron job that triggered the problem here), I don't see how to detect it
easily.</p>

<p>I got distracted by other things and now weekend is almost there...</p>
<p>My primary intent is not to let ReaR automatically fix such
inconsistencies<br />
but to only detect them which is what @bwelterl intends with his<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786</a></p>
<p>For internal backup methods we may run what <code>checklayout</code> does<br />
during <code>mkbackuponly</code> to avoid that an inconsistent backup<br />
is taken with <code>mkbackuponly</code> after <code>mkrescue</code>.</p>
<p>When an inconsistent backup is taken with an external backup method<br />
after <code>mkrescue</code> there is nothing we can do to detect or avoid that.</p>
<p>When an inconsistent backup was taken before <code>mkrescue</code><br />
there is nothing we can do during <code>mkrescue</code> because we cannot know<br />
if a backup was taken before and what there is in the backup.</p>
<p>So all we have during <code>rear recover</code> is what there is in

<p>I think it is no bug in ReaR that things in the recovery system<br />
must be consistent with what there is in the backup.</p>
<p>In some cases we may avoid inconsistencies<br />
e.g. avoid that an inconsistent backup is taken with mkbackuponly after
mkrescue<br />
cf.
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787#issuecomment-1092853451">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787#issuecomment-1092853451</a><br />
but I think in most cases we cannot do anything in ReaR to avoid<br />
inconsistencies between recovery system and what there is in the
backup<br />
so it is mostly up to the user to keep recovery system and backup in
sync.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about how to help the user to avoid such
inconsistencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For internal backup methods we may run what checklayout does<br />
during mkbackuponly to avoid that an inconsistent backup<br />
is taken with mkbackuponly after mkrescue.</p>
<p>When an inconsistent backup is taken with an external backup method<br />
after mkrescue there is nothing we can do to detect or avoid that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can advise the user to run <code>checklayout</code> before (and possibly after)
their external backup procedure to imitate what the internal backup
would do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an inconsistent backup was taken before mkrescue<br />
there is nothing we can do during mkrescue because we cannot know<br />
if a backup was taken before and what there is in the backup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This case is a more difficult one. It could be solved by saving the
layout at the time <code>mkbackuponly</code> is executed to some place under
<code>/var/lib/rear</code> and have a special variant of <code>checklayout</code> that would
check the current layout not against the layout saved by <code>mkrescue</code>
(under <code>/var/lib/rear/layout</code>) but against the layout saved by
<code>mkbackuponly</code>. In essence have two saved layouts, one by <code>mkrescue</code>,
the other by <code>mkbackuponly</code>, and when each of the two commands detect a
difference from the layout saved by the other command, it is an
inconsistency, thus abort.</p>

<p>Another option would be to embed some files in the rescue image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rear is checking some files to update the UUID during the recovery,
these files should be embedded in the rescue ISO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and restore them from the rescue image instead of from the backup. This
of course opens a potential can of worms: one could then gradually embed
all the system in the rescue image, and we would not have a separate
backup anymore (that's the approach we don't want to take in general, I
suppose). But embedding only files that need to be edited in the
recovered system could be an acceptable and well-defined subset.</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
yes, we must make it very clear to the user that he is responsible<br />
to keep his backup in sync with his ReaR recovery system and<br />
that he can and should use "rear checklayout" to check it.</p>
<p>In general he should make an up-to-date backup<br />
when he made a new ReaR recovery system to be<br />
on the safe side or that he should in general make the<br />
backup and the ReaR recovery system at the same time<br />
in one single run to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>Simply put<br />
he should use "rear mkbackup" to be on the safe side<br />
or the equivalent for external backup tools i.e.<br />
"rear mkrescue &amp;&amp; make a new external backup".</p>

<p>Some external backup methods are executed from ReaR : looking at
<code>usr/share/rear/backup</code>, that's at least <code>BORG</code>, <code>DUPLICITY</code>, <code>TSM</code>.
Although it depends on the choice of terminology: maybe you consider
backups that are triggered from inside ReaR internal and leave the term
"external" only for backups that are taken completely outside ReaR.</p>

<p>I used the term "external backup" in a sloppy way when I basically<br />

<p>Regarding TSM backup via "rear mkbackup":<br />
I guess this is not often used by TSM users.<br />
I think most TSM users use a native TSM method to make their backup.<br />
I assume most TSM users have TSM integrated in whatever bigger stuff<br />
so they do their backups via that bigger stuff (e.g. whatever backup<br />
management solution or something like that).<br />
So I think that in most cases a TSM backup is made outside of ReaR.<br />
But I am not a TSM user so this is only a guess and I could be wrong.</p>

<p>I think in customer solution, TSM is used to backup data, and rear the
system (what is expected), but then rear is using TSM also to save the
rear backup.<br />
I think there is no solution to restore an OS in TSM like rear.</p>

<p>Sure, but the question was, is the TSM backup of system files made by

<blockquote>
<p>then rear is using TSM also to save the rear backup</p>

<p>Now I don't understand what you mean, is TSM used to save the recovery

<p>I am not a TSM user either, so I am interested in @bwelterl 's (or
@rmetrich 's) opinion, in case they know some representative sample of
ReaR + TSM users. Is the above true? As a counterexample, issue #2762
is from a user who found that he needed to modify
<code>usr/share/rear/backup/TSM/default/500_make_TSM_backup.sh</code>, so
presumably he is using ReaR to take TSM backup.</p>
<p>@xslima00 is my understanding correct that you take TSM backups of the
system by running <code>rear mkbackup</code> or <code>rear mkbackuponly</code> ?</p>

<p>@pcahyna</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>TSM backups can be triggered by Rear or outside of Rear control. In both
cases is backup incremental. So in case it´s triggered outside and
<code>rear mkbackup</code> in next hour (we use it like this) it will simply build
backup ISO and another incremental backup which finish within seconds
(just new ISO is uploaded to TSM server and very few files). Problem of
standalone TSM backup is you cannot boot from it. That´s why we use
Rear. In case of crash TSM admin restore ISO to some location, I will
boot from it and make rear restore (via TSM client).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2762">issue 2762</a> - in standard
situation there is no need to modify scripts. But we want to backup TSM
server itself to another TSM server. That´s why was necessary perform
workaround I described to force TSM client backup to correct server.</p>

<p>I believe we should leave this issue open. #2795 introduces detection
of inconsistency at recovery time, when it is a bit too late. The proper
fix would be to avoid inconsistency before it bites, by detecting it
during <code>mkrescue</code> &amp; <code>mkbackuponly</code> and ideally introducing a
<code>savelayout</code>-like command that one could use for consistency enforcement
when an external backup method is used instead of <code>mkbackuponly</code>.<br />
EDIT: which is basically what you wrote.</p>

<p>Regarding how to do a basic check that a backup via "rear
mkbackuponly"<br />
is consistent with a "rear mkrescue" that had been done before:</p>
<p>I noticed right now during "rear mkbackuponly"</p>
<pre><code># usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackuponly
...

<p>so it creates a current disk layout in .../tmp/backuplayout.conf<br />
because of</p>
<pre><code>DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf
</code></pre>
<p>in lib/mkbackuponly-workflow.sh<br />
but as far as I see on first glance it does not compare<br />
the current disk layout in .../tmp/backuplayout.conf<br />
with an existing disk layout in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf</p>
<p>I have no idea why "rear mkbackuponly" creates a disk layout at all<br />
but when it creates one anew which does not match an existing one<br />
in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf it indicates that something<br />
is wrong so "rear mkbackuponly" may error out to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>yes, this is a good idea and probably easy to do. Doing the opposite

above:</p>

commands detect a difference from the layout saved by the other
command, it is an inconsistency, thus abort.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>mkbackuponly</code> saves the layout under <code>$TMP_DIR</code> makes it
easier (we need to let it save to a persistent location and extend it).</p>
