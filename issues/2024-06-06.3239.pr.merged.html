<p>How was this pull request tested?<br />
    Together with the changes in #3175 , the backup&amp;recovery test
    make-backup-and-restore-iso passes when executed locally on Fedora
    rawhide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description of the changes in this pull request:<br />
    /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh in the
    rescue system examines systemd version in order to know whether it
    should use udev or load modules manually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, at least on Fedora, the systemd version can contain a
tilde (the systemd version is equal to the systemd package version,
which conforms to the Fedora conventions:
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Versioning/#_handling_non_sorting_versions_with_tilde_dot_and_caret">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Versioning/#_handling_non_sorting_versions_with_tilde_dot_and_caret</a>
) and the bash code that compares versions chokes on it on Fedora
rawhide, as the current systemd version in Fedora rawhide is
<code>256~rc3</code>:<br />
<code>/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh: line 24: [[: 256~rc3: syntax error in expression (error token is "~rc3")</code><br />
and then the wrong branch is taken.</p>
<p>This leads at least to non-working make-backup-and-restore-iso CI test
due to the ramdisk (brd) module being loaded earlier and thus not
respecting the desired parameters. (A ramdisk of a pre-determined size
is used to emulate the backup ISO in the test.) Probably has other
unwanted consequences as well.</p>
<p>As reasonably modern distros should have a newer systemd (even RHEL 7
has systemd 219 and Ubuntu 16.04 has 229), delete the check and error
out in a similar check during mkrescue if a too old systemd is
encountered.</p>
<p>The check in build/GNU/Linux/600_verify_and_adjust_udev.sh is more
robust, so it could be used as an alternative if desupporting old
systemd is not desired. The <code>version_newer</code> function would have to be
moved to a library available during boot, though, and the function does
not really check for a tilde in version, thus it appears to work more by
accident than by design.</p>

For me that whole CI stuff results (at least for now)<br />
a mental "too many indirections stack overflow exit"<br />

<p>I am sorry to be unhelpful here (at least for now)<br />

<p>@jsmeix @pcahyna I think that you can safely ignore that error as of

<p>I'd guess that this is related to the mirrorlist / YUM repos for CentOS
and/or a configuration error in the

<p>@jsmeix sorry for the somewhat hackish approach in <code>run-in-docker</code>. I
put it together to solve my problems (check something on all distros and
build packages for our master branch) and was hoping to see more ReaR
developers to make use of it.</p>
<p>About CentOS8, the <code>rpm-build</code> check of this PR also fails in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239/checks?check_run_id=25937084878">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239/checks?check_run_id=25937084878</a>
with this error:</p>
<pre><code>Error: Failed to download metadata for repo 'baseos': Cannot prepare internal mirrorlist: No URLs in mirrorlist
</code></pre>
<p>Which is why I believe there is a general CentOS8 problem that we just
experience here.</p>

<p>yes, I guess it is because CentOS 8 is EOL. @schlomo can you please
disable it in this test? and @jsmeix how were you able to locate the

<p>@schlomo<br />
yes, since your explanation in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2154680294">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2154680294</a><br />
I also think the root cause in this case<br />
is "something outside of ReaR"<br />
so we can - and should - just ignore it.</p>
<p>I think this particular case shows rather well<br />
what I had in mind when I wrote<br />
"too many indirections stack overflow exit".</p>
<p>We have our "own ReaR code" plus our "own CI code"<br />
(which is the only code we have under control).</p>
<p>But (at least some) CI tests depend on tons of<br />
other stuff outside of what is under our control<br />
(docker, OS images at third-party locations, whatnot...).</p>
<p>So when some CI test fails it is almost impossible<br />
to see directly if that failure is caused by a change<br />
in our own code - in particular whether or not a<br />
CI failure is caused by a change in our own ReaR code.</p>
<p>I think it is almost impossible because of a too high<br />
stack of indirections where most of that stack is<br />
outside of our control and - even worse - much of that<br />
stack is located at various third-party locations.</p>
<p>So in practice it means CI failures are mostly<br />
meaningless to decide if a change in our own ReaR code<br />
is good or bad because in most cases CI failures<br />
are not caused by a change in our own ReaR code<br />
but instead by somthing outside of our control<br />
on an arbitrary third-party location.</p>
<p>This makes it rather questionable whether or not<br />
the CI stuff is actually helpful for us in practice.</p>
<p>In the end it is the same basic question as it<br />
had been with those automated ShellCheck stuff.</p>
<p>When automated tests result too many false positives<br />
those automated tests do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I think more than one or two percent false positives<br />
is already when it does more harm than good.</p>
<p>When for each pull request 10 automated tests are run<br />
and each on has 98% reliability, then the overall<br />
reliability is only 82% (0.98 ^ 10 = 0.817)<br />
so every 5th CI failure is a false positive.</p>
<p>To have 98% overall reliability (for 10 CI tests)<br />
each one must have 99.8% reliability<br />
(0.998 ^ 10 = 0.980).</p>
<p>With "reliability" I mean that a failing CI test<br />
correctly indentifies an issue in our own code.</p>

<p>@jsmeix BTW, when using the <code>run-in-docker</code> tool locally it looks much
nicer than on CI:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/101384/3fb4bab5-d50a-494c-ac17-ecd3276f4eaa">https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/101384/3fb4bab5-d50a-494c-ac17-ecd3276f4eaa</a></p>
<p>(the upper part shows a completed section and the lower parts shows an
in-progress section. Section meaning patching the Docker image for a
distro to use.</p>
<p>And yes, I agree with your thoughts on CI and 3rd party dependencies.
OTOH I think it is useful to have as we can then see if a PR breaks
something that works on <code>master</code>, or - as in this case - we see that it
is the same broken as <code>master</code> and that we can therefore safely ignore
it.</p>

<p>Depends. Some of the failures are due only to external circumstances
breaking the test. But some are due to the OS evolving in a way that
breaks ReaR itself. (And this was the case for the CI failure that
triggered this PR.) In the latter case, we want to know about it,
because we need to fix it anyway.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I would like to discuss the future of the CI stuff (if you want, we can
move it to a separate issue).</p>
<p>I agree that false positives are bad, but I do not want to get back to a
state where even basic backup and recovery test on each PR should be
tested manually by the submitter. I would thus like to put some effort
into improving the reliability of the CI so that it is "green" most of
the time and any "red" result most likely represents an actual bug
(although the bug can be due to unrelated changes in the distro that we
test on, sure, but even that we need to know about).</p>
<p>First of all, we have the rpm-build:opensuse-tumbleweed-x86_64 build
test. Would you agree to removing it? I thought that it might be useful
for you, but among the builds it seems to be the one that fails the most
often. And for software that is not compiled, like ReaR, a build test is
of limited use anyway, since there will be few build failures (no syntax
errors to be caught by the compiler).</p>
<p>Second, I will disable the koji-build checks, I found that I only rarely
use them (they produce RPMs that can be easily installed on a system,
but I build my own if I need to anyway).</p>
<p>Third, the fedora-rawhide tests are prone to fail because of entirely
unrelated breakage in Fedora that occurs form time to time, like
recently. One can expect it to happen many times a year, so this will
not pass your "2%" criterion. Let's disable the Fedora Rawhide test
then.</p>
<p>Last, there is now a test failure when recovering F40 and Rawhide,
discussed in more detail in #3175 . This may well be due to a real
problem in ReaR or in the distro, as it is 100% reproducible in the CI
environment. But since Testing Farm does not provide any good way to
debug it (console logs are incomplete), I will disable also the Fedora
40 tests until I debug the problem.</p>
<p>There will always be test failures due to changes outside our control,
but we should first focus on eliminating flakiness/temporary breakage
and then we can focus on tests where the failures are
reliable/persistent. Even if they are due to changes outside of our
control, we still need to adapt to them or report bugs at their source,
so such tests are still valuable for us and we should act on the
results.</p>
<p>At the end, there will be some cases where the test fails reliably
because of a change that breaks only the test script and not ReaR, and
the test will need to be fixed. This is extra maintenance work that is
the price for having a working CI and IMO this price is acceptable.</p>
<p>WDYT?</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
I fully agree to disable at least for now all CI stuff<br />
that currently does not reasonably reliably produce<br />
actually helpful results for us.</p>
<p>In general regarding openSUSE Tumbleweed<br />
see what I wrote about it starting at<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L3862">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L3862</a></p>
<pre><code>In theory ReaR 2.7 should work on openSUSE Tumbleweed but in practice
arbitrary failures could happen at any time because the Tumbleweed
distribution is a pure rolling release version of openSUSE containing the
latest stable versions of all software
(cf. https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) so arbitrary changes of any
software are possible at any time that could arbitrarily break how ReaR works.
</code></pre>
<p>The "arbitrary changes of any software are possible at any time"<br />
also means that building RPMs on openSUSE Tumbleweed cannot<br />
reasonably reliably produce actually helpful results for us.<br />
So yes, please disable all openSUSE Tumbleweed related stuff.</p>
<p>I cannot comment on the koji-build checks<br />
because I don't know what they are good for<br />
so from my personal (in this case ignorant) point of view<br />
feel free to disable them as you think what is best.</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
what I would prefer - if possible - is that our CI tests<br />
run in stable environments that are under our control.</p>
<p>In particular I would prefer - if possible - using<br />
fixed OS versions for our CI tests.<br />
For example - if possible - by using fixed OS images<br />
of stable OS versions that we keep in our 'rear' space<br />
at GitHub under our control: First and foremost<br />
the stable enterprise Linux distributions RHEL and SLES<br />
plus optionally also stable Debian or Ubuntu "LTS" versions<br />
provided someone could maintain ReaR for Debian or Ubuntu.</p>

<p>@jsmeix Koji is the Fedora build system and this check builds scratch
packages the same way as the official Fedora packages would then be
built. In practice, I think that there is not enough differences from
the <code>rpm-build</code> tests, which use Copr (another build system) to expect
that there would be problems uncovered by one that are not also
uncovered by the other. I wanted to use the RPMs build this way in test
automation that expects Koji builds and input, but I have found myself
very rarely, if ever, doing that. The builds are in fact very reliable,
but since they are not very useful, I will eliminate them to reduce
visual clutter in the result list.</p>
<p>Regarding opensuse, I see that there is <code>opensuse-leap-15.3-x86_64</code>
build configured now, which does not appear in the results, probably
because Copr does not know this target anymore (it knows
<code>opensuse-leap-15.5-x86_64</code> and <code>opensuse-leap-15.4-x86_64</code>). If you
want, I can update it. Beware though, it will need updating in a similar
way in the future, and also I saw the opensuse builds failing several
times for reasons entirely unrelated to ReaR or even opensuse itself, so
false positives are more likely than for other builds.</p>

<p>As we discuss CI builds here... my thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I really would love to have build automation that can run both
    locally on my machine and in the Cloud. That gives me significantly
    faster cycle times for changes and allows me to debug problems
    happening in the Cloud in my local setup. <code>tools/run-in-docker.sh</code>
    was born out of that thought and it creates our snapshot builds.
    That is also the reason why I find OBS, Koji or other Cloud-only
    build environments less useful</li>
<li>I see value in continuously building and testing against unknown
    Linux distro versions, because that gives us an early warning for
    problems that our users might be facing tomorrow.</li>
<li>Yes, there is - and will be - a permanent risk of such builds
    failing for external, e.g. non-ReaR, reasons. IMHO this is an
    accepted risk and in the end we still benefit more from the
    continued validation than what we suffer from the flaky builds. For
    me this is a trade-off decision where I choose the information
    provided or confirmation supplied by these builds.</li>
<li>Finally, yes we should keep investing into stabilizing our builds
    and reducing the external influence on the build results - but not
    at the expense of staying back.</li>
</ol>
<p>HTH, and maybe we move this to a dedicated issue with specific
suggestions?</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
don't worry about openSUSE CI build tests.<br />
I cannot care about them (no time for that).<br />
I.e. feel free to disable all of them.</p>
<p>In particular for SUSE (i.e. SLES) users they are meaningless<br />
(SLES users get their RPMs directly from SUSE).</p>
<p>When needed I try to fix build issues<br />
e.g. the last one was<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3235">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3235</a><br />
in the openSUSE Build Service (OBS)<br />
project "Archiving:Backup:Rear"<br />
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear">https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear</a><br />
which is the traditional place<br />
where we (i.e. ReaR upstream) build packages<br />
which is the "officially documented place" at<br />
<a href="http://relax-and-recover.org/download/">http://relax-and-recover.org/download/</a></p>

<p>@jsmeix the problem I see with OBS, e.g.
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7">https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7</a>
is that it seems like we don't really maintain that any more. At least
the Debian 12 and xUbuntu builds are failed and therefore users would
have a problem if they need those packages.</p>
<p>For the next ReaR release I would therefore like to rely on automation
that runs in GitHub and where it is simpler for all of us maintainers to
see what is going on or to make changes. And where all the configuration
for the builds is in our ReaR git repo and a change &amp; push to it will
effect the change.</p>
<p>For distro supported packages targeting SLES and RHEL and Fedora I of
course expect the vendors to keep their official build infra up and
running, but I wouldn't expect any other packages to come out of that.</p>
<p>For snapshot builds of <code>master</code> I would in turn expect the distros to
not care and to supply all of the snapshot packages from our GitHub
Releases page.</p>
<p>For a release I would expect to also provide release packages via our
GitHub Releases (and GH actions automation), similar to the snapshots.</p>
<p>And, I'm happy to keep an eye on that stuff and to keep working on the
build automation that runs on GH actions.</p>

<p>I see negative value in continuously building and testing<br />
against unknown Linux distro versions<br />
because of the "unknown".<br />
Who should continuously care about continuously failing<br />
building and testing against unknown Linux distro versions?<br />
@schlomo<br />
when you continuously care about what you ask for<br />
all is OK for me.<br />
I cannot - no time for that.</p>

<p>@jsmeix yes, I also want to solve the "no time" and "rotting systems"
problem. So my suggestion is that</p>
<ol>
<li>the distro / vendor build systems cover "their" distros and you
    (@jsmeix and @pcahyna) take care of that and the fact that it exists
    means that somebody cares about it.</li>
<li>here on the GitHub page we build everything and care less because it
    is all based on best effort and if it is broken then eventually
    somebody will fix it.</li>
</ol>

regarding build failures in OBS<br />
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear">https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear</a><br />
for non-(open)SUSE distributions:</p>
<p>As I wrote above<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2173727926">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2173727926</a></p>
<pre><code>When needed I try to fix build issues
e.g. the last one was
https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3235

</code></pre>
<p>I try to fix build issues as far as I can justify<br />
also for non-(open)SUSE distributions but there<br />
my efforts are very limited because I am not paid<br />
by non-SUSE distributions.</p>
<p>In particular regarding Ubuntu I am very reluctant<br />
because Ubuntu has a commercial distributor but<br />
it seems Canonical is not interested in supporting<br />
us at ReaR upstream so they get what they pay for.</p>
<p>openSUSE and in particular the openSUSE Build Service is<br />
a public and free (both as in freedom and in free beer)<br />
project where Ubuntu ReaR users could (and should)<br />
contribute. They get what they contribute.</p>
<p>Because any Ubuntu user could contribute and fix the<br />
Ubuntu build failures in the openSUSE Build Service,<br />
I feel I have no right to "simply remove" their<br />
currently failing Ubuntu ReaR source packages.</p>
