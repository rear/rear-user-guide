<p>In my view, all of these should not raise concerns even for the casual
user, with the following exceptions, which indicate that something
should be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ReaR should probably not mess with the <code>/run</code> temporary file system:
        stat: cannot stat '/run/user/121/gvfs': Permission denied
        stat: cannot stat '/run/user/7002/gvfs': Permission denied

<p>A process supposed to be killed doesn't exist:

</li>
</ul>
<p>I have checked other <code>type</code> invocations throughout ReaR. They all use
either <code>-p</code>, <code>-P</code>, or <code>-t</code> (all of which do not produce stderr
messages), or they redirect <code>stderr</code> to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p>

<p>@OliverO2<br />
on a quick first glance I do not like your proposed changes here<br />
because as far as I understand it they basically fully contradict<br />
my intentions behind<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416</a>
and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498</a><br />
and go back to the state before - as far as I currently see - i.e.<br />
back to misleading false alarm messages by default in the log<br />
and as a consequence special coding at each and every code place<br />
where some program might output some false alarm message on stderr.</p>
<p>I try to have a closer look as time permits but possibly it gets delayed
until eternity<br />
because I do not want to spend any more minute of my precious time with
general<br />
issues what ReaR outputs where under what conditions in which specific
way<br />
because I think there is no right solution for all users so such issues
go on and on<br />
and re-appear again and again ad infinitum and ad nauseam and in the
end<br />
it only wastes energy and health of all involved people.</p>
<p>@gdha @rmetrich @pcahyna and all @rear/contributors<br />
I would much appreciate it if you find some time and have a closer look
here.<br />
Feel free to proceed as you like and as you think it is best for ReaR.</p>
<p>In general (except exceptions) I will not further deal with such kind of
issues.<br />
I may - as time permits - further explain my intentions behind<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416</a>
and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498</a><br />
if things are not yet sufficiently clear to help you to decide what to
do.</p>

<p>@jsmeix I have invested considerable time into this PR (it took a lot of
searching). This was an attempt to address your valid concerns but it
feels like the road is blocked. In addition, unfortunately, I see no
empathy to also address my concerns. Sorry to see that we could not find
a more constructive path here.</p>

<p>@OliverO2<br />
I think you misunderstood what I meant.</p>
<p>I want to make it possible to move this issue forward in a constructive
way.<br />
Therefore I moved myself out of the way to not block anything here.<br />
Because I have a contradicting opinion compared to yours I leave it to
others to decide.<br />
I did not set me as assignee or reviewer here so others are free to do
what they think is best.<br />
I wrote "on a quick first glance / as far as I understand / as I
currently see" to indicate<br />
that what I wrote is not a thorougly thought decision but only my first
impression<br />
so others who decide should not consider it as some authoritative
judgement.</p>
<p>Regarding "no empathy":<br />
I think my refusing wording was misunderstood as "no empathy" but I did
not mean that.<br />
I only mean that I refuse to spend more time with those kind of
issues.<br />
I think you cannot imagine how much time I wasted in more than 20
years<br />
(hundreds of hours worktime that cost me thousands of hours lifetime)<br />
with various kind of "usability" or "user experience" issues (almost
none related to ReaR)<br />
where there was no right solution for all users so such issues went on
and on<br />
and re-appeared again and again ad infinitum and ad nauseam and in the
end<br />
they only wasted lots of energy and health of all involved people.<br />
So to procet myself and my health I decided some years ago<br />
to no longer waste time with usability/UX issues.<br />
This does not mean I completely ignore usability/UX.<br />
I intend to provide reasonably well usability/UX.<br />
But I do no longer waste time with "only usability/UX" issues.<br />
When usability/UX is really bad the root cause is basically always<br />
a real bug and real bugs get fixed.</p>
<p>Regarding "also address my concerns":<br />
I think what went wrong here is that this pull request is an
implementation<br />
but what should have had happened before is mutual understanding<br />
of your concerns and my concerns.<br />
I.e. we have now an implementation (that you like but I do not like)<br />
but not yet a common understanding of what the actual problem is.</p>
<p>Regarding what the actual problem is:<br />
I think the actual problem is that when ReaR errors out in non-debug
modes<br />
it only shows the ReaR error message but no message from the failed
program<br />
so it is hard to understand what the root cause is why ReaR did error
out.</p>
<p>If my understanding of the actual problem is right<br />
then what is needed is that when ReaR errors out in non-debug modes<br />
it shows the ReaR error message plus messages from the failed program<br />
to make it easier to understand what the root cause is why ReaR did
error out.</p>
<p>So what is needed is not to have stderr in any case in the log but<br />
what is needed is to get messages from the failed program<br />
if and only if ReaR errors out.</p>
<p>If this can be implemented it should fix the specific actual problem
here<br />
and it does not show possibly false alarm messages when ReaR does not
error out.</p>
<p>My totally untested off the top of my head idea<br />
(the idea came to me during last night so sleeping over an issue always
helps)<br />
is based on</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND ... 2&gt;&gt;"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" || Error "..."

which shows possibly false alarm messages when ReaR does not error out<br />
that might be further enhanced to work somehow like</p>
<pre><code># function Error () { cat /tmp/current.stderr ; echo "Error: $@" ; }

# grep -Q welcome /etc/issue 2&gt;/tmp/current.stderr || Error "grep failed with $?"
grep: invalid option -- 'Q'
Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
Try 'grep --help' for more information.
Error: grep failed with 2

# grep -q welcome /etc/issue 2&gt;/tmp/current.stderr || Error "grep failed with $?"
Error: grep failed with 1

# grep -i welcome /etc/issue 2&gt;/tmp/current.stderr || Error "grep failed with $?"
Welcome to \S - Kernel \r (\l).
</code></pre>
<p>It cannot be used as is in ReaR because in debug modes stderr must
append to the log<br />
but the above writes stderr into another file so I need to think more
about it...<br />
I wished something like</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND ... 2&gt;SPECIAL_FILE || Error "..."
</code></pre>
<p>where SPECIAL_FILE appends to the log in debug modes<br />
and in non-debug modes is is a normal file where the Error function
could extract things.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should redirect in non-debug modes strderr in general<br />
into a separated normal file where the Error function could extract
things<br />
so in non-debug modes the ReaR log cannot contain possibly false alarm
messages<br />
but in non-debug modes stderr of all programs is still available for the
Error function<br />
to extract some latest stderr messages.</p>
<p>Because stderr messages could contain sensitive information<br />
cf.
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416#issuecomment-855960979">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416#issuecomment-855960979</a><br />
that normal file would have to be deleted in any case when ReaR
finishes<br />
regardless how ReaR finishes i.e. also when ReaR errors out<br />
because that normal file would contain all stderr messages of all
programs<br />
and not only the last ones of the failed program that let ReaR error
out.</p>

<p>@jsmeix<br />
Thank you for taking the time to answer. Briefly, because it's slightly
late:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it would be difficult to go ahead with ReaR without your
    backing since you are the one who takes care of most issues.</li>
<li>Yes, I might not fully understand what your motivation was as all I
    had was your opinion as stated. I could not find detailed examples
    about which stderr messages were specifically annoying you.
    Regarding wasted hours on usability issues: It is possible that I
    can relate, having had similar experiences (most people have those
    in one way or the other). Without concrete examples I cannot know.</li>
<li>What I perceived as "no empathy" was not a rejection as such, but a
    rejection without addressing my arguments. When there is a conflict,
    I see no problem when people decide to not agree (hey, we are
    grown-ups). The problem is when it appears that one party does not
    address, but seemingly ignores, the other party's stated arguments.
    I gave concrete examples for my concerns, and a proof of concept to
    address yours. So when I say, for example, I cannot focus properly
    when <code>rear -d mkrescue</code> dumps lots of output lines at me, this is
    apparently important to me and should deserve a reaction.</li>
<li>With respect to the actual problem: Erroring out without giving a
    precise cause is one side of the issue. The other (and larger side)
    is errors which ReaR does not catch and which would compromise the
    result (i.e. produce a non-working rescue system). There is no way
    to foresee the possible conditions. A quick glance over the logfile
    (if it contains complete stderr output) is a way to safeguard
    against this. Separating stderr into an additional log file would
    break the association between logged ReaR actions and stderr output.
    It would also not really address your concerns, because when it's
    there, people will look into it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not look likely that ReaR is on a path where I could continue to
rely on it the way I need to. So I have decided to create an internal
fork just for my use cases based on commit 2433c72f. I have already
heavily modified the code to simplify it and increase usability (at
least for me). The downside is that I can no longer track upstream
developments. But in the end, this helps me to better allocate
resources. Hopefully, it also helps you to proceed with what you find
necessary to support ReaR in the future.</p>

<p>@OliverO2 Disputes are normal and very human, however, for this alone
leaving the project is hard and we cannot and will not stop you of doing
that. You will fix your problems in the short run, but over a couple of
months when we release a new major version of ReaR you may regret it. We
try to find a way in reasonable solutions and/or fixes that does not
break anything and we know even then we break our code sometimes. As you
said there are only a few key contributors for the moment (like @jsmeix
and @pcahyna who are trying to get the code to work under all
circumstances after years of adding new features without seeing the
bigger picture).<br />
For that reason alone I'm in favor of a grand cleanup and trimming
unneeded features - by way of speaking go back to the core.<br />
That being said @OliverO2 it is with sad feelings that we see you
leaving the upstream project, but we welcome you back anytime with
pleasure.</p>

<p>@gdha Thank you for your kind words. Let me assure you that my decision
is not a knee-jerk reaction to that dispute. As you say, disputes are
normal (and even healthy), we have had those before, and it is not
something in general to worry about. This one went a bit astray but not
necessarily to the extent that we could not have resolved it in one way
or another.</p>
<p>My concern in this case is the limited time I have available, and the
characteristics of changes I needed to use rear safely and confidently.
While unused code in plugins was never an issue for me (it just sits
there), usability was not good enough. The required changes deeply
affect existing ReaR code, and contradict what I perceived as the
prevalent philosophy guiding ReaR at this time.</p>
<p>I am aware that this has a downside, cutting me off from bug fixes and
added functionality I might find useful. But doing so anyway also shows
my confidence that much of ReaR (at least the way I am using it) has
become pretty mature over time and does not require lots of maintenance.</p>
<p>Anyway, contributing for a couple of years has been a pleasure and ReaR
has mostly been a pretty welcoming project with respect to
contributions.</p>
<p>Regarding your thoughts on cleanup, yes, consolidation is always a good
idea as it makes the code base more manageable. I cannot say much about
plugins as they did not really affect me (they might affect you when
dealing with issues and testing releases, though). What I would consider
in addition is to remove duplicate functionality, such as two sets of
Btrfs code, two methods for disk sizing, and possibly others.</p>

<p>@OliverO2 @jsmeix Do not get it wrong that we close this PR as we see no
outcome on an acceptable PR by all involved parties.<br />
@OliverO2 It is with a sad feeling that we see an important and hard
working contributor leaving, but that is part of a life-time of an Open
Source project. We stay positive and it is as you already mentioned -
ReaR is mature enough to survive the storm...</p>

<p>I think
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633</a><br />
provides - at least most of - what is wanted by this pull request here<br />
but without having possibly inexplicable stdout/stderr messages<br />
in the log in non-debug modes.<br />
So I think
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633</a><br />
obsoletes this one - at least to a sufficiently large extent in
practice.</p>
