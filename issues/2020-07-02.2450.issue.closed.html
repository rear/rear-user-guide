<p>Hello,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is that possible to boot REAR from only rescue ISO and after running
    download backup file from HTTP Server in external network?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was looking for the first option but it would be great to support
    AWS S3 buckets and target and source place for backup. What do you
    think?</p>

<p>Regarding using Amazon S3 like cloud storage buckets we had<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2400">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2400</a></p>
<p>Currently there is no support for AWS S3 buckets in ReaR<br />
and according to
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2400">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2400</a><br />
it seems it is not easily possible to successfully<br />
mount Amazon S3 like cloud storage buckets<br />
from within the ReaR recovery system.</p>
<p>I am not an Amazon Web Services (AWS) user and in particular<br />
I am not an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) user<br />
so I cannot actually help with "Simple Storage Service" issues.<br />
But as its name tells I suggest to "simply" ask the makers of<br />
that "Simple Storage Service" how to "simply" mount their<br />
"Simple Storage Service" from within a simple system<br />
that simply runs inside a simple ramdisk ;-)</p>
<p>Seriously:<br />
According to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2400#issuecomment-631280520">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2400#issuecomment-631280520</a><br />
it seems the actual problem with mounting Amazon S3 buckets<br />
from within the ReaR recovery system is to somehow get<br />
"enough disk space for used as cache or (temporary) directory for
s3fs"<br />
available inside the recovery system.</p>

<p>In general regarding downloading a backup file from the network<br />
there is the problem where to store the dowloaded huge backup file<br />
inside the ReaR recovery system that runs only in a ramdisk.</p>
<p>The current methods that are implemented in ReaR do not download<br />
the whole backup file.<br />
Instead a "network storage thingy" (e.g. a NFS share) is mounted<br />
at a mountpoint directory inside the ReaR recovery system<br />
so that the actual backup file remains at its network storage place<br />
and becomes only accessible from within the ReaR recovery system.</p>
<p>This way during backup restore the backup file data is only streamed<br />
from its network storage place down into the ReaR recovery system<br />
so on the ReaR recovery system only some small buffer space is needed.</p>

<p>I think the ReaR man page is a bit confusing about<br />
what <code>http</code> actually means in ReaR.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc</a><br />
reads (excerpts)</p>
<pre><code>Currently Relax-and-Recover supports ... a variety of network protocols
(incl. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup
</code></pre>
<p>that looks as if both "OUTPUT_URL=http" and "BACKUP_URL=http"<br />
would be supported but "man rear" only tells about</p>
<pre><code>OUTPUT_URL=http://
    Write the image using lftp and the HTTP (PUT) procotol.
OUTPUT_URL=https://
    Write the image using lftp and the HTTPS (PUT) protocol.
</code></pre>
<p>but nothing about "BACKUP_URL=http" which shows that<br />
only "OUTPUT_URL=http" but not "BACKUP_URL=http"<br />
is supported.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your comments.</p>
<p>@jsmeix OK. S3 doesn't work. Http download is not possible due to small
ramdisk.<br />
I was wondering if there is any other options to download backup from
WAN network and use it in rear.<br />
Or, only way is create some local storage like CIFS or NFS.</p>
<p>@gozora Yes, i used this option and it was good but in my case if I boot
iso without backup everything is fine, but if I boot ISO with backup
I've got error - Failed to load ldlinux.c32<br />
I guess the reason of this error is that I boot using iPXE (sanboot
method there I use ISO as source) and maybe ISO is too large.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My general use case is to restore backup on machine without any
    storage in any network - that's why I wanted to use HTTP or S3
    because I was able to boot REAR Rescue CD with iPXE via WAN network
    and now I need backup - but it looks like that this is not possible
    without any local storage :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about BORG? I can use there some SSH connection - Can I use
    BORG in public network and somehow it mount backup? I don't know -
    just thinking loudly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My backup is like 2GB- maybe it will be 3-4. Machine has 8gb ram -
    is that possible to use bigger ramdisk and somehow WGET backup to
    machine and restore?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I vaguely remember there is some sophisticated method<br />
by using an intermediate filesystem (I think it was FUSE)<br />
how one could mount things on a usual HTTP server<br />
provided the HTTP server supports certain HTTP methods.</p>

<p>Hmmm...<br />
I wonder why in general a simple pipe like</p>
<pre><code>HTTP_DOWNLOAD_COMMAND | BACKUP_RESTORE_COMMAND

<p>should not work?</p>

<p>If SSH is an option for you (you have SSH connection available from AWS
to sever holding your ReaR backup), you can certainly use Borg which
works primarily over SSH. But be aware that when <code>rear recover</code> is
triggered, it does not mount your data, but uses
<a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/extract.html"><code>borg extract ...</code></a>
instead.</p>

<p>Ok. Thanks, guys for your input.</p>
<p>Based on you comments I'm going to change a little bit my approach.</p>
<p>I will restore from USB. So, I will create bootable USB with REAR Rescue
(without backup). Then, I have USB Storage for backup, right? I'd like
to create bash script with get the latest backup via HTTP from server
and save it USB and then REAR restore it</p>
<p>Is that possible? Do you see any obstacles?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can I add some custom script to execute during start to REAR
    somehow?</p>

<p>USB Storage is available in REAR for download backup from HTTP

<p>Can I add some additional software to rear? How? I guess, I need

I meant something like hacking as an initial experimental test<br />
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh<br />
and replace therein in the <code>tar</code> case the hardcoded
<code>dd if=$restore_input</code><br />
by a HTTP download program call (e.g. <code>curl</code>) as appropriate in your
case<br />
(provided you use <code>BACKUP=NETFS</code> with its default <code>tar</code>).</p>

when you use OUTPUT=USB<br />
why don't you then also use BACKUP_URL=usb://...<br />
which is the usual and recommended way how to use USB, cf.<br />
<a href="http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started">http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started</a></p>
<p>But using a bootable disk device for the ReaR recovery system<br />
has a generic drawback, see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854</a></p>
<p>By default "BACKUP_URL=usb" does not behave compatible<br />
with how "BACKUP_URL=nfs" behaves, see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164</a></p>
<p>And there are other special issues with USB,<br />
for example see
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2171">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2171</a><br />
and
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1738">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1738</a>
and others.</p>
<p>The root cause is that the whole USB stuff is basically<br />
some kind of "add-on hack" for a special use case<br />
that is not well integrated with how the rest of ReaR works,<br />
see in particular

<p>Yes, it can use USB as Backup but my goal is more complex.</p>
<p>I have to create flow (bash script) which check backup on USB (if this
is latest) and in case if this is not the latest then I will check
backup on HTTP server, download it to USB STICK and then restore this
latest backup. I will be creating backups in other places and restore in
other place. That's why I need to get latest version from server.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is that possible?</p>
<p>That's why I want to use USB now, and need possibility to download
latest and place in USB. Do you see any issues?</p>

<p>@matekubi<br />
there is no package manager in ReaR.<br />
The only thing is ReaR's RequiredSharedObjects function (cf.
default.conf).<br />
But when you need to copy a runtime environment for an interpreded
programming language<br />
into the ReaR recovery system you need to find the needed files on your
own.<br />
On an RPM based Linux distribution <code>rpm -q --requires</code> could help a bit.</p>

offhandedly I see no issue when you replace an existing backup file<br />
with another one (e.g. a newer one) provided it is the same file name<br />
(and of course provided it is the same backup file type, e.g. a
<code>tar.gz</code>),<br />

to automate such things we have PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT<br />
and PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT (cf. default.conf).<br />
I would make an appropriate script and put it e.g. into /etc/rear<br />
so that the script gets automatically copied into the recovery system<br />
(cf. usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh)<br />
or place the script elsewhere and specify it via COPY_AS_IS<br />
and call such a script via PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT<br />
and/or PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT as appropriate.</p>

<li>Regarding issues mentioned by you with USB:</li>
</ol>
<p>When I will use:<br />
OUTPUT=USB<br />
BACKUP_URL=usb://...<br />
Still, I will face those issues with changing letters for drives etc?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>So, maybe still is the better option boot rescue cd by PXE, run
    REAR, then attach USB and download backup from WWW server?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from HTTP there is also info about FTP support - maybe it is
    better option to download backup?<br />
    But still I don't have place in memdisk to extract it and restore -
    also here I can use USB.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was wondering what can be the easiest and safe way to achieve my
goals....</p>

<p>@matekubi<br />
in any case (i.e. regardless where the backup of your files is)<br />
when you boot the ReaR recovery system from a disk device<br />
you could be hit by
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854</a><br />
in particular with newest kernels because of<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2254">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2254</a></p>
<p>I myself was never hit by
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854</a><br />
but we do have evidence that a USB device can become /dev/sda<br />
on the replacement hardware, see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854#issuecomment-403015226">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854#issuecomment-403015226</a><br />
that points to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271</a></p>
<p>Therefore to be more on the safe side against
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854</a><br />
I think it is better to boot the ReaR recovery system not from a disk
device<br />
but plug in a (removable / USB) disk after the ReaR recovery system was
booted<br />
as temporary storage where the backup could be downloaded to.</p>
<p>But when you have now your backup on a <code>/dev/sdc</code> USB disk<br />
there perhaps on the first partition /dev/sdc1 as backup.tar.gz<br />
you need to mount that in the ReaR recovery system<br />
e.g. mount /dev/sdc1 at /current_backup/$HOSTNAME<br />
(you may need a $HOSTNAME sub-directory because<br />
the backup_path function in usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh<br />
indicates that NETFS_PREFIX="$HOSTNAME" is appended)<br />
and then you need to modify /etc/rear/local.conf in the ReaR recovery
system<br />
so that the variables that specify where the actual backup is<br />
(e.g. you may set BACKUP_URL=file:///current_backup)<br />
because otherwise 'rear recover' would try to get the backup<br />
from the old/outdated/unaccessible loaction.</p>
<p>I verified right now that with <code>BACKUP_URL=file:///other/backup</code><br />
(I have a separated filesystem mounted at /other) one gets</p>
<pre><code>root@linux-h9wr # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
...
Using backup archive '/other/backup/linux-h9wr/backup.tar.gz'
</code></pre>
<p>so a $HOSTNAME sub-directory is automatically appended<br />
and during "rear recover" with <code>BACKUP_URL=file:///other/backup</code><br />
a file /other/backup/linux-h9wr/backup.tar.gz must be there<br />
so if backup.tar.gz is directly on a USB disk partition /dev/sdc1<br />
that partition would have to be mounted at /other/backup/linux-h9wr/<br />
or as in my case (I have a separated filesystem mounted at /other)<br />
the backup is created in backup/linux-h9wr/backup.tar.gz<br />
in that filesystem so that during "rear recover" the same mount<br />
(i.e. that filesystem mounted at /other) is expected.</p>

<p>When you have sufficient RAM you may mount a <code>tmpfs</code>.<br />
(<code>tmpfs</code> is a filesystem in RAM).</p>
<p>For example as a test I did right now on my original system</p>
<pre><code># mkdir /mnt/mytmpfs

# mount -o size=123M -t tmpfs none /mnt/mytmpfs/

# df -h
Filesystem     Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
...
none           123M     0  123M   0% /mnt/mytmpfs

# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/mytmpfs/urandom.stuff bs=1M status=progress
67108864 bytes (67 MB, 64 MiB) copied, 1 s, 66.7 MB/s
dd: error writing '/mnt/mytmpfs/urandom.stuff': No space left on device
124+0 records in
123+0 records out
128974848 bytes (129 MB, 123 MiB) copied, 1.94111 s, 66.4 MB/s

# ls -lh /mnt/mytmpfs/
total 123M
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 123M Jul  3 17:21 urandom.stuff

# umount /mnt/mytmpfs/
</code></pre>
<p>I assume the same should also work inside the ReaR recovery system.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>I was working on the implementation above cases - we will which one is
better for me.</p>
<p>I have a side question:</p>
<p>GOAL: Restore backup created on AWS EC2 to a physical machine.</p>
<ol>
<li>I've created REAR RESCUE with the backup inside (USB) on a physical
    machine.</li>
<li>I've restored this backup on the same machine from USB - everything
    works fine - no issues witch changing drive letters.</li>
<li>Now - my goal will be building backup zip on cloud machine - AWS EC2
    and restore it on physical.</li>
<li>So, I've created ONLY BACKUP on AWS EC2 and then I've replaced
    backup zip on my USB - this Rescue USB has been created on a
    physical machine.</li>
<li>After replacing, I've started restore using USB stick created on a
    physical machine with backup zip create in the cloud.</li>
<li>Restore process was fine - no questions, no errors.</li>
<li>After reboot, I cannot boot machine. Even I don't see my CentOS in
    EFI list of bootable drives.</li>
</ol>
<p>What was wrong? Rescue CD also contains any system-specific data? Or
maybe during restore some changes in the backup are needed? Am I able to
fix it somehow?</p>
<p>My another approach will be create full-back with restore iso in EC2 and
then to restore in in physical machine. I hope it helps.</p>

<p>@matekubi<br />
does your USB stick with the ReaR recovery system on it boot in UEFI
mode?</p>
<p>I.e. did you "rear format" your USB stick for booting in UEFI mode<br />
whit a command of the form</p>
<pre><code># rear -D format -- -efi /dev/sdX
</code></pre>
<p>?</p>
<p>If you did not "rear format" your USB stick for booting in UEFI mode:</p>
<p>As far as I know it is in general not possible to boot an installation
system<br />
in BIOS mode (the ReaR recovery system is an installation system)<br />
and then install an UEFI bootloader for the target system.</p>
<p>I think the reason behind is that for a system that was booted in BIOS
mode<br />
UEFI related stuff (e.g. EFI variables and things like that) is not
accessible.</p>
<p>I assume in this case it did not work at the end of "rear recover"
during<br />
its "finalize" stage to let ReaR install an UEFI bootloader<br />
for the recreated target system.</p>
<p>It might work to <code>chroot /mnt/local</code> into the recreated target system<br />
and manually install its UEFI bootloader from within the target
system.<br />
I don't know if it can work to manually install an UEFI bootloader this
way.<br />
I think when an installation system was booted in BIOS mode<br />
it is impossible to install an UEFI bootloader for the target system.</p>

<p>Yes, I did format with EFI mode.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I was able to describe it cleary in above post:</p>
<p>But the problem I guess is: Amazon EC2 doesn't use EFI and there I've
created "only backup" zip, and now I'm trying to restore by using EFI
USB Stick (this stick was created on hardware, not Amazon EC2), before I
replace backup from EC2 with backup on local USB Stick.</p>
<p>So, backup.tar.gz was prepared on a non EFI system (Amazon EC2)<br />
Rescue USB was created by rear as EFI USB Stick, rescue bootable drive
was created also on EFI hardware BUT backup comes from EC2. I've
replaced it.</p>
<p>My goal will be to create a backup of a file system in the cloud and
restore it on the physical machine.</p>

<p>@matekubi</p>
<p>at the end of "rear recover" during its "finalize" stage<br />
when ReaR installs a bootloader for the recreated target system<br />
it is done via <code>chroot /mnt/local</code> into the recreated target system<br />
so that the bootloader is installed by calling the bootloader
installation tool<br />
of the restored target system with the restored bootloader config files
of the target system<br />
i.e. with the bootloader installation tool and its config files from the
original system,<br />
e.g. for GRUB2 BIOS bootloader installation see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh</a><br />
versus for UEFI bootloader installation see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh</a><br />
plus - as needed - e.g. additional UEFI related things like<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/675_install_shim.sh">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/675_install_shim.sh</a></p>
<p>So when you don't have already UEFI bootloader installation tools and
config files<br />
on your original system you can't get an UEFI bootloader installed on
the target system.</p>
<p>Switching from BIOS to UEFI is not something that "works out of the box"
in ReaR,<br />
cf. the section "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a></p>
<p>What you intend to do is a major system migration.</p>
<p>In general regarding system migration see<br />
<a href="http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html">http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html</a></p>
<p>I never migrated from BIOS to UEFI so the following is only an offhanded
guess:</p>
<p>First you need UEFI bootloader installation tools and config files on
your original system<br />
to be able to manually install a UEFI bootloader after "rear recover"
finished<br />
but still inside the running ReaR recovery system via
<code>chroot /mnt/local</code> into<br />
the recreated target system and then adapt the target system bootloader
config files<br />
as needed to migrate the recreated target system from BIOS to UEFI and<br />
afterwards install the target system bootloader.</p>
<p>But that would be only the bootloader migration from BIOS to UEFI.</p>
<p>There is also disk layout migration needed from BIOS to UEFI:</p>
<p>Usually a UEFI system requires an EFI System Partition (ESP)<br />
so your disklayout.conf from your original BIOS system won't have that<br />
and a UEFI system requires GPT partitioning but your original BIOS
system<br />
may still use MBR (a.k.a. MSDOS) partitioning (inspect your
disklayout.conf<br />
whether or not it contains <code>disk ... gpt</code> or still <code>msdos</code>) so you may
have to<br />
manually adapt your disklayout.conf to create GPT partitioning with an
ESP.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your comments. I was able to achieve another goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>In physical PC and AWS EC2 I use legacy bios - not UEFI.</li>
<li>I have created USB stick on physical PC</li>
<li>I have created backup zip on AWS EC2 machine.</li>
<li>From USB Stick with Rear I've booted system and replaced backup zip
    with backup zip from cloud.</li>
<li>Started rear recover</li>
<li>and.....</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything was able to restore backup but there is a problem with the
bootloader.<br />
The system is able to load bootloader after the restart but I can see
some errors:<br />

<p>FSTAB doesn't look good:

<p>It looks like that I'm close to the final solution - I hope.... :)</p>

<p>@matekubi<br />
in your initial<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2450#issue-650231346">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2450#issue-650231346</a><br />
you wrote</p>
<pre><code>ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):
Latest
</code></pre>
<p>but your recent<br />
<a href="https://pastebin.com/zenyTr8N">https://pastebin.com/zenyTr8N</a><br />
contradicts</p>
<pre><code>2020-07-15 16:34:39.138267461 Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git
</code></pre>
<p>So first and foremost actually use our latest ReaR upstream version<br />
which is ReaR version 2.6, cf.<br />
<a href="http://relax-and-recover.org/download/">http://relax-and-recover.org/download/</a><br />
or preferably use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code<br />
cf. "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recover">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recover</a></p>
<p>In general we at ReaR upstream do not support older ReaR versions, cf.<br />
<a href="http://relax-and-recover.org/support/">http://relax-and-recover.org/support/</a><br />
and in particular for SUSE Linux Enterprise see the section<br />
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a><br />
(I don't know about other Linux distributions).</p>
<p>We at ReaR upstream do not plain reject issues with older ReaR
versions<br />
(e.g. we may answer easy to solve questions also for older ReaR
versions)<br />
but we do not spend much time on issues with older ReaR versions
because<br />
we do not (and cannot) fix issues in released ReaR versions.</p>
<p>I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code<br />
because that is the only place where we at ReaR upstream fix issues.</p>
<p>Issues in released ReaR versions are not fixed by us (by ReaR
upstream).<br />
Issues in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR
upstream<br />
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with<br />
reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got ReaR.</p>
<p>In your<br />
