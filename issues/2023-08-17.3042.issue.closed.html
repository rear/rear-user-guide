<p>As of RHEL9, use_devicesfile in LVM seems to be enabled by default. The
devices file contains information on the allowed PVIDs.<br />
As we may be restoring on a different PV, the devices file needs to be
recreated prior to rebooting after the restore.</p>

<p>See also #2917 . I don't think one can do
<code>/usr/sbin/vgimportdevices -a</code>. The problem is, imagine you have several
volume groups. One for the system (rootvg) and one for data (datavg), on
different disks. Now you system is broken and you want to recover it,
but the data are unaffected and you want them to survive the recovery
procedure. For this, it is advisable to disconnect the data disks during
the recovery procedure to avoid being accidentally reformatting them.
But, as they are not connected, <code>/usr/sbin/vgimportdevices -a</code> will not
find datavg, therefore it will not add them to the devices file and when
you reboot after recovery with the disks attached again, they will not
be found by LVM and datavg will not be activated.<br />
I was thinking about some automated procedure to update only the
obsolete entries in lvmdevices and keep all others, but I have not found
anything simple. I therefore believe the only reliable solution is to
remove the devices file at the end of recovery, since running without it
is preferable to a broken system due to some fragile attempt at an
"ideal" solution.</p>

<p>@MiguelSanders is it a problem for you if the devices file is removed at
the end of recovery and thus missing from the recovered system?</p>

<p>@pcahyna Just a thought but can't we just merge
/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices from the recovery environment with the
actual /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices from the backup?</p>

<p>@MiguelSanders I thought about that too, but that would leave duplicate
entries in the resulting system.devices (old possibly invalid and new
valid) and every LVM command will then complain about it. It will not be
broken, but it will be quite annoying.</p>

<p>If by "merge" you mean something more sophisticated than merely
concatenate them (like using PVID as the merge key and removing
duplicates), I would love to do that, but there is no tool to perform
this ATM.</p>

<p>@pcahyna If we decided to disconnect unaffected VGs before we initiate
the recovery phase, we could still</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices inside the chroot after the
    recovery</li>
<li>Run vgimportdevices -a inside the chroot after the recovery.</li>
<li>Run vgimportdevices -a again once we have reattached the other PVs
    after we booted the recovered system. Importing existing VGs should
    be considered a BAU operation. I don't believe ReaR has to take any
    responsibility for this step.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively we could also do a simple merge of the (A)
/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices (from ramdisk) with the (B)
/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices (from chroot) as follows<br />
EXCLUDE=$(echo $(for i in $ ( cat A | grep PVID | awk '{print $4}' | cut
-d'=' -f2); do echo $i; done) | tr ' ' '|')<br />
cat B | grep PVID | grep -Ev "$EXCLUDE" &gt;&gt; A<br />
cp A B<br />
Of course, if we are missing PVs, LVM commands will complain about those
but I consider this a good thing as this will tell us that the LVM
layout of our recovered system differs from the source system and needs
to be amended/corrected.</p>
<p>I can give this a try tomorrow if you want.<br />
Let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>I see at least two problems with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>will the recovered system even boot if you reattach the data drives
    but the data VG will not be found? Usually systemd drops to
    emergency mode when volumes referenced from fstab can't be found.
    This could cause lots of admin frustration.</li>
<li>is it widely known that importing existing VGs is a BAU operation? I
    have encountered several bug reports already that show lack of
    awareness about the lvmdevices "feature" and its implications
    especially in case of moving content to new disk, including system
    cloning (and not just with ReaR).</li>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts and the offer to help. Writing a parser in
shell for this (undocumented) format was exactly what I wanted to avoid,
though, as I would consider it to be very fragile. For example, where
does the <code>print $4</code> in your awk statement come from? How do you know
that the thing you are interested in is the 4th column? You don't take
comments into account (although this does not seem to be a problem with
the usual file content, who knows what might appear in a comment).</p>
<p>As simplicity and reliability are my highest priorities (there is
already too much complicated and fragile code in ReaR making lots of
assumptions about how things look like), I strongly prefer to remove the
file, with simple concatenation and resulting duplicates (and warnings)
as the only viable alternative. Concatenation is not without its
pitfalls, though. Is it guaranteed that two files can be simply
concatenated like that with preserving the meaning of entries in both? A
simple problem like a missing terminal newline will ruin it. Or consider
this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>new version of LVM introduces a new incompatible format for the file</li>
<li>as it needs to support the old format in existing installations, it
    recognizes the new format using a header at the top</li>
<li>your system uses the old format, but your LVM tools are upgraded to
    ones that use the new format</li>
<li>you recover the system, the LVM tools create a new file in
    ramdisk (A) in the new format, but the file in chroot (B) remains in
    the old format</li>
<li>you concatenate them and the result is now broken, because it
    contains a mixture of entries in different formats</li>
</ul>
<p>There is even no guarantee that the file format supports concatenation
in the future - the format may be changed to something like a binary
database, XML, or JSON. Undocumented formats can be changed any time.</p>
<p>Last but not least, removal of the LVM devices file is not a solution
that I made up myself. It is one of the operations performed by
virt-sysprep as a preparation of a VM for cloning, so there is a prior
art. See the description of lvm-system-devices under
<a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/virt-sysprep.1.en#OPERATIONS">https://man.archlinux.org/man/virt-sysprep.1.en#OPERATIONS</a>
(it is marked with an asterisk, meaning that it is enabled by default).</p>

<p>@pcahyna I completely agree on the fact that the format might change at
any time. As long as there is no option to lvmdevices that could help
us, I also believe that the safest thing to do right now is to simply
remove the system.devices file.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>

<p>@MiguelSanders thank you for your review.</p>
<p>Indeed, if one wants to be perfect and keep correct lvmdevices, the
correct way to do it is to have some option of lvmdevices(8) or
vgimportdevices(8) that would do what we need without having to touch
the file ourselves (i.e. treat it as opaque, which is the right way of
dealing with undocumented and thus internal file formats).</p>
<p>I now realized that one such option (which does not rely on yet
unimplemented features of lvmdevices(8) or vgimportdevices(8)) could be
to keep the old lvmdevices in the rescue ramdisk. This way, the pvcreate
commands will update it with new IDs, while keeping the old entries. We
could then copy it to the recovered chroot at the end.</p>
<p>This approach is not without its own problems. The file could not have
come from backup, since we recreate the layout before extracting the
backup. It would need to be embedded in the ramdisk (in upstream ReaR it
is actually already there). This would be a problem if the file changes
between creating the rescue media (<code>rear mkrescue</code>) and taking the
backup (<code>rear mkbackuponly</code>) as these operations are in principle
independent. This is a solvable problem as we already have a check for
inconsistencies of this type. Another pitfall is that pvcreate used to
crash if it found an existing PVID already in the file - see
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117937">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117937</a>
, and therefore we are excluding the file from the rescue ramdisk in
RHEL as a workaround - I realize I should submit this patch to ReaR
upstream too, although the bug in LVM is fortunately fixed now, but some
distributions/versions might have a buggy version. The patch will be
then incompatible with this approach.</p>
