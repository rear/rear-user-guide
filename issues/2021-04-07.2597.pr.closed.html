<p>How was this pull request tested?</p>

</ul>
<p>Tested on multipath hardware from a customer. Saved 40 minutes creating
the Rescue ISO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brief description of the changes in this pull request:</li>
</ul>
<p>This array variable enables to only process specified disks when
building the <code>disklayout.conf</code> file.<br />
This is particularly useful when having a lot of multipath devices which
are slow to scan but anyway excluded in the end.</p>
<p>This is for experts only, since it may end up creating an inconsistent
<code>disklayout.conf</code> file.<br />
In particular the <code>EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS</code> variable is not populated
automatically because doing so would likely break things.</p>
<p>Usage example:</p>
<pre><code>ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS=( sda sdb )
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS=( /sys/block/sda )
</code></pre>

<p>While saving 40 minutes in mkrescue sounds attractive, I am not sure
whether adding yet another knob, especially one that "is for experts
only, since it may end up creating an inconsistent disklayout.conf
file." is the way to go.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to do the optimization automatically by scanning
only the disks actually referenced by the objects (filesystems, VGs)
that one wants to include in the backup and avoid even looking at those
that are not referenced?</p>

<p>@rmetrich could you via ONLY_INCLUDE_VG variable not exclude all other
block devices? I'm afraid that the new ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS variable
will lead to more confusion by the end-users? And, when both are used
and remove a disk that should not? We must be careful with exclude and
include rules - less is better IMHO</p>

<p>@gdha yes it's not perfect for sure. The issue with
<strong>ONLY_INCLUDE_VG</strong> is that this doesn't prevent scanning the devices,
because all the code is flowing from bottom up, hence first scan
devices, then exclude stuff.<br />
Whereas we would need here to do the opposite: include vg, know how a vg
is created, then go down to selecting devices.</p>

<p>Caution!<br />
Long and elaborated text about generic things:</p>
<p>As far as I see the whole include/exclude area<br />
has become a grown "hairy" mess over the time, cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229#issuecomment-531264805">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229#issuecomment-531264805</a></p>
<p>Usually (i.e. in commonly used and tested cases) things work well.<br />
But in special and/or exceptional cases things fall apart and what is
worst:<br />
Currently (as far as I see) there is no simple clear and consistently
working way<br />
how the user could specify what disk layout components he wants to get
recreated<br />
and what mountpoints or directories he wants to get included in the
backup.</p>
<p>Including/excluding components like disks/partitions/filesystems<br />
is different from what gets included/excluded in the backup.<br />
There are some relationships but in general both are different things.</p>
<p>See<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2586#issuecomment-805601063">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2586#issuecomment-805601063</a><br />
and the therein linked comments in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229</a><br />
and also<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2236#issuecomment-531204474">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2236#issuecomment-531204474</a><br />
which is also a special case for multipath.</p>
<p>For ReaR's internal BACKUP method I added some time ago<br />
BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE and BACKUP_ONLY_EXCLUDE<br />
cf.
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091</a><br />
so that the user could specify what he wants to get in his backup<br />
by keeping ReaR's automatisms out of his way.</p>
<p>Currently there is no counterpart for the disk layout like<br />
where the user could specify what he wants to get in his
disklayout.conf<br />
by keeping ReaR's automatisms out of his way.</p>
<p>The problem with including/excluding disk layout components<br />
are their interdependencies.</p>
<p>I think the following comment in disklayout.conf<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2749">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2749</a></p>
<pre><code># How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
#
# You cannot exclude a device (e.g. /dev/sdg) directly.
# Instead you have to exclude everything ON that device
# and then the dependency tracker will automatically exclude
# the device from the recovery (because there won't be any
# recovery information for that "unnecessary" device).
#
# Furthermore, you have to exclude MD devices and LVM2
# volume groups separately as there is no automatic detection
# of these dependencies.
</code></pre>
<p>points to the root cause why the disk layout components<br />
include/exclude functionality in ReaR behaves "hairy":</p>
<p>It is ReaR's automatisms that<br />
on the one hand make things work well in commonly used and tested
cases<br />
BUT<br />
on the other hand it let things fall apart in special and/or exceptional
cases<br />
(because not automatism can behave perfectly for all use cases).</p>
<p>I think I need to sleep over it to let a reasonable opinion appear<br />
whether or not I like a new ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS config variable.</p>
<p>In general I want "final power to the user" so in general<br />
I like when the user can switch off ReaR's automatisms<br />
and command ReaR what it must do (where the user takes<br />
full responsibility for what he commands - of course).</p>

could you provide what</p>
<pre><code># find /sys/block -ls

# lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
</code></pre>
<p>results on such a machine with a lot of multipath devices?<br />
I really have no idea what "a lot of multipath devices" actually
means.<br />
Are there tens or hundreds or thousands?</p>

<code>lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT</code><br />
output indicate something how the actually interesting block devices<br />
could be distinguished from the non-interesting block devices?</p>
<p>What I have in mind is:</p>
<p>When looking at that code part in
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh</p>
<pre><code>    for disk in /sys/block/* ; do
        blockd=${disk#/sys/block/}

...
            if is_multipath_path ${blockd} ; then
                Log "Ignoring $blockd: it is a path of a multipath device"
            elif [[ ! ($blockd = *rpmb || $blockd = *[0-9]boot[0-9]) ]]; then # Silently skip Replay Protected Memory Blocks and others  
                devname=$(get_device_name $disk)
                devsize=$(get_disk_size ${disk#/sys/block/})
                disktype=$(parted -s $devname print | grep -E "Partition Table|Disk label" | cut -d ":" -f "2" | tr -d " ")

                echo "# Disk $devname"
                echo "# Format: disk &lt;devname&gt; &lt;size(bytes)&gt; &lt;partition label type&gt;"
                echo "disk $devname $devsize $disktype"

                echo "# Partitions on $devname"
                echo "# Format: part &lt;device&gt; &lt;partition size(bytes)&gt; &lt;partition start(bytes)&gt; &lt;partition type|name&gt; &lt;flags&gt; /dev/&lt;partition&gt;"
                extract_partitions "$devname"
            fi
        fi
    done
</code></pre>
<p>the interesting block devices are those where<br />
commands like <code>parted -s $devname print</code> make sense<br />
i.e. the interesting block devices are what is commonly known<br />
as "real disks" with partitions on it.</p>
<p>I wonder if there isn't a more direct way to get the intended "real
disks"<br />
than to first list all block devices and then sort out the unintended
ones.</p>
<p>I know basically nothing about multipath so the following could be plain
wrong:<br />
I think the problem with multipath is that one "real disk behind
multipath" appears<br />
as several duplicates under normal <code>/dev/sd[a-z]*</code> disk device nodes.<br />
Because normal <code>/dev/sd[a-z]*</code> disk device nodes must be normally
considered<br />
it means for multipath that all those multipath duplicates must be also
considered<br />
and sorted out via <code>is_multipath_path ${blockd}</code> which costs time :-(</p>

<p><code>lsblk --nodeps -o fstype /dev/sd...</code> shows <code>mpath_member</code> for multipath
paths. This information seems to be eventually obtained from udev.</p>
<p>I suspect that the <code>multipath -c</code> command actually does not look at the
kernel multipath device tables, but checks whether the device should be
a multipath path, instead of checking whether the device actually is a
multipath path. It is even hinted in the manual page ("-c Check if a
block device should be a path in a multipath device."). This could be
the reason both for this problem and for #2298.</p>

<p>I don't think <code>multipath -l</code> is the problem here - the customer is

<p>Actually... @rmetrich maybe the problem lies not in any slowness of
<code>multipath -c</code>, but in returning wrong information. Can you please check
whether <code>multipath -c</code> returns the correct information (return code 0)
for all those <code>/dev/sd*</code> devices? You would see messages like "Ignoring
$blockd: it is a path of a multipath device" in the log if paths are
detected correctly (even without a debug log).</p>

<p>@rmetrich @pcahyna<br />
I have a gereral understanding question:</p>
<p>I do not understand what the reason behind is why a system<br />
needs to have very many disk-like devices accessible.</p>
<p>Because<br />
<a href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-multipath.html#sec-multipath-mpiotools">https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-multipath.html#sec-multipath-mpiotools</a><br />
reads (excerpt)</p>
<pre><code>17.4.1 Device Mapper Multipath Module
...
Configurations of up to eight paths to each device are supported.
</code></pre>
<p>it seems eight paths to a device is a reasonable maximum<br />
that is used "out there in practice".</p>
<p>So when according to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814908043">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814908043</a><br />
there are 2653 <code>sd[a-z]*</code> device paths it seems<br />
there are 379 <code>dm-[0-9]*</code> multipath devices<br />
(because 7 is the only proper divisor &lt;= 8 i.e. <code>2653 = 379 * 7</code>)<br />
or there is one normal system disk /dev/sda (non-multipath)<br />
so there are 2652 <code>sd[a-z]*</code> multipath device paths with<br />
either 1326 = 2652 / 2 <code>dm-[0-9]*</code> multipath devices<br />
or 663 = 2652 / 4 <code>dm-[0-9]*</code> multipath devices<br />
or 442 = 2652 / 6 <code>dm-[0-9]*</code> multipath devices.</p>
<p>Or do I misunderstand something here?<br />
If not:<br />
I wonder why there are hundreds of multipath devices accessible on a
system.</p>
<p>Are those hundreds of disk-like devices perhaps<br />
first combined into RAID arrays to get RAID devices<br />
that are then perhaps used as LVM PVs to be<br />
further combined into VGs and LVs so that<br />
from hundreds of low level disk-like storage objects<br />
only a few high level strorage objects get created<br />
that are finally mounted?</p>
<p>Or is there perhaps some lower level configuration mistake<br />
(e.g. related to the SAN setup, perhaps no or insufficient SAN
zoning?)<br />
when a system has hundreds of disk-like devices accessible<br />
but most of them are perhaps not meant to be used by that system?</p>
<p>The</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
</code></pre>
<p>output of such a system could really help to better understand its
storage structure.</p>

<p>It's not rare that Red Hat customers have such many multipath devices on
their system.<br />
Usually they host large databases and stuff like that.<br />
So yes, here there is a single disk for the OS and the rest are "raw
devices" we shouldn't even look at.<br />
You can have similar devices with VxVM for example.</p>

<p>This is a special case.<br />
Even if that use case is relatively normal in enterprise server

usually each particular enterprise environment is an individual special

if we should perhps better use<br />

less RFC 1925 item 6a "It is always possible to add another level of
indirection".</p>
<p>Now I see that the config variable name ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS is wrong.<br />
It should be ONLY_CONSIDER_DISKS (or something else that tells its
actual meaning)<br />
because what is specified in that array is not what will be (only)

because certain disks will get automatically excluded by the hardcoded<br />

<p>I will note that this special case should be already adequately covered
by the current code that skips multipath paths, so I would like to
determine why it does not work as expected first. Otherwise you may just
introduce a dirty hack which does not in fact allow some new special
case, but is merely a workaround for another part of the code not
working properly.</p>

I agree that we need to find out why it is so slow for thousands of<br />
multipath path devices in <code>/sys/block/*</code></p>
<p>Perhaps we find out that we cannot get automated exclusion of<br />
thousands of multipath path devices sufficiently fast,<br />
cf.

"there is Grub2 probe running for 20 minutes"<br />
(we could not make Grub2 probe running faster).</p>
<p>My general intent is to provide "final power to all users"<br />
what layout components get included and what get excluded.</p>
<p>Perhaps my above <code>CONSIDER_DISKS=( /sys/block/* )</code> proposal<br />
points into the right direction.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could have <code>INCLUDE_DISKS=()</code> so the current default<br />
to consider all in <code>/sys/block/*</code> and automatically exclude by the
hardcoded<br />
conditions in layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh is done<br />
while a user specified <code>INCLUDE_DISKS=( sda sdc )</code> will include (only)
them<br />

some stable identifiers (like filesystem mount points, volume groups or
logical volumes).</p>
<p>Also, the discussion here is not about what to exclude (multipath
components are excluded anyway), but about a performance optimization
which allows to avoid looking at them before excluding them.<br />
EDIT: This is not entirely correct, the proposed change introduces
indeed a new way to define what is included/excluded, but the primary
motivation was an optimization and not having another way of configuring
inclusion/exclusion.</p>

<p>I understand that it would be desirable to have a generic way to tell
what devices to avoid looking at. Even if we manage to fix it for the
multipath case, what if a customer uses non-multipath devices for such
purposes? Given the problems with configuring this kind of exclusion
using explicit device names, would it be possible to ask the kernel
whether there is anything interesting on the drives? After all, the
kernel looks at disks when they are configured to search for partition
tables etc. Would it work to automatically exclude disks that have no
partitions known to the kernel, no mounted filesystems and no holders
(<code>/sys/block/*/holders</code>)?</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
perhaps I misunderstand what you wrote</p>
<pre><code>I am afraid that in this case you would provide merely the
power to all users to shoot themselves in the foot
without providing the complementary power of aiming properly
</code></pre>
<p>but for me <code>provide final power to all users</code> essentially means<br />
to provide the power to all users to even shoot themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>ReaR is meant to be used by a user who is <code>root</code> and such users<br />
have unlimited power to do what they want on their systems<br />
where "aiming properly" is completely their own responsibility<br />
just as it is for a real shooter - the gun provides him power<br />
but "aiming properly" is completely the shooter's responsibility.</p>
<p>In contrast to a weapon ReaR has reasonably safe default behaviour<br />
(at least for the commonly known and well tested use cases).</p>
<p>By default ReaR should avoid (as far as possible with reasonable
effort)<br />
that a ReaR user shoots himself in the foot (but there are still many
places<br />
where ReaR does not protect the user to shoot himself in the foot).</p>
<p>The crucial part - and that is what I have to basically always explain -
is<br />
that for me "provide final power to all users" means</p>
<ul>
<li>first and foremost a reasonable default behaviour</li>
</ul>
<p>plus</p>
<ul>
<li>the user has unlimited power to change the defaults as he likes</li>
</ul>
<p>When the user changed something then things could fail in arbitrary
ways.<br />
Of course we would try to error out cleanly when user settings cannot
work,<br />
cf. "Try hard to care about possible errors" in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style">https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style</a><br />
but we cannot ensure that we catch all bad cases so things might even
go<br />
terribly wrong when the user changed something in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Simply put:<br />
In "final power to the user" the word 'final' is crucial<br />
so "final power to the user" does not mean the program does nothing to
avoid bad outcome<br />
instead it means the program does not hinder the user to explicitly let
it also do bad things.</p>
<p>Or in other words:<br />
"Final power to the user" means<br />
the programmer gives his power away to the user of his program<br />
and not the programmer keeps the power himself via hardcoded things in
his program.</p>
<p>The perfect example for "final power to the user" is nowadays "# rm -rf
/":</p>
<pre><code># rm -rf /
rm: it is dangerous to operate recursively on '/'
rm: use --no-preserve-root to override this failsafe

# rm -rf --no-presreve-root /
[all is gone now]

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>My proposed change introduces intentionally a generic way<br />
to define what disks are included (and all others are excluded)<br />
because I like to avoid optimization "hacks" for specific cases.</p>
<p>I think my proposed change would also help a user who has<br />
a few disks for the OS (the only ones of interest for ReaR) and<br />
hundreds of (non-multipath) "raw devices" to host large databases.</p>
<p>I think @rmetrich current ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS implementation<br />
would do the same - only the variable name is misleading as long as<br />
the exclude conditions in
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh<br />
are not skipped when ONLY_INCLUDE_DISKS is specified.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you indeed misunderstood. My point was that you make the user
responsible for "aiming properly", but in this case you would not
provide them with proper means for aiming. The only way the proposed
variable aims at block devices is by using their assigned names, which
are, I am afraid, not reliable - <code>/sys/block/sdxyz</code> can become
<code>/sys/block/sdqux</code> on next boot. (IIRC I even saw an issue about similar
problems from you, but I can't find it now.) So a user might determine
that including <code>/sys/block/sdxyz</code> works for them, but after a reboot it
becomes <code>/sys/dev/sdqux</code> and gets excluded from the backup.</p>
<p>Moreover, generally speaking, while places where "users can shoot
themselves in the foot" are acceptable in a tool like this, I believe
one should be cautious when adding a new one and first ask whether the
same desired outcome can be achieved in a safer way.</p>

<p>For the case that motivated this PR, the problem is, how will the user
implement this detection (of unwanted multipath devices)? Either they
implement it in the same way as it is done now in ReaR, but then they
will save nothing, because if the method is the same, it will lead to
the same 40-minute delay.<br />
Or they implement something better, but then why not implement this
"better thing" in ReaR directly?<br />
You mentioned that "perhaps we find out that we cannot get automated
exclusion of thousands of multipath path devices sufficiently fast".
This is certainly a possibility, but in this case the power given to the
user is illusory. It will not allow them to make any actual improvement
in their local configuration, lest they hardcode the list of device
names in the config file and be surprised when the devices rename on
some future reboot.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that you want to make the variable more generic and
not tied to this specific case, which certainly goes in the right
direction and the argument above does not apply. But...</p>

<p>I am sure that relying on (unpredictable) device names is already a
problem in the current code. I am only saying that it would be better to
avoid introducing another place which relies on them and thus amplifying
the problem. Especially among configuration variables, as those are the
documented user interface that one should not change (because of
compatibility).</p>

<p>Depends. The question is, is it possible to implement a reliable way of
detecting the wanted disks without looking at all the disks and
examining whether they are wanted or not? It seems that in this case the
condition is "the disk is wanted if it is not multipath". In this case
one has to look at all the disks to determine whether they are multipath
and my reasoning applies. But perhaps there would be a better way. (I
would say that one possible better way would be to start at the objects
that the user is interested in - esp. filesystems, maybe LVs, VGs,
RAIDs, and recursively determine their underlying devices until one
reaches the leaves, instead of starting from the leaves and building the
entire stack from the bottom up.) Still, this better way could then be
worth implementing in ReaR in a generic manner, but perhaps it is too
difficult.</p>

<p>The commonly used point of view is that in the tree-like structure of
storage objects<br />
(it is no tree because one higher level storage object could have more
than one parent<br />
e.g. a non-degraded software RAID array "md" device has at least two
parent devices)<br />
the actual disks are the root devices and on them certain levels of
higher and higher<br />
level storage objects are built until the leaves are usually some

<p>Same appies for virtual disks.<br />
Virtual disks are what admins have first and foremost on virtual
machines.</p>
<p>So in ReaR we also should let the user specify his things<br />
according to how he is used to imagine his things,<br />
i.e. first and foremost disks.</p>
<p>So far from a usability point of view.</p>
<p>Now from a "what ReaR is meant to do" point of view:</p>
<p>ReaR's main task is to recreate a system as much as possible as it was
before<br />
on bare metal replacement hardware (or on bare virtual machines).</p>
<p>It is not ReaR's main task to initially create a system where it might
make sense<br />
to let the user specify the final storage objects (usually "mountable
thingies")<br />
and let some (semi)-automatism create the needed lower and lower level<br />
storage objects until finally some disks are used (those where the
intended<br />
final storage objects fit best).</p>
<p>It is ReaR's main task is to use "same" disks as on the original
system<br />
and recreate on them the same structure of higher and higher<br />
level storage objects.</p>
<p>Finally from a technical point of view:</p>
<p>To create a structure of storage objects on bare metal replacement
hardware<br />
(or on a bare virtual machine) one must start with disks, create
partitions on them,<br />
and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore ReaR uses "whole" disks when recreating<br />
and its first thing is <code>parted mklabel</code>, then <code>parted mkpart</code> and so on.</p>
<p>There is no code in ReaR to "partially" recreate storage objects on a
disk.</p>
<p>Summary (from my point of view):</p>
<p>It would help the user a lot if he could specify with final power<br />
what disks ReaR has to use (and then all other disks must not be used).</p>
<p>When a higher level storage object (e.g. a LV in a VG that is spread
over several disks)<br />
uses a disk that is not specified to be used (if the user has specified
what to use)<br />
ReaR (i.e. "rear mkrescue") must error out so the user would see the
conflict.</p>

<p>The commonly used point of view is that in the tree-like structure of
storage objects<br />
(it is no tree because one higher level storage object could have more
than one parent<br />
e.g. a non-degraded software RAID array "md" device has at least two
parent devices)<br />
the actual disks are the root devices and on them certain levels of
higher and higher<br />

"mountable thingies"<br />
(like filesystems or btrfs subvolumes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, when I wrote that comment I had an opposite view in mind: the
"mountable thingies" as roots and the actual disks as leaves. Of course
since the tree is not actually a tree but a DAG, both viewpoints (with
actual disks as roots vs. with mountable thingies as roots) can be
considered equally valid (or invalid), but my comment should be
interpreted with the "mountable thingies as roots" view in mind.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure that I agree with this view. Users buy disks to put the
"mountable thingies" and eventually data on them, so they may buy a
disk, but ultimately they are interested in the data, not disks.<br />
The discussion you reference, is AFAICT, about the installer, which can
have different usability requirements than a backup/recovery tool. (When
you install a system, you don't have any data on it yet.) If anything,
the discussion is more relevant to the recover phase, not to the backup
phase (indeed, in the recover phase, you certainly want to have a
detailed control over what disks are going to be used, since you don't
want to overwrite disks that still have valuable data. Similar concerns
apply when installing, so here the installer is a more relevant analogy
to the recover phase than to the backup/mkrestore part.)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It seems that what you say goes a bit against the current philosophy of
ReaR though, because the current include/exclude rules are often
formulated in terms of the final (or close to final) storage objects:
<code>ONLY_INCLUDE_VG</code>, <code>EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS</code>, <code>EXCLUDE_VG</code>,
<code>EXCLUDE_RECREATE</code> - even <code>AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS</code> excludes disk that are not
used by mounted filesystems.</p>
<p>(I admit I am not familiar enough with the current include/exclude
rules.)</p>
<p>Thinking in terms of "mountable thingies" has also the advantage of
naturally mapping to backups, because usually those are the only objects
that one knows how to backup (unless one uses a method like BLOCKCLONE,
but I suppose it is not very typical).</p>

disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I suspect that if you exclude a VG that has a PV on a partition of
a disk, it is allowed to recreate the partition without recreating the
PV and VG that resides in it. The disk will then indeed become
"partially recreated". (I haven't tried it though.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary (from my point of view):</p>
<p>It would help the user a lot if he could specify with final power<br />
what disks ReaR has to use (and then all other disks must not be
used).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to go this route, please let the user specify the disks in
terms of some stable identifier (/dev/disk/by-*) instead of using block
device names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a higher level storage object (e.g. a LV in a VG that is spread
over several disks)<br />
uses a disk that is not specified to be used (if the user has

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>I admit never really understood the current include/exclude rules.</p>
<p>I can "understand" a particular case by trial and error plus reading the
code<br />
but I don't have an overall understanding in my mind to be able to
tell<br />
off the top of my head what config variables must be set with which
values<br />
to get a desided outcome.</p>
<p>From my failed attempts to understand things my result<br />
that I personally think the whole include/exclude area<br />
has become a grown "hairy" mess over the time, cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814895323">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814895323</a></p>
<p>My vague basic understanding is that during "rear mkrescue"<br />
first all storage objects ReaR knows about are included in
disklayout.conf<br />
(except some automated hardcoded ignored ones, cf. this issue here)<br />
and then some "not needed" entries in disklayout.conf get disabled<br />
by various subsequent <code>exclude</code> scripts which is the main "hairy" part.</p>
<p>Cf. what <code>rear -s mkrescue | grep layout/save</code> shows (excerpts)</p>
<pre><code>Source layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh
...
Source layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh
Source layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh
...
Source layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh
Source layout/save/default/320_autoexclude.sh
Source layout/save/default/330_remove_exclusions.sh
</code></pre>
<p>A bad consequence is that when ReaR does not support something<br />
it gets silently ignored during "rear mkrescue" and then the user has
to<br />
learn the hard way later (when it is too late) when "rear recover"
fails<br />
with unfriedly messages that something is not supported by ReaR, cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560</a></p>
<p>E.g. as far as I know off the top of my head<br />
a mounted filesystem that is not supported by ReaR is silently ignored
and<br />
an unsupported storage object is also silently ignored during "rear
mkrescue"<br />
for the latter see
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560</a></p>
<p>What is missing is the final power where the user could specify<br />
what he wants and "rear mkrescue" fails if it cannot fulfill that<br />
and where the uscer could specify what is sacrosanct<br />
for ReaR and "rear mkrescue" fails if it needs that.</p>
<p>Ideally ReaR would have sufficient automated checks<br />
that find out when something unsupported is actually in use<br />
so "rear mkrescue" could error out to have the user informed in time<br />
when he can adapt and enhance things to make "rear recover" work.</p>
<p>Let me experiment a bit with some generic <code>INCLUDE_DISKS</code><br />
and <code>EXCLUDE_DISKS</code> functionality to find out how that works<br />
in practice at least for me then let's see if that way looks promising.</p>

<p>@gdha<br />
I think you may misunderstand two things here:</p>
<p>(1) This particular issue is a special case:</p>
<p>This particular issue is not about a "normal" system.</p>
<p>This issue is about a system with thousands of disks, see<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814908043">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814908043</a></p>
<pre><code>... physical devices
...
2653 "/devices/pci..." devices there.
All scanned.
</code></pre>
<p>and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814957059">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2597#issuecomment-814957059</a></p>
<pre><code>... get an idea how long it takes when 'multipath -l' is run 2653 times.
</code></pre>
<p>So <code>multipath</code> is not terrible slow.<br />
But tousands of times <code>multipath</code> gets terrible slow.</p>
<p>Systems with thousands of disks mean stress in general.</p>
<p>Not only with ReaR but basically all tools that deal with disks<br />
may get terrible slow with thousands of disks up to low level things<br />
like possibly udev event storms and things like that<br />
(kernel developers could tell such stories ;-)</p>
<p>So we are thinking about some additional generic INCLUDE_DISKS<br />
and EXCLUDE_DISKS functionality to make it possible for admins<br />
of systems with thousands of disks to have less stress - at least in
ReaR.</p>
<p>I am totally selfish here:<br />
If a SUSE customer with a system with thousands of disks<br />
files an urgent support case at SUSE then I will get stress.<br />
But I do not like stress - actually I really really hate stress.<br />
So to get rid of such customer-introduced "real-time stress"<br />
(likely amplified by some well-intended advice by managers)<br />
I would implement whatever quick and ditry hack to somehow<br />
make that stuff somehow work for the particular customer<br />
to get that annoyance out of my way as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>(2) More and more config variables don't mean stress:</p>
<p>The crucial point with config variables is that normally the user<br />
should not need to care about their values because normally<br />
config variables have a default setting where things "just work".</p>
<p>Only if things do not "just work" the user would have to care<br />
about that specific case where it does not "just work" for him<br />
with his particular system in his particiular environment.</p>
<p>In such a case the user would have to read default.conf to find out<br />
what the right config variables and values are that he must<br />
specifically set to make his special case work.</p>
<p>When there are config variables for basically all and everything<br />
the user has relatively easy means to make his special case work.</p>
<p>When there is no config variable for a particular kind of thing<br />
the user would have to adapt the ReaR scripts that deal<br />
with that particular kind of thing which is less easy compared to<br />
read default.conf and set some appropriate config variables.</p>
<p>But the worst of all when config variables are missing is<br />
that then very most of the users won't adapt the ReaR scripts.</p>
<p>Instead the users make issues here and then we get their stress<br />
and the users are right doing so because only in theory<br />
"simply change the code - that's just what free software is about"<br />
is right but in practice users don't appreciate such habits.</p>
<p>In particular SUSE customers usually won't adapt ReaR scripts<br />
because they want to use "the software" (i.e. the ReaR scripts)<br />
as is from a rear* RPM package same on all their systems<br />
and specify system-dependant things only in config files<br />
on each system as needed.</p>
<p>So having config variables for basically all and everything<br />
means less stress for all of us compared to not having<br />
config variables for basically all and everything.</p>
<p>Adendum:<br />
It is a separated and different topic<br />
if we should have all config variables in a single default.conf<br />
or if we should split them up into commonly used config variables<br />
and config variables for special cases.</p>

<p>@gdha I fully agree with your view in general, and indeed I spent some
time researching why is <code>multipath</code> slow. It turns out, however, that in
the original issue
(<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1946911">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1946911</a>)
the culprit was not multipath devices, but just lots of unmounted SAN
devices, so optimizing multipath would not have helped here.</p>
<p>OTOH, it also turns out that there is indeed a multipath performance
problem that was fixed in PR #2034 but reintroduced in ReaR 2.6. As
written by @jsmeix above:</p>

perhaps in the function <code>is_multipath_path</code> in
lib/layout-functions.sh<br />
the most time consuming part is not the device specific call</p>
<pre><code>multipath -c /dev/$1
</code></pre>
<p>but the listing of the whole multipath topology via</p>
<pre><code>multipath -l | grep -q '[[:alnum:]]' || return 1
</code></pre>
<p>see my comment in the code why I added that call<br />

<p>The problematic change is here:
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2299/files#diff-2916f533f1aa01a8a571a7062e43957bdd1523e70ce94a5107541ff466eef22cR705">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2299/files#diff-2916f533f1aa01a8a571a7062e43957bdd1523e70ce94a5107541ff466eef22cR705</a>
- for each device, it issues <code>multipath -l</code>. And since <code>multipath -l</code>
scans all devices and the time it takes is proportional to their number,
the total time spent on all this is quadratic in the number of devices.
For 1600 devices it used to take 300 s, now it takes 4445 s. I will try
to propose a fix for that (using the strategy mentioned in

<p>With

merged<br />
at least the long computing time in
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh<br />
should be avoided.</p>
<p>I don't know if the "Grub2 probe running for 20 minutes" issue<br />
in output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh can be avoided, see<br />

When it hangs inside a command call (e.g. when GRUB is slow)<br />
there is perhaps not much what ReaR could do.<br />
At least that code is only run when GRUB_RESCUE is wanted by the user.</p>
