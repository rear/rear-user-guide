<p>@annonymous99999</p>
<p>first and foremost:<br />
There is no such thing as "an urgent fix" for Relax-and-Recover,<br />
see the section "Notes on the meaning of 'Relax' in 'Relax-and-Recover'"
at<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a></p>
<p>Second:<br />
When you click on the [New issue] button at<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues</a><br />
you see this<br />
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md</a><br />
which describes how to submit issues so that we have at least a chance<br />
to understand what goes on on your particular system with your
particular hardware<br />
in your particular environment which is a precondition to be able to
help you.</p>
<p>Third:<br />
See the section "SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" at<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a></p>
<p>Fourth:<br />
In current ReaR upstream master code<br />
I cannot find anything about <code>emcpower</code></p>
<pre><code>rear.github.master # find . -type f | xargs grep -i 'emc' | egrep -vi 'systemctl|EMC NetWorker|EMC Avamar|EMC Legato|scsi_dh_emc'
[no output]
</code></pre>
<p>This indicates that currenly ReaR does not support<br />
that kind of devices <code>/dev/emcpower*</code><br />
so this issue seems to be about a new feature<br />
"Support /dev/emcpower* devices".</p>

<p>I assure you there is urgency in context of the need. I do have a
support contract with SUSE and have talked to them, but I suspect this
forum may have more knowledge of the rear code and timeliness. At least
I am hoping :). PowerPath(emcpower devices) is the Dell/EMC version of
multipath devices, example /dev/mpatha. That is why I am asking how to
properly include them since the restore looks to be saying it did not
record them. This is FCOE bare metal boot from SAN and we do have
networker but that does not appear to be what the error is currently
stuck on. I am hoping there is a simple way to include the emcpower
devices during the mkbackup so the restore does not error. I am very new
to this particular recovery product.<br />
Also on a side note is there an option/flag to not rebuild the initramfs
with Dracut at the end if I am restoring to the same exact system? That
way I do not have to worry about the Powerpath modules being including
or other such issues. Thank you very much for your replies and inputs.</p>

<p>@annonymous99999</p>
<p>I did not question that the issue is urgent for you.<br />
But you cannot enforce urgency on free software developers at ReaR
upstream.</p>
<p>When you have a sufficient SUSE support contract for<br />
SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension (SLE-HA)<br />
(which is the only SUSE product/extension where SUSE officially supports
ReaR)<br />
then you should also (in addition to this issue at ReaR upstream)<br />
file a separated issue at SUSE via your SUSE contact.<br />
Depending on your SUSE support contract you may enforce urgency at SUSE.</p>
<p>But when current ReaR upstream does not support <code>/dev/emcpower</code>
devices<br />
then there is little hope things can be fixed in urgency mode in
particular<br />
when no such hardware is available to the developers who work on ReaR.<br />
E..g. on my x86_64 homeoffice laptop I cannot reproduce anything<br />
that depends on special hardware.</p>
<h4 id="jsmeix_commented_at_2021-01-29_1255"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50"><a href="https://github.com/jsmeix">jsmeix</a> commented at <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560#issuecomment-769788886">2021-01-29 12:55</a>:<a class="headerlink" href="#jsmeix_commented_at_2021-01-29_1255" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Regarding rebuilding the initramfs.</p>
<p>During "rear recover" the initramfs is rebuilt after the backup was
restored.<br />
In the ReaR recovery system the target system where the backup gets
restored to<br />
is mounted at /mnt/local.<br />
In the ReaR recovery system the initramfs is rebuilt via</p>
<pre><code>chroot /mnt/local ... /sbin/mkinitrd
</code></pre>
<p>cf. in current ReaR upstream master code for x86 compatible
architecture<br />
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh</a></p>
<p>So during "rear recover" the initramfs is rebuilt inside the restored
system<br />
with the programs and files (also config files) as restored from the
backup<br />
so that the initramfs should be rebuilt same as when <code>/sbin/mkinitrd</code><br />
was called in the normal running system.</p>

<p>@annonymous99999</p>
<p>regarding if there is a simple way to include the emcpower devices
during the mkbackup:</p>
<p>You may run a command like</p>
<pre><code># find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'nvme'
</code></pre>
<p>which shows "the usual suspects" of the code places<br />
where disk block device (base)names are normally handled, mainly in<br />
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh<br />
plus some special case handling in the get_part_device_name_format()
function<br />
to guess a block device partition name from the block device disk name<br />
(some have a <code>p</code> between the parent disk device and its partition
devices)<br />
and another special case handling for <code>nvme</code> in<br />
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh</p>
<p>Perhaps - only a blind guess I never had anything to do<br />
with /dev/emcpower devices or its corresponding hardware -<br />
it is sufficient to add <code>emcpower*</code> to those usual code places.</p>
<p>Probably you need some trial and error attempts with "rear mkrescue"<br />
(you do not need to run "rear mkbackup" for those tests)<br />
until you get in your var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf the needed<br />
entries of your /dev/emcpower* devices so that "rear recover"<br />
(now you need a "rear mkbackup" before) works in your case.</p>
<p>If you like to do that I would very much recommend to work<br />
with current ReaR upstream master code because that is the only code<br />
where we at ReaR upstream work with and where we would accept pull
requests.</p>
<p>See the section "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a><br />
and all the subsequent sections therein up to the section<br />
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover"<br />
how you could work yourself on ReaR.</p>

the diskrestore.sh script as needed, cf. the section<br />
"Restore to different hardware" - "The Ad-Hoc Way" in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc</a></p>
<p>But that is probably not what you like to do in case of emergency and
time pressure<br />
during a real disaster recovery.</p>
<p>So what needs to be done is to get the missing things automatically
into<br />
/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf which is created during "rear
mkrescue"<br />
so that later in case of emergency and time pressure during a real
disaster recovery<br />
"rear recover" could recreate the system fully automatically without
labourious<br />
and possibly erroneous manual interventions.</p>
<p>There is no standard how to get missing things into disklayout.conf.<br />
This is manual trial-and-error adapting and enhancing the ReaR scripts<br />
as I described it a little bit in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560#issuecomment-769797622">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560#issuecomment-769797622</a></p>
<p>If /dev/emcpowera* devices need special setup actions to be recreated<br />
then things get even more complicated because then the scripts that<br />
run during "rear recover" would have to be adapted and enhanced<br />
to provide support for /dev/emcpowera* device setup, cf. at<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a><br />
the<br />
"Essentials about disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover presentation
PDF"<br />
and the<br />
"Fundamentals about Relax-and-Recover presentation PDF"<br />
which is a bit more specific for SLE12/15 in particular regarding<br />
SUSE's default btrfs structure that is rather special, see also<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#btrfs">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#btrfs</a><br />
and the section "Limitations with Btrfs" in<br />
<a href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP5/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html">https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP5/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html</a></p>
<p>By the way:<br />
As long as you do not provide us (i.e. the ReaR upstream developers)<br />
the information that I asked for in my<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560#issuecomment-769680240">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2560#issuecomment-769680240</a><br />
this ReaR upstream issue cannot move forward.</p>
<p>To make it more clear what information is needed<br />
to analyze and debug a "rear recover" failure<br />
I added an itemization that is about</p>
<pre><code>To analyze and debug a "rear recover" failure the following information is mandatory
</code></pre>
<p>to the "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" section in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery</a></p>
<p>Alternatively we could stop here and continue only via the SUSE internal
issue<br />
that we have now for this issue but that would have the drawback that
all other<br />
ReaR upstream developers and users are excluded so there cannot be any
help<br />
from them - perhaps there are other ReaR users who have hardware with<br />
/dev/emcpowera* devices who could contribute something helpful here?</p>
