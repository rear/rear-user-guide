<p>Hey gents, I know y'all are really busy, however that being said, I have
some information for you guys(as well as a bug, but I will get to the
bug at the end of this rough draft instruction manual for restoring to a
system that is boot from san as well as using multipath).</p>
<p>Late on Friday I was able to successfully restore a system that uses
boot from SAN, multipath, and LVM2 for RHEL 7.X.</p>
<p>I have written a script that does some translations over multipath to
specific block devices that are pertaining to multipath. But to start
off, I will start this thread from scratch.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a blade that is boot from SAN and attached to EMC/3PAR/IBM
    XIV/Hitachi storage.</li>
<li>The rest of the disks that are assigned to the system are also on
    the above mentioned SAN array.</li>
<li>Multipath is enabled.</li>
<li>Using a recovery method of TSM (Tivoli).</li>
<li>You also have LVM/LVM2 enabled and are using volume groups to
    control system wide sizes (i.e. size of /var, /opt, /tmp, /root,
    /home, etc...).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing that you will want to do before creating a new recovery
image via 'rear mkrescue' will be to run this script, from which I have
provided...</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em> --&gt; You will have to edit this script for your output of
multipath -ll and exclude the model from field 5. You can elect to keep
the model name within the contents, however, being an admin/engineer,
you should know what your environment is using and how it is utilizing
these technologies.</p>
<pre><code>#BEGIN#######
#!/bin/bash
#INITIAL VARIABLES
MLIST=`multipath -ll | grep mpath | awk '{ print $1 }'`
ROLIST=`multipath -ll | egrep '(mpath|size|wp)' | awk '{ print $5 }' | grep -v SYMMETRIX` #exclude your model of SAN that will pull with field 5
VGLIST=`vgdisplay | grep "VG Name" | awk '{ print $3 }' | sort -rn`
PVLIST=`vgdisplay -v | grep "PV Name" | awk '{ print $3 }' | sort -rn`
SDLIST=`multipath -ll | grep sd | awk '{ print $3 }'`

<p>The above script will put your block devices on a line with the VG that
is associated with that disk, as well as the read/write permission (i.e.
assuming that you may have gatekeepers that are presented to the blade
that would be read only).</p>

<p>Now what does this do for ReaR? It at least sets an example on what
volume groups are associated with what multipath disks, and what block
devices are associated with that multipath disk number. It will also
eliminate any read only disks that may show up due to gatekeepers being
presented, or any number of read only associated disks that may be
presented to the system over fibre channel.</p>
<p>Once you have taken note on what volume groups are associated with what
drives, go into the disklayout.conf (/var/lib/rear/layout/.) section and
uncomment the multipath entries that are associated with the set of
block devices that your volume group is a member of. In the case above,
if we were only to restore VG00 (i.e. the root volume group), we would
find the entries for /dev/sda that are associated with
/dev/mapper/mpatha(yes it is actually mpatha2, but we aren't talking
about partitions, YET...) within the disklayout.conf file.<br />
As shown here:</p>
<pre><code>disk /dev/sda 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdb 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdc 5898240 unknown
disk /dev/sdd 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sde 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdf 5898240 unknown
disk /dev/sdg 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdh 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdi 5898240 unknown
disk /dev/sdj 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdk 21626880000 msdos
#disk /dev/sdl 5898240 unknown
#disk /dev/sdm 0
multipath /dev/mapper/mpatha /dev/sda,/dev/sdd,/dev/sdg,/dev/sdj
</code></pre>
<p>Also, head into /etc/rear and look at the <code>site.conf</code> file.</p>
<p>Ensure in the <code>REQUIRED_PROGS=(</code> that <code>multipathd</code> and <code>multipath</code> are
there as well.</p>
<p>An example would be the following:</p>
<pre><code>REQUIRED_PROGS=(
"$SCRIPT_FILE"
bash
awk
cpio
dd
df
getopt
sed
vi
ip
tar
sort
mv
uniq
grep
loadkeys
kbd_mode
dumpkeys
diff
join
pwd
file
pidof
sync
multipath    (i have included this binary to pull into the mkrescue image)
multipathd  (This one is the actual daemon, I haven't noticed an issue with order)
parted  (need to include this one to rebuild any drives with partitions and what not)
grub2   (will need this as well to re-install grub to the main boot device MBR)
grub2-install
grub2-mkconfig
)
</code></pre>
<p>Also set your <code>BOOT_OVER_SAN=Y</code> in this file as well as<br />
<code>AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n</code> or leave it blank as well so it is unset.</p>
<p>Once these steps are done, go ahead and make the rescue image.</p>
<p><code>rear mkrescue</code> (this takes some time).</p>
<p>Once complete, the rescue image will be in
<code>/var/lib/rear/output/rear-&lt;servername&gt;.iso</code></p>
<p>FTP this image to your laptop, or whatever device you will be using to
go into the console.</p>
<p>In this particular case, this server had a DELL iDRAC connected, from
which we will use the CD/DVD/ISO virtual media manager to mount the
image and force the system to boot to the rescue image.</p>
<p>Once at the boot menu, DO NOT SELECT AUTOMATIC, select MANUAL recovery
mode (there are some steps that must be completed first and foremost).</p>
<p>Once booted into the rescue image after selecting manual recovery
method, the first, and THE MOST IMPORTANT step to do while in this
environment is to turn on multipath(assuming you didn't have to dhclient
your interface to obtain an IP address from DHCP).</p>
<p><code>multipathd</code> (this will turn on the multipath daemon)</p>
<p><code>multipath -ll</code> (this will spit out and confirm whether or not multipath
is working and can translate the block devices into selective paths via
the WWID on each LUN from the SAN).</p>

<p>If you notice above, there is a disk that is presented that is only 5.6M
in size, the <code>wp</code> flag is set to <em>ro</em> (read only) which means this LUN
is in actuality a gatekeeper from the EMC SAN. If you followed along
correctly above, you would know to ignore this particular device and
shouldn't have un-commented this entry in the <code>disklayout.conf</code> file in
the previous step (prior to mkrescue).</p>
<p>Now, here is where the "bug" comes into play, however I have figured out
a workaround for this particular bug (the bug that says, NO FILE SYSTEMS
MOUNTED TO /mnt/local).</p>
<p>This isn't due to a bug within multipath or a bug within anything else,
except for a bug within the rear code and how it pertains to LVM2 while
having a VG associated with the mpath disk. I want it to be understood
that this is in no way anyone's fault. The ideas and concepts around
boot from SAN and multipath can differ greatly from environment to
environment. Some choose to use LVM and LVM2 to control the growth of
data, other environments choose to not use LVM and to go with straight
block devices (mpath numbers) instead. Boot from SAN can also vary
greatly depending on the environment in question as well, so my goal
with this document was to try and show all the mechanics behind several
different methodologies and to try and get around certain bugs that may
be presented because there isn't a huge group of folks that are
necessarily going about this method like anyone else would (i.e. there
is no RFC white paper on the proper way to do boot from SAN with
multipathing enabled while using LVM2 for data size control).</p>
<p>Now that being said, let's get around this bug where it cannot mount
logical volumes to /mnt/local.</p>
<p>run a <code>vgchange -a y</code> (that's right, do a blanket activation of all
volume groups that the system can see, even if the contents of the LVOLS
within this volume group have been deleted, the volume group and
subsequent LVOLS will still be there, and still able to be activated).
Now you will see why running my script at the very beginning, prior to
mkrescue is so important.</p>
<p>Once the volume groups, or volume group (you could theoretically just
have vg00) are activated, mount the lvols from the volume group you are
using into /mnt/local. Yes, I understand that I am doing this manually,
but the rear scripts themselves are failing because of some error where
it isn't fully understanding that from this point forward, because
multipath is enabled and LVM2 is up and operational, you don't need to
worry about disk names (and that is the whole point of multipath, so
that you do not have to worry about what block devices your data is on).</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/mapper/vg00-lv_root    /mnt/local/.
mount /dev/mapper/vg00-lv_tmp    /mnt/local/tmp
mount /dev/mapper/vg00-lv_var    /mnt/local/var
</code></pre>
<p>DO NOT FORGET ABOUT /boot!!!!</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/mapper/mpatha1    /mnt/local/boot
chmod 755 /mnt/local/boot
</code></pre>
<p>This is because 9 times out of 10, boot will be at 555, and thus so, TSM
or any other backup/restore utility will not be able to write to this
directory due to permissions, please check the permissions, or if so,
chmod them 755, after the restore, you can chmod it back to 555.</p>
<p>The boot information was gathered again from the original script you run
before you even mkrescue, and more specifically in the fdisk area that
is printed at the bottom, the asterisk marked block device will specify
the boot partition, and since we know that mpatha is our primary disk,
we know that mpatha1 will be our boot disk, and mpatha2 will be our vg00
disk. As shown here:</p>
<pre><code>Disk /dev/sda: 21.6 GB, 21626880000 bytes, 42240000 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk label type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x0006efa7

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System

</code></pre>
<p>Now, if everything is okay, and the sun and planets are aligned just
perfectly, go ahead and do the recover from rear.</p>
<p><code>rear recover</code></p>
<p>everything should be fine with the configuration of the
<code>disklayout.conf</code> as well as default.conf and site.conf.</p>
<p>Select the correct numbers for all the filesystems you wish to restore.
i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10, etc...</p>
<p>it will be normal to see some errors that say "no code added to for
filesystem blah blah blah"</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue</li>
<li>Abort</li>
</ol>
<p>Select option 1 for every question that asks this.</p>
<p>Once it goes through these questions, it will then check that there is
something mounted in /mnt/local. SURPRISE!!!! Your lvols are already
mounted there via multipath because of the steps you just followed, so
if files are missing or directories are missing(i.e. if someone tried a
'rm -Rf * /'), TSM will now pick up where you left off and begin
recovery.</p>
<p>When the above is completed, if you are utilizing selinux, you need to
go into /mnt/local/etc/selinux and set enforce mode to permissive mode
for selinux. Then touch /mnt/local/.autorelabel. This is to combat a
minor issue when SELINUX blocks all new scanned FC devices during reboot
and therefore your devices will not be mounted (your kernel will panic,
or go into the mode where it kills off udev every so often).</p>
<p>Change /mnt/local/boot back to permission level of 555 (note: You may
still encounter the error that rear is unable to find any /boot
partitions. From a theoretical standpoint, if something was wiped from
/boot, you could use the permissions work around to restore from
backup.)</p>
<p>Reboot. And wait for the system to come back up.</p>
<p>Once the system comes back up, run <code>multipath -r</code>, then <code>multipath -v3</code>,
then reboot one more time (sometimes only 3 of the 4 paths come back on
the initial reboot, and doing a refresh, followed by a rescan (v3) will
fix this issue and voila, you will have your multipath, boot from SAN,
restored from backup machine.</p>
<p>FOOD FOR THOUGHT:<br />
It might be worth saying that for this type of recovery it is best to
get your root filesystem recovered first and foremost. Once you can boot
normally because / is working correctly, then you could theoretically
kick off a real TSM session with a system that is up in order to recover
any additional volume groups that you have (i.e. oracle database, some
application, or customer data).</p>
<p>I HOPE TO GOD THAT THIS HELPS THE REAR TEAM GET CLOSER TO COMPLETING
THIS PROJECT WITH FULLY AUTOMATED SUPPORT for BOOT FROM SAN as well as
MULTIPATHD.</p>
<h4 id="total_disaster_note">TOTAL DISASTER NOTE<a class="headerlink" href="#total_disaster_note" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If the lvols that are associated with the VG are completely gone (i.e.
<code>vgchange -ay</code> completely fails out due to bad/broken disks). What you
could do prior to the recover, is to use the RHEL rescue image (i.e.
boot into rescue mode with multipath enabled), go ahead and re-create
your disks (i.e. pvcreate, kpartx -a, etc...), then go ahead and create
your VG's as well as your LVOLS(use the df.txt file that ReaR has coded
into their recovery agent if you need to take a quick look at how you
had once setup your filesystems). Once this is complete, stop right
there, boot into the rescue image you created with ReaR and then follow
the documented guide I have above. This will mean that all LVOLS are
completely empty and that TSM will then restore EVERYTHING that you
mount into /mnt/local/.</p>

<p>Just tested this twice. Still having issues restoring /boot on
/mnt/local/boot. Unsure what the issue is. Will keep trying a few
different ways to see what the deal is. But i believe this has to do
with grub running on multipath versus being on a standard block device.
Error is:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR:  BUG BUG BUG!  Unable to find any /boot partitions
=== Issue report ===
Please report this unexpected issue at:  https://github.com/rear/rear/issues.

<p>Tailing the log and looking at it shows the following:</p>

<p>Which is odd, because of the following output...</p>
<p><code>df -kh</code>, and then look at the bottom (last item mounted)</p>
<pre><code>/dev/mapper/mpatha1    509M  105M  405M  21% /mnt/local/boot
</code></pre>
<p>so it's mounted.... Unsure why it can't find the actual partition as it
is sitting in /mnt/local/.</p>
<p>Will boot into Linux rescue image and re-load grub from scratch as is
stated in the document I wrote above.</p>
<p>After grub rebuild of boot device. Reboot commencing...</p>
<p>running <code>multipath -r</code> and <code>multipath -v3</code> then rebooting once more.</p>
<p>####NOTES####</p>
<p>The above issue can be worked around. When mounting boot to
/mnt/local/boot, simply change the permissions of the boot folder to 755
to allow your backup agent to restore to this directory. Then once the
contents are restored, you may still see the above error, but you can
switch the permissions back to 555 and continue with the selinux and the
<code>/.autorelabel</code> portion.</p>

<p>So just tried another recovery. This time, I deleted
(<code>rm -Rf /etc; rm -Rf /var; rm -Rf /boot; rm -Rf /tmp</code>). So to
streamline my above document, I used the same iso image as I had created
before for this particular system.</p>
<p><code>shutdown -r now</code></p>
<p>mount up recovery ISO</p>
<p>Boot to ISO (1st option (manual mode)) do not do auto as this process is

<p>select file systems you wish to recover (1 2 3 4 21 22 23 (or whatever

<p>select 1 to continue for any continue/abort messages</p>
<p>let TSM take over and restore everything (including boot).</p>
<p>Will get an error that no boot partitions are found (even though I just

<p>Once done chmod 555 /mnt/local/boot</p>
<p><code>vi /mnt/local/etc/selinux/config</code></p>
<p>change enforcing to permissive.</p>
<p><code>touch /mnt/local/.autorelabel</code></p>
<p>reboot</p>
<p>system will come up, start the autorelabel process, and then reboot

<p>Just to give an update, trying a restore where REAR needs to be able to
rebuild an entire disk (i.e. your disk has failed, or you have migrated
to another system and need to rebuild from scratch). Currently the
output of ReaR tells me that the "disk layout has been created." But
this is a false echo message when running with multipath (nothing is
actually created). So i'm currently attempting to script this as a
pre-run script before the ReaR software contacts TSM (so that my
filesystems are created, and mounted via lvols into /mnt/local so that
even though there is no content, it can still be mounted and a TSM
restore can take place). Since the grub re-install is also not working
(if you whack your entire VG00 drive as well as the MBR for boot,
regardless if you restored /boot, you will still need to do the
following:</p>
<p>Pop in RHEL7 installation. Select boot/install, hit escape twice to get
to the boot: prompt of the DVD/ISO.</p>
<pre><code>linux rescue mpath

chroot /mnt/sysimage

mount /dev/mapper/mpathX1 /boot
</code></pre>
<p><code>grub2-install /dev/mapper/mpathX</code> (DO NOT SELECT THE PARTITION, this
must be an MBR record, so select the entire drive that is going to
contain your boot stuffs).</p>
<p><code>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</code> (this will re-scan your /boot
and default directories and hunt down any VMLINUZ images that you
currently have setup and will re-set them while writing the MBR to the
drive.</p>
<p>Ideally this needs to be scripted, but as the drives are failing to do a
full re-creation of partitions and lvols, that will need to be scripted
as well. Probably something to the effect of:</p>
<p>EDIT: I added some more logic and some corrections to my test machine to
get these mounted and created if for some reason your entire disk is
gone.</p>
<p>Obviously, as you can see, my boot drive and volume group are currently
hard coded for testing purposes, but will become variables that pull
from the system itself as time goes on, hence my cat output.recover |
awk lines, they aren't finished until I can spool up the test lab again
that is connected to our SAN infrastructure. But this will at least
create a disk from scratch, will then like to see it find the correct
disk from the original mkrescue image. But from a testing perspective,
it will rebuild vg00 (vg01 in my testing), complete with boot partition
and root partition and create the LVOLS and then mount them to
/mnt/local, then from that point forward, rear recover takes over and
restores the mounted filesystems from backup.</p>

<p>But I am still in the infancy with this particular task.</p>

<p>Wow - lots of information to absorb! Let start with the beginning: if
you define <code>BOOT_OVER_SAN=Y</code> (which is a wise thing to do for booting
over SAN as this is an exception for rear) then there should be <em>no</em>
need to add or redefine the array <code>REQUIRED_PROGS</code> in <code>local.conf</code><br />
If you could check this in recovery mode that all required executables
are present then we are already one step in the right direction.</p>
<p>For my understanding - an EMC gatekeeper is something similar as an
Hitachi (or HP) command device, however a command device has <code>wp=rw</code>
instead of EMC gatekeeper <code>wp=ro</code>. Therefore, it might depend (as
usual). It must be excluded from the device list (and to my proper
knowledge in rear that is already the case).</p>
<p>Another, important item is (not mentioned) the settings of the FC card
to make it bootable (at least in case of cloning to another HW). You
could come to the conclusion that rear is broken, but it could just be a
missing (or wrong) setting on the FC card (inside its BIOS).</p>
<p>I have the impression (but could be completely wrong here) that you make
it too complex to restore. But, it would be nice that I could test it
out myself (you can always hire me for a short period :).</p>
<p>You could have a look at
<code>./prep/GNU/Linux/24_include_multipath_tools.sh</code> and
<code>./rescue/GNU/Linux/27_fc_transport_info.sh</code> and give me some feedback
what could be added here. That would be a nice <em>step 2</em></p>

<p>Awesome! Thank you so much for getting back to me. I understand that you
guys are super busy. I have no issues taking a look at those shell
scripts and providing feedback. Also good information about the command
device being read/write as well. I was under the impression that most
gatekeeper type devices would be read only. As far as thh
required_progs in the local.conf, BOOT_OVER_SAN is most definitely
set to Y, so I'm unsure as to why I need multipathd and multipath in
there, but you will need to put them in there for sure (I have tested
this a few times, it's a must). As well as grub2 binaries being included
as well(i.e. if you need to rebuild your MBR/boot area). Currently GDHA,
we believe that the SCSI ID of our boot LUN was set improperly and so we
are working with our SAN team to get this ironed out. Once we have
corrected the SAN issue, we are going to kickstart our lab server again
and then I will be alotted more time to focus on getting this to work.
Ideally I am looking for you to point me in some direction where we need
more information, or maybe to get a rough construct across the finish
line that is at least somewhat workable. I will take a look at the Fibre
Channel info as well as the multipath_tools.sh and transport_info.sh
files once I can get the lab server back up and running.</p>
<p>Thank you again for responding to this post (where somehow i managed to
mess up the formatting). :-)</p>

</code></pre>
<p>So my test is to go inside /etc/ or something to this nature, and rm -Rf
*</p>
<p>Then, using my newly created iso image (dsmc i; rear mkrescue)</p>
<p>I can do the automatic recovery of the filesystem I have whacked (i.e.
rm -Rf *).</p>
<p>The issue:</p>
<p>At the very end of the restore process, grub complains that he could not
find a filesystem that has a boot partition, which is quite odd, because
my script mounts the boot partition to /mnt/local/boot</p>
<p>So if this was a bare metal restore, you will have to use a RHEL7 rescue
image to do the whole</p>
<pre><code>chroot /mnt/sysimage

grub2-install /dev/mapper/mpatha
</code></pre>
<p>and then:</p>
<pre><code>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>, and then finally reboot.</p>
<p>So, since my script is integrated as far as pulling boot and vg00
information from the df.txt file.</p>
<p>The problem is, even though I could write a script to put the
.autorelabel file in / and also to change the /etc/selinux/config
parameters to permissive mode, I would like to place this script in the
post_recovery script, but since my recovery errors on the grub portion,
the rear scripting set never actually gets that far(so putting that
script in the post would be frivolous because it never makes it that
far). So i'm looking for options from you and your team on how I could
get the grub portion to work.</p>
<p>However, what is nice is that even though it errors on the grub portion
that it could not find a boot partition, the process is actually 100%
complete with the restore and you can just reboot back to a fully
restored system (HOORAY!!!!!).</p>
<p>So at this point in time, we are literally 95% finished with making this
work, it's the last portion of the grub re-install that is the issue
(i.e. i fully tested this in automated mode this morning after blowing
away /var and /etc ).</p>
<p>Hope to hear back from you guys soon! -- MultipathMaster</p>

<p>Just wanted to provide an update that sometimes dhcp isn't loaded for
the network adapter, if this is the case, then doing the automatic
recovery will fail with TSM (our recover agent) not being able to get an
available IP address. Just hit option 2 when it fails to get to a shell
and simply 'dhclient <em>adapter_name</em>' and then re-run "rear recover" and
it should be good to go. Tested this again this morning by removing
/etc, /home, and /var, thus putting the system into a degraded state.
Using the above script at the beginning of the pre_recovery script
mounts everything that is required and restores. Simply reboot (even
though the error with grub is still present) and it will come back up
fully restored. Just another update. Thanks! -- MultipathMaster</p>

<p>Update, been scouring for days trying to figure out why grub re-install
isn't working. Finally found something super important from redhat
site....</p>
<p>Note: The grub-install command does not work for multipath devices.</p>
<p>Well shoot, that kinda shoots a giant hole in everything if grub-install
doesn't actually work for multipath devices. Will continue testing,
maybe coming up with a different way to get grub re-installed, the
initramfs work will be simple enough (dracut -f -v) , but getting grub
to install is certainly a challenge.</p>
<p>There might be a few different ways to do this, the first option that
I'm going to explore is going to be to get the multipath devices to fail
down to only one path (thus giving us a /dev/sdX number) and maybe grub
install can go ahead and install here, but the problem then being that
it won't boot up properly if /etc/fstab is showing that /dev/sdX
number..... Will update as I have more information to do so.</p>
<p>Thanks -- MultipathMaster</p>

<p>Just to provide an update. I have opened a case with redhat regarding
not having standard grub included with RHEL7. This whole grub thing can
be sorted out if the standard packaged grub comes with the system out of
the box (can script some answers and pipe them into grub in order to
re-write the MBR and boot partition). I will update you guys whenever I
have heard some information back from redhat.</p>

<p>Still waiting on redhat. They have apparently setup a similar setup in
their lab and are conducting testing.</p>

<p>I have gotten this to work, currently still in the lab testing with a
senior resource from redhat, as soon as this is completed I will update
you guys with my findings, it's starting to look like we might not need
grub2-install to be run at all for the final steps of restoring, we
might actually use dd to get the MBR and GRUB partition, save it to a
small image file, restore that with the TSM run, and instead of doing a
grub2-install at the end, we will run dd to restore from that image back
to the root drive in question. Just an update, but I should have more
notes by the end of the day, with a completed script without all of the
dirty stuff.</p>

<p>Okay, gents, here are my findings while working with redhat as well as a
few other resources.<br />
The following is what you will need if you are using RHEL7.X, along with
boot from SAN, multipath enabled, while also using LVM for volume
groups:</p>
<p><code>multipath -ll</code> (find a block device for the main root disk)<br />
<code>dd if=/dev/sdX of=/usr/share/rear/custom/boot.mbr.img bs=512 count=1</code>

<p>To re-create the MBR for boot, working with redhat yielded that using dd
is the best option. So we run the dd string before and output the img
file to /usr/share/rear/custom prior to the mkrescue.</p>
<p>I know this has stripped a majority of the scripts from this process,
however because of the delicacy of using it with boot from san, as well
as multipath, it was required to get this working and functioning. As
ReaR is going to be included with RHEL7.2 (talking to the redhat
engineers), they helped me figure out exactly what was wrong with
grub2-install, and have created a KCS article for this very issue.</p>
<p>Also, each time you patch and put a new kernel on the system, the dd as
well as the mkrescue should be re-run to re-create an image that points
to the correct kernel that the system is running. Feel free to leave me
any feedback, but in all honesty this should get anyone that is using
multipath/lvm/boot from SAN, as well as TSM, across the finish line. My
hope being that you guys can use this information going forward to make
this a bit more streamlined.</p>

<p>@multipathmaster @schlomo could you share some info about this issue if
it is still hot? If we integrate this in rear it should be with prep
scripts and finalize scripts, right?</p>

<p>Sorry to re-open this gents, I finally have some time dedicated back to
this project and will update this issue accordingly. We have streamlined
the module method that Schlomo has shown us, and have slowly been
getting this to install properly with puppet (i.e. ensure a version, and
then install our custom module that will utilize the mrecover module
method). I will update this shortly with additional information that has
been gathered by also utilizing the livecd-creator to create a bootable
image that we are going to be using for troubleshooting.</p>

<p>No feedback since more than one year<br />
indicate that this issue has become outdated<br />
so that I like to close it now.<br />
If needed it could be reopened but preferably<br />
file a new issue based on a current rear version.</p>
