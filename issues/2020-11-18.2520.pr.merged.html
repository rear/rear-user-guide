<p>How was this pull request tested?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Works well for me.<br />
On my openSUSE Laep 15.1 system I get during "rear -D mkrescue"</p>
<pre><code>Included current keyboard mapping (via 'dumpkeys -f')
Included fallback US keyboard mapping /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwerty/defkeymap.map.gz
Included other keyboard mappings in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps
</code></pre>
<p>But I did not test the various failure cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brief description of the changes in this pull request:</li>
</ul>
<p>Inform the user about possible issues with keyboard usage in the
recovery system<br />
but use neutral wording for those user messages to avoid false alarm<br />
except when it fails to include the current keyboard mapping<br />
(which is no fatal Error because the US keyboard mapping is included as
fallback).</p>
<p>The actual reason behind why the changes here are needed is<br />
that it seems newer Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu)<br />
no longer contain any keymaps directory as part of the base system,
cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-729264699">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-729264699</a><br />
so those distros do no longer provide console-multi-keyboard support by
default.<br />
In such cases ReaR aligns with what there is without being needlessly
verbose.</p>
<p>If the distro provides console-multi-keyboard support, ReaR includes it
(without being verbose).<br />
If the distro has decided that this is not necessary, ReaR aligns with
it (without being verbose).<br />
If the user has installed multi-keyboard support, ReaR aligns with it
(without being verbose).<br />
Cf.
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2520#issuecomment-729681053">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2520#issuecomment-729681053</a></p>
<p>Only when including the current keyboard mapping failed (i.e. when
'dumpkeys' failed)<br />
it shows subsequent messages on the user's terminal in any case (via
LogPrint and LogPrintError)<br />
but normally it shows subsequent messages only in debug mode (via
DebugPrint).</p>

<p>Thanks for picking this up. I'm now getting these messages on Ubuntu:</p>
<pre><code>No fallback US keyboard mapping included (no KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY specified)
No support for different keyboard layouts (neither KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY nor KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES specified)
</code></pre>
<p>The wording is certainly better, but it still gives the impression that
something might be wrong here (in particular, as these are the <em>only</em>
messages appearing). More importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The motivation for these messages may not be apparent to users (see
    below).</li>
<li>The messages lack guidance on what to do about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I try to put myself into two different user's shoes:</p>
<ul>
<li>US keyboard user<ul>
<li>"I have a US keyboard. Is this not included? What is a fallback?
    Why should I care about different keyboard layouts at all?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>German keyboard user<ul>
<li>"I have a German keyboard and never touched anything else. I
    have heard from the older guys that there was a time when US
    keyboards were seen in Germany. Not these days. Why would there
    be a need for some "fallback"?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So of course, your mileage may vary, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>ReaR's <a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style">Coding Style</a>
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless usr/sbin/rear was launched with '-v' or '-d' or '-D' <strong>there
should be no output on the user's terminal</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schlomo says in <a href="https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html">WARNING is a waste of my
time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNINGS for most cases only create extra manual work because somebody
needs to go and check some log file and decide if there actually is a
problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: It does not really matter if the word <code>WARNING</code> appears. Someone
has to make a decision. If there are two messages, that means spending
time on two decisions. In addition, if there are no directions, if means
investing more time to research the issue.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyboard issues might no longer be relevant today with <code>ssh</code> use
    for rack servers and non-local keyboards being the rare exception
    elsewhere.</li>
<li>The notion of having a "fallback keyboard" may not be clear to
    users.</li>
<li>If ReaR runs on a system configured for a US keyboard, the message
    <code>No fallback US keyboard mapping included</code> is wrong. The standard
    keyboard is the "fallback keyboard".</li>
</ul>
<p>My conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two messages is at least one too much.</li>
<li>ReaR should not simply complain but rather provide helpful guidance
    on what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider my suggestion in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-729264699">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-729264699</a>:</p>
<pre><code>TIP: To support different keyboard layouts, see 'KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY' in 'default.conf'.
</code></pre>
<p>With a message like this, you could put in additional commentary in
<code>default.conf</code> explaining the situation better than any message could
do. There you could describe why a different keyboard layout might need
to be supported and what could be done about it (e.g. installing
packages, setting variables).</p>

<p>@OliverO2<br />
thank you for your comments!<br />
I will need some time to think about it.<br />
As always sleeping over it should help me.</p>
<p>Unless usr/sbin/rear was launched with '-v' or '-d' or '-D'<br />
there should be no output on the user's terminal<br />
of course unless there is something important to say to the user<br />
and because of the reasons in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781</a><br />
my current personal opinion is that messages about possible issues<br />
with the keyboard in the recovery system are important to notify<br />
the user in any case.</p>
<p>I may consider your suggestion if at least the <code>TIP</code> was removed<br />
for example something like</p>
<pre><code>To include different keyboard layouts set KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY (see default.conf)
</code></pre>
<p>because personally I hate it when computers give me (unsolicited) tips<br />
what those machines "think" that I should preferably do.<br />
"Shut up I am 'root' - I know what I do" ;-)</p>

only when 'dumpkeys' failed it shows subsequent messages on the user's

<p>@OliverO2<br />
does in now behave better in your environment?</p>
<p>I don't like it so much now because now the code looks somewhat
oversophisticated.<br />
But I like to find out how to get your needs any my needs aligned as far
as possible.</p>

<p>@jsmeix<br />
Wow, that must have been a short night! ;-)</p>
<p>I would not call it over-sophisticated, but user-friendly: ReaR now
follows what Linux distributions have decided (and what their users now
are used to). If the distro includes console-multi-keyboard support,
ReaR has it (without asking). If the distro has decided that this is not
necessary, ReaR aligns with that decision. If a user has decided to
install multi-keyboard support, ReaR again will pick it up. Looks just
right.</p>
<p>I ran the new code on my Ubuntu system and now there is no output
appearing. Ideal from my point of view. ReaR does the right thing, I can
relax. ;-)</p>
<p>This is what a had just written before your new commit came in:</p>
<hr />
<p>Take your time!</p>
<p>Now I see that you consider "TIP" as some imperative from a machine
pretending to know better. I have never thought of it that way. For me
"TIP" is just a friendly reminder because the machine does not know what
you might want to do and you might not know what the machine has in
store for you. ;-) I stuck with "TIP" because there are many places in
ReaR where this is used and I wanted to be consistent.</p>
<p>I usually get upset if software starts to throw nonsense at me or if its
programmer was too lazy to figure out what is going on, back-delegates
the decision to me and fails to provide me with necessary information.</p>

<p>@OliverO2<br />
thank you for your prompt reply.<br />
I will sleep over it nevertheless and<br />
if I am still satified with it tomorrow I will "just merge" it.</p>
<p>Regarding the wording <code>TIP</code>:</p>
<p>I perceive the wording "TIP" as some kind of patronizing behaviour from
a machine.</p>
<p>For the fun of it a side note:<br />
I had an uncle in Westphalia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia</a><br />
who told me that one of the things that he doesn't like is<br />
"a good advice from someone else when things went wrong"<br />
and what makes him even angy is<br />
"a good advice that is true from someone else when things went wrong"<br />
;-)</p>
<p>Regarding your</p>
<pre><code>I stuck with "TIP" because there are many places in ReaR
where this is used and I wanted to be consistent
</code></pre>
<p>I only find it in your code:</p>
<pre><code># find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -i 'tip[:]* ' | grep -v 'gethostip'

<p>@jsmeix<br />
Thank you for taking care of it and for going the extra mile.</p>

<p>I only find it in your code:</p>

<p>Oh, really! It must be because ReaR has become too smart over time. In
the past there was:</p>
<ul>
<li>b3db59e10da3885ac287e41a7c341bab50e08f05 (Florent38 committed on Jul
    17, 2013)</li>

    26, 2012)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Some other TIPs are present in the documentation.)</p>
<p>And I was so convinced that the "TIP" prefix was not my idea at all...
;-)</p>

<p>Guess who removed that <code>TIP</code> wording via<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/df1d9623f6202f7908e6be8787211b4787626107">https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/df1d9623f6202f7908e6be8787211b4787626107</a><br />
:-)</p>
<p>Good evolution:<br />
From scaring <code>WARNING</code> to patronizing <code>TIP</code> to nothing :-)</p>
<p>When there is a <code>TIP</code> in the documentation I don't perceive it as
patronizing<br />
because I don't perceive reading documentation as if someone is talking
to me.<br />
In contrast working on a computer is some kind of dialog with a
machine<br />
and I don't like to get (unsolicited) good advice from a machine:</p>
<pre><code>user@host $ rm -rf ~
Removed all files in your own home directory.
TIP: Now it's time for having a good backup.

<p>I tested it with artificial errors and (at least for me) things behave
well<br />
for "rear mkrescue" / "rear -v mkrescue" / "rear -d mkrescue".</p>
<p>Artificial error in rescue/GNU/Linux/500_clone_keyboard_mappings.sh</p>
<pre><code>if dumpkeysQQQ -f &gt;$ROOTFS_DIR$original_system_dumpkeys_file ; then
</code></pre>
<p>to let that fail.</p>
<p>Artificial error on openSUSE Leap 15.1:</p>
<pre><code># mv /usr/share/kbd/keymaps /usr/share/kbd/keymaps.away
</code></pre>
