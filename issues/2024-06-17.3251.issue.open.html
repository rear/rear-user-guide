<p>Moved from
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239</a>
.</p>
<p>I am less concerned with builds (they only rarely fail) and more
concerned with tests (they fail fairly often, so it is a more pressing
issue). We need to pay attention to failing tests, because they may mean
either that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the PR introduces a regression and should not be merged</li>
<li>something changed in the distro that we test against, so the PR can
    be merged, but we still need to know about it and fix the issue ASAP</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first case, "if it is broken then eventually somebody will fix
it" is not the right approach. The PR author needs to fix it, and not
"eventually", but before the PR is merged.</p>
<p>For this we need the test to be not flaky. "continuously failing
building and testing against unknown Linux distro versions" is not even
the worst case (if it continuously fails, it is probably a case of point
2.) . The worst case is that tests fail randomly. If tests fail for
random reason too often, we will learn that we should disregard them and
cases of point 1. will creep in.</p>
<p>I understand @schlomo 's view</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see value in continuously building and testing against unknown Linux
distro versions, because that gives us an early warning for problems
that our users might be facing tomorrow.<br />
Yes, there is - and will be - a permanent risk of such builds failing
for external, e.g. non-ReaR, reasons. IMHO this is an accepted risk
and in the end we still benefit more from the continued validation
than what we suffer from the flaky builds. For me this is a trade-off
decision where I choose the information provided or confirmation
supplied by these builds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but also @jsmeix 's</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When automated tests result too many false positives<br />
those automated tests do more harm than good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is: should we test on development versions of distros (in
our case, Fedora Rawhide for now)? We will catch incompatibilities with
updates to the distro, but won't the occasional false positives due to
unrelated breakage in the distro hide true test failures and lead us to
ignoring them?</p>

<p>@pcahyna thank you and good catch:</p>

<p>I'm totally fine with not doing anything on development versions of
Linux distros and rather solve problems when we see them on the released
versions. In any case I don't expect a distro to fix something because
ReaR stopped working.</p>
<p>BTW, #2972 was a nice example of an upstream problem that I found where
maybe (at least I like to believe that) we were helpful in getting it
fixed faster - because our CI found it and I followed up on it and it
turned out to be an upstream bug.</p>

<p>@schlomo well,
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972</a>
contradicts your "I don't expect a distro to fix something because ReaR
stopped working". If you mean "only because ReaR stopped working and
nothing else", even if the distro does not fix the incompatible change
that breaks our use, we still need to develop a fix on our side, so we
need to know about it.</p>
<p>As a compromise, I think I'll enable testing on <code>fedora-branched</code> (
<a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration#aliases">https://packit.dev/docs/configuration#aliases</a>
). This includes all supported stable versions, as well as the version
that was branched from the development branch (rawhide) and is
undergoing stabilization in order to become the next stable version.
Testing on it will hopefully allow us enough time to catch issues due to
distribution changes before the stable distribution version release,
while avoiding most of the breakage associated with Rawhide.</p>
<p>(This is for longer term; in the short term I will disable even the F40
stable version though due to a known but incompletely understood test
failure as discussed elsewhere.)</p>

<p>yes @pcahyna that is indeed an anti-example. I was thinking if I should
change ReaR to not use the broken <code>cp</code> option, but then I decided that I
first want to try reporting it upstream and simply waiting for upstream
to fix it. Which happened in the end. If this would have been for a
release that had to go out then I would indeed have changed ReaR as a
workaround (and reverted that for the next release).</p>

<p>Clarification of my unclear wording:<br />
With<br />
"continuously failing building and testing<br />
against unknown Linux distro versions"<br />
I actually meant the worst case<br />
that continuously this or that tests fail randomly<br />
so we are continuously hit by various false alarms.<br />
I did not mean that specific tests fail continuously.</p>

<p>Regarding</p>
<pre><code>We need to pay attention to failing tests, because they may mean
...
2. something changed in the distro that we test against,
   so the PR can be merged, but we still need to know about it
   and fix the issue ASAP
</code></pre>
<p>"Tertium datur!" ;-)</p>
<p>When a test for a specific distribution fails<br />
for a longer time (i.e. considered "continuously"),<br />
it my not mean we have to fix something in ReaR.</p>
<p>When that specific distribution is not a stable release<br />
but something that changes, then a test that fails<br />
for a longer time could be a bug in that distribution<br />
which will be eventually fixed by that distribution,<br />
e.g. as in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972</a></p>
<p>Only when this bug in that distribution is not fixed<br />
when that distribution is released, then we may think<br />
about implementing a workaround in ReaR - but this<br />
requires that there is someone who uses that distribution<br />
and who contributes the workaround - i.e. as in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173907303">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173907303</a></p>
<p>Because of my above reasoning I still think<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2173626556">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2173626556</a></p>
<pre><code>I would prefer - if possible - is that our CI tests
run in stable environments that are under our control
</code></pre>
<p>i.e. theat we run the CI tests only on (stable) released<br />
Linux distribution versions, same as @schlomo wrote in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173857729">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173857729</a></p>
<pre><code>I'm totally fine with not doing anything
on development versions of Linux distros and
rather solve problems when we see them
on the released versions.
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand I fully understand when @pcahyna<br />
would like to test on development versions of<br />
the distro he personally cares about (Fedora Rawhide)<br />
because he may like to know early when there are issues<br />
in Fedora Rawhide that affect ReaR, e.g. to avoid early<br />
that such issues later hit Red Hat customers who use RHEL.</p>
<p>The crucial difference here is that<br />
when @pcahyna enables tests on Fedora Rawhide<br />
and when he cares about "his" test results<br />
then all is well and I really appreciate it<br />
because test failures on Fedora Rawhide may<br />
indicate early a generic issue in ReaR,<br />
e.g. because of a newer version of some software<br />
as in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3021">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3021</a></p>
<p>In contrast when we enable tests on various<br />
development versions of Linux distros<br />
but there is no dedicated person (maintainer)<br />
who cares about those test results,<br />
then at least I feel somewhat annoyed by<br />
"randomly failing tests" and all I could do<br />
in this case with reasonable effort is to<br />
simply ignore particular failing tests<br />
(i.e. tests where the root cause of the failure<br />
is not obvious to me with reasonable effort).</p>

<p>Don't rely on "bug will be eventually fixed" without our action. In many
cases, we will need to actively report the bug on order to get it fixed,
otherwise nobody will care. This is especially the case for obscure
features of otherwise standard software that do not affect anyone else
if they get broken. So, even if we don't implement a workaround in ReaR,
we still need to know about the problem in order to get the maintainers
fix it.</p>

<p>The main question is, if a test on rawhide fails on a PR, what will you
(or other maintainers) do? Debug the cause of the test failure? Ask me
to debug it and wait with merging until the cause is known? Or just
merge the PR despite the test failing? In the third case, won't that
lead you to gradually ignore all test failures, even when they occur on
stable versions where the likelihood of the failure being a real bug is
much higher?</p>
<p>If there is a risk that the third case would apply, I prefer not testing
on rawhide (see
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173885768">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173885768</a>
for a compromise solution that would IMO bring lots of the benefits
without most of the drawbacks).</p>

regarding the first part:<br />
Simply put in practice I can only care about (open)SUSE<br />
because I have basically no time for other distributions.</p>
<p>Regarding the second part:<br />
I only meant that you could enable tests on whatever<br />
distribution you like provided you care about its<br />
test results. I did not mean you should enable<br />
tests on Fedora Rawhide - but you could if you<br />
care about its test results.</p>
<p>In general:<br />
I am against CI tests on a Linux distribution<br />
(regardless how many users it has "out there")<br />
when we have noone here at ReaR upstream<br />
who actively cares about that Linux distribution,<br />
cf. what I wrote about Ubuntu and Canonical in<br />

<p>Bottom line from my point of view:<br />
It is not about what would be good to do or good to have.<br />
It is about what we can get done with reasonable effort.</p>
<p>E.g. since about one year I wished a new ReaR release<br />
could get done - but see how long we need in practice<br />
for such a very basic task to get it actually done.<br />
So all what might delay us getting our basic tasks<br />
done should be avoided as far as possible.</p>

<p>I will care about the CI results - I already do.</p>
<p>Even then it entails waiting with PR merges on me debugging CI failures
sometimes - is that acceptable for you?</p>
<p>Are you willing to have a quick look at CI test failures on your PRs
yourself first, please? From time to time there will be actual bugs
introduced and initial investigation by the PR author would save me some
work. Just as you did in
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128#issuecomment-1892136367">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128#issuecomment-1892136367</a>
where you correctly identified that the failures are something to
investigate in more detail.</p>
<p>I understand that you may not have the time for this, but then I will
not be able to enable rawhide tests, as the load would be too high.</p>

<pre><code>When automated tests result too many false positives
those automated tests do more harm than good.

I think more than one or two percent false positives
is already when it does more harm than good.

When for each pull request 10 automated tests are run
and each on has 98% reliability, then the overall
reliability is only 82% (0.98 ^ 10 = 0.817)
so every 5th CI failure is a false positive.

To have 98% overall reliability (for 10 CI tests)
each one must have 99.8% reliability
(0.998 ^ 10 = 0.980).

With "reliability" I mean that a failing CI test
correctly indentifies an issue in our own code.

the automated tests were rather new for me<br />
so I cared and paid attention to failing tests<br />
because a failed CI thing was interesting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile for any pull requests there are basically<br />
always some CI things that fail (regardless what kind<br />
of CI thing fails - basically always something fails).</p>
<p>So I became rather accustomed to failed CI things<br />
and because most failed CI things were not caused<br />
by the actual code changes, failed CI things became<br />
no longer interesting but "just some normal noise"<br />
that one better "simply ignores".</p>
<p>Actually when something is mostly only noise<br />
one must ignore the noise to be able to still focus<br />
on what one actually wants to get done - otherwise<br />
if one would listen to noise (pay attention to noise)<br />
one could not get done what one actually wants to get done.</p>
<p>So my current ignorance of failed CI things is<br />
a necessity or a way out for me so that I still<br />
can get done what I actually want to get done.</p>

<p>@jsmeix exactly, and that's why I think disabling Rawhide tests is a
good thing to do despite missing the opportunities to catch important
changes or bugs in the distribution early. Hopefully the CI will be all
green most of the time then and developers will start paying attention
to it again.</p>
