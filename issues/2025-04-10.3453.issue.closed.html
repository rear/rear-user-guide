<p>I think I was able to backup to tape with OBDR,<br />
but I can't figure out how/if I can boot my server from it.<br />
Taped Drive is IBM TS2290 and Server is Lenovo SR650V3.<br />
Can't find out anything from IBM or Lenovo's website.</p>
<p>Writing iso to CD and burning is a pain<br />
and the servers don't have an internal optical drive,<br />
so I thought I'd boot from USB flash,<br />
then let it restore from the Tape.</p>
<p>The USB drive boots into command line,<br />
I log in as root and run the rescue.<br />
I get</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: No 'backup.tar.gz' detected in /var/tmp/rear.blahblahblah/outputfs/rear/servername/*
</code></pre>
<p>ls verifies there is nothing under /var/tmp.</p>
<p>Seems like it's looking for the backup data on the local filesystem?</p>
<p>Here's local.conf contents:</p>
<pre><code>OUTPUT=USB
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
BACKUP=NETFS
</code></pre>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>I've used this before with a network SMB share<br />
and I was impressed, but this has got me so frustrated.<br />
Been working with rear for 3 days with various issues<br />
and have yet to make one successful backup/restore.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>@DebianGuru Could you share the output of <code>lsscsi</code> and <code>lsmod</code> so we can
see the modules involved around the tape drive.<br />
According the data sheet of IBM TS2290 we cannot figure out if the drive
is OBDR capable. Perhaps, IBM support can assist you on that point?
Perhaps you need a special software driver or configuration setup on the
drive itself?</p>
<p>Does your system uses UEFI to boot?<br />
If yes then you first need to format your USB drive as following:<br />
<code>rear -v -- --efi /dev/sdb</code> (assuming /dev/sdb is your USB drive - it
will reformat the <strong>whole</strong> USB disk!)<br />
If not, use:<br />
<code>rear -v format /dev/sdb</code></p>
<p>Then edit the <code>/etc/rear/local.conf</code> file and define:</p>
<pre><code>OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
# is the tape rewinded?
TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
BACKUP=NETFS
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this help?</p>

<p>@DebianGuru</p>
<p>first and foremost:<br />
Using ReaR with tape drives is not something I ever did.<br />
I never used a tape device with Linux<br />
so I cannot really help with tape device issues.</p>
<p>In general:<br />
We at ReaR upstream did not get user issues since years<br />
regarding using ReaR with tape drives and in particular<br />
no further user contributions in this area.<br />
The last one we got was via<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637</a><br />
and even that finally faded away in July 2023<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637#issuecomment-1620667477">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637#issuecomment-1620667477</a></p>
<p>So all I can provide is some generic thoughts<br />
what might help in your specific case:</p>
<p>I think the first thing to have in mind is that<br />
in ReaR the "backup of the system files" part<br />
is a separated and somewhat "external" part<br />
of what ReaR's actual task is, see<br />
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore">https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore</a></p>
<p>For each backup method which is supported in ReaR there is<br />
a matching usr/share/rear/restore/METHOD directory.<br />
That there is no usr/share/rear/restore/TAPE directory<br />
tells me that there is no generic TAPE backup method<br />
which is supported in ReaR.<br />
There is only usr/share/rear/restore/OBDR but this directory<br />
is basically empty - in particular there is no ReaR script.<br />
This tells me that the OBDR backup method is rather special<br />
and not a generic backup method for tape devices.<br />
Because I never used a tape device with Linux<br />
I may not see things which are obvious<br />
for users who actually use a tape device.</p>
<p>The primary functionality of ReaR is to make a bootable<br />
ReaR recovery system which contains the ReaR installer<br />
(i.e. what is run via "rear recover") which can recreate<br />
the storage setup (called "disk layout" in ReaR)<br />
same as it was before on the original system.<br />
Afterwards as last step during "rear recover"<br />
the "backup of the system files" is restored<br />
into the recreated storage.</p>
<p>ReaR provides a very generic and rather crude backup method<br />
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE<br />
This is ReaR's default/fallback backup method<br />
when no BACKUP is specified by the user.<br />
The BACKUP method REQUESTRESTORE is not real backup method<br />
but simply halts the recovery and requests that somebody<br />
will restore the data into the recreated storage.</p>
<p>So when you have your "backup of the system files"<br />
on a tape drive and use BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE<br />
together with OUTPUT=USB<br />
then "rear mkbackup" is useless because<br />
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does not make a backup of the files<br />
so only "rear mkrescue" is needed and that will make<br />
a ReaR recovery system which is bootable from USB.</p>
<p>When you boot that ReaR recovery system on replacement<br />
hardware and inside the running ReaR recovery system<br />
you call "rear recover" you will get your storage setup<br />
recreated same as it was before on the original system<br />
and the recreated (empty) storage will be mounted<br />
inside the running ReaR recovery system at /mnt/local</p>
<p>Then "rear recover" halts and requests you to restore<br />
your "backup of the system files" from your tape drive<br />
into /mnt/local</p>
<p>To do that everything what is needed for the backup restore<br />
(e.g. kernel modules for the tape drive, programs to use the<br />
tape drive, config files for the tape drive, whatever else)<br />
must be included in the ReaR recovery system.</p>
<p>ReaR provides generic ways to get things included<br />
in the ReaR recovery system.<br />
Those are (see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)</p>
<pre><code>MODULES
FIRMWARE_FILES
REQUIRED_PROGS
LIBS
COPY_AS_IS
</code></pre>
<p>So with BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE<br />
plus appropriate settings as needed for<br />
MODULES FIRMWARE_FILES REQUIRED_PROGS LIBS COPY_AS_IS<br />
you can set up ReaR to be able to manually restore<br />
a backup from a tape drive during "rear recover".</p>
<p>Of course this requires manual try and error<br />
step by step legwork until it will work.</p>

<p>@DebianGuru</p>
<p>in addition and/or alternatively to BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE<br />
we also have BACKUP=EXTERNAL see its description in<br />
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf</p>
<p>In contrast to BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE<br />
BACKUP=EXTERNAL has ReaR scripts to make a backup via "rear mkbackup"<br />
usr/share/rear/backup/EXTERNAL/default/500_make_backup_with_external.sh<br />
and to restore it during "rear recover"<br />
usr/share/rear/restore/EXTERNAL/default/500_restore_with_external.sh<br />
so with BACKUP=EXTERNAL and appropriate settings for the<br />
user config variables</p>
<pre><code>EXTERNAL_...
MODULES
FIRMWARE_FILES
REQUIRED_PROGS
LIBS
COPY_AS_IS
</code></pre>
<p>I think it should be possible to set up ReaR so that<br />
"rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" behave as usual<br />
with making and restoring a backup on tape drive.</p>
<p>It is ages ago when I tried last BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE<br />
and BACKUP=EXTERNAL so I have no personal experience<br />
how the current state of both is.</p>
<p>If special command are needed<br />
e.g. to somehow prepare the tape drive<br />
see<br />
PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT and POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT<br />
(for "rear mkbackup")<br />
and<br />
PRE_RECOVERY_COMMANDS / PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT and<br />
POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT / POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS<br />
(for "rear recover")<br />
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf</p>

<p>@DebianGuru</p>
<p>FYI regarding your question in your initial description</p>
<pre><code>Seems like it's looking for the backup data on the local filesystem?
</code></pre>
<p>What is at /var/tmp/rear.blahblahblah/outputfs/...<br />
is normally not a local filesystem because<br />
with BACKUP=NETFS this is normally a mountpoint directory<br />
where "usually a network share" from a remote host<br />
is locally mounted, see the BACKUP=NETFS description in<br />
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf</p>
<pre><code>NETFS is an internal backup method that saves the backup
into a mounted directory.
This is usually a network share, but can also be used
to create a backup to a local disk (by providing your
own BACKUP_MOUNTCMD and BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD commands
that mount the local disk.
</code></pre>
<p>If you could mount your tape drive so that its contents<br />
appear as regular files within a mountpoint directory<br />
then it should be possible to somehow "misuse"<br />
BACKUP=NETFS with BACKUP_MOUNTCMD and BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD<br />
for storing and restoring a backup on a tape drive.</p>
<p>Again:<br />
I know nothing about tape drives so I have no idea<br />
whether or not mounting a tape drive makes any sense.</p>
<p>Mounting a tape drive would require that there is some<br />
kind of filesystem on the tape drive so that its contents<br />
could appear as regular files within a mountpoint directory.</p>
<p>I only try to explain some generic background information<br />
that might help you to better understand how ReaR behaves<br />
so you might be able to find a way how you could use ReaR<br />
to store and restore a backup on your tape drive.</p>

<p>Solved. I was missing "USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000" as
suggested by @gdha . Many thanks to all who provided replies.</p>
