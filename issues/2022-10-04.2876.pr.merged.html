<ul>
<li>
<p>Type: <strong>New Feature</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact: <strong>High</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>High impact only on systems where 'barrel' exists.</p>
<p>There should be no change (and no impact) on other systems<br />
regarding the actual disk layout recreation via diskrestore.sh<br />
(i.e. nothing of the actual disk layout recreation<br />
via diskrestore.sh is changed).</p>
<p>There are visible changes on all systems<br />
regarding the choices in the user dialogs<br />
during "rear recover" that are improved<br />
so that users have now more options what to do<br />
and what should happen during "rear recover".<br />
There was no change what the default choice is<br />
so the default behaviour of "rear recover" is same as before<br />
unless BARREL_DEVICEGRAPH is explicitly set to true by the user.</p>
<p>In particular users can now additionally choose:</p>
<p>"Skip wiping disks"<br />
Before there was no way to do that without changing<br />
/etc/rear/local.conf and restarting "rear recover".</p>
<p>"Again wipe the disks in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED"<br />
Before there was no way to do that during "rear recover".<br />
The only way was to abort "rear recover" and restart it.</p>
<p>"Show what is currently on the disks ('lsblk' block devices list)"<br />
Before there was no easy way to see what is currently on the disks.<br />
The only way was to use the ReaR shell and manually type<br />
e.g. an appropriate 'lsblk' command.</p>
<p>"Confirm what is currently on the disks and continue 'rear recover'"<br />
Before there was no way to do that.<br />
The only way was to fix diskrestore.sh and re-run it until all is OK<br />
or do something via ReaR shell and re-run barrel until all is OK.<br />
But the user might also fix things (in particular smaller things)<br />
by only using the ReaR shell and then confirm what he created<br />
on his disks and continue with restoring the backup.</p>
<p>Those additional options during "rear recover" became useful<br />
and needed by me while I did my various tests with 'barrel'<br />
so those additional options during "rear recover" are a direct<br />
consequence of the added support for a second method how to<br />
recreate the disk layout - in particular when I first used<br />
'barrel' and then switched back to 'diskrastore.sh' where<br />
I needed to "Again wipe the disks in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED"<br />
and where I liked to see what is currently on the disks.</p>
<p>The BARREL_DEVICEGRAPH and BARREL_MAPPING_FILE config variables<br />
are curently not documented in default.conf because the names<br />
and semantics of 'barrel' config variables may change during<br />
the currently ongoing development of 'barrel' support.</p>

</ul>
<p>Several tests on my SLES15 SP4 test VM<br />
with the default SUSE storage structure:</p>
<pre><code># lsblk -ipo NAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINTS

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Brief description of the changes in this pull request:</li>
</ul>
<p>In layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh<br />
added the new storage layout recreation method<br />
<code>Recreating storage layout with 'barrel' devicegraph</code><br />
as optional alternative to recreating with diskrestore.sh<br />
when the config variable BARREL_DEVICEGRAPH is 'true'<br />
plus an option to switch from 'barrel' back to diskrestore.sh.</p>
<p>Additionally there are the new options<br />
<code>Show what is currently on the disks ('lsblk' block devices list)</code><br />
and<br />
<code>Again wipe those disks ...</code> in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED<br />
to check after a failed attempt what was recreated and<br />
to redo the recreation from scratch on clean disks.</p>

<p>Currently this implements only very basic 'barrel' support.</p>
<p>In particular support for 'barrel' device mapping<br />
during "rear recover" via user dialogs in MIGRATION_MODE<br />
is currently missing.</p>
<p>Current 'barrel' device mapping must be done manually via</p>
<pre><code>BARREL_MAPPING_FILE="/etc/barrel-mapping.json"
COPY_AS_IS+=( $BARREL_MAPPING_FILE )
</code></pre>
<p>in etc/rear/local.conf with an appropriate manually created<br />
/etc/barrel-mapping.json file with content for example like</p>
<pre><code>{
    "mapping" : {
        "/dev/sda" : "/dev/disk/by-id/ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00001"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>which works for me for my KVM/QEMU test VMs because<br />
all my VMs have <code>/dev/disk/by-id/ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00001</code><br />
as a symbolic link that points to ../../sda</p>

<p>@gdha @pcahyna @rear/contributors<br />
I would appreciate it very much<br />
if you could have a look at my code changes<br />
whether or not they look backward compatible to you.</p>
<p>I will do some more tests tomorrow<br />
and when there are no objections<br />
I would like to merge it on Friday afternoon<br />
to get some initial very basic 'barrel' support<br />
as a first step - further enhancements will happen<br />
afterwards via separated pull requests as needed.</p>

<p>@jsmeix I will not be able to review the change this week, as I am
leaving now. But according to the description, the "barrel" tool sounds
very promising for use in ReaR.</p>

<p>@jsmeix I'm not familiar with "barrel", so, not much input from my side.
However, if you feel okay with it please proceed.</p>

<p>@gdha<br />
thank you for your feedback.<br />
I do not expect you or other ReaR contributors (except me)<br />
to know about 'barrel' or to even learn what 'barrel' is.<br />
I only liked to get feedback from a general point of view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There should be no change (and no impact) on other systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had only a quick look at the change and I see some code changes in
places that are not protected by <code>if is_true "$BARREL_DEVICEGRAPH"</code>.
Especially in
usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/120_confirm_wipedisk_disks.sh
and usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh .
It may be the case that the changes do not change anything when <code>barrel</code>
is not in use, but it is far from obvious and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally there are the new options<br />
Show what is currently on the disks ('lsblk' block devices list)<br />
and<br />
Again wipe those disks ... in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED<br />
to check after a failed attempt what was recreated and<br />
to redo the recreation from scratch on clean disks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>seems to contradict it.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to separate the barrel-related changes from the
disk-wiping changes?</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
thank you for having a look!</p>
<p>I enhanced my initial description of this pull request<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2876#issue-1395991143">https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2876#issue-1395991143</a><br />
that now explains why those additional user dialog choices<br />
got added together with the actual 'barrel' support.</p>
<p>In theory I could separate those additional user dialog choices<br />
from the actual 'barrel' support but in practice I needed<br />
those additional user dialog choices while I was using<br />
'barrel' and 'diskrestore.sh' alternately during one same<br />
'rear recover' run so in practice all that belongs together.</p>

<p>If there are no strong objections against the<br />
new additional choices during "rear recover"<br />
I would like to merge this pull request as is<br />
today afternoon.</p>
<p>When issues appear with the new additional choices<br />
during "rear recover" I will of course fix them.</p>
<p>I already know one but that really belongs<br />
to a separated pull request:</p>
<p>Currently it does not work to run diskrestore.sh<br />
then "Again wipe the disks in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED"<br />
and then re-run diskrestore.sh<br />
because the second run of diskrestore.sh does nothing<br />
because all is marked as already done by the first run.<br />
The reason why things get marked as done can be seen<br />
how it is meant to behave in the section "The Ad-Hoc Way" in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc">https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc</a><br />
so one can modify diskrestore.sh step by step and re-run it<br />
and it only does the not yet done things.</p>
<p>What currently "just works" (at least for me) is<br />
to run 'barrel'<br />
then "Again wipe the disks in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED"<br />
and re-run 'barrel'<br />
and so on as often as one likes.</p>
<p>It also works for me to just re-run 'barrel'<br />
even without "Again wipe the disks in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED"<br />
in between because 'barrel' does a lot to be able to run<br />
on already used disks where the same layout already exists<br />
because this is how 'barrel' gets usually tested<br />
(again and again via AutoYaST with already used disks).</p>
<p>Of course there is no guarantee that one can re-run 'barrel'<br />
again and again as often as one likes and all goes well.<br />
During my tests I managed to mess up things so much<br />
that 'barrel' failed to recreate things even with<br />
"Again wipe the disks in DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED" before.<br />
But in this case it "just worked" (at least for me)<br />
to abort the current "rear recover" run and<br />
re-boot the ReaR recovery system and let<br />
"rear recover" run again from scratch.</p>

<p>@jsmeix does it mean that in practice barrel supports to do "only the
not yet done things" natively without marking things as done? That's how
I understand it and would be good for consistency between barrel and the
usual layout code.</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
no, you misunderstood.<br />
'barrel' does not support to do "only the not yet done things".<br />
It is the opposite:<br />
Running 'barrel' always recreates all from scratch.<br />
Running 'barrel' results that what is specified<br />
as so called 'devicegraph' via an XML file<br />
will get (basically mercilessly) setup on the disks<br />
(regardless what there already is on the disks),<br />
cf. at the end of<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2863#issue-1375652428">https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2863#issue-1375652428</a></p>
<pre><code>Its name is 'barrel' because it even supports
"shooting yourself in the foot" when used without care ;-)
</code></pre>
<p>So with 'barrel' one cannot recreate step by step<br />
as with disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh.<br />
When recreating with 'barrel' plus devicegraph fails<br />
it is a dead end in practice because manually editing<br />
the devicegraph XML is likely not what one wants to do.</p>
<p>BUT<br />
One can run barrel also interactively to manually<br />
setup storage things, cf.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/barrel/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md">https://github.com/openSUSE/barrel/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md</a><br />
So when recreating with 'barrel' plus devicegraph fails<br />
the user may manually setup his storage things with 'barrel'<br />
interactively via the ReaR shell<br />
or the user can switch back to ReaR's native recreating<br />
method via disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh<br />
or perhaps even a combination of both and finally he can<br />
"Confirm what is currently on the disks and continue 'rear recover'"<br />
to restore his backup into what he manually created.<br />
I assume this way will not be done very often in practice.<br />
But when all seems lost this could be the only way out<br />
(except reinstalling from scratch without ReaR).</p>
<p>With "'barrel' does a lot to be able to run on already<br />
used disks where the same layout already exists"<br />
I meant that 'barrel' does a lot to deal with unwanted<br />
remainders of what there already is on a disk on its own.<br />
So 'barrel' does not need a separated "wipe disks" step<br />
before - at least in usual cases a.k.a. in the already known<br />
cases where the 'libstorage-ng' developer(s) implemented<br />
"the right things" how to deal with remainders on disks.</p>
<p>'barrel' is a command line frontend for 'libstorage-ng'<br />
<a href="https://github.com/aschnell/libstorage-ng">https://github.com/aschnell/libstorage-ng</a><br />
so the actual work is implemented in 'libstorage-ng'<br />
(as far as I understood what I was told about it).</p>

<p>@pcahyna<br />
thank you for your questions!<br />
They help me to think in more detail about how 'barrel' works<br />
and how it can and should be well integrated into ReaR.</p>
