I will certainly take a look, but I need to setup PXE testing
environment first, which will take some time ...  
@didacog aren't you guys heavily using PXE in DRLM ? Did you noticed
some problems with UEFI based systems?

Hi @gozora,  
Yes we use PXE boot all the time in DRLM with both BIOS and UEFI systems
with no issues.

@didacog  
could you describe how your ReaR PXE setup for UEFI  
is different compared to  
the "ReaR PXE setup for RHEL/OEL 7 to boot with UEFI"  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2359](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2359)  
together with the also needed additional code in this pull request here?

In particular what is your etc/rear/local.conf  
where PXE boot with UEFI works in your case?

Hi,  
We just configure a MACAddr file to setup the boot and adjust de vga to
gfxpayload=vga of the kernel opts. See:
[https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm/blob/develop/usr/share/drlm/backup/run/default/129\_post\_backup\_tasks.sh](https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm/blob/develop/usr/share/drlm/backup/run/default/129_post_backup_tasks.sh)

You can also take a look at out GRUB2 config on the server side:
[https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm/blob/develop/var/lib/drlm/store/boot/grub/grub.cfg](https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm/blob/develop/var/lib/drlm/store/boot/grub/grub.cfg).

Its a mkstandalone GRUB image BTW in DRLM.

You can take a look in how we created it at:
[https://docs.drlm.org/en/2.3.1/building\_grub2.html](https://docs.drlm.org/en/2.3.1/building_grub2.html)

Regards,  
Didac

As far as I understand
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2449\#issuecomment-655976230](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2449#issuecomment-655976230)  
it means that DRLM uses its own scripts to set up PXE boot with UEFI  
so PXE boot with UEFI can "just work" in DRLM while it can "just fail"
in ReaR.
