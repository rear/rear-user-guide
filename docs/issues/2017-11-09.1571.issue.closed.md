I should add that yes /proc/mounts was not listed the device, however,
If unplug it and plug it back in, it automounts and I run rear mkbackup,
it errors with USB device /dev/sdc2 is already mounted on
'/run/media/root/rear-000

It seems to be a kind of catch22 proc mounts wont have the info unless
it's mounted, but I cannot mount it and start the backup.

thinking of it, try to disable automount of rear ubs disk or try to
umount the disk manually, prior `rear mkrescue`

As far as I understand it there is not much what ReaR could do.

During "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" ReaR needs to mount  
the USB device at a ReaR-specific mount point but that  
could conflict with whatever existing USB automount magic  
that may have already mounted that USB device elsewhere.

I think ReaR should never ever try to mess around with  
the existing system setup (like changing how an existing  
USB automount magic behaves) because the setup  
of the original system is sacrosanct for ReaR  
(i.e. ReaR should never change the original system).  
Instead the user of ReaR has to setup his system  
so that his system setup does not conflict with ReaR.

@prophet60091  
as far as I see the script that mounts the USB device  
at the ReaR-specific mount point is  
usr/share/rear/output/default/100\_mount\_output\_path.sh  
which calls

<pre>
mount_url $OUTPUT_URL $BUILD_DIR/outputfs $OUTPUT_OPTIONS
</pre>

and the mount\_url function is defined in  
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh

For me on my SLES12 test system the mount\_url function  
is called like (from my "rear -d -D mkbackup" log file):

<pre>
+ source /root/rear.master/usr/share/rear/output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh
...
++ mount_url usb:///dev/disk/by-label/MyBackup /tmp/rear.Gql4esSs7sKmOdb/outputfs
</pre>

according to what I have in my test system

<pre>
# ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/MyBackup
lrwxrwxrwx ... /dev/disk/by-label/MyBackup -> ../../sdb1
</pre>

If you like you could perhaps do a GitHub pull request  
that enhances ReaR so that when the USB device  
that is configured in ReaR is already mounted  
could be automatically unmounted to that then  
it works to mount it at the ReaR-specific mount point  
$BUILD\_DIR/outputfs = /tmp/rear.XXX.../outputfs

I'd disagree here, as we don't know neither reason nor method how
particular USB disk was mounted, ReaR should not interfere here but
rather let user to disable automatic mounting of USB disk or solve such
situation by him self.

I think I should have better explained why I thought  
it could be o.k. to let ReaR automatically umount it:

My reasoning was that I assumed that when the user  
(who must be 'root') runs "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
then he knows what that results and he really wants it  
which means he wants that ReaR writes onto the USB device  
that he has configured in ReaR to be used by ReaR.

On the other hand:  
When the user accidentally misconfigured a wrong  
USB device in ReaR e.g. 'sdb1' instead of 'sdd1' like

<pre>
USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdb1
</pre>

or

<pre>
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1
</pre>

where /dev/sdb1 is one of his system filesystems,  
then it is probably not so much o.k. to let ReaR  
"just automatically umount it" ;-)

Bottom line:  
I agree with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571\#issuecomment-343128675](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571#issuecomment-343128675)  
that ReaR should not automatically umount it.

Accordingly I close the issue as "invalid" for ReaR  
because the user must solve such situations by himself  
because ReaR must never ever try to mess around  
with the existing system.

@prophet60091  
you could add a script that implements  
what you need for your particular case  
to the 'init' stage.  
I.e. add such a script to the  
usr/share/rear/init/default/  
directory.  
ReaR scripts must be named  
with an exactly three digits prefix like  
usr/share/rear/init/default/123\_my\_special\_stuff.sh

Well, I've tried not auto mounting, and I've tried also just unmounting
before running the script. In this case it gives the error that I
originally described.  
Here the full log:

[https://github.com/prophet60091/rearlogs/blob/master/FSnotFound.log](url)

If it's mounted as it would be after running the format for example then
get error:\*\*  
`Message: USB device '/dev/sdb2' is already mounted on '/run/media/root/REAR-000'`

full log
[https://github.com/prophet60091/rearlogs/blob/master/mounted.log](url)

The problem seems to be that it looking in /proc/mounts isn't going to
work when the device isn't mounted. But mounting it will cause
complaints of being already mounted.

I tried hardcoding the file system to usb\_filesystem=ext4 (I've used 3
as well no difference there)

I already noticed in the log that there is another complaint that states
RAW\_USB\_DEVICE and REAL\_USB\_DEVICE, should already be set.

I think I can track it down, but what should the values of those two
variables be ideally set to? The script mentioned in this issue, says
it's assuming they are set, but I don't know where.

@prophet60091 just for fun of it, can you remove `OUTPUT_URL=null` from
your config file ?

I had left it part of the config from doing ISOs earlier in the day and

Seems to be much more complicated than expected.  
That USB stuff was added a longer time ago  
as a dirty hack for a very specific use case and  
that results and endless sequence of weird issues  
like this one.

By chance I found while debugging this script:  
build/USB/default/800\_enforce\_usb\_output.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/USB/default/800\_enforce\_usb\_output.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/USB/default/800_enforce_usb_output.sh)

Its code does not make any sense for me.  
WHY could OUTPUT=... be different in  
$ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/local.conf  
compared to what the user had set  
in /etc/rear/local.conf on the original system  
that justifies to enforce OUTPUT=USB in  
$ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/local.conf  
and WHY does OUTPUT=... matter at all  
in the ReaR recovery system?  
I would expect that OUTPUT is only used for  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" but not for "rear recover".

@gdha  
do you perhaps have any idea what the reason is/was  
for this script?

It this script stays inexplicable for us I would suggest  
to "just blindly remove it right now" and then wait  
and see if any user reports any regression.

Or we may only disable it with an added initial

<pre>
# No idea what the reason behind is for the code below
# so that it is - at least for now - just disabled:
return 0

O.k. seems I found how it fails:  
In my log I get (excerpts):

<pre>
+ source /root/rear.master/usr/share/rear/output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh
++ mount_url null /tmp/rear.8n2C189DVGc6flF/outputfs
++ local url=null
++ case $(url_scheme $url) in
+++ url_scheme null
++ return 0
...
+ source /root/rear.master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh
+++ grep -E '^/dev/sdb1 |^/dev/sdb1 ' /proc/mounts
++ usb_filesystem=
++ case "$usb_filesystem" in
++ BugError 'Filesystem for device '\''/dev/sdb1'\'' could not be found'
</pre>

i.e. 850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh expects that the USB device  
was already mounted by 100\_mount\_output\_path.sh  
but because of OUTPUT\_URL=null the 'mount\_url null ...'  
function call did nothing (and 'return 0') so that  
the 'grep ... /proc/mounts' in 850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh  
cannot find a mounted USB device which results the BugError.

Accordingly I think now that the actual conflict is  
"OUTPUT=USB" together with "OUTPUT\_URL=null"  
and ReaR should detect this and error out.

"rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackup"

If `OUTPUT=USB` the `OUTPUT_URL` with USB may **not** be *null* IMHO as
otherwise it is a complete useless definition as we must be able to boot
from the USB drive, right. That is the purpose of OUTPUT\_URL. However,
in recover mode the OUTPUT\_URL is not required as the BACKUP\_URL is
important there.  
I agree USB part was a quick and dirty hack by Jeroen and Dag, but we
may not complain as it is used a lot and seems to be functional most of
times.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1572](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1572)  
is the right fix.

@gdha  
do you perhaps also have an idea what the reason behind  
the 800\_enforce\_usb\_output.sh script could be, cf. my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571\#issuecomment-343461088](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571#issuecomment-343461088)

Only a side note for the fun of it:  
I am allowed to complain (at least a bit from time to time)  
because I fixed so much with it ;-)

Have a nice weekend!

@jsmeix concerning:

    build/USB/default/800_enforce_usb_output.sh
    https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/USB/default/800_enforce_usb_output.sh

    Its code does not make any sense for me.
    WHY could OUTPUT=... be different in
    $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/local.conf

I seem to remember (and that is already an achievement!) that that was a
hack when Dag plugged in the USB drive into a Proliant server it
automagically started doing things with ReaR. However, I might be
completely wrong here - if @dagwieers could bring some light that would
be even better.
