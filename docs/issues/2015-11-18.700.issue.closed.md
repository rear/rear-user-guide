To avoid exaggerated expectations:  
Currently only the 'help' workflow should work with 'set -ue'  
all other workflows do not yet work with 'set -ue'  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/699)).

Updating the man page (and other documentation as needed) regarding
'--debugscripts' belongs to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/688](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/688)
that I reopened because of that missing documentation.

I have an idea how I could make rear working with ''set -ue -o
pipefail"  
step by step:

I can do it script by script.

For each script I can add at the beginning a line

<pre>
set -ue -o pipefail
</pre>

and at the end a line

<pre>
set +ue +o pipefail
</pre>

to make that one working with 'set -ue -o pipefail'.

The advantage of having 'set -ue -o pipefail' hardcoded in the  
scripts is that it ensures that subsequent changes are also  
implemented so that it still works with 'set -ue -o pipefail'.

And scripts where I cannot test them (e.g. scripts for using  
third-party backup tools that I do not have) can be left as is.

I will start with "my" scripts for btrfs support to make them  
working with 'set -ue -o pipefail'.

@jsmeix great idea! That way it is also visible in that script that
those settings are active. Maybe less of a surprise for the next
developer to work on a script.

One other thought. By disabling those settings at the end of a script
you will also disable them if they are enabled globally. Maybe you write
a function to remember the settings and to return them to the remembered
state?

In general it might be useful to have functions for those settings so
that we can change them centrally or extend them with tracking code and
other stuff.

I agree.

I found  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/210158/how-can-i-list-bashs-options-for-the-current-shell](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/210158/how-can-i-list-bashs-options-for-the-current-shell)

Accordingly it seems the right way to save and restore bash flags and
options is

<pre>
# Save current flags and option settings as bash commands:
bash_flags_and_option_settings=$( set +o | tr '\n' ';' ; shopt -p | tr '\n' ';' )
# Change flags and options as one likes:
...
# Restore bash flags and option settings:
eval $bash_flags_and_option_settings
</pre>

I have tested it a little bit and it seems to work (at least for me).

To provide that via generic functions

<pre>
function save_bash_flags_and_option_settings () { ... }
function restore_bash_flags_and_option_settings () { ... }
</pre>

it must be save against nested function calls which means  
I need to implement a stack of bash\_flags\_and\_option\_settings  
variables where the states are stored.

It seems Rear does not yet have a stack implemented.

Via  
[http://brizzled.clapper.org/blog/2011/10/28/a-bash-stack/](http://brizzled.clapper.org/blog/2011/10/28/a-bash-stack/)  
I found  
[https://github.com/bmc/lib-sh](https://github.com/bmc/lib-sh)  
where  
[https://github.com/bmc/lib-sh/blob/master/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/bmc/lib-sh/blob/master/LICENSE.md)  
reads that it is "under a BSD license".

@schlomo  
could you check if their license is o.k. so that it could be used in
rear?

Or avoid the stack and use local variables in place like

<pre>
# Save current flags and option settings:
flags_and_options=$( get_bash_flags_and options )
# Change flags and options as one likes:
...
# Restore bash flags and option settings:
set_bash_flags_and options "$flags_and_options"
</pre>

that call complementary global stateless functions

<pre>
function get_bash_flags_and_options () { set +o | tr '\n' ';' ; shopt -p | tr '\n' ';' ; }
function set_bash_flags_and_options () { eval $1 ; }
</pre>

Or don't use a generic stack but a simple array that is sufficient  
only for this particular use case?

I mean a global array like bash\_flags\_and\_options\_array  
that contains bash\_flags\_and\_options values  
plus complementary global stateful functions  
save\_bash\_flags\_and\_option\_settings and  
restore\_bash\_flags\_and\_option\_settings  
that operate on that global array.

I.e. like currently EXIT\_TASKS, AddExitTask, RemoveExitTask.

I experimented with using implicitly a stack (i.e. an array) of
saved\_flags\_options\_cmds via save\_flags\_and\_options and
restore\_flags\_and\_options functions but its usage was not sufficient
for my needs.

In particular I like to be able to restore an explicity named state.

In the end in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/726](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/726)
I implemented simple functions get\_bash\_flags\_and\_options\_commands
and apply\_bash\_flags\_and\_options\_commands that are used via an
explicit variable that stores the current bash flags and options
commands and using that explicit variable to re-apply them, i.e. like

<pre>
      saved_flags_options_cmds="$( get_bash_flags_and_options_commands )"
      ... [change bash flags and options] ...
      ... [do something] ...
      apply_bash_flags_and_options_commands "$saved_flags_options_cmds"
</pre>

Current rear does not at all work with ''set -ue -o pipefail".

There are zillions of places where the code  
is not yet safe against "set -ue -o pipefail".

I assume this issue will stay open for a very long time.  
But on the other hand there is no time pressure.

I set the "Milestone" to "Rear future".

Only FYI  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1334](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1334)  
which is an interesting example how complicated things  
could get if one likes to use bash arrays with 'set -ue'.

Because of this I meanwhile wonder if 'set -ue' would be really  
a good thing for the future because it seems bash with 'set -ue'  
works very much against what is "usually expected to work" in bash.  
In other words:  
I wonder if bash code with 'set -ue' may abort too often  
not because of real issues but because of "false alarm"  
that result from nitpicking stuff in bash when 'set -ue' is set?

@jsmeix I fully agree with you Johannes - less is sometimes better

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2017-04-28 09:38](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700#issuecomment-297954640):

At least for now (unless others object)  
I set the "won't fix" label to this issue  
but I will keep it open for some time  
so that others could provide more feedback.

Personally I am unsure:

Obviously 'set -ue' enforces programmers to write code  
that works more stable because they must care about errors.

On the other hand 'set -ue' may fail more often for users  
because bash (as any interpreted programming language)  
fails basically only during runtime ('bash -n script.sh' is  
insufficient, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040))  
and all cases where 'set -ue' did not fail for programmers  
causes additional failures for users.

On the third ;-) hand those additional failures for users  
with 'set -ue' would be reported to ReaR upstream  
so that in the end with 'set -ue' ReaR could work much  
better (mainly much more reliably) than it works now.

IMHO ReaR reached a size and complexity where such strict coding styles
will really help us to maintain and maybe even increase our quality.

If we can't enable it globally we might add it as a development mode
where we maintainers run our tests with strict mode to harden ReaR.

My proposal was to use 'set -ue' in new scripts,  
cf. "Try to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Probably also when scripts are so much overhauled  
that they got basically rewritten.

Regarding "maybe even increase quality":

I got used to use 'set -eu -o pipefail' when I made  
my own generic system installation scrits, see the section  
"Generic usage of the plain SUSE installation system ..."  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

My own experience when I use 'set -eu' from the beginning  
is that I think my scripts become very much better  
because I am enforced to care all the time about  
any kind of possible errors (up to nitpicking stuff in bash)  
but - at least from my personal point of view - the result  
works so much better compared to "usual bash scripting".

I think  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327\#issuecomment-297964501](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327#issuecomment-297964501)  
is perhaps a good example how in practice 'set -ue' may work  
too much against what is "usually expected to work" in bash  
which may let ReaR fail later in perhaps very unexpected ways.

Because some scripts already use "set -e -u -o pipefail"  
we need to implement some verbose error exit trap  
for cases where bash exits because of "set -e -u"  
so that the user is sufficiently informed what happened  
because by default bash exits silently in case of "set -e -u"  
and when the user does not actively check the exit code  
it would look like a regular finishing program.

Probably
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1747](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1747)
is another good example  
why "set -e -u -o pipefail" can result more problems in practice than it
solves.

Meanwhile I am thinking about a generic wrapper function  
for "set -e -u -o pipefail" that only sets it when in debugging mode  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700\#issuecomment-297960017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700#issuecomment-297960017)  
so that in practice for the users out there who do not run ReaR  
in debugging mode there are no such unexpected "sudden death"  
bash error exits because of any minor (perhaps even irrelevant) stuff  
cf.
