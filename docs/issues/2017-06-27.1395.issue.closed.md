There are very many places in the ReaR code where  
output is suppressed via redirection to /dev/null.

Herebey I ask for comments what to do when  
stdout and/or stderr is redirected to /dev/null.

My personal opinion is that  
in general ReaR should  
suppress success output via stdout  
but keep failure output via stderr in the log.

Details:

What to do when stderr is redirected to /dev/null:

Why hide STDERR here? It might contain useful infos
that should appear in the log.
</pre>

Accordingly  
in general stderr should be in the log.

Exceptional cases are where tools blabber non-useful stuff  
via stderr for example 'cp $verbose' in 400\_copy\_modules.sh  
and in 420\_copy\_firmware\_files.sh

What to do when stdout is redirected to /dev/null:

My personal opinion is that  
in general stdout should not be in the log  
so that in general stdout should be redirected to /dev/null.

A special case is properly fixing the old  
deprecated usage of '&gt;&8':

We are not using the progress-bar code for years
anymore (the >&8 redirection), so the question was
asked, why not get rid of it and capture the code
in the logging (or not)?

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391/commits/4f4efb37db4c4ee7d1b05f247101c1680e1f8c31](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391/commits/4f4efb37db4c4ee7d1b05f247101c1680e1f8c31)  
I replaced all old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8' with '&gt;/dev/null'  
to keep the current behaviour (i.e. suppress all the output)  
both for stderr like

<pre>
- ... 2>&8
+ ... 2>/dev/null
</pre>

and in most cases also for stdout like

<pre>
- ... >&8
+ ... >/dev/null

- ... 1>&8
+ ... 1>/dev/null

- ... >&8 2>&1
+ ... >/dev/null 2>&1
</pre>

After sleeping over it I think now that

<pre>
in general stdout should not be in the log
so that in general stdout should be redirected to /dev/null
</pre>

is not the right way because  
it contradicts
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)  
where we intend to have stdout in the log.

Meanwhile I think regarding what to do with stdout:

In general stdout should not appear on the user's terminal  
so that in general stdout should be redirected.

When usr/sbin/rear is run in verbose mode  
stdout should be redirected to the log file.

When usr/sbin/rear is not run in verbose mode  
stdout should be redirected to /dev/null.

I think this could be implemented in usr/sbin/rear like

<pre>
# Redirect STDOUT and STDERR.
# Redirect STDERR to the log file because error messages should be always in the log.
# To be more on the safe side append to the log file '>>' instead of plain writing to it '>'
# because when a program (bash in this case) is plain writing to the log file it can overwrite
# output of a possibly simultaneously running process that likes to append to the log file
# (e.g. when a background process runs that also uses the ReaR log file for logging):
exec 2>>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE"
# In verbose mode stdout is redirected to the log file
# otherwise stdout is redirected to /dev/null
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395
if test "$VERBOSE" ; then
    # Make stdout the same what stderr already is (i.e. the log file)
    # This keeps strict ordering of stdout and stderr outputs in the log file
    # because now both stdout and stderr use one same file descriptor:
    exec 1>&2
else
    # In general stdout should not appear on the user's terminal
    # so that stdout is redirected to /dev/null when not in verbose mode:
    exec 1>/dev/null
fi
</pre>

which seems to work o.k. for me during a very first test.

With that basically all those stdout redirections in the scipts  
can be removed (which greatly cleans up the code in the scipts).

For completeness here what is already done with stderr:

In general stderr should not appear on the user's terminal  
so that in general stderr should be redirected.

Error messages should be always in the log so that  
stderr is always redirected to the log file.

Exceptions are useless stderr messages (like verbose warnings)  
that can be redirected to /dev/null where needed in the scripts.

IMHO ReaR should not willingly destroy information. So for me
`>/dev/null` is not an option. If we don't want to show it to the user
then it must go to the logfile. If we want to show it to the user then
having it in the logfile too would be really nice.

@schlomo  
I agree with you.

Personally I don't mind if a log file gets big.  
Personally I prefer a verbose log over a concise log.  
Personally I prefer to always have full information in the log.  
When something fails I want to have a complete log right now  
without the need to reproduce the failure with some special  
option settings to get a complete log.

I made my proposal in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395\#issuecomment-311592122](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395#issuecomment-311592122)  
to have STDOUT in the log only in case of verbose mode  
because I (falsely) assumed that by default for ReaR  
a concise log is preferred over a complete log.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395\#issuecomment-311678896](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395#issuecomment-311678896)  
things get simple and straightforward so that now  
(if I understand it correctly) our intent is:

In general stdout should not appear on the user's terminal  
so that in general stdout should be redirected to the log  
(this is what we already have in current GitHub master code).

Furthermore because ReaR should not destroy information  
basically all current '&gt;/dev/null' in the code should be dropped  
so that in general all stdout (and all stderr) appears in the log.

Exceptions are really useless stdout messages and  
really useless or falsely scaring stderr messages  
that can be redirected to /dev/null as needed in the scripts.

Regarding possibly useless stdout messages:

Perhaps things like 'pushd ... &gt;/dev/null' and 'popd &gt;/dev/null'  
might be valid examples where stdout could be suppressed  
(currently all 'pushd' and 'popd' suppress stdout except  
in my restore/ZYPPER/default/940\_generate\_fstab.sh).

But on the other hand I do not see anything wrong  
if 'pushd' and 'popd' stdout appears in the log  
(cf. above "I prefer to have full information in the log").

I assume all 'pushd' and 'popd' suppress stdout  
because before
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)  
the 'pushd' and 'popd' stdout appeared on the users terminal  
where it is meaningless so that it was simply suppressed  
(instead of redirecting it to stderr to get it into the log  
as in restore/ZYPPER/default/940\_generate\_fstab.sh).

I will be investigating about a usable way how to call a command  
that shows its stdout (and/or its stderr) to the user  
and have both of them in the log file too.  
But that will be something for the future.  
For now I am trying to get ReaR running correctly  
when both stdout and stderr are redirected into the log, cf.

If time permits I would like to do  
some general cleanup for ReaR 2.6. in all scripts  
and remove '2&gt;/dev/null' where it makes sense  
and replace '&&gt;/dev/null' by '1&gt;/dev/null' where it makes sense  
or also remove '&&gt;/dev/null' where that seems to be better  
BUT

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2252](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2252)
merged  
I hope this issue is sufficiently fixed.

But I cannot test all those affected code parts,  
in particulart not the changes for TSM and NBU in  
verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
and  
verify/NBU/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh

Please report if there are regressions so that I can fix them,  
ideally each one as a new and separated GitHub issue.
