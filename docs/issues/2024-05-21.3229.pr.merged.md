-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224)

-   How was this pull request tested?

I manually reverted the actual change in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224)  
and then the current ReaR BUILD\_DIR is not included  
in the backup but a leftover ReaR BUILD\_DIR from  
a previous "rear -D mkbackup" gets correctly included  
in the backup because it is my task to remove  
my intentionally kept BUILD\_DIR (via '-D').

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Revert the actual change in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224)  
and have BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE in default.conf same as before  
because the current BUILD\_DIR gets automatically  
excluded in usr/sbin/rear via

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( "$BUILD_DIR" )

It is not ReaR's task to exclude possibly lefover  
older ReaR working areas because in general  
files in /var/tmp are persistent which need  
to be cleaned up deliberately by the user  
(and not by ReaR from behind via its backup).

Also described things more clearly in the comment.

Something is wrong with the Fedora rawhide CI run, looking... I see in

Moreover, I see lots of messages in the mkbackup log which are not
fatal, but suspect nevertheless:

In current GitHub master code  
/usr/share/rear/prep/default/400\_save\_directories.sh  
line 12 is

    # cat -n usr/share/rear/prep/default/400_save_directories.sh

which is the first thing that fails  
so this one is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3222](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3222)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223)

On my SLES15-SP5 test system I got for "rear -D mkbackup" only

    2024-05-21 13:06:59.138690211 FHS directory /etc/sgml does not exist
    2024-05-21 13:06:59.142684523 FHS directory /etc/xml does not exist

    2024-05-21 13:06:59.176064989 FHS directory /usr/X11R6 does not exist

but there I had already done a "rear -D mkbackup" before  
so I already had a `$VAR_DIR/recovery` from the first  
"rear -D mkbackup" run.

Regarding

    ERROR: Cannot find required programs: mkfs.vfat

see in layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh  
the last part where filesystem creating tools that  
are required in the recovery system get added via

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( $required_mkfs_tools )

depending on which filesystem types entries ('^fs ')  
exist in disklayout.conf

So in this case there must be a

    fs .* vfat ...

entry in disklayout.conf

Because 'fs' entries have the form

    fs <device> <mountpoint> <filesystem type> ...

I think that the grep search string

    grep -q "^fs .* $filesystem_type " $DISKLAYOUT_FILE

in layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh  
is sufficiently safe to not match false positives.  
As far as I see the only possible false positive  
would be a 'fs' entry with a ' vfat ' substring  
but such a substring (with leading and trailing space)  
would be invalid syntax in disklayout.conf, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc\#disk-layout-file-syntax](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc#disk-layout-file-syntax)

    ... keyword and all the values are separated
    by single space characters (which means
    spaces in values are forbidden ...

@pcahyna  
thank you for your review!  
The description text is now much better.
