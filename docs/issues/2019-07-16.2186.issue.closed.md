In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142)
therein see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495554406](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495554406)  
I learned how to boot a new system from within a running system  
via kexec basically as follows:

    # kexec -l new_kernel --initrd=new_initrd --command-line='root=...'

    # kexec -e

This will instantly reboot into the loaded kernel (plus initrd)  
without a clean shutdown of the currently running system.

The interesting part here is **instantly reboot**.

So the advantage of booting via kexec is that  
it leaves out the BIOS/UEFI firmware part  
which makes booting via kexec much faster.

On the other hand the disadvantage of booting via kexec  
is that it leaves out the BIOS/UEFI firmware part  
which makes booting via kexec somewhat unreliable  
because the hardware is not initialized from the very beginning.  
I.e. booting via kexec basically runs a new kernel on an  
arbitrary current hardware state as left from the old kernel.

As far as I know it should help when the kernel that does  
the kexec is up-to-date because a more up-to-date kernel  
should be better prepared against possible kexec failures  
when there are still ongoing hardware operations after kexec  
(e.g. old DMA operations that still write somewhere in memory)  
from the old kernel while the new kernel is already running.  
As far as I know current kernels have proper kexec support  
for most hardware which means they cancel still ongoing  
hardware operations just before the actual kexec is done,  
but I am not at all an expert in this area.

So we cannot do kexec instead of regular boot in any case  
to always speed up booting but as an alternative for the user  
(who must anyway verify that his particular disaster procedure works)  
it could be helpful when he can do kexec instead of regular boot.

Cf. the section  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Here I also mean to kexec the recreated system after "rear recover".

As far as I know booting on this or that server hardware could take  
longer time (up to minutes) while it is in its BIOS/UEFI firmware part.

Assume on such hardware kexec does work reliably  
(perhaps kexec works in particular unreliably on those hardware  
where booting takes "ages" in its BIOS/UEFI firmware part ;-)  
then kexec instead of regular boot would save that time two times:

1.  When booting the ReaR recovery system (provided the replacement
    hardware is already running a system that supports kexec well).

2.  When booting the recreated system after "rear recover".

This way disaster recovery could be done noticeably faster.

I was told that kexec should work in particular reliably on IBM Z  
because there kexec is even part of the regular boot, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2137\#issuecomment-490420041](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2137#issuecomment-490420041)

    So on SLES12 and SLES15 booting IBM Z basically works this way:

    Initially zipl loads a kernel and
    that kernel runs GRUB2 and
    GRUB2 loads the actual kernel and does a kexec.

but I am not at all an expert in this area.

I've used `kexec` boot, while debugging un-bootable OS on HPE Superdome
with 16TB of RAM, where one normal reboot took ~1 hour. Since the
problem was in initrd, I had to do several initrd rebuilds followed by
reboot, to exactly locate the culprit (guess it was systemd-udev).  
In this scenario, re-boot with `kexec` saved me literally hours.  
I was later told by vendors HW engineer that it is OK to use `kexec` for
such "debugging" purposes he'd however not recommend to run production
on such system just because the state of HW, as already mentioned by
@jsmeix.

Wow!

    ... 16TB of RAM, where one normal reboot took ~1 hour ...

@gozora  
thank you so much for that example!

For me this one example is already sufficient reason to implement  
a way that the user can deliberately and alternatively do `kexec`  
instead of `reboot` to boot the recreated system after "rear recover".

My offhanded idea is to enhance our generated `reboot` script  
to support a parameter `kexec` so that it could be called
`reboot kexec`  
or add a separated script called `kexecreboot` via  
build/GNU/Linux/630\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/630\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/630_simplify_systemd_reboot_halt_poweroff_shutdown.sh)  
where `reboot kexec` or `kexecreboot` basically should do  
something like

    kexec -l /mnt/local/path/to/kernel --initrd=/mnt/local/path/to/initrd --command-line='...'
    umount -vfar
    echo syncing disks... waiting 3 seconds before kexec
    sync
    sleep 3
    kexec -e

to be reasonably well on the safe side that all disk I/O on the  
recreated system disk is completely done before `kexec -e`.

I asked a colleague: It is perfectly o.k. when arbitrary things happen  
between `kexec -l` and `kexec -e`. For example the crash kernel  
is loaded by `kexec -l` (somewhere into kernel reserved memory)  
during boot and then the system can run for an arbitrary long time  
until a crash may happen which triggers `kexec -e` into the crash
kernel.

What I need for such a `reboot kexec` or `kexecreboot` is  
/mnt/local/path/to/kernel and /mnt/local/path/to/initrd  
and the right kernel command line to boot the recreated system.

I think /mnt/local/path/to/kernel should be normally  
the same as /mnt/local/$KERNEL\_FILE and  
the right kernel command line should be normally  
the same as /proc/cmdline on the original system during "rear
mkrescue"  
(KERNEL\_CMDLINE is not right because that is for the recovery system)  
but /mnt/local/path/to/initrd could be anything  
what `chroot /mnt/local/ mkinitrd` results.

In any case I would first and foremost implement it with  
config variables that the user can specify and must specify  
if there is no reliably working way to autodetect that values.

FWIW:  
I think at least at SUSE when we install a system with YaST  
we boot the installed system via `kexec` and I think we do that  
basically the same way as I intend for `reboot kexec` or
`kexecreboot`:  
We shut down the system normally except at the very end where  
`kexec -e` gets called instead of a regular reboot via the  
hardware BIOS/UEFI firmware.

My reasoning behind why I think this could be in particular  
of interest for disaster recovery of production systems:

Assume your "high noon meals" web sales portal production server  
burns out of a sudden at high noon where your hungry customers  
use that server most of all.

So - no matter what - you want that server back as fast as possible.

You are not (yet) such a big business that you could afford a  
high availability solution via redundantly replicated systems.

But you are sufficiently well prepared and "rear recover"  
on your replacement machine is done in less than 5 minutes.

But then you do a regular reboot of your recreated system  
and your sales of this day are mostly lost in your vendor's  
HW engineer recommendation... ;-)

In contrast if you could do deliberately and alternatively `kexec`  
to fast-boot your recreated system after "rear recover",  
you could be back in business in a few minutes.

I think if `kexec` fails, things won't be really worse because then  
you can do the regular boot of your recreated system as fallback.

Either way, I'd add some kind of warning message that additional full
reboot should be done after successful `kexec` boot.

A first manual test to fast-boot the recreated system after "rear
recover"  
via `kexec` seems to have worked well for me:

and the recreated system "just boots" and works well
