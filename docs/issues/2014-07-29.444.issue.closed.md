Hi All,

I have installed REAR on RHEL 6.5 - 2.6.32-431.el6.x86\_64, physical box
and RHEL 5.10 - 2.6.18-371.el5 i686 - VM on VirtualBox. REAR versions
which I have used are rear-1.16.1-1.el5 and rear-1.15-9.el6.noarch. The
backup process completes without any issues. I'm using NFS share for
backup and iso files but when I try to boot from rescue image I get
kernel panic. The same result on physical box and VM. Could you tell me
how to attached my local.conf, site.conf and rear log file here?
Basically I have copied default.conf into /etc/site.conf and changed the
following:

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://camstore3a/vol/camreardr\_nfs  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://camstore3a/vol/camreardr\_nfs  
EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS=("Data dirs")

The /etc/rear/local.conf contains: OUTPUT=ISO

The /etc/rear/os.conf contains:  
OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
OS\_VERSION=6

Here are the kernel panic snapshots:

which fs type are you using? ext3 perhaps. it might be the the ext3
kernel module is not loaded during the initrd phase...

How could I fix this? I mean how could I force rear mkbackup or rear
mkrescue to include this module. I have used rear couple of years before
and I haven't had such issues. It's very strange to have issues with
ext3 fs.

See the issues \#326 and \#367 for some background details. You could
start with `lsmod | grep ext` on your running system (and on the system
booted with recovery image)

I have used ext4 on RHEL6 and ext3 on RHEL5. I'm going to try to load
respective modules with MODULES\_LOAD array using site.conf file
tomorrow:

\[root@ausrhdb501 ~\]\# lsmod |grep -i ext  
ext4 374902 3

\[root@vmrear\_test ~\]\# lsmod|grep ext  
ext3 126281 2

I have tried to load the ext3 module on RHEL5 VM but with no success. I
have used two different ways for syntax:

MODULES\_LOAD=( ext3 ) and MODULES\_LOAD=( ${MODULES\_LOAD\[@\]} ext3 )

@kamensa Sorry for the delay...  
The `MODULES_LOAD=( ${MODULES_LOAD[@]} ext3 )` is the correct
definition.  
Did you try the latest rear-1.17.1?
