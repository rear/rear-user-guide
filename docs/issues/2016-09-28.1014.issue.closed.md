@jsmeix IMHO we should work with
`tar_version=$(get_version tar --version)` and make a decision based on
a version of `tar` from when the option `--test-label` was introduced. I
found evidence on the Internet it was introduced in version **1.15.90**
(see
[http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/\*checkout\*/tar/NEWS?view=auto&root=tar&revision=1.125](http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/tar/NEWS?view=auto&root=tar&revision=1.125))
(released on 2006-02-19).  
@philippebolduc My suggestion to you is to upgrade `tar` to at least
version 1.15.92 and your problem is over.

I have the feeling it is not worth the effort to modify the code in
*rear* as the option `--test-label` is already 10 years present within
`tar`.

Do tar 1.15.92 avalaible easily via rpm on Centos 5 ?

@gdha  
I agree that rear does not need to support very old versions  
of tools that are called by the rear scripts - in particular  
because basically nobody tests that.

On the other hand doc/rear-release-notes.txt currently reads

<pre>
Rear-1.18 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:
...
CentOS 5, 6 and 7
</pre>

But on one more other hand (again a "tertium datur" ;-)  
the rear scripts are meant to be adapted by the admin  
as needed in his particular case so that it can be considered  
to be o.k. when @philippebolduc must adapt rear to make it work  
for his CentOS 5 (or upgrade tar on his CentOS 5).

I think we should not do the effort to keep  
the current rear working also for tar &lt; 1.15.92

As a consequence for the upcoming rear-1.19  
we may drop officially support for CentOS 5.

Some forensics on that issue:

The string '--test-label' is only in  
restore/NETFS/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh  
and  
"git log -p -w restore/NETFS/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh"  
shows when the '--test-label' was introduced:

<pre>
commit 354486da3191dbfe5c6a4b896e34977be10697d5
Author: test <kreitz@Dev-Server.mhknet.de>
Date:   Mon Sep 2 11:39:52 2013 +0200
...
+                       BASE=$(dirname "$restorearchive")/$(tar --test-label -f "$restorearchive")
</pre>

but "git log" does not show any useful message for that commit:

<pre>
commit 354486da3191dbfe5c6a4b896e34977be10697d5
Author: test <kreitz@Dev-Server.mhknet.de>
Date:   Mon Sep 2 11:39:52 2013 +0200
    Incrementap Patches
</pre>

I.e. it was this commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/354486da3191dbfe5c6a4b896e34977be10697d5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/354486da3191dbfe5c6a4b896e34977be10697d5)

According to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS)  
CentOS 5 was releasted in April 2007  
and that commit happened in 2013  
so that I assume before rear had worked for CentOS 5  
but since that commit it does no longer work for CentOS 5.

@jsmeix For CentOS 5: the`tar --test-label` is only used when
`BACKUP_TYPE=incremental` has been selected, therefore, it is only
problematic in some cases. I can comment it in the FAQ section of our
web pages?

@philippebolduc If you do not find a suitable rpm for *tar v1.15.9x* you
could try to build it from the sources?

Ah!  
Now I understand (at least I think so).

The commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/354486da3191dbfe5c6a4b896e34977be10697d5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/354486da3191dbfe5c6a4b896e34977be10697d5)  
did not break existing functionality for CentOS 5  
but only implemented the new functionality  
"BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" is a way that  
does not work with tar &lt; 1.15.92.

If I am right it means there is no real bug here  
(i.e. I remove "bug" from that issue and keep  
only "enhancement").

Because we will not do the work to make the new  
"BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" functionality  
working with old tar &lt; 1.15.92 I close this  
enhancement request as "won't fix".

@philippebolduc  
regardless that we will not fix the issue  
many thanks for your valuable contribution  
to Relax-and-Recover because now we learned under  
what special circumstances tar &lt; 1.15.92 fails and you  
even provided a "quick and dirty" workaround that could  
also be used by other users who have that issue.

@philippebolduc  
in general regarding "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" note its limits  
that are described only in the current documentation  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/35fc7c93242221e58f148f2aa318a52b07dcc9fb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/35fc7c93242221e58f148f2aa318a52b07dcc9fb)  
in short:

<pre>
The current implementation supports only to restore
one full backup plus one single incremental backup
so that currently BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
actually implements a differential backup
</pre>

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-09-29 14:13](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1014#issuecomment-250478042):

@philippebolduc  
that "we will not fix the issue" does of course not mean  
that another contributor (e.g. you) could not enhance  
the current "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" functionality  
so that it also works with old tar &lt; 1.15.92 provided  
the enhancement is made in a way that it cannot  
cause regressions for users with newer tar.

Of course we appreciate GitHub pull requests  
that enhance Relax-and-Recover functionality.
