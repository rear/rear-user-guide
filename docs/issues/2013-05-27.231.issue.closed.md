Hi,

running "rear mkrescue" on Rhel5 and Rhel6, the ISO image is being
created but afterwards rear stops with the following error:

ERROR: Failed to find initrd.cgz, updating GRUB failed.

Running "rear -d mkrescue", the initrd.cgz can be found under
/tmp/rear.xxxxx/tmp/isofs/isolinux/initrd.cgz

The rear.log is here:

Thanks in advance  
Tim

@gdha this is caused by the removal of ISO\_FILES in
output/ISO/Linux-i386/80\_create\_isofs.sh ? I don't really want to
spend too much time on understanding all of those UEFI changes :-), but
was it causing problems?

I will fix this issue by copying the initrd instead of moving it.
