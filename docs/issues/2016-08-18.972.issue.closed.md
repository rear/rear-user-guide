Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): CentOS 7
    (reports as RedHatEnterpriseServer/7)
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=cifs://swss-nas3/REAR\_Backups  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"

-   Brief description of the issue

There is an issue with restoring a system that uses LUKS encryption,
which fails as shown in the attached screenshot with "An error occurred
during layout recreation" immediately after the first password prompt to
recreate the LUKS volume:

Digging into this further I found that the issue is caused by the
password quality check on cryptsetyp, which requires the cracklib
dictionaries, which appear to be missing from the restore media:

![rear-002](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21100372/17769060/d88fb69c-652e-11e6-8593-78a8c91752c8.jpg)

The system the ISO was generated from has the cracklib packages
installed, so I guess the ISO creation process needs to be amended to
include them?

-   Work-around, if any

There's a simple workaround, edit the restore script and add the
--force-password switch to the cryptsetup command(s), which skips the
password quality check. The restore process then runs fine and restores
as expected.

In general when something special is not automatically  
included in the rescue/recovery system, you can  
specify whatever you want to get it included  
by using in /etc/rear/local.conf things like

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" progam1 program2 )
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" file1 file2 directory1 directory2 )
</pre>

for an example see  
/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf  
and in general for what you can configure  
see /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Issue \#679 is about the same - see the solution provided - it will be
included in 1.18  
If this is sufficient for you then close this issue please?

Hi,

Sure, it was more of a heads-up, thought it should probably include the
cryptlib by default as it includes LUKS support.

Happy to close, awesome work on REAR btw, off to donate now!

@nikbarron  
only FYI if you like to try out the currently  
newest rear GitHub master code:

In general regarding how to test the currently  
newest rear GitHub master code:  
Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory.

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
# cd rear
# vi etc/rear/local.conf
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>
