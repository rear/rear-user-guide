[\#280 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/280) `closed`: Check only disk size is a little too optimistic ?

When restoring, rear check if original sdX exists and verify its size,
if it's equal then rear launch the restore. In many server the disk size
is identical and we have to check more than only the disk size, for
example :

-   the model **cat /sys/block/sdX/device/model**
-   the vendor **cat /sys/block/sdX/device/vendor**
-   local or distant disk **lsscsi**
-   the kernel location of disk (if it's an internal disk) **lsscsi**
-   the serial number if exist **smartctl**

What do you think about this ?

I could care about the difference between a local or SAN disk I guess in
the unlikely case that the size of the SAN disks is exactly equal to the
system disks. The other things I don't really want to worry about in a
DR situation.

In what kind of situation would it be useful to force the advanced
restore mode when any of those things changes?

When fiber cards is used and when booting on the rescue system, sda may
switch with another disk (sdb for example). If the size is identical,
Rear erase the wrong disk.

Our (Arakmar and me) internship ends up in 2 weeks, so what about this
problem ?

We will most likely to change our SAN related code (for the moment).
