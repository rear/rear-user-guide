    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1879](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1879)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Via partial restore

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This removes the overwriting of $HOSTNAME in
    400\_restore\_duplicity.sh.  
    Just removing the Line should be enough especially because $HOSTNAME
    isn't overwritten on Duplicity Backup.
