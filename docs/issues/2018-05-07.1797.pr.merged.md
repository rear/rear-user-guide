-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

By default, TSM logs every file restored in the main output.  
This produces a huge and difficult to read ReaR logfile.  
The purpose of this PR is to

-   improve ReaR output readability
-   redirect TSM output to an external log file

Right now I noticed that the backup restore log file is not copied  
into the recreated system into /var/log/rear/recover/  
cf. usr/share/rear/wrapup/default/990\_copy\_logfile.sh  
which copies all in $VAR\_DIR/layout/ and $VAR\_DIR/recovery/  
but things in $TMP\_DIR are intentionally not copied.

Perhaps it is better when in general a backup restore log file  
is in $VAR\_DIR/recovery/ (and not in $TMP\_DIR) to get  
the backup restore log file automatically copied into the  
recreated system?

Now I noticed that a backup restore log file  
is in $VAR\_DIR/recovery/ would not be copied  
for the 'restoreonly' workflow so that I need to think  
a bit more carefully how to get the backup restore log file  
properly copied into the recreated system...

@jsmeix,  
I also think about that (copy the restore log file in the recreated
system) and arrives at the same conclusion =&gt; not as easy.... If you
have a good idea, please tell me.

@schabrolles  
just merge this one with `TSM-restore.log` (instead of
`TSM_restore.log`)  
and later - as time permits - I will do a separated pull request to
also  
get backup restore log files properly copied into the recreated system.

FYI:  
We have  
usr/share/rear/restore/RSYNC/default/800\_copy\_restore\_log.sh  
but it copies to the old place `/root` (I will clean it up).
