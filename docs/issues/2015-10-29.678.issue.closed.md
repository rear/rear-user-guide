[\#678 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/678) `closed`: Move DISKLAYOUT\_FILE to default.conf?

When looking at \#668 I realized that `DISKLAYOUT_FILE` is defined in
many places:

    $ grep -r DISKLAYOUT_FILE= .
    ./usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/10_create_layout_file.sh:DISKLAYOUT_FILE=${DISKLAYOUT_FILE:-$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf}
    ./usr/share/rear/lib/checklayout-workflow.sh:    DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TEMP_LAYOUT
    ./usr/share/rear/lib/mkbackuponly-workflow.sh:  DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf
    ./usr/share/rear/lib/savelayout-workflow.sh:    DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf

But it is not defined in `default.conf` and the setting in
`savelayout-workflow.sh` actually repeats the builtin default in
`10_create_layout_file.sh`.

I suspect that it would be better (more ReaR-like and less error prone)
to have the default setting in `default.conf`.

@gdha  
You added the DISKLAYOUT\_FILE to usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
in the following section:

<pre>
# DRLM (Disaster Recovery Linux Manager) Variables
</pre>

I assume the DISKLAYOUT\_FILE variable  
does not belog only to DRLM but is a  
generic global variable for any disk-layout code.

If I am right I woul like to place the DISKLAYOUT\_FILE variable  
in a section for generic global variables in default.conf

@jsmeix no problem - you may move it

I relation to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708)
I think that  
neither the DISKLAYOUT\_FILE variable  
nor a RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT variable  
belongs into usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
because those variables are not meant to be  
configured by the user, see default.conf

<pre>
# PLEASE NOTE:
#
# * Here we define and describe ALL configuration variables and set them to a sane
#   default. Please do NOT change them here, but rather copy them to site.conf or
#   local.conf
# * Most variables can be set to an empty value (VAR=) which means that this
#   setting is off or set to some automatic mode.
</pre>

I think generic global variables like DISKLAYOUT\_FILE  
and RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT belong into usr/sbin/rear  
like SHARE\_DIR CONFIG\_DIR VAR\_DIR LOG\_DIR ...

@jhoekx what is your opinion on this topic?

What is actually the purpose of making DISKLAYOUT\_FILE and
RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT  
a variable?

Whom do you expect in which situation to change it?

Answering those questions will also tell you where to put them.

My (I cannot speak for the others) actual purpose of using  
things like DISKLAYOUT\_FILE and RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT  
is not as a real variable (i.e. where the value is meant to change)  
but as a constant that has a meaningful name to avoid  
hardcoded meaningless literal values in the scripts.

For me things like DISKLAYOUT\_FILE and RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT  
represent values that rear needs internally to work.

I think we should declare those kind of variables  
as bash constants via

<pre>
readonly VAR_DIR="$REAR_DIR_PREFIX/var/lib/rear"
...
readonly DISKLAYOUT_FILE="$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf"
readonly RECOVERY_FS_ROOT="/mnt/local"
</pre>

I think such rear-internal values can be defined in usr/sbin/rear or  
in a separated file (not default.conf) that is sourced by usr/sbin/rear.

+1 for readonly constants. I would put them in the main rear script,
unless  
you plan to read them also from outside the rear framework, e.g. from
the  
system-setup scripts in the rescue system.

I will have readonly constants in the main rear script because this is  
simplest and only if really needed have them in a separated file.

Depending on how variables are meant to be used they can be  
easily moved from usr/sbin/rear to default.conf or vice versa  
and they can be easily declared as readonly or not.

Of course
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/710](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/710)
is not yet  
the final solution - but it should be a first working step  
(at least "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" still works for me).

This particular issue about DISKLAYOUT\_FILE is fixed.  
It is now in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
# Generic global variables that are not meant to be configured by the user
# (i.e. that do not belong into usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf),
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/678
# and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708
# Location of the disklayout.conf file created by savelayout
# (no readonly DISKLAYOUT_FILE because it is also set in checklayout-workflow.sh and mkbackuponly-workflow.sh):
DISKLAYOUT_FILE="$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf"
</pre>

I close this particular issue.

I will continue to work on this kind of issues  
as needed in the future.
