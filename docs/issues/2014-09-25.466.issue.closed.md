I’m installing ReaR into a server using LVs with stripes, as the
following exemple:

Server0:/var/lib/rear/layout \# lvs -o +devices | grep LVSample1  
LVSample1 VGTemp -wi-ao 60.00g
/dev/mapper/temp\_1(0),/dev/mapper/temp\_2(0),/dev/mapper/temp\_3(0),/dev/mapper/temp\_4(0)

I see the layout generated ignores this configuration:

Server0:/var/lib/rear/layout \# grep LVSample1 disklayout.conf  
lvmvol /dev/VGTemp LVSample1 960 125829120  
fs /dev/mapper/VGTemp-LVSample1 /sample1 reiserfs
uuid=1d1e43d4-968f-46b9-bb55-ad6b773ae93c label=
options=rw,notail,acl,user\_xattr  
Server0:/var/lib/rear/layout \#

Commented at the Mailing List, and it seems to be an missing feature.
I'm trying to attach the output of 'rear -vdD savelayout', as D'haese
Gratien has suggested.

@iaragones you mailed me the log file created, but I would rather see
the log created by `rear -vdD savelayout` and attach it to
gist.github.com

There's only this log file available... I see no more output to send to
you. Where is the log you need supposed to be located?

The /var/log/rear/rear-bcnabpccip01.log file created just now will do.

I only see the option of attaching images... I'm sending it via e-mail
again.

Our current code base does not (yet) support striped lvm lvols. It will
take considerable time to get this implemented. We do accept a pull
request...

When cloning you are not sure what kind of disks you will have, so I
think striping should not be blindly applied. It is better the way it is
now. You can proof me wrong, of course...

Usually, when you want to recover/clone a server, you already know how
many disks you need to recover the same status the server were before a
disaster... In my opinion, the recover process may leave the new server
exactly with the same configurations the original was. Obviously, you
ever can modify the layout to make it different, but in my opinion it’s
better to make the defaults to be equal to the actual scenario.
