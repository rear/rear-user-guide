-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / 2017-12-20

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    Debian GNU/Linux 8.10 (jessie)

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    OUTPUT=USB  
    USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
    USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM=ext4  
    BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
    TIMESYNC=NTP  
    CLONE\_ALL\_USERS\_GROUPS="yes"

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine):  
    amd64 (backup)  
    amd64 (restore vbox 4.3.36)

-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot?  
    vbox BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I am testing restoration and created a simple VirtualBox machine
    with one hard drive (the backed up machine has multiple hard drives
    with various LVM volumes and partitions). The restore fails with a
    parted mkpart command that is called with the wrong parameter ('BIOS
    boot partition' instead of a valid partition type).

Here is a screenshot from the VM with the end of the rear.log:

Steps to reproduce:

1.  Create USB rescue image with rear mkrescue.
2.  Create VirtualBox machine with hard disk and second disk that maps
    to USB stick.
3.  Boot VBox image with USB stick and select rescue image in Grub menu.
4.  Confirm a few questions to map partition layout to single disk.
5.  From command line, invoke rear restore.

Hello @ritzmann,

Could you please paste here how does your
*/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf* looks like ?

Renamed to disklayout.txt so that I could attach it instead of
pasting.
