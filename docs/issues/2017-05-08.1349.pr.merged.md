Some modern distros (like ubuntu16.04) use systemd to control inet
naming.  
Those information are stored in `/lib/systemd/network` or
`/usr/lib/systemd/network`.

For example, my system in Ubuntu16.04 uses Predictable interface name by
default : **enp0s1**  
*I'm not a big fan of Predictable interface name, but it seems to become
the new standard (Fedora 25 / Ubuntu 16.04, CoreOS...)*

When I boot to the rescue image, the interface is renamed **eth0** =&gt;
with **NO IP** because of name chaged.

I think we should add `/lib/systemd/network` or
`/usr/lib/systemd/network` to the rescue image as we want to "replicate"
network configuration from the original machine when booting on the
rescue image.  
If the user doesn't like the "Predictable naming", it could add
`net.ifnames=0` or change the configuration file
`/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link` (which will be saved in the
rescue image)

@schabrolles  
is plain adding /lib/systemd/network or /usr/lib/systemd/network  
to the rescue image sufficient to make the recovey system somehow  
"automagically just work" also in case of predictable interface names  
or are there more adaptions and enhancements needed  
e.g. in rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
to make predictable interface names "just work"  
in the ReaR recovery system?

@gdha  
could you also have a look here because it seems  
prep/GNU/Linux/280\_include\_systemd.sh  
is mainly your file (according to "git log -p --follow ...").

@jsmeix Some changes will be required in
`rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh` during a migration.

-   booting rescue on the original system **will work without any
    changes** (Predictable Names comes from PCI topology (bus/port
    etc...))
-   booting rescue on a different system (migration) **will not work**
    because inet name should have changed (except if PCI topology is the
    same)...

=&gt; There is still some work for migration.... I notice that "modern"
distros doesn't seems to use `udev/*persistent*` anymore but use
`systemd network` instead ... (like CoreOS:
[https://coreos.com/blog/intro-to-systemd-networkd.html](https://coreos.com/blog/intro-to-systemd-networkd.html)).
I don't know if it is "stable" and if all the next linux major release
will embrace this when they will be all migrated to systemd, but we
should start to have a look.

@jsmeix Do not merge it yet until Sebastien has finished his code (and
tested from his side)

@schabrolles  
but for recovery on "same" hardware (i.e. for "non-migration")  
plain adding /lib/systemd/network or /usr/lib/systemd/network  
to the rescue image is sufficient to make networking in the  
recovey system also work for predictable interface names?

@jsmeix for recovery on "same" hardware (i.e. for "non-migration") it
works well...  
Interface is created **enp0s1** and IP is setup by OS during boot
(`/etc/network/interfaces` for ubuntu).

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04

@gdha  
from my point of view  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1349\#issuecomment-299829602](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1349#issuecomment-299829602)  
is sufficient to merge this one.

I hope there cannot be regressions when there are some more  
systemd related files in the rescue image that make some more  
systemd magic "just work" in the recovery system.  
On the other hand:  
Any more "systemd magic" might result anything ;-)
