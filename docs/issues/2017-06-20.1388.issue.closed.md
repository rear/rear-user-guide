    GRUB_RESCUE=1
    GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="Hello"

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    `UEFI`

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    My Ubuntu system is set up on an mdadm RAID1 installation. The OS is
    on a RAID1 and the backup partition is on another RAID1
    (/mnt/backupstorage0). The GRUB installation is on a separate hard
    disk which is not in a RAID.  
    The problem is, that when I execute "sudo rear -v mkbackup" it says
    everything is OK, I get no errors, but it doesn't create the GRUB2
    menu entry. I also tried entering "sudo update-grub" but that
    doesn't help.  
    The actual backup ISO is created successfully.

Hi @GamerBeast004,

By quickly checking ReaR sources *GRUB\_RESCUE* with UEFI is a bit
misleading.  
ReaRs boot entry is not included in Grub but you should rather check
your UEFI boot menu.  
Executing `efibootmgr -v` should reveal ReaR boot entry.

One more thing.  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD was dropped some time ago.

Reading
[default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf):

> The former GRUB2 superuser setup support in ReaR via GRUB\_SUPERUSER
> is dropped and  
> also the former GRUB2 password setup support in ReaR via
> GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD is dropped.  
> Both kind of setup can change the behaviour of the GRUB2 bootloader as
> a whole in unexpected ways  
> but ReaR is not meant to change the general GRUB2 configuration of the
> currently running system.  
> It works by default reasonably backward compatible when formerly a
> GRUB\_SUPERUSER was used  
> which means a GRUB2 superuser was set up by ReaR in
> /etc/grub.d/01\_users with GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD  
> so that the empty GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER results that the
> 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2 menue entry  
> can only be booted by the formerly set GRUB\_SUPERUSER with the
> formerly set GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD.

Because there are no further comments  
I assume this isssue is sufficiently answered  
so that I can close it hereby.
