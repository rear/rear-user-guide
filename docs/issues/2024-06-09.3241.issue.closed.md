My goal is to create a recoverable OS on an 8GB USB using mkrescue and
then make a mkbackuponly to a different USB 4TB hdd. Is this possible?
Then after installing ReaR and updating my site.conf file I formatted my
8GB USB for --efi using the format subcommand I found in the help guide.
I seems to almost complete but then exits with an error. Here is the
last part of the log:

Which device? The /tmp tree on the primary drive? Its a 1TB drive with
only Linux Mint 21.3 installed. Is there a way at this point to
determine how much space/workspace is required? Is there a mechanism to
define/redirect the workspace to a different drive?

If you would be so kink could you advise what step I may have missed
and/or how I can remedy it?

At your convenience. Thank you, BobMCT

@rear/contributors  
the URL of this issue is

    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3241

while our normal ReaR issues have URLs like

    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238

so this issue seems to be in a wrong place.

Now I see:  
This one had been created under

I found

so I transferred it right now from

to

@BobMCT  
see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
what information we usually need in issues  
to be able to understand what geos on.

I guess you use OUTPUT=USB together  
with BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP\_URL=usb://

This method is normally meant to be used  
with only one disk, for example as described at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

I never tried it with two disks,  
one for the ReaR recovery system  
and another one for the backup.

Offhandedly I think this could be possible  
but I assume you would have to adjust things  
in the ReaR config file(s) to make this special kind  
of usage work - in particular during "rear recover".

But I do not understand why you like to have the  
ReaR recovery system on another disk than the backup?  
Why not have the ReaR recovery system and the backup  
on one same disk as usual?

Regarding

    cp: error writing '/tmp/rear-efi.5diMF75R3L//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz': No space left on device
    ...
    Trace 4: /usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh

The code in  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh:38  
seems to be from ReaR 2.6 in your case which is

    cp -p $v "$TMP_DIR/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME" "$EFI_DST/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME" || Error "Failed to copy initrd to $EFI_DST/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh\#L38](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh#L38)

So there is no space left on device for `$EFI_DST`  
which is `${EFI_MPT}/${EFI_DIR}` where `${EFI_MPT}`  
is hardcoded `/tmp/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX`  
in `mktemp -d /tmp/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX`  
so it is hardcoded `/tmp` on the system disk  
where "rear mkrescue" runs.

In ReaR 2.7 this was improved to

    mktemp -d $TMPDIR/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh\#L38C12-L38C49](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh#L38C12-L38C49)

So upgrading to ReaR 2.7  
see
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
and then setting $TMPDIR (and exporting it)  
to a directory with more space (e.g. /var/tmp/  
which is already the default since ReaR 2.7)  
should help before calling "rear mkrescue".

See the description about TMPDIR in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for RerR 2.7 at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L44)

@BobMCT  
I think that my above analysis was wrong.

Reason:  
At /tmp/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX the ESP gets mounted  
so it is not '/tmp/' on the system disk  
where there is no space left on device  
but it is the ESP (EFI System Partition)  
on the USB disk where there is no space left on device.

To solve that specifiy a sufficiently big  
USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE in your ReaR configuration.

In ReaR 2.6 its default was 400 MIB  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L841](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L841)

In ReaR 2.7 it was increased to 1 GiB  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1053](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1053)

Regarding using two separate disks for mkrescue and mkbackuponly:

My reasoning is thus:   The mkrescue would be executed significantly  
less frequently perhaps weekly or bi-weekly but mkbackuponly would be  
executed most likely daily.  If both disks were formatted as Rear-000  
then would that suffice?

However, if the target disk was an external 4TB hdd then could both
the  
mkrescue and the mkbackuponly be written to the same device?

Does the target device have to be reformatted prior to EACH execution
if  
the results were to be written to the target drive with newer versions?

Finally, where can I get a deb file of the rear 2.7 version that I can  
install on my development machine (because I do not have compile  
capability - all my work is done remotely or with interpreted
languages).

Thanks for your help.

@BobMCT you can download pre-built packages of our `master` code from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/snapshot](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/snapshot)

I'd recommend to simply use `rear mkbackup` all the time and forego the
rather little optimisation gained by `mkbackuponly`. The time to run
`mkrescue` is much shorter compared to the backup time, typically. The
rescue image disk space requirements are rather small in comparison to a
typical backup - and you will gain a significant improvement in the
handling and convenience.

To answer your other question please share your ReaR configuration.

To use different disks please make sure to set a different
`USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL`

You can also experiment with having multiple ReaR configs that you pull
in via the `-C` option.

But, again, my honest advice would be to simply only use `mkbackup` all
the time. That also ensures that - no matter what - your rescue image
and your backup always fit together.

I am afraid that there is confusion in the USB code regarding the usage
of `BACKUP_URL` vs. `OUTPUT_URL`, so using different disks for output
and backup may have issues.

@BobMCT  
to avoid generic problems when backup and ReaR recovery system  
are separated and to avoid problems with our imperfect USB code  
I would much recommend to follow the advice of @schlomo and  
only use "rear mkbackup" with single disks all the time.  
This is what basically all others do so this way is proven  
to work reasonably well "out there in the wild".

Regarding generic problems when "rear mkrescue"  
and "rear mkbackuponly" are called at different times  
instead of using "rear mkbackup" see in the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
in particular the parts about  
"ensure your backup is consistent".

Regarding "use 'rear mkbackup' with single disks"  
versus "use 'rear mkbackup' with a single disk"  
see in the same section in particular the part about  
"ensure your backups are kept safe" that reads

    It is your task to ensure your backups are kept safe at a
    sufficiently secure place. In particular the place where
    ReaR writes a new backup (e.g. a NFS share or a USB disk)
    is not a really safe place to also keep old backups
    (arbitrary things might go wrong when writing there). 

So if you use only one disk where already a backup is  
stored, something might go terribly wrong when writing  
a subsequent beckup there (via "rear mkbackup")  
so in the end all might be lost on that disk.  
I.e. to be reasonably on the safe side  
you should use at least two separated disks.

Closing this as it seems to be that alls has been said. You can reopen
for new thoughts on this topic.
