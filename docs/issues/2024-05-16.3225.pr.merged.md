-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In usr/sbin/rear make it more clear  
in a comment and in DebugPrint messages  
when ReaR's TMP\_DIR gets used  
(in contrast to the system's TMPDIR)

Details - from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223\#issuecomment-2114294271](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223#issuecomment-2114294271)

While debugging things in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-2112594449](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-2112594449)  
I got a bit confused because it was not clear to me  
if ReaR's TMP\_DIR was used versus the system's TMPDIR  
so I inspected the code in usr/sbin/rear which was

        if ! [[ "$RECOVERY_MODE" || "$PORTABLE" ]] ; then
            ...
                tmpdir_debug_info="Setting TMPDIR to '$TMP_DIR' (was unset when ReaR was launched)"
            ...
        else
            ...
                tmpdir_debug_info="Setting TMPDIR to '$TMPDIR' (was unset when ReaR was launched)"

i.e. same message text like

    Setting TMPDIR to '/var/tmp' (was unset when ReaR was launched)

for two different cases so it was not possible  
to see from the message text which case it was.  
The '/var/tmp' indicates it was the second case  
but that is not 100% clear.  
So that I had to reverse-engineer things  
to understand what actually goes on.  
With the improvement it looks like

    Setting TMPDIR to ReaR's '/var/tmp/rear.3pc7RyD4Ki2uoMC/tmp' (was unset when ReaR was launched)

versus

    Setting TMPDIR to '/var/tmp' (was unset when ReaR was launched)
