As explain in \#1533, `rear mkrescue` failed when using with TSM because
of the need of additional libraries.  
This error comes from the image rescue check made in
`build/default/980_verify_rootfs.sh`.  
Two solutions here:

1- Update and export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH in
`prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh`. When exported, LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
will be inherit into the chrooted environment used in
`build/default/980_verify_rootfs.sh`:

    for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable -printf '/%P\n' ) ; do
        chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/ldd $binary | grep -q 'not found' && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary"
    done

2- We don't need all the stuff provided by the TSM client in the rescue
image (~300MB). Only `dsmc` (tsm client) binary, with some libraries and
config files.  
I usually use the following `COPY_AS_IS_TSM` within my conf file which
do not complain about missing libraries during `rear mkrescue` and
reduced the size of TSM client to (~30MB).

    COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmc /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/tsmbench_inclexcl /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.opt /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/libgpfs.so /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/libdmapi.so /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/EN_US/dsmclientV3.cat /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* )

Even if the 2nd option seems to be more optimized (size, time saving
during initrd compression) it could be also source of issues because we
cannot be sure that this set of file (name, libraries, config files)
will remain the same with the next version of TSM. So I prefer to use
the First solution (LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH) and let the users update
themselves their local.conf file if they want to optimize initrd size.

@jsmeix, I know you don't have TSM, but I would like to get your
feedback about this PR.  
Do you think we can use `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ?  
Could you confirm that `prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh`is the best
place for that ?  
Thanks for your help and review here.

@schabrolles  
I fear setting a global TSM-specific LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
for all programs in all ReaR scripts that run after  
prep/TSM/default/400\_prep\_tsm.sh  
might lead to unexpected side effects like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533\#issuecomment-336622504](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533#issuecomment-336622504)  
because libraries via LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH have  
precedence over the "normal" ones.

I would prefer to keep "dirty hacks" as local as possible.

Accordingly I suggest the TSM-specific LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
is only locally set for the particular 'ldd' command  
where it is actually needed.

E.g. only in build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh something like:

<pre>
local old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
test $LD_LIBRARY_PATH && old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
if test "TSM" = "$BACKUP" ; then
    # Use a TSM-specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH to find TSM libraries
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/cit/bin
fi
for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable -printf '/%P\n' ) ; do
    chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/ldd $binary | grep -q 'not found' && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary"
done
test $old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH || unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

I tried to avoid to have a possibly empty LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
set at the end.

I guess in case of an initially empty LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
the resulting TSM-specific LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH with  
a leading colon ":/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin:/opt/..."  
also works?

@schabrolles  
I wonder if the hardcoded TSM-specific LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
is sufficiently future proof?  
Perhaps in default.conf a

<pre>
TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/cit/bin"
</pre>

and then

<pre>
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

is better?

FWIW:  
Currently things nicely fall apart when someone has  
blanks in the directories in his LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH ;-)  
cf.

@schabrolles  
and - by the way - I think you should add a comment in default.conf  
about how TSM users could optimize their COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM  
(I think a really small recovery ISO is required at least on  
some POWER systems where the initrd must be small)  
and what issues such an optimization might cause.

@jsmeix, thanks ;-)  
I'm currently testing it

@jsmeix, it is working. tested with rhel 6 + tsm 7  
I'm gonna merge this one soon if you agree.

@schabrolles  
I agree

@schabrolles  
would you accept a pull request from me  
with what I proposed in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562\#issuecomment-342113626](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562#issuecomment-342113626)  
or do you not want to have that described in default.conf  
and in this case I would like to know why.

@jsmeix, Sorry, I'm a bit busy with a lot a different project those days
and I totally forget to do it.  
It is now done in \#1566

No need to say sorry for anything!  
I do appreciate all your work and contributions.
