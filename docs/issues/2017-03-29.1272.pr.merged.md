This patch corrects problems with mawk, which allowed maximum integer
0x7FFFFFFF (2147483647) when "%d" conversion specification format was
used.  
This caused that maximum allowed partition size was limited to ~2GB.

I wonder what "round starting size to next multiple of 4096"  
actually means, in particular what the 'next' therein means.

Does it mean that e.g. 123 \* 4096 should be rounded to 123 \* 4096  
or does the 'next' mean 123 \* 4096 should be rounded to 124 \* 4096

In the latter case the current calculation is actually right.

@gozora  
when we agreed on what that calculation actually means,  
an additional explanatory comment in the code  
could help to avoid confusion for future conributors ;-)

@gozora  
just an informal comment regarding coding style:  
In bash arithmetic evaluation (( ... )) variables do not  
need a leading '$' according to "man bash"

<pre>
Within an expression, shell variables may also
be referenced by name without using the parameter
expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null
or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name
without using the  parameter expansion syntax.
</pre>

Therefore I wonder what is better coding style:

<pre>
result=$(( ( $foo - $bar ) / $baz ))
</pre>

or

<pre>
result=$(( ( foo - bar ) / baz ))
</pre>

Furthermore I wonder why in 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
a variable block\_size is calculated and used for stuff for  
logical partition and in the next block there is a guess that  
"4096 is a good match for most device's block size".

It seems I completely fail to understand the code  
in 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh :-(

Accordingly I dismiss my review because I think  
a review from one who fails to understand the code  
does not really help you.

I would very much appreciate it if @gozora or @gdha  
could explain 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh to me.

@jsmeix, @gdha as I'm really bad in working on two things at once, I'd
put this pull request on hold until I've finished XFS testing topic then
I'll check *100\_include\_partition\_code.sh* more deeply.

Hope you don't mind.

Btw. original code seems to be created by @jhoekx so maybe he can bring
bit of light into this?  
(If I'm wrong just tell me and I'll read my Git book bought on Fosdem
one more time :-) ).

Great so I'm not crazy after all! I've noticed syntax
`result=$(( ( foo - bar ) / baz ))` but I ignored that :-).

If you ask me, I like `result=$(( ( $foo - $bar ) / $baz ))` more
because $ somehow evokes variable for me ..

@gdha  
I think we should for now simply merge this pull request  
because it fixes the mawk issue without changing the  
result of the calculations so that it cannot make things worse.

Later - as time permits - I may have a closer look  
at the code in 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh and  
perhaps then I might be able to improve it.
