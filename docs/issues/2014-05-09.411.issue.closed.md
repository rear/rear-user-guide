Hi,

I tested REAR (1.15 & 1.16) in combination with EMC² Networker (V 8.1)
on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64Bit).

"rear -v mkbackup" works fine.

"rear recovery" failed (screenshot below):

Function 'iconv\_open' failed for UTF-8 to ANSI conversion. The function
may be unable to determine the current locale. Verify appropriate values
in environment variables LC\_MESSAGES, LC\_ALL and LANG.

Please help me to fix this issue!

Thanks

I guess you might miss some library or locales from NSR itself. Check
the prep/NSR section of what been pulled into the rear rescue image

Do you meen this folder: /usr/share/rear/prep/NSR ?  
There is only the "default" direcotry with two scripts: 40\_prep\_nsr.sh
and 45\_check\_nsr\_client.sh

What should I pull into the rear rescure image to run NSR correctly?

@bastiw88 sorry for the delay - found something interesting:
[https://community.emc.com/thread/164152](https://community.emc.com/thread/164152)  
Could be that we need `locale` and `/usr/lib/locale` in our recovery
image? I cannot tell, I hope you have some starting points to get
further? Please return some feedback, ok?

@gdha  
thanks for your feedback and help.  
Sorry, I'm a newbie in using REAR. How do I add additional
packages/software to my recovery image (running: <code>rear
mkbackup</code>)?

Thanks a lot :-)

Put following line into your site.conf or local.conf:  
PROGS=( "${PROGS\[@\]}" locale )

@bastiw88 and do not forget to add
`COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /usr/lib/locale )` as well

Hi,  
sorry, I had no time to test this workaround.  
I inform you, as soon as I can test rear with ubuntu 12.04. and emc
networker.

I have exactly the same issue but on RHEL 5. RHEL 6 is working fine.

I put PROGS=( "${PROGS\[@\]}" locale ) and COPY\_AS\_IS=(
${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]} /usr/lib/locale ) into my my site.conf without
success.

any other suggestions to solve this?

I did a test today and these two options doesn't work in Ubuntu 12.04
LTS 64Bit too.

@bastiw88 @chnusti @alxgu We did the integration with NW 8.0. Therefore,
I suspect that with NW 8.1 an additional library was added which wasn't
there with NW 8.0. Unfortunately, I do not have access to any NW
server/client environment anymore (as the integration was performed
on-site of a customer).

@bastiw88 @rear/contributors @chnusti Were you able to test rear-1.17.0
with NW 8.1 already? Does it work better or is it still the same?

@gdha  
Sorry for the delay.  
I tryed to test it with the following Settings:

lgtoclnt 8.1.2.3  
rear 1.17.1

Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS  
3.2.0-37-generic

site.conf:  
BACKUP=NSR  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://XXX.FQDNl/data/col1/backup/rear/output  
NSRSERVER=BAK.FQDN  
RETENTION\_TIME="5Weeks"  
USE\_CFG2HTML=y

Same error :-(

Any idea?

Thanks

@bastiw88 if you check the installation manual of NSR does it mention
anything special? Like a package that must be present to make NSR work
properly? I think we need to verify this first before doing something on
the rear side...

Addidionally you need the package "rpcbind" in ubuntu (apt-get install
rpcbind). But this is not specific for lgto 8.x. It's necessary in all
version of lgto client.

That will enlarge the rescue image by all the libraries in that
directory. Better would be to be more specific and take only what we
need. Also, the library path will be different depending on the distro
etc. That is why we have the LIBS variable for libraries. The content
will be resolved and searched for, not simply copied as is.

@bastiw88 could you test out with `ldd` command which libs it actual
needs?

And if `ldd` does not show it, please try to use `strace` to find out
which libraries are loaded dynamically.
