I have created a symbolic link from  
/usr/lib/SYSLINUX/mbr.bin to /usr/lib/ISOLINUX/isolinux.bin  
to get rear to create the USB files on the 4 GB usb drive.  
the local.conf file has  
OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
BACKUP=BAREOS  
BAREOS\_CLIENT=zeus-fd

I have also tried /usr/lib/SYSLINUX/mbr.bin to
/usr/lib/SYSLINUX/isolinux.bin which also works but I must have
isolinux.bin - mbr.bin does not pass the tests in rear

when I put the usb thumb drive in a different dell computer the
indicated menu does not come up but ends with the No Default or UI
message. I am using the rear\_1.17.1\_all.deb on Ubuntu 15.04

I have tried 2 different dell computers but both get the same error.

the creation log file looks ok to me but is attached here for
clarification:

Did you install EXTLINUX? in version rear-1.17.1 we had to fix some
ISOLINUX issues due to Ubuntu's re-arraging several packages around
syslinux, isolinux and extlinux executables.  
The OUTPUT=USB was not yet tested nor modified. I guess some work has to
be done in that area.

Yes, according to synaptic, I have extlinux, syslinux-common,
syslinux-efi, syslinux. installed version 3:6.03+dfsg-5ubuntu1. rear
says it is formatting in ext3 but the device needs to be unmounted to
perform the format. The rear -v mkbackup (or mkrescue) do not care
whether I mount or not after the format. Also I had assumed from the
fixes suggested on the site, I would not have to link the mbr.bin file
to isolinux.bin but I did. PS thanks for deleting extra info, was not
sure what you needed to see.

@hi-flyer rear will automatically mount the USB device when required
(and umount it afterwards). Perhaps, run `rear -vD mkrescue` to have the
debug output. I think we need to adapt the manner to find the proper
`mbr.bin` for extlinux also, like we did for isolinux. I'm having my
vacation, so I take some time off and will not debug it myself. For
effort is very much appreciated!

Because 'find /usr' may take very long time on some systems  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2792](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2792)  
now via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/339cff93232460fc5098b06c666c925d88459360](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/339cff93232460fc5098b06c666c925d88459360)  
the function find\_syslinux\_modules\_dir  
tells the user in debug mode what is going on  
(plus a hint one "may specify SYSLINUX\_MODULES\_DIR")  
when the fallback 'find /usr' is run  
to find the SYSLINUX modules directory.
