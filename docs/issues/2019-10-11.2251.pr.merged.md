-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

Tested on CentOS 7, running 7 FDR/Upstream services. Temporarily set
$countmax=3 to verify that the infinite loop detection works properly.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Users may run multiple FDR/Upstream services on a single machine. This
code change allows ReaR to copy FDR/Upstream logs from the recovery
environment to the restored system for all running services. Previously
the code was expecting to find only one set of logs and reports in the
FDR/Upstream installation directory. For several years now, logs and
reports have been stored in a new location ($FDRUPSTREAM\_DATA\_PATH),
so we check here instead.

@rowens275  
thank you for your enhancement for BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM.

In general regarding BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM:  
There is nothing at all what I could do in case of issues  
with third-party backup tools or any other third-party software  
because I do not have such software on my test systems  
so that I can neither test nor reproduce anything.  
But I can help with generic bash scripting issues.

According to the output of

    git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/restore/FDRUPSTREAM/default/260_copy_log_and_report.sh

you @rowens275 have been the original author of  
usr/share/rear/restore/FDRUPSTREAM/default/260\_copy\_log\_and\_report.sh  
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/200174fc2c273874a23219724f65cc7393503d03](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/200174fc2c273874a23219724f65cc7393503d03)  
so I think we at ReaR upstream could "just accept" this pull request  
except one notices a generic issue with that changes.

When there is no second review from another ReaR maintainer  
I will "just merge" it tomorrow afternoon.

I made the recommended change to check if SERVICENAME is empty.
