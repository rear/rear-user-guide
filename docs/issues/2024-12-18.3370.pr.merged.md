With the current commits in this pull request  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
is the only file left that needs to be updated regarding ReaR 2.8  
i.e. no other file falsely contains '2.7' where it should be '2.8'.

Via the last two commits I replaced  
the old doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
by a completely new one to finally solve

@jsmeix Could you please correct some misspelled words before the actual
release?

In the new one  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/jsmeix-rear28-preparations/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/jsmeix-rear28-preparations/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
the line breaks are sometimes not very good  
(but the content is at least readable).  
I created it as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/README.md)  
via

    export LC_ALL=POSIX
    export LANG=POSIX
    lynx --dump https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-8 >rear-release-notes.txt

So I leave the line breaks as is.

@gdha  
thank you for review.  
I will fix the misspelled words in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md)  
and re-generate doc/rear-release-notes.txt from it.

Fixed typos (which all wrere only in the git commit messages)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md)

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3370\#issuecomment-2553237981](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3370#issuecomment-2553237981)  
the following happened because of those "not very good"  
line breaks of what 'lynx' produces:

    # for w in tha interactiv characte ; do grep -A1 -w "$w" rear-release-notes.txt ; done

    New variable USE_RAMDISK configures rescue system to use a ramdisk for tools tha
    t need to check for free disk space.

    In the UserInput function drain stdin if stdin is a terminal (i.e. in interactiv
    e mode):

    The primarily intended use case is to discard possibly already existing characte
    rs

And 'clude' is false alarm:

    # grep -w 'clude' rear-release-notes.txt

    * Remove duplicates in backup-[in/ex]clude.txt but keep the ordering

@jsmeix I'm sorry, please generate the text release notes as you see
fit.

If the text release notes file makes so much work, maybe we can get rid
of it or simply have a one-liner pointing to the home page? Less effort
and good enough? I'm not sure if so many users actually only can read
the release notes when it is shipped with the ReaR package itself.

Or just use the original file in markdown format?

    lynx -dont_wrap_pre --dump https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-8 >rear-release-notes.txt

improves things - at least in the git commit messages.  
Now the `tha` `interactiv` `characte` issues are gone.

But '-dont\_wrap\_pre' still results "strange" line breaks  
in normal text, e.g.

         * New portable mode --portable and OUTPUT=PORTABLE, see
           [23]https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/17-Port
           able-Mode.adoc for more information.

where the long URL gets wrapped within the word "Portable".

Allow lines up to 100 characters for normal text  
helps a lot to avoid ugly looking line breaks:

    lynx -dont_wrap_pre -width=100 --dump https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-8 >rear-release-notes.txt

@rear/contributors  
I will merge this pull request very soon  
to be able to do "the actual release" today  
(I must leave at 14:00 today because of an appointment).

All checks are successful  
except "Codespell / codespell" which is false alarm.  
So I merge it now.
