Added 'tail -n1' to get only the last value if there are more than one  
and because getting values from sysconfig files is like sourcing  
a shell script it is the last setting that matters, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c291991ace856a56843c6e45cb121af06829f82c\#commitcomment-19500870](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c291991ace856a56843c6e45cb121af06829f82c#commitcomment-19500870)

Cf.

that reads (excerpt):  
source /etc/sysconfig/FOO  
echo $MY\_VALUE  
and  
[http://ftp.novell.hu/pub/mirrors/ftp.novell.com/forge/library/SUSE%20Package%20Conventions/spc\_sysconfig.html](http://ftp.novell.hu/pub/mirrors/ftp.novell.com/forge/library/SUSE%20Package%20Conventions/spc_sysconfig.html)  
that reads (excerpts):  
The configuration is easily readable by shell scripts  
The sysconfig files are plain text files.  
The setting is defined by pairs {VARIABLE,value} the following way,  
like shell variables:  
VARIABLE=”value”
