-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Created and UEFI booted ReaR recovery system on RHEL 7.6, SLES12 SP2
    and Fedora29

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    It looks like
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f9e53a331c226fa305145866492bb978a1e66a2a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f9e53a331c226fa305145866492bb978a1e66a2a)
    introduced a regression for Linux distributions that ships Grub2 EFI
    modules (grub2-efi-x64-modules) only in
    */usr/lib/grub\*/x86\_64-efi* but does not copy them to */boot* when
    installed (observed on RHEL7.6 and Fedora29 so far, but there might
    be more ...).  
    Missing modules in */boot* combined with code from
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f9e53a331c226fa305145866492bb978a1e66a2a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f9e53a331c226fa305145866492bb978a1e66a2a)

<!-- -->

    test "$( find /boot -type f -name "$grub_module.mod" 2>/dev/null )" && grub_modules="$grub_modules $grub_module"

are causing that resulting boot loader *BOOTX64.efi* is silently missing
all the important modules because `grub-mkimage` is executed without any
module as follows:

    ++ grub2-mkimage -v -O x86_64-efi -c /tmp/rear.XqviherDVAkuSdo/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg -o /tmp/rear.XqviherDVAkuSdo/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi -p /EFI/BOOT

where command should look something like:

    ++ grub2-mkimage -v -O x86_64-efi -c /tmp/rear.0al2HwSlvQ5XsiC/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg -o /tmp/rear.0al2HwSlvQ5XsiC/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi -p /EFI/BOOT part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux linuxefi multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs

ReaR rescue system is created, but after boot attempt following message
appear:

This was originally proposed by @jsmeix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001\#issuecomment-446536035](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001#issuecomment-446536035)
but somehow fall into oblivion.

As far as I see this issue is basically what I had meant with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001\#issuecomment-446536035](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001#issuecomment-446536035)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001\#issuecomment-446659273](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001#issuecomment-446659273)  
but it was not finally answered there.

For the log:  
On my SLES12-like openSUSE Leap 15.0 UEFI system  
I get for `rear -D mkrescue` in the log

    ++ grub2-mkimage -v -O x86_64-efi -c /tmp/rear.h4XFbmUFzskCRHg/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg -o /tmp/rear.h4XFbmUFzskCRHg/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi -p /EFI/BOOT part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux linuxefi multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs

@gozora  
apparently I did not see much far so "early" in the morning when I
wrote  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2039\#issuecomment-462673120](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2039#issuecomment-462673120)  
because you had already mentioned exactly that.

Yes, there is "something" in SLE (12 & 15), I did not found so far that,
that copies some modules from */usr/lib/grub2/x86\_64-efi* to
*/boot/grub2/x86\_64-efi*. RHEL on the other hand, does not have such
behavior.
