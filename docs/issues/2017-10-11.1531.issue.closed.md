Hi, @metro1234

Default options are used for mounting of your OUTPUT\_URL, which is
fully ok, as you did not explicitly specify them.

Try to add something like:

    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="username=testuser,domain=rear,vers=2.0"

or if OUTPUT\_OPTIONS should be same as BACKUP\_OPTIONS add following
line AFTER line with BACKUP\_OPTIONS

    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_OPTIONS"

V.
