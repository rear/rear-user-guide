    Running rear mkrescue (PID 15205)
    Using log file: /projects/rear/myforks/rear/var/log/rear/rear-okido.log
    ERROR: Carriage return character in /projects/rear/myforks/rear/etc/rear/local.conf (perhaps DOS or Mac format)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: If
    configuration files contain hidden carriage returns this often runs
    into an error (which is sometimes not obvious to understand where
    the issue came from). With this patch we will bail out and tell the
    user to fix his config file

Currently it tests only site.conf local.conf and rescue.conf  
but sbin/rear sources several other config files too (excerpts):

<pre>
source $SHARE_DIR/conf/default.conf
</pre>

perhaps we can assume default.conf is never modified by the user  
but I think there have been already issues where users had  
messed around with default.conf ?

<pre>
test -r "$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf" && Source "$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf" || true
test -r "$CONFIG_DIR/$WORKFLOW.conf" && Source "$CONFIG_DIR/$WORKFLOW.conf" || true
</pre>

I think all \*.conf files in $CONFIG\_DIR could have been broken by the
user  
so that all \*.conf files in $CONFIG\_DIR should be tested.

@schlomo  
I think your `Nice trick with 'tr'` comment means  
that you don't know a plain bash-only method and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1965\#issuecomment-439432400](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1965#issuecomment-439432400)  
is answered.

FYI:  
With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1970](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1970)  
it would be possible to use the Source function return code  
to actually check in commands like `Source "$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf"`  
whether or not that was actually successful - but still note  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1965\#issuecomment-439330017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1965#issuecomment-439330017)  
i.e. as long as it is allowed that the last command in config files
could fail  
we cannot use the Source function return code to check if config files  
are valid as I did in

@jsmeix Glad to use your code and as the issue was already closed I
decided to add it to rear before we all forgot about it. Anyhow, a big
thank you.  
IMHO I think these 3 scripts are in 99% of the cases where end-users
play with - if they touches other scripts or config files then we may
consider them as experts, no?

@gdha  
yes, as it is now it should detect 99.9% of such cases.
