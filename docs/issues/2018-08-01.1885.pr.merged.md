-   How was this pull request tested? Tested on AIX/LPAR/PPC64le

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   Use `blockdev` to retrieve the size of the disk and block size
        (unused)
    -   Compute partition start using 512 bytes blocks (this is
        hardcoded in the Linux kernel)

@rmetrich are you sure that other users of `get_block_size()` actually
want the logical block size and not simply 512 bytes? I suspect it might
be more correct to simply make it return 512 always. E.g. in
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh`:

        # Get all strings in the first 512*4=2048 bytes on the disk:
        bootloader_area_strings_file="$TMP_DIR/bootloader_area_strings"
        block_size=$( get_block_size ${disk_device##*/} )
        dd if=$disk_device bs=$block_size count=4 | strings >$bootloader_area_strings_file

Not sure about
`usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh`.
There it is used e.g. in

                block_size=$( get_block_size "$sysfs_name" )
                device_size=$( get_disk_size  "$sysfs_name" )

                ### GPT disks need 33 LBA blocks at the end of the disk
                # For the SUSE specific gpt_sync_mbr partitioning scheme
                # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544
                if [[ "$label" == "gpt" || "$label" == "gpt_sync_mbr" ]] ; then
                    device_size=$( mathlib_calculate "$device_size - 33*$block_size" )

@pcahyna I don't know, that's why I left the code unchanged.  
If `get_block_size` is always supposed to be set to 512 on Linux, then
we can just get rid off that function.

Regarding usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh

It should not matter if it gets the strings in the first 512 \* 4 = 2048
bytes on the disk  
or if it gets the strings in the first 4096 \* 4 = 16384 bytes on the
disk because  
it is just some reasonable looking limit what the "first bytes on the
disk"  
should be that are examined to guess the used bootloader.  
If that "first bytes on the disk" are 16384 nothing should go wrong.  
Furthermore this part of the code is already where ReaR guesses  
which means this code can never work 100% right and it is not meant  
to work 100% right. If ReaR's guess is wrong the user must explicitly  
specify his actually used bootloader via the BOOTLOADER variable.

Regarding
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh

I am really not at all an expert in GPT partitioning but I would
assume  
nothing goes wrong if more space is left at the end of the disk  
(i.e. 33 \* 4096 = 135168 with 4K block size instead of usually
16896).  
I think all what happens is that there is a bit more possibly unused  
space at the end of the disk.  
The 33 \* 512 space at the end of the disk is for the "Secondary GPT",
see  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID\_Partition\_Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table)  
but I think a GPT is not hard limited to 33 \* 512 = 16896 bytes.  
I think 33 \* 512 = 16896 bytes is only the default space that should be
reserved  
as minimum for the GPT because  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID\_Partition\_Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table)  
reads

<pre>
The UEFI specification stipulates that a minimum of 16,384 bytes,
regardless of sector size, be allocated for the Partition Entry Array.
</pre>

where 16384 = 128 \* 128 which matches 128 GPT partition entries.  
But as far as I know GPT is not hard limited to 128 partitions.  
I think GPT would support more than 128 partitions.

By the way:  
Currently ReaR fails badly if there are more than 128 partitions,  
see usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh

<pre>
get_partition_number() {
...
    # Catch if $number is too big, report it as a bug
    (( $number <= 128 ))
    StopIfError "Partition $partition is numbered '$number'. More than 128 partitions is not supported."
</pre>

I know I know - the whole layout code gets older and older  
and needs more and more to be completely overhauled,

Is it true that recovery on a non-512B-sector disk has been completely
non-working until now, so there is no risk of regressions even if the

Thanks for pointing the issue. I don't know either what is **no-image**,
but for sure `blockdev /dev/sr0` fails because there is no disk
inserted.  
So we need to do fall-through to old method instead.

Still, I'm wondering what is the reason for getting size of /dev/sr0 if

@rmetrich  
the reason for getting size of /dev/sr0 even if there is no disk is that
code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh

<pre>
    for current_device_path in /sys/block/* ; do
        # Continue with next block device if the device is a multipath device slave
        is_multipath_path ${current_device_path#/sys/block/} && continue
        # Continue with next block device if the current one has no queue directory:
        test -d $current_device_path/queue || continue
        # Continue with next block device if no size can be read for the current one:
        test -r $current_device_path/size || continue
        current_disk_name="${current_device_path#/sys/block/}"
        current_size=$( get_disk_size $current_disk_name )
        test "$current_size" -gt '0' && replacement_hardware_disk_sizes=( "${replacement_hardware_disk_sizes[@]}" "$current_size" )
    done
</pre>

For this particular use case it would be right when the get\_disk\_size
function  
results `0` as fallback value when `blockdev` fails - but I don't know
if this  
fallback value is the right one also for all other get\_disk\_size
function calls.

I think I can reproduce it on a KVM/QEMU virtual machine  
with a second virtual IDE CDROM drive where no medium is  
(i.e. where no ISO image is connected to) because there I get:

in contrast to /dev/sr0 with a medium/ISO image

# blockdev --getsize64 /dev/sr0
69345280

@rmetrich  
I propose to change the blockdev calls to

<pre>
    if has_binary blockdev ; then
        # sda/sda1 -> sda1 ; sda -> sda
        blockdev --getsize64 /dev/${disk_name##*/} && return
    fi
</pre>

and

<pre>
    if has_binary blockdev ; then
        blockdev --getss /dev/$disk_name && return
    fi
</pre>

i.e. a simple try and fall through if it fails.  
A possible blockdev error message appears automatically in the log.

@schabrolles  
could you re-test if now the failure is avoided on your systems?

This shows how important it is that various different people test
something  
because I would never ever had the idea to set up a testing KVM system  
with an additional CDROM where no ISO is attached to...

Why? No disk is something different than a disk with zero size.

The question rather is, why does ReaR need to know the size of the DVD?

That get\_disk\_size function seems to be an endless cause of pain  
because I found
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1370](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1370)  
which was avoided by @gozora at that time by adding  
the retry\_command function so that in

<pre>
retry_command test -r /sys/block/$disk_name/size || Error "..."
</pre>

it retries 5 times and waits 1 second between each retry  
if /sys/block/$disk\_name/size appears.

But now if blockdev is available we just run it once and fall through if
it fails  
without any waiting if something what it needs may become available a
bit later.

This may lead to a wrong disk size output when blockdev would output  
the right disk size but fails because something what it needs is not yet
available  
and the old fall-through code results a wrong disk size output.

Therefore I wonder if that

<pre>
retry_command test -r /sys/block/$disk_name/size || Error "..."
</pre>

waiting should not be better also before the blockdev call like
(excerpt):

<pre>
    retry_command test -r /sys/block/$disk_name/size || Error "Could not determine size of disk $disk_name"

    if has_binary blockdev; then
        blockdev --getsize64 /dev/$disk_name && return
    fi

    # Linux always considers sectors to be 512 bytes long. See the note in the
    # kernel source, specifically, include/linux/types.h regarding the sector_t
    # type for details.
    local block_size=512
    local nr_blocks=$( < /sys/block/$disk_name/size)
    local disk_size=$(( nr_blocks * block_size ))

Hmm, we miss the real root cause here. I suspect this is due to some
partprobe just before that and it took some time for udev to create the
device names.  
Also found such issue when loading the usb-storage module: it took some
seconds for device nodes to show up.

Good grief!

I see now that we have had already "much fun" in 2017  
with that little piece of code and how to avoid issues with it,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1418](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1418)

It seems up to now I had successfully managed to forget about it  
but now it seems that little monster touches me again - how scaring!

if you are really brave you may dare to read through  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1418](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1418)  
It even contains `partprobe` ;-)

In general about waiting for device like thingies see

I know - I know - the whole layout code gets older and older

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885\#issuecomment-410697398](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885#issuecomment-410697398)  
with a second virtual IDE CDROM drive where no medium/ISO is.  
FYI:  
During "rear -D recover" I get in the log (excerpts)

<pre>

The size of /sev/sr0 is a bit different here compared to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885\#issuecomment-410697398](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885#issuecomment-410697398)  
because there is a new ReaR recovery system ISO with the latest code.

I will merge it soon today unless there are objections right now  
because it is currently a good step forward and it should be  
sufficiently backward compatible so that further regressions  
should be (hopefully) mostly avoided.

I dared to add explanatory comments directly to your code here  
so that at any time later it is still clear from plain reading the
code  
why the code is as it is even for users who cannot compare or
reproduce  
how the code behaves under different conditions on different systems  
cf.
