With the current changes in 070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
and 540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh it works for me  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166)  
but I need to verify if I didn't break other things.

Do not yet merge it.  
I need to do more tests and  
I need to adapt the documentation.

I made the backup selection dialog behave  
now reasonably well for me and  
I made the USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR  
description in default.conf less specific about  
how many backups / recovery systems will be kept  
according to my experience in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166\#issuecomment-273101775](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166#issuecomment-273101775)

FYI:

How recovery looks now for me  
when there is more than one backup detected (excerpts):

How recovery looks now for me  
when there is only one backup detected  
and that backup is even not in the recovery system  
i.e. made by a "rear mkrescue" with timestamp "...1447"  
and a "rear mkbackuponly" with timestamp "...1149"  
(excerpts):

I.e. no useless backup selection dialog if there is only one backup  
plus automated switch from a non-existing default backup file  
to an actually existing (i.e. autodetected) backup file.

Now it looks good to me so that I will merge it soon.

I will not merge it soon because there is a bug  
in the backup selection  
see above:

<pre>
Select a backup archive.
1) 20170117.1057
2) 20170117.1106

I selected "4) 20170117.1149" but I got "3) 20170117.1144" restored!

How embarrassing: I outsmarted myself!  
My overclever attempt in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1168/commits/4f6f21ae469877177536bd418d546f7696ccacfe](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1168/commits/4f6f21ae469877177536bd418d546f7696ccacfe)  
to run the 'set +x' in a subshell during the backup selection dialog  
to easily return to the environment settings of before after the  
backup selection dialog makes of course all set variables within  
that dialog useless after returning from that subshell which results  
that the initially set and reported RESTORE\_ARCHIVES value  
is actually used.

Surprise!  
As soon as one implements it correctly it even works correctly ;-)

I am currently testing if with my latest changes  
when USB\_SUFFIX is set that then backup on USB  
still works in compliance with backup on NFS  
so that in particular incremental backups on USB  
still "just work" with my changes in this pull request.

I have now in local.conf

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
USB_SUFFIX="my_incremental_backups"
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS=7
FULLBACKUPDAY=Wed
</pre>

I did "rear mkrescue" and three times "rear mkbackuponly".

On my my REAR-000 medium that results

<pre>
rear/e205/my_incremental_backups/kernel
rear/e205/my_incremental_backups/rear-e205.log
rear/e205/my_incremental_backups/syslinux.cfg

Recovery "just works" for me (excerpts):

Now I think I can merge it.
