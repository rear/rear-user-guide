##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: Bug Fix

-   Impact: Low

-   Reference to related issue (URL): none.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I tested the pull request on a CentOS 6.9 VM and a RHEL6 and 7 based
    server.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The script `650_check_iso_recoverable.sh` exits with FALSE if it
    cannot find an ISO image stored on the NSR\_SERVER.  
    In case the "NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE" is set to "yes" saving an ISO image
    to the NSR\_SERVER is not allowed. Because of this
    `rear checklayout` (in the cronjob "rear") is always FALSE in this
    mode and a rescue image is created daily even if not required.  
    This pull request shall correct the behaviour with skipping the ISO
    check in the mode NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=yes.

@hpannenb It makes sense, OTOH I'm not able to test it myself.
Therefore, I'm hoping it won't break work-flows (based on wrong
assumptions from this *changed* script)
