#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4 / 2018-06-21

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Ubuntu 18.04

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"): NA

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): KVM guest

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): amd64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): NA

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): local disk

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
    Ubuntu 18.04 uses systemd-resolved for DNS resolution therefore the
    entry in /etc/resolv.conf is 127.0.0.53. When the rescue media is
    created this fails to resolve DNS and therefore also fails to
    resolve hostnames for remote backups. Current DNS servers can be
    retrieved by `systemd-resolve --status`, there are probably other
    methods to get DNS.

-   Workaround, if any: after booting into recovery media set DNS
    servers by hand

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

I do not use systemd-resolved and I don't know  
whether or not there is specific support needed for it in ReaR.

I simply use `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` because I have a DHCP server  
in my network so that this alone is sufficient in my use case to get  
networking set up in the ReaR recovery system.

@nniehoff  
if you do not have a DHCP server in your network  
you may use NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
to specify the needed commands to set up networking  
in the ReaR recovery system, see its description in  
default.conf e.g. online at  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

Because you did not provide us your ReaR configuration files  
(why did you decide your ReaR configuration is not needed?)  
I don't know why you need networking in the ReaR recovery system.  
Usually networking in the ReaR recovery system is only needed  
to access the backup on a remote location to be able to restore it  
so that usually you only need a minimal networking setup  
that is sufficient to get the backup from another host.  
E.g. when you specify the IP address as in

    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

no DNS is needed to access the backup on the NFS server, cf.  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf)

If you must use systemd-resolved to set up networking  
in the ReaR recovery system check first of all that all needed  
files to run systemd-resolved within the ReaR recovery system  
are included in the ReaR recovery system. You may use  
`KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"` (see its description in default.conf)  
to check more easily what is included in the ReaR recovery system.  
Then boot the ReaR recovery system and try to manually launch  
systemd-resolved from within the ReaR recovery system  
if it is not already somehow magically running.

    COPY_AS_IS_BORG=( "/root/.config/borg/keys/" )

    export BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="yes"

I will look into using the NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS to see if I
can come up with a workaround. You are correct a potential workaround
would be to use an IP however, I typically avoid using IPs as DNS is
usually a better practice (an argument could be made in a disaster
recovery situation it may not be a good idea to rely on DNS either).

I reported this bug as the default in Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) and later is
to use systemd-resolved.

If I understand it well - if the `/etc/resolv.conf` symlink is replaced
with a real file then DNS lookup should work as well. Could you try this
as it would make it easier for us then supported yet another systemd
sub-service

@nniehoff  
I forgot to say that I am not a Ubuntu user (I am from SUSE)  
and in openSUSE Leap we do not use systemd-resolved  
and I have no personal experience with systemd-resolved  
so that I cannot provide informed help in this area.

I guess an alternative (untested) workaround could be  
to provide an `/etc/hosts` entry for your NFS server name  
e.g. via something like

    NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( "echo 'NFS.server.IP.address fs1.somedomain.com' >>/etc/hosts" )

or via

    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT="echo 'NFS.server.IP.address fs1.somedomain.com' >>/etc/hosts"

(see default.conf for PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT).  
This changes only the `/etc/hosts` file in the ReaR recovery system.  
Your actual system gets its `/etc/hosts` file restored from your backup.

@OliverO2  
this is an issue about ReaR and systemd-resolved in Ubuntu.

As far as I know you use ReaR on Ubuntu  
and according to your code in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/095\_exclude\_non\_essential\_files.sh\#L10](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/095_exclude_non_essential_files.sh#L10)

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( /lib/systemd/systemd-{cryptsetup,logind,networkd*,resolved} )

it seems you may have even used ReaR on Ubuntu with systemd-resolved  
(because you excluded systemd-resolved in case of OPALPBA).

My question is now if you could provide us information  
if and how ReaR works on Ubuntu with systemd-resolved?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660803?v=4" width="50">[OliverO2](https://github.com/OliverO2) commented at [2019-01-15 10:51](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2015#issuecomment-454349979):

It is true, I am using Ubuntu, 16.04, 18.04 and 18.10. Unfortunately, I
have not yet tested the 18.x versions with ReaR yet. But this is
scheduled to change soon (in a matter of weeks).

What I can say is that Ubuntu 16.04.x DNS clients actually run
systemd-resolved.service (with `/etc/resolv.conf` being a symlink to
`../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf`). However, that does not mean
systemd-resolved is actually used for DNS lookups (see below). On 16.04,
everything always worked out of the box on the original system, on the
rescue system and on ReaR-recovered systems. At some point (not
ReaR-related) I had issues with unwanted DNS client caching, which I was
unable to resolve, because I found the DNS client documentation on
Ubuntu really lacking. I did not invest enough time to find out which
DNS client service is actually used on 16.04.

Now this issue is about 18.04, and from what I've found in [this
article](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-set-dns-nameservers-in-ubuntu-server-18-04/)
everything changes with that version. The old configuration files are
still around (huh!) but the relevant stuff seems to sit in
`/etc/netplan`. Maybe that helps. If not, I might have more information
in the weeks to come.

@OliverO2 thanks for pointing out this fundamental change. I guess
somebody will have to provide or sponsor some coding to support Ubuntu
18.04 properly.

Offhandedly (without any look at the DNS related code in ReaR):

I think we do not need to replicate in the ReaR recovery system  
whatever complicated DNS setup there is on the original system.

I think in the ReaR recovery system a plain traditional  
`/etc/resolv.conf` file with real content should be sufficient.

As far as I see (at least on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system)  
the `/etc/resolv.conf` in the ReaR recovery system is an exact  
copy of the `/etc/resolv.conf` on the original system:

    # md5sum /tmp/rear.NqjFe7FOfLJuJ6O/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf
    105142156fd4d6b0d755c2c6aa6de6c0  /tmp/rear.NqjFe7FOfLJuJ6O/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf

    # md5sum /etc/resolv.conf
    105142156fd4d6b0d755c2c6aa6de6c0  /etc/resolv.conf

Because I like it so much when the user has the final power  
where he can specify all what ReaR should do if needed  
I suggest to provide a config variable where the user can  
specify the nameserver(s) that should be used within the  
ReaR recovery system like

    USE_RESOLV_CONF=( "search my.domain" "nameserver 192.168.100.53" "nameserver 8.8.8.8" )

and then it results /etc/resolv.conf in the recovery system  
with the specified content

    search my.domain
    nameserver 192.168.100.53
    nameserver 8.8.8.8

@nniehoff  
you wrote that your workaround is:  
`after booting into recovery media set DNS servers by hand`

How exactly did you do it?  
Was it sufficient to manually enter a DNS server into  
the /etc/resolv.conf file in the running recovery system  
or did you do something more and/or something different?

Yes, adding a nameserver to /etc/resolv.conf in the recovery system
worked.

Interestingly that Ubuntu way of DNS setup  
had hit us already several times in the past, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/520](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/520)

I guess I can further enhance
build/GNU/Linux/630\_verify\_resolv\_conf\_file.sh  
to make ReaR behave more clearly for the user on Ubuntu  
(note that I carefully avoided to write about a "fix for Ubuntu" ;-)  
...

I believe a resolv.conf file is available (albeit via a symlink). Would
it not be enough to detect this and make sure we copy the real file (and
not just the symlink). I believe we already have such code in place?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2019-01-16 15:52](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2015#issuecomment-454829795):

@gdha  
it is not sufficient to copy the content of the the real file because it
seems  
on Ubuntu 18.x versions /etc/resol.conf is linked to
/lib/systemd/resolv.conf  
where its actual content is only the following single line

    nameserver 127.0.0.53

as far as I understand your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2015\#issuecomment-454082087](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2015#issuecomment-454082087)

But a loopback IP address for the DNS nameserver cannot work within  
the recovery system because there is no DNS server listening at
127.0.0.53  
because systemd-resolved is not running within the recovery system.

Accordingly I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2018](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2018)  
which works fine for me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system  
but testing on Ubuntu systems is needed.

I would very much appreciate it if you could test on your Ubuntu

No news is good news so that I merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2018](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2018)

By default /etc/resolv.conf in the recovery system is a copy  
of /etc/resolv.conf (or its symlink target) on the original system.  
It cannot work when /etc/resolv.conf contains only loopback IP
addresses  
(which happens when the stub resolver systemd-resolved is used)  
or when there is no nameserver entry so that "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
errors out in this case with an error message like

    No nameserver or only loopback addresses in
    /tmp/rear.8OotHqKXNrolR0K/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf,
    specify a real nameserver via USE_RESOLV_CONF

For non-default cases the user must specify what he wants via the  
new USE\_RESOLV\_CONF variable that is described in default.conf.

Adding support in ReaR when systemd-resolved is used needs  
code contribution from ReaR users who use systemd-resolved.

Not necessarily. ;)

I'll test it anyway on Ubuntu 18.04 once I'll be using ReaR on that
version. As I've said, in a matter of weeks. If any issues come up, I'll
report, of course.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2076](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2076)
merged  
build/GNU/Linux/630\_verify\_resolv\_conf\_file.sh does no longer error
out  
when etc/resolv.conf has no nameserver or only loopback addresses  
and USE\_DHCLIENT is true (and USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING is not true)  
because then etc/resolv.conf in the recovery system is generated anew  
by /bin/dhclient-script so that its content before does not matter.

This way it should in particular no longer falsely error out on
systems  
that use systemd-resolved (like Ubuntu 18.04) and do their networking  
setup via DHCP (probably pretty standard on usual desktop systems),
