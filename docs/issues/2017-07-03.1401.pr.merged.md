First step:  
Let the help workflow output to the original STDOUT

@gdha  
restore/NSR/default/400\_restore\_with\_nsr.sh  
is initially from you and it contains 'echo' commands  
where I do not fully understand how they are meant  
so that I like to get feedback from you if my fix in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1401/commits/3aaf8d4595aaa48b89122c0b03fa5a6d8b210555](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1401/commits/3aaf8d4595aaa48b89122c0b03fa5a6d8b210555)  
is right.

@gdha  
in restore/NSR/default/400\_restore\_with\_nsr.sh  
I do not understand how the following code is meant to work:

<pre>
BLANK=" "
...
    echo -ne "\r${BLANK:1-COLUMNS}\r"
</pre>

BLANK contains only one single space character  
and on a 80 characters wide terminal  
1-COLUMNS evaluates to -79 so that  
${BLANK:1-COLUMNS}  
should be the last 79 characters in BLANK  
which cannot work according to what I tested:

<pre>
BLANK="x"

# echo $COLUMNS
80

# set -x

# echo "${BLANK:1-COLUMNS}" | od -a
+ echo ''
+ od -a
0000000  nl
0000001
</pre>

From my point of view the whole reformatting of  
the 'recover' command output is oversophisticated  
and should be dropped to keep ReaR simple and  
straightforward like

<pre>
# Use the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR when 'rear' was launched by the user for the NSR 'recover' command:
recover -s $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server) -c $(hostname) -d $TARGET_FS_ROOT -a $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_paths) 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

I use explicitly also the original STDIN to be future-proof  
and prepared if the 'recover' command does a user dialog.

Or is there a undocumented special reason behind  
why the 'recover' command output must be reformatted?

I mean:  
Why would ReaR need to reformat the 'recover' command output  
compared to when the user calls 'recover' manually in a terminal?

Or in other words:  
If the 'recover' command output looks bad, it is an issue  
in that command and not something that ReaR should  
try to "fix".

Furthermore:  
There is no error checking of the 'recover' command.  
Is it perhaps broken so that it returns zero exit code in any case?  
If not the code in ReaR should be simple straightforward  
and fail-safe like:

<pre>
# Use the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR when 'rear' was launched by the user for the NSR 'recover' command:
if ! recover -s $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server) -c $(hostname) -d $TARGET_FS_ROOT -a $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_paths) 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8 ; then
    Error "NSR 'recover' command failed"
fi
</pre>

@jsmeix It is 4 years ago I entered the code, so it is hard to remember
why that piece of code was written as that. That being said I have no
means to test the code, so whatever we change it could break the current
code.

@gozora  
regarding your restore/BORG/default/300\_load\_archives.sh

Could you have a look at my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1401/commits/5398f290452134c4f6a65669377fa5896f475d78](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1401/commits/5398f290452134c4f6a65669377fa5896f475d78)  
whether or not it looks o.k. for you how I have adapted it  
so that it should work when STDOUT is redirected.

I think it could be much more simplified if the  
UserInput function was fully used but for now  
I preferred to do only minimal adaptions to make it work.

By the way I also replaced "while(true)" with "while true"  
to avoid a useless subshell.

I think I found and fixed (hopefully) almost all places  
where 'echo' was used to output on STDOUT.

I would like to merge it now - unless there are  
immediate objections.

Of course I will fix issues and remaining things  
with output when STDOUT is redirected.
