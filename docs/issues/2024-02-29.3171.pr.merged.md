##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149)

-   How was this pull request tested? `rear dump` and then rescue on
    x86\_64 Fedora Rawhide and RHEL 9.4

-   Description of the changes in this pull request - Notable changes:

    1.  Search for `rhel` when detecting RHEL  
          
        The `redhat` substring is present only in auxiliary variables
        and URLs in `/etc/os-release` both on Fedora and RHEL.
        Therefore, the `grep` worked only by accident on RHEL and was
        broken on Fedora because it wrongly classified Fedora as RHEL
        because its `BUG_REPORT_URL` refers to Red Hat's Bugzilla.  
          
        On the other hand, `rhel` is the actual `ID` of RHEL and this
        string is  
        not present in Fedora's `/etc/os-release` at all.

    2.  Always source a script in `SourceStage` at most once  
          
        `sort -u` makes sure that each relevant script is listed and
        sourced  
        only and that duplicates get discarded.  
          
        Otherwise, some scripts could have been executed repeatedly (see
        the last  
        linked comment). Especially, when `OS_VENDOR` and
        `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` have the  
        same value which is the case at least on Fedora.

Thank you for the analysis, @jsmeix! I've pushed changes that rename
`Arch` to `Arch_Linux` and completely remove `RedHatEnterpriseServer`. I
still have to test these changes on an actual RHEL machine so I'll let
you know ASAP if the recovery is still ok.

Good news is that the changes recovered the machine successfully.
However, I've just remembered that ReaR uses `OS_VENDOR` for the name of
the recreated EFI boot entry so we will not get `Fedora` for all
Fedora-like distributions.

@pcahyna What do you think?

Hi  
Clould this OS detection fix also solve the root problem for \#3170 ?  
Which is in my opinion also related to OS detection.

Hey @rvdkraan! Unfortunately, this PR will not fix your issues because
both the `OS_VENDOR` and `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` variables from your report
were already correct.

Some further thoughts regarding the  
get\_var\_from\_file() function:

Because at least at first glance it looks rather confusing  
what $0 $1 $2 actually is when looking at the  
get\_var\_from\_file() function code, better tell in a comment  
how get\_var\_from\_file() needs to be called,  
e.g. like

    # get_var_from_file file_name variable_name

I think it would be good to BugError()  
when $file\_name is no readable file  
and/or when $variable\_name is empty.

Perhaps it is somehow possible to let  
get\_var\_from\_file() provide a useful exit code.  
Currently it always results exit code 0 because  
`echo something` is (basically) always successful:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0"; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2"; }

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    opensuse-leap
    OK

    # get_var_from_file qqq ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory

    OK

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release QQQ && echo OK || echo FAIL

    OK

    # cat my-invalid-assignments
    if then
    VAR="value"

    # get_var_from_file my-invalid-assignments VAR && echo OK || echo FAIL
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: `if then'

    OK

Therefore I suggest a better implementation  
of the actual get\_var\_from\_file() code body:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" && echo "${!1}" || false' "$1" "$2" ; }

    # get_var_from_file my-invalid-assignments VAR && echo OK || echo FAIL
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: `if then'
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release QQQ && echo OK || echo FAIL

    OK

    # get_var_from_file qqq ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    opensuse-leap
    OK

An offhanded proposal how to let get\_var\_from\_file()  
return non-zero exit code when $variable\_name is not assigned:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" || false ; test -v "$1" && echo "${!1}" || false' "$1" "$2" ; }

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    opensuse-leap
    OK

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release QQQ && echo OK || echo FAIL
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file qqq ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file my-invalid-assignments VAR && echo OK || echo FAIL
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: `if then'
    FAIL

@jsmeix Not at all, both yours and @pcahyna's suggestions are very
constructive!

@jsmeix A bit shorter approach is to use the `-u` shell option. Also,
`source "$0" || false ; ...` will not halt the execution immediately in
your second implementation.

This should return `0` if the sourcing succeeded and the given variable
is set. Otherwise, it returns `1` (the final `|| return 1` is necessary
because bash returns `127` on unbound variables).

    $ function get() { bash -c 'source "$0" || exit 1; set -u; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 }
    $ get /etc/os-release ID; echo $?
    fedora
    0
    $ get /etc/osrelease ID; echo $?
    /etc/osrelease: line 1: /etc/osrelease: No such file or directory
    1
    $ get /etc/os-release IDD; echo $?
    /etc/os-release: line 1: !1: unbound variable
    1

On the other hand, if it would be ok to fail on any problems in the
sourced file as well, `bash -euc ...` may be enough.

I like `bash -euc` very much because it is simple  
and it makes useful use of the "bash in between"  
which was up to now more a workaround for `source`  
that has a problem with `readonly` variables,  
cf. our "late but helpful party guest" ;-) comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#discussion\_r1521750947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#discussion_r1521750947)

So I played around with `bash -euc` and  
this seems to behave best at least for my tests:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -eu -c 'source "$0" && echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

FYI: Intentionally I separated `-eu` form `-c` to make it  
more clear that there is different meaning of arguments  
and I used `source ... && echo` to make it more clear  
that successful `source` is a condition for `echo`  
(instead of having this condition as an implicit result of `-e`).

During my tests how it behaves in error cases  
I was thinking about that it could be helpful for debugging  
when also within the bash inside that function  
ReaR's outer DEBUGSCRIPTS setting would be supported,  
so I enhanced it further to

    # function get_var_from_file() { test "$DEBUGSCRIPTS" && local debug="-x" ; bash $debug -eu -c 'source "$0" && echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

That seems to behave well at least for me on command line

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file qqq VAR && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2  )" ; declare -p myvar

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-shell-assignments QQQ && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2  )" ; declare -p myvar
    + source my-shell-assignments
    ++ VAR=value
    ++ STRING='lvalue = rvalue'
    ++ ARR=('first element = 1' 'second element = 2' 'last element = 3')
    my-shell-assignments: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1
    declare -- myvar=""

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-shell-assignments VAR && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2  )" ; declare -p myvar

    ++ VAR=value

    ++ ARR=('first element = 1' 'second element = 2' 'last element = 3')
    + echo value
    OK
    declare -- myvar="value"

The last two examples (i.e. when 'source' succeeds with
DEBUGSCRIPTS=1)  
show that the whole sourced file gets output via 'set -x'  
which might be unwanted e.g. when that file is huge and  
which might expose (sensitive) variable values in ReaR's log file  
(where stderr is redirected within ReaR's runtime environment).

So we must also test it within ReaR's runtime environment.

Perhaps it is best to "Keep It Simple and Secure"  
and omit such transitive DEBUGSCRIPTS setting?

For completeness:  
Tests with added EMPTY and BLANK variables and  
with STRING (correct) and ARR (wrong) results  
(with `DEBUGSCRIPTS=1`):

    # cat my-shell-assignments 
    VAR="value"
    EMPTY=
    BLANK=' '
    STRING="lvalue \
    = \
    rvalue"
    ARR=( 'first element = 1'
          'second element = 2'
          'last element = 3' )

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-shell-assignments EMPTY && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2  )" ; declare -p myvar
    + source my-shell-assignments
    ++ VAR=value
    ++ EMPTY=
    ++ BLANK=' '
    ++ STRING='lvalue = rvalue'
    ++ ARR=('first element = 1' 'second element = 2' 'last element = 3')
    + echo ''
    OK
    declare -- myvar=""

I think so, I would not bother with it.

More important question is whether it is ok to fail on any problems in
the sourced file as well. I think that the sourced file may use variable
assignments that are not intended to work correctly with `set -eu`. For
example FOO="$BAR" where BAR is unset. For this reason I think I would
prefer to add `set -u` or `set -eu` after the `source` instead of having
-eu as flags on the `bash` invocation.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2015507343](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2015507343)

I do fully agree.

Meanwhile  
(after I had some "deep thought" about it over the weekend)  
I consider hardcoded "transitive DEBUG options setting"  
a horrible idea regarding security and privacy.

Not only in this specific case but in general:  
I.e. when ReaR scripts run with 'set -x'  
it does not mean that programs which are called by ReaR  
also run with whatever program-specific debug settings.

Reasoning  
with this specific case as an example:

For example (as far as I know) some networking config files  
could contain confidential data (like WLAN passwords)  
so when ReaR needs some other value from such a file  
the whole file (except bash comments)  
would appear in the log (in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode)  
so the confidential values would leak out =&gt; security issue.

Furthermore when whole user config files (except bash comments)  
appear in the log (in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode)  
ReaR would cross a privacy boundary:  
From what belongs to ReaR (e.g. the value that ReaR needs  
from a user config file) to what belongs only to the user  
i.e. his whole config file with all his values =&gt; privacy issue.

If at all "transitive DEBUG options setting" might be enabled  
only on explicit user request via '--expose-secrets'.

But in this specific case "transitive DEBUGSCRIPTS setting"  
is not needed in practice because also without 'set -x'  
the stderr messages tell sufficiently what the problem is  
so that the user can inspect his config file on his own  
what the actual reason inside his config file is.  
Also when a user reports an issue to us  
we can show him by the stderr messages what the problem is  
but we neither need to know all his config values  
nor should we know all his config values  
to help him sufficiently.

The current implementation

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0"; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

does not yet work correctly  
when there is stdout output of the sourced file

    # cat my-assignment 
    if echo HELLO ; then
      VAR="value"
    fi

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2 ; declare -p myvar
    OK
    declare -- myvar="HELLO
    value"

    # unset VAR ; source my-assignment && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2 ; declare -p VAR
    HELLO
    OK
    declare -- VAR="value"

This one fixes it for me:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" 1>/dev/null ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2 ; declare -p myvar
    OK
    declare -- myvar="value"

The fix here (by added `1>/dev/null` to the 'source' call)  
is only meant as an offhanded proposal to fix  
when there is stdout output of the sourced file.

It is not meant as a proposal how to deal with errors  
(via `set -e` or `set -eu` or `... || exit 1` or ...).

A 'nit' reply only for the fun of it:  
I prefer `1>` over `>` because I prefer explicit code.  
In particular explicit `1>` would make it easier  
in theory to search the code where stdout is redirected.  
In practice this does not work because also `>` is used  
so in the end it does not matter if `1>` or `>` is used  
and I am fine with both.

@jsmeix I happen to disagree here because everyone knows `> /dev/null`
and is used to it, so if I see `1> /dev/null`, I have to think about
what is the `1` doing there, while `> /dev/null` is immediately obvious.
Related: `> /dev/null` is more visually recognizable from let's say
`7> /dev/null`, and we use numbered redirections often in ReaR.

Sigh - endless problems - here the next one:

We cannot fail when 'source' fails because  
'source' returns the status of the last command  
executed in the sourced file so

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null || exit 1 ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

(emphasis mine).

So, why to worry about the exit status from `source` if the only allowed
statements are variable assignment statements? (`ls` in your example is
thus not allowed.) I consider this a non-issue.

@pcahyna  
in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#discussion\_r1521750947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#discussion_r1521750947)  
you wrote that  
"the get\_var\_from\_file function is meant to be generic"  
which was the reason that I suggested in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#discussion\_r1523283636](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#discussion_r1523283636)  
that "it fits perhaps better in lib/global-functions.sh"

When we have a generic get\_var\_from\_file function  
then it must work reasonably well for any file  
that can be sourced, in particular for a bash script.

Otherwise when we only want a function to get values  
from os-release then we must not have such a function  
as a generic function lib/global-functions.sh  
but preferably as it was before only a "local" function  
called explicitly get\_var\_from\_os\_release to make it clear  
that this function cannot be used generically  
to get a value from any file that can be sourced.

But why not have a generic get\_var\_from\_file function  
when it seems it can be implemented reasonably well,  
for example as I proposed in my last  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2019541083](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2019541083)

Or is there something severely wrong with my recent proposal?

I mean: It is certainly possible to make a bash script  
where my recent get\_var\_from\_file function fails  
but in "sufficiently normal" cases it seems to work OK

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

    # cat my-assignment 
    echo HELLO && VAR="$( echo -n "Today is $( date )" )"
    ls QQQ && VAR="qqq"
    if then

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" && echo OK || echo FAIL with $? ; declare -p myvar ; date
    ls: cannot access 'QQQ': No such file or directory
    my-assignment: line 3: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-assignment: line 3: `if then'
    OK
    declare -- myvar="Today is Tue 26 Mar 2024 03:06:09 PM CET"
    Tue 26 Mar 2024 03:06:09 PM CET

For the fun of it:  
I even found a simple bash script where  
my recent get\_var\_from\_file function fails,  
something like:

    poweroff
    sleep 120
    VAR="value"

;-)

Depends on how "generic" we want it to have. We can define it as being
generic enough to be able to read files that have the same format as
os-release, i.e. variable assignments but no other shell commands. I
believe that files under `/etc/sysconfig` fall in this category.

> Or is there something severely wrong with my recent proposal?

My only problem with it is that we lose the ability to detect errors
when sourcing the file (including file not found or readable), compared
to the `source ... || exit 1` version.

It also fails for file not found or not readable

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file qqq VAR )" && echo OK || echo FAIL with $? ; declare -p myvar
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory
    qqq: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1
    declare -- myvar=""

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file /etc/shadow VAR )" && echo OK || echo FAIL with $? ; declare -p myvar
    /etc/shadow: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
    /etc/shadow: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1
    declare -- myvar=""

but it always fails at 'set -u' because of "unbound variable".

As far as I see it is not possible to  
fail at 'source' for file not found or not readable  
but not fail at 'source' when the last command in file  
results non-zero exit code which is usually '1'

    $ source /etc/shadow || echo $?
    bash: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
    1

    $ source qqq || echo $?
    bash: qqq: No such file or directory
    1

    $ cat my-script
    grep qqq /etc/fstab

    $ source my-script || echo $?
    1

so we would have to add special checks  
for cases like file not found or not readable.

I think such specific checks are not needed  
because stderr shows the root cause why it failed  
regardless that actually it failed at 'set -u'.

Bottom line of what I mean is:

As far as I see

    function get_var_from_file() {
        bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1
    }

provides simple "all or nothing" return code behaviour:

Zero return code means the variable was set in the file and  
stdout is the value of the variable (could be empty or blank).

Non-zero return code in all other cases.

So get\_var\_from\_file can be used in a simple way like

    if my_var="$( get_var_from_file FILE_NAME VAR_NAME )" ; then
        # Code when VAR_NAME was set in FILE_NAME:
        ...
    else
        # Code when the value of VAR_NAME is unknown
        # (e.g. error handling code or fallback code):
        ...
    fi

For the fun of craziness:

My above described simple "all or nothing" return code behaviour  
does not hold in any case, in particular not for shell variables:

    # cat my-assignment
    VAR="value"
    BASH="my bash"
    BASHPID=99999999

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="my bash"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASHPID )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="6854"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH_COMMAND )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="echo \"\${!1}\""

but BASHPID cannot be set in my-assignment because it is readonly  
and BASH\_COMMAND was not set in my-assignment.

So for the fun of craziness I further enhanced it:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'unset $1 || exit 1 ; source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

This seems to even behave correctly - as far as I tested:

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="value"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="my bash"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASHPID )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    my-assignment: line 0: unset: BASHPID: cannot unset: readonly variable
    FAIL with 1

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH_COMMAND )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    my-assignment: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1

The idea behind to ensure the above described  
simple "all or nothing" return code behaviour  
is:

When VAR\_NAME cannot be unset before 'source FILE\_NAME'  
then VAR\_NAME cannot be (successfully) set in FILE\_NAME  
so get\_var\_from\_file must return non-zero return code.

@pcahyna @lzaoral  
when you agree that having a generic function

    function get_var_from_file() {
        bash -c 'unset $1 || exit 1 ; source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1
    }

is useful in ReaR - in particular when you think  
the above implementation is reasonably correct,  
would it then help you with this pull request here  
when I make a pull request to add that function  
to lib/global-functions.sh so that this part  
can be excluded from this pull request?

And in case of issues with that function  
I am to "git blame" for it ;-)

@lzaoral  
in usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh  
in the

        # set OS_MASTER_VENDOR in case this is a derived OS and ReaR differentiates it
        case "${OS_VENDOR,,}" in
    ...
        esac

section  
could you keep a simplified version of the comment

    # When OS_VENDOR_VERSION contains 'SUSE', set OS_MASTER_VENDOR to 'SUSE'
    # but do not set OS_MASTER_VENDOR same as OS_VENDOR (i.e. 'SUSE_LINUX')
    # (cf. above: all SUSE distributions ... must be unified to 'SUSE_LINUX')
    # because then scripts in a .../SUSE_LINUX/... sub-directoriy and conf/SUSE_LINUX.conf
    # get sourced twice by the (buggy) SourceStage function in lib/framework-functions.sh

that tells why it is crucial to  
not set OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR same as OS\_VENDOR?

I needed some second and third looks to understand that  
OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR same as OS\_VENDOR is carefully avoided  
in the current code but that is neither obvious  
nor explicitly visible in the code.

For example you may add something like

        # Set OS_MASTER_VENDOR in case this is a derived OS and ReaR differentiates it.
        # Do not set OS_MASTER_VENDOR same as OS_VENDOR
        # e.g. OS_MASTER_VENDOR = OS_VENDOR = Some_Vendor
        # because then scripts in .../Some_Vendor/... sub-directories
        # and conf/Some_Vendor.conf get sourced twice by the (buggy)
        # SourceStage function in lib/framework-functions.sh
        # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241
        case "${OS_VENDOR,,}" in
        ...
            OS_MASTER_VENDOR=...
        ...
        esac

Or - perhaps even better - BugError when both are same like

        # set OS_MASTER_VENDOR in case this is a derived OS and ReaR differentiates it
        case "${OS_VENDOR,,}" in
        ...
            OS_MASTER_VENDOR=...
        ...
        esac
        # OS_MASTER_VENDOR must not be same as OS_VENDOR
        # e.g. OS_MASTER_VENDOR = OS_VENDOR = Some_Vendor
        # because then scripts in .../Some_Vendor/... sub-directories
        # and conf/Some_Vendor.conf get sourced twice by the (buggy)
        # SourceStage function in lib/framework-functions.sh
        # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241#issuecomment-295292372
        test "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR" != "$OS_VENDOR" || BugError "OS_MASTER_VENDOR must not be same as OS_VENDOR '$OS_VENDOR'"

To follow up, in 1ed656d6ab631ef606f967d460c9643c28d21f61 I fixed the

broken, behaviour on those distros:

Here we have even more broken variables so that I think that fixing the

@schlomo  
see my quick first analysis starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1934386437](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1934386437)

Some results from my offhanded tests:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1934402243](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1934402243)  
excerpts

    Where those variables are used in ReaR scripts:

    ...

    So it seems (according to that quick and dirty test)
    those variables are not actually used in ReaR scripts

    OS_MASTER_VENDOR_ARCH
    OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION
    OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH
    OS_VENDOR_ARCH
    OS_VENDOR_VERSION
    OS_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH
    VERSION_ID

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1934474211](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1934474211)  
excerpts

    What directories we have where the value of such variables
    is used as directory name (also a quick and dirty test):

    ...

    So it seems only those values are actually used
    as directory names:

    Debian
    Fedora
    IPL
    Linux-arm
    Linux-i386
    Linux-ia64
    Linux-ppc64
    Linux-ppc64le
    Linux-s390
    SUSE_LINUX
    Ubuntu
    i386
    ppc64
    ppc64le
    s390

And some other tests later  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1972731026](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1972731026)  
excerpts

    What OS_VENDOR value dependant scripts we have

    ...

    So we neither have scripts for 'Arch'
    nor for 'RedHatEnterpriseServer'.

And finally my personal opinion  
as a result of my above tests:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1972786350](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1972786350)  
excerpt

    What I think what is needed and what works in practice
    (in particular what is maintainable in practice) is
    only two semantically different/separated variables:

        one for the Linux distribution
        one for the hardware architecture

    Nothing more - in particular no versions.

    Why no versions
    Testing for version values is almost always plain wrong
    because testing for version values is almost always
    not testing "the real thing" so a version value test
    could too easily have a wrong result.
    E.g. assume in version 1 there is /etc/old
    which is replaced since version 2 by /etc/new
    then /etc/old versus /etc/new should be directly tested
    instead of an indirect test of the version that has
    a wrong result when e.g. /etc/old is still used
    regardless that version 2 is already there.

    ...

    I would mercilessly simplify and clean up that part in ReaR
    to have only two variables left

        DISTRIBUTION
        ARCHITECTURE

    which matches what we actually have as scripts
    for 'Debian' 'Fedora' and 'SUSE_LINUX'
    (nothing version dependant there),
    ...
    This is known to be sufficient and works
    in practice since many years.

To avoid possible misunderstanding of my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2110203576](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2110203576)

I did not mean we should do such a  
"merciless simplification and clean up"  
right now.

I meant that we should not spend more time  
than really needed right now for current real issues  
with all that variables, cf. my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1968483977](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1968483977)  
excerpt

    it is perfectly OK for me when you do only minimal changes
    to make things work again for Red Hat and Fedora and
    leave the "great cleanup work" to others...

and my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1973347166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1973347166)  
excerpt

    (as a totally separated subsequent major step)
    I will have a look
    if I could do such a "great cleanup work"
    (i.e. simplify it to only DISTRIBUTION and ARCHITECTURE)
    with reasonable effort
    (provided time permits and provided I have nothing better to do).

Bottom line:  
I would like to keep this pull request limited  
to what it was originally meant to fix:  
Some specific bug with that variables  
for Red Hat and Fedora.

I think it is not the task of @lzaoral  
to do some major generic work in ReaR.  
Of course if he likes to contribute that  
then I would very much appreciate it.  
What I mean is that we should not ask contributors  
who like to contribute just one specific thing  
to do major generic work "by the way".

Or in other words:  
Keep Separated Issues Separated "KSIS" ;-)

@lzaoral  
because this pull request is meant for ReaR 3.0  
I would like to know how far things meanwhile work  
for you with current Red Hat and Fedora versions  
with what is already merged in current master code  
(e.g.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3331))
?

In other words:  
Is more needed to make ReaR 3.0 work  
with current Red Hat and Fedora versions  
or is the current master code already "good enough"  
(likely not really good but perhaps OK for now)?

Simply put:  
Is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149)  
good enough fixed for now in current master code?

Hey @jsmeix!  
The current state is definitely better than it was in January but two
major issues raised in

are still not resolved. The current state is:

    unmerged fix in \#3171
    -   Minor issue from RH/Fedora point since it is only related to
        SUSE on IBM mainframes.

Of course, I have no abjections against splitting this PR into multiple
smaller ones to move this effort further.

@lzaoral  
I am sorry that I could not reply earlier,  
too much other stuff filled up my brain :-(

I would much appreciate it if you could  
split this PR into separated parts  
i.e. one for each separated "Not fixed" issue in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2437219729](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2437219729)

I think this could make this issue move forward  
because smaller steps are easier to deal with.

But do not split it up into artificial parts  
where the partial changes depend on each other,  
i.e. keep together what technically belongs together.  
But you can split up one same global task into parts  
where each change implements/fixes a separated part.

Again sorry that this issue is delayed for such a long time.  
For me personally the main reason is that in this case here  
from plain looking at only the changes in this PR  
I fail to understand what the changes mean in practice.  
So in this case a proper review is rather hard for me.  
I hope separated parts make the review easier for me.

@pcahyna @lzaoral  
it is still approved "bona fide" by me (see my first comment)  
so for me personally it is fine when @pcahyna approves it  
and merges it as he likes.  
I.e. you do not need to get an additional review from me.

Sorry everyone for not replying sooner, everyone! I was really busy with
other projects. When going through @schlomo's main concerns in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#pullrequestreview-2053278291](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#pullrequestreview-2053278291),
I propose the following:

1.  Move the SUSE/s390x-related change and the rename of `Arch` to
    `Arch_Linux` (suggested by @jsmeix at the bottom of
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1972731026](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1972731026)
    to precent confusion with "Architecture") to a separate PR. These
    two changes are independent of the rest and I'll create this PR
    ASAP. edit: Created as
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3344/](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3344/).
2.  Make only a minimal change to fix detection of Fedora (and move the
    rest of this PR on-hold). The plain chain of `grep` commands used
    currently (without any actual parsing) classifies Fedora as RHEL,
    because Fedora uses RH bugzilla for bug-tracking:

<!-- -->

    $ grep -i -E '(centos|redhat|scientific|oracle)' /etc/os-release
    BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/"
    REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Fedora"
    REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=41
    REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Fedora"
    REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION=41

Amusingly, on actual RHEL the situation is somewhat similar (I've tried
7.9, 9.5 and 10 Beta), primarily URLs with the `redhat` substring get
matched:

    $ grep -i -E '(centos|redhat|scientific|oracle)' /etc/os-release
    CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9::baseos"
    HOME_URL="https://www.redhat.com/"
    DOCUMENTATION_URL="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9"
    BUG_REPORT_URL="https://issues.redhat.com/"
    REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"
    REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=9.5
    REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
    REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="9.5"

In both cases, the grepped value (`redhat`) was never present in the
`ID` (or `ID_LIKE`) fields of `/etc/os-release` so this always worked
"by accident".

This minimal patch fixes the autodetection (at least) on Fedora 40

This way, the actual logic for setting `OS_VERSION` and
`OS_MASTER_VERSION` stays unchanged.

1.  We still need to decide what to do about:

> Duplicated code execution whenever OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR and OS\_VENDOR
> have the same values

The original idea was to leave `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` empty for non-derived
systems but that was discouraged by @schlomo in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#pullrequestreview-2053278291](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#pullrequestreview-2053278291)
and I see his concerns. If nobody has objections, I'll implement the
following suggestion by @schlomo
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#pullrequestreview-2053278291](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#pullrequestreview-2053278291))
instead:

Once again my apologies for not moving this further sooner. @jsmeix
@gdha @schlomo @pcahyna Your suggestions and comments are welcome. Thank
you!

I fully support to

    Make only a minimal change to fix detection of Fedora
    (and move the rest of this PR on-hold).

@schlomo @pcahyna @jsmeix I've rebased the PR to implement the
absolutely minimal change to correctly classify Fedora as Fedora (but
the current parsing logic is still rather brittle) and to resolve
duplicated stage executions when `OS_VENDOR` and `OS_VENDOR_MASTER`
match. Thank you in advance for the review!

@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections  
I would merge it on Monday afternoon

Puh!  
So (hopefully) it is DONE now - at least for now  
what is needed to release ReaR 2.8.

@lzaoral @pcahyna  
please test (as time permits) current GitHub master code  
with this merged pull request and ideally when things work  
report what you tested successfully in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-ReaR-2.8](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-ReaR-2.8)

Thnak you for the reminder, @jsmeix! Hopefully, I'll get to the testing
next week.
