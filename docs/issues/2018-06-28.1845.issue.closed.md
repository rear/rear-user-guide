The current apply\_layout\_mappings function is not sufficiently fail
safe.

In particular things go wrong when for a target disk in
/var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings  
no associated mapping for that disk as source disk exists.  
For example when I have /dev/sda and /dev/sdb both with same size  
I get /var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings generated as

<pre>
/dev/sda /dev/sda
/dev/sdb /dev/sdb
</pre>

When I change that to

<pre>
/dev/sda /dev/sdb
#/dev/sdb /dev/sdb
</pre>

I get disklayout.conf changed into (excerpts):

<pre>
disk /dev/sdb 21474836480 msdos
disk _REAR1_ 21474836480 msdos
</pre>

Furthermore the current apply\_layout\_mappings function runs mad if  
there are lines with unexpected syntax in
/var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings  
in particular if there are empty lines.

Because in MIGRATION\_MODE /var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings is
meant  
to be manually adapted by the user ReaR should behave more fail safe
against  
possibly missing or wrong entries in
/var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings.  
Currently ReaR blindly proceeds in such cases.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843)  
the commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/ba2aefa9e3f3dc5c28f35720644bb4e694cd0a63](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/ba2aefa9e3f3dc5c28f35720644bb4e694cd0a63)  
should make the apply\_layout\_mappings function and its callers behave
more fail safe.
