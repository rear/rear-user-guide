hi,

with the actual GIT version i was able to create a SLES12 based EFI boot
iso image, but the first  
boot option (Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)) does not work, the
generated grub.cfg  
looks like:

menuentry "Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)" --class gnu-linux --class
gnu --class os {  
echo 'Loading kernel ...'  
linux /isolinux/kernel \[..\]

The "Secure Boot" option however works, difference is that this one uses
"linuxefi" instead  
of "linux":

menuentry "Relax and Recover (Secure Boot)" --class gnu-linux --class
gnu --class os {  
echo 'Loading kernel ...'  
linuxefi /isolinux/kernel \[..\]

Because it is about SLE I assing it to me regardless that  
basically I know nothing at all about (U)EFI or Secure Boot.

@gozora  
could you please have a look?

@abbbi "No Secure boot" means booting without UEFI (or via BIOS mode),
which if UEFI is turned on will fail for obvious reasons. I don't
consider this as a bug, perhaps, opinions may be different?  
@gozora what is your point of view on this question?

@gdha Ok, Thanks for clarification. Maybe the Naming should be different
(No UEFI/UEFI boot) or something, to make it more obvious.

Hello Guys,  
First of all, my knowledge of EFI secure boot (SB) is limited to theory
only. I don't have hands on experience with it :-(. I can however take
closer look on this technology and how ReaR handles it, but it will take
a day or two, as I need to get my dirty hands on some SLES12
installation DVD, coz I don't have any SLES12 installed so far in my
collection ...

@gdha  
when "No Secure boot" actually means  
"booting without UEFI (i.e. via BIOS)"  
I will prepare a pull request to get that  
currently misleading naming fixed.

@gozora  
accordingly I think this is not a SLE12-specific issue  
so that you do not need to do a special test with SLE12.  
But if you like to try our SLE12 see

I think more meaningful names for the recovery system boot  
options is only a first step.

I think the real solution would be when boot options that  
cannot work are not shown at all - but that is something  
for someone who is much more an expert in grub setup  
than I am...

Hello @ll,  
After some struggle with new features of SLES12 (God bless
`/etc/modprobe.d/10-unsupported-modules.conf` and systemd) and severe
brain damage I found out why secure boot option works (unlike no secure
boot).  
This thing is that grub2 installed on SLES12 and using secure boot, uses
module **linuxefi**, which includes commands:

-   `linuxefi` for loading kernel
-   `initrdefi` for loading initrd

but for some reason does not include **linux** module which uses `linux`
and `initrd` commands to load initrd and kernel

According this I'd recommend to modify create\_grub2\_cfg() to use
`linuxefi` and `initrdefi` only in case of secure boot. I can create
pull request for this of course, but I'm a bit tight with time these
days, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it this week...

@abbbi I was not able to reproduce your problem with **sysfs** and
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=0.  
A thing that would bring some light into this would be if you could set
shell debug options (`set -x` at the beginning and `set +x` at the end)
in file
`/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/25_populate_efibootimg.sh` run
`rear mkrescue` and send me just the debug output.  
Would that be possible from your site?

@gdha, @jsmeix  
And maybe one point that jumped out but could hit us in the back later.
Once I was booting from rear recovery media I've got kernel panic due
problem with execution of `/init`. Fortunately it was just due missing
**root=root\_disk** in grub2. I'll not open issue for this right now
because I need to take a closer look why it was not a problem until now.
It might be that I didn't used btrfs before (yes, shame on me ;-) ). But
it could be some misconfiguration on my site (would not be for first
time). Anyhow just keep this in mind if someone complaints about kernel
panic ;-)

@gozora the SYSFS seems to be fixed with the latest git version, i was
using version 1.18, i already verified with @jsmeix that it works with
the latest git checkout, no troubles here.

@gozora  
many thanks for your analysis!

I have a general question about the naming  
"UEFI boot" versus "Secure Boot":

As far as I know "UEFI boot" and "Secure Boot"  
are different things.

As far as I know UEFI is a precondition for "Secure Boot"  
but one can do "plain UEFI boot" without "Secure Boot".

Therefore I am confused with the current naming  
of the boot options of the rear recovery system.

I would expect three boot options like

<pre>
traditional boot (BIOS boot on x86 architecture)
plain UEFI boot (without Secure Boot)
Secure Boot (only on UEFI systems)
</pre>

Curently I do not understand why there are only two  
boot options of the rear recovery system.

From my current point of view it seems something is  
shomehow mixed up here so that first and foremost  
I would like to get it sorted out.

In short, my question is:

What is the fully correct naming of the  
booting options of the recovery system?

@gozora  
a question regarding your recommendation to  
"modify create\_grub2\_cfg() to use linuxefi and initrdefi  
only in case of secure boot."

I don't see how I could currently test in rear whether or not  
Secure Boot is used.

As far as I see I can currently only test in rear whether or not  
UEFI is used via the USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER variable.

Do you perhaps mean to use linuxefi and initrdefi only  
in case of UEFI boot?

Do you mean to add tests for USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
to create\_grub2\_cfg() so that only those "menuentry" blocks  
are output that match the actually used bootloader?

I have dark forebodings about 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi':

Because I cannot find them in the GRUB2 upstream sources.  
I assume 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi' is SUSE-specific stuff.

In this case anything in rear regarding 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi'  
would need to be implemented as a special case  
only for SUSE.

Or is perhaps 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi' also used in other  
Linux distributions?

@jsmeix

> I would expect three boot options like

I agree with you! However I'm not author of those entries so I can't
guess their porpose :-(. I guess that this mess comes from HANAs running
SLES11. I've saw some installations with both grub and elilo installed
and was never able to find out why ...

You can identify secure boot when `uefi_bootloader_basename=shim.efi` so
it should be enough to add if .. else in function.

> I have dark forebodings about 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi':

Yesterday as I was doing some research I've found this post for
[fedora](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2013-January/177568.html)
and this one for
[ubuntu](https://falstaff.agner.ch/2012/12/12/secure-boot-implementation-of-ubuntu-12-10-quantal-quetzal/)
both describing `linuxefi` resp `initrdefi`, but grub2 documentation is
not mentioning them. So maybe we appeared our selves in middle of war
secure boot vs no secure boot ...

to make things more interesting i just created a Debian 8 based UEFI
image with REAR (installed ebiso on the system) and the Secureboot does
not work here (kernel has invalid signature). The "No Secureboot"
however does.

So:

SLES12: (No Secureboot) fails with "can't find command linux"  
Debian: (Secureboot) fails with "invalid signature"

Yes, we appeared right in the middle of a war...

I asked the SUSE grub2 package maintainer  
and got this information:

We have to support UEFI Secure Boot
so we have to use linuxefi as it implemented
the need verification mechanism via shim-lock
protocol to loaded the grub2 image ..
Moreover it leverages the kernel UEFI handover
protcol to boot the kernel via its own efistub
and beneficial from kernel bug fixing for
firmware issues. ..

It's not upstreamed for various reasons ..
Although down-stream distros like SUSE
and RedHat already used that for a while,
upstream is still have problem accepting it ..

Please consider it a standard to boot
in UEFI Secure Boot for now, until someone
could convince upstream to include it,
there no other grub command could be used
for now in UEFI Secure Boot as Microsoft only
recongize linuxefi as a they audit the code
to issue their certifcates for shim loader ... 
</pre>

Accordingly 'linuxefi' (and 'initrdefi') is  
the current de-facto standard to boot  
in UEFI Secure Boot that is used by  
various Linux distributions like SUSE,  
Red Hat, and Debian (where the latter  
indicates that also Ubuntu uses it).

Currently ther rear recovery system offers in any case  
both methods to load kernel and initrd via

<pre>
menuentry ...
    linux /isolinux/kernel ...
    initrd /isolinux/initrd.cgz ...
</pre>

and via

<pre>
menuentry ...
    linuxefi /isolinux/kernel ...
    initrdefi /isolinux/initrd.cgz ...
</pre>

I do not like to exclude one of them because I fear  
regressions in this or that use-cases.

Perhaps sometimes only the 'linux'/'initrd' method works,  
perhaps sometimes only the 'linuxefi'/'initrdefi' method works.

I do not want to make in rear a decision which method  
works in what cases.

Therefore I will change my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/867](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/867)  
a bit so that the naming is more technically correct.

At least for now I leave it up to the user to find out  
what method actually works in his particular  
boot environment.

Later - when we know better about all the various details - then  
rear might get enhanced so that non-working recovery system  
boot menue entries are automatically suppressed.

@gozora regarding  
"SLES11 ... with both grub and elilo installed"

Curently I don't know any details about that  
but I think I vaguely remember I heard about  
some complicated reasoning behind it.

In short: This is not because SUSE likes to make  
things overcomplicated but because something  
that had needed to be solved for customers.

Fortunately on SLE12 GRUB 2 is the only bootloader  
but now we have Secure Boot to keep things complicated.

<pre>
SLES12: (No Secureboot) fails with "can't find command linux"
</pre>

it seems in case of (U)EFI on SLES12 the GRUB 2 there  
does not know about the linux command - in only  
knows the linuxefi command so that

<pre>
linux /isolinux/kernel ...
</pre>

cannot load the kernel in case of (U)EFI on SLES12, only

<pre>
linuxefi /isolinux/kernel ...
</pre>

can in case of (U)EFI on SLES12.

See also what I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/867\#issuecomment-238487352](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/867#issuecomment-238487352)

I am still confused about the meaning of the names  
for those GRUB menue entries.

For me the code looks as if it is about "(U)EFI" versus "no (U)EFI"  
but the GRUB menue names make it look for the user as if it is  
about "Secure Boot" versus "no Secure Boot".

Actually Grub2 commands naming **linux** vs **linuxefi** is quite
confusing ...  
From what I've understood so far, whether you use **linux** or
**linuxefi** depends if you want secure boot or not:

In other words:

-   linuxefi loads and check kernel signature
-   linux just loads kernel

So you can use both command while UEFI booting (depending if you want
secure boot or not), but you can use only **linux** command if using
legacy boot.

This is actually caused by "incomplete bootx64.efi" (missing Linux
module). This was a tricky bug. If you are interested I can explain it
in full detail this afternoon (once I'm off my work) ...

@gozora  
of course I am always interested in detailed explanations!

@jsmeix as now I'm home far from screams of my work, beer opened I'll
try to awake author in me and as promised describe this fix in more
detail.

I'll first summarize my assumptions that lead me through writing this
patch:  
Grub2 options (let's call them like this for this time) behave as
follows:

-   linux/initrd just loads kernel/initrd (this is our beloved simplest
    option inherited from legacy boot times)
-   linuxefi/initrdefi instead of just loading kernel/initrd, checks
    whether kernel signatures are valid or not and refuses to load
    kernel that is not signed or have wrong signature. This is our
    Secure boot.

In *25\_populate\_efibootimg.sh* we have following code on line 15:

`cp $v "${UEFI_BOOTLOADER}" $TMP_DIR/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi >&2`

so just take whatever is in **$UEFI\_BOOTLADER** and copy it to
preparation area that will be later part of ISO. (let use call this
**default BOOTX64.efi** for now). This operation is useful for ELILO as
you will learn later.

In order to successfully boot UEFI system, we need to have boot loader
(\*.efi). In case of Grub2 we can create our own using *grub(2)-mkimage*
and embed modules we need to boot (which is IMHO preferred way) or in
case of ELILO we can use one located under /boot/efi like done in
previous *cp* command. This copy approach can be utilized even for
Grub2, but can have nasty side effects in form for missing Grub2
functionality.

If we go on in *25\_populate\_efibootimg.sh*, nothing really interesting
is going on there (except your FIXMEs which I've noticed ;-) and
thinking about them) until line 69:  
**build\_bootx86\_efi** this function intends to build our own
BOOTX64.efi (which of course should overwrite default BOOTX64.efi) that
shall be used to boot ISO.

**build\_bootx86\_efi** is defined in *uefi-functions.sh*  
and we had following code in it:  
...  
`[[ ! -d /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi ]] && return`  
…  
`$gmkimage $v -O x86_64-efi -c $TMP_DIR/mnt/EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg -d /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi -o $TMP_DIR/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi ...`

as SLES12 SP1 have Grub2 modules stored in
/usr/lib/grub**2**/x86\_64-efi, grub(2)-mkimage was never allowed to
create BOOTX64.efi and we were left with default BOOTX64.efi.

I assume that abbi installed system with Secure Boot enabled, which
caused default BOOTX64.efi be build without **linux** Grub2 module
embedded (that normally includes linux and initrd options), and as
default BOOTX64.eif not overwritten with **build\_bootx86\_efi**, it
caused effect described in this issue.  
Normally Grub2 is capable to load modules from disk in case of need (you
might have been noticed all that insmods in grub.cfg), Grub2 modules are
however not part of the ISO (we rather use embedding) so I guess error
message abbi saw was something like “error: can't find command \`linux'”

What I did to correct this issue was just to remove condition:  
`[[ ! -d /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi ]] && return`  
and removed *-d /usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi* from grub(2)-mkimage as -d
option of always defaults to location where Grub2 modules are
installed.  
This allowed function **build\_bootx86\_efi** to overwrite default
BOOTX64.efi in case Grub2 is in use, as well as keep default BOOTX64.efi
in case of ELILO

So this is not about Grub2 knowing or not knowing linux/initrd options,
I'd call it just a bad coincidence aka bug ;-). Grub2 options/command
are enabled by modules and modules can be either loaded dynamically
(with insmod) or can be embedded to boot loader file (\*.efi)  
I've btw discovered that list of commands modules contain is listed in
*/usr/lib/grub(2)/x86\_64-efi)/command.lst*, might be useful in future
...

If SLES12 would use */usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi* for Grub2 module storing
(like Debian or Centos does) we'd probably never discovered this.

I hope this brought a bit of light to this issue,

@gozora  
wow!  
Many thanks for your awesome explanation.

I think such enlightening background explanations  
should be stored somewhere in the actual rear sources  
(and not only in a GitHub issue comment)  
to make it easier for others to adapt and enhance the code  
if needed at any later time when nobody remembers the  
exact reasoning behind why the current code is as it is, cf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@gdha  
what do you think about having such background information  
in the actual rear sources?

Personally I would provide it as comments directly in the scripts.  
Why not have long explanatory comments directly in the scripts?  
I think it is sufficiently easy to skip over them when coding  
and having them directly in the scripts hopefully avoids that the  
code documentation gets outdated when the code is changed.  
Perhaps very long comments could be added after the actual code  
at the bottom of the script and in the actual code have only some  
kind of references to sections in the code documentation at the end?
