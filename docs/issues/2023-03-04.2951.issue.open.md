[\#2951 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2951) `open`: Scripts in prep stage shouldn't touch ROOTFS\_DIR
==================================================================================================================

I just noticed that we have some scripts in `prep` that write to
`$ROOTFS_DIR` even though the README there clearly states not to do so.

    REAR rear-ol8u7:/src/rear/usr/share/rear # cat prep/README 

    This is the preparation part of ReaR before starting the rescue build phase.

    Please note that you should not put any scripts that reference
    $ROOTFS_DIR or $VAR_DIR/recovery into this section. Scripts for $ROOTFS_DIR
    go to rescue/ and for $VAR_DIR/recovery go to layout/ respectively

    That way we keep only the real prep stuff here in the prep section.


    REAR rear-ol8u7:/src/rear/usr/share/rear # grep -r ROOTFS_DIR prep

    prep/BORG/default/200_prep_borg.sh:mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR/usr/lib/locale"
    prep/BORG/default/200_prep_borg.sh:localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US "$ROOTFS_DIR/usr/lib/locale/en_US.UTF-8"
    prep/NETFS/default/100_check_nfs_version.sh:# in $ROOTFS_DIR
    prep/NETFS/default/100_check_nfs_version.sh:    mkdir -p $v ${ROOTFS_DIR}${src} >&2
    prep/NETFS/GNU/Linux/205_inspect_tar_capabilities.sh:# save the BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS array content to the $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf
    prep/NETFS/GNU/Linux/205_inspect_tar_capabilities.sh:echo "BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( ${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]} )" >> $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf
    prep/README:$ROOTFS_DIR or $VAR_DIR/recovery into this section. Scripts for $ROOTFS_DIR
    prep/default/005_remove_workflow_conf.sh:mkdir -p $v $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear >&2
    prep/default/005_remove_workflow_conf.sh:rm -f $v $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf >&2
    prep/default/100_init_workflow_conf.sh:cat - <<EOF >> "$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf"
    prep/default/490_store_write_protect_settings.sh:} >> "$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf"
    prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh:    cat - <<EOF >> "$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf"
    prep/DUPLICITY/default/200_find_duply_profile.sh:    echo "DUPLY_PROFILE=$DUPLY_PROFILE" >> "$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf"
    prep/DUPLICITY/default/220_define_backup_prog.sh:echo "BACKUP_PROG=$BACKUP_PROG" >> "$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf"

The reason this is now a problem is that I must run the `prep` stage
**before** the `layouts/save` stage in the `checklayout` and
`savelayout` workflows in order to implement auto-discovery of the
GALAXY11 configuration (which happens in `prep`).

As a result, in \#2937 I will have to move those scripts mentioned above
to the `rescue` stage.

@rear/contributors I won't be able to test all those BACKUP methods, can
you please have a look and try to think what could go wrong?

@schlomo

(1)  
I do not understand the reason behind what  
usr/share/rear/prep/README  
states.

I wonder what could go wrong when $ROOTFS\_DIR  
is accessed already in the prep stage?

ROOTFS\_DIR is set in sbin/rear

    BUILD_DIR="$( mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX || Error "Could not create build area '$BUILD_DIR'" )"
    ROOTFS_DIR=$BUILD_DIR/rootfs

so ROOTFS\_DIR is a local directory  
that should be always accessible.

By the way:  
I don't see `readonly ROOTFS_DIR` and `readonly BUILD_DIR`  
but I don't see why they should not be set readonly?

(2)  
I do not understand why you need to move all the above  
mentioned scripts to the resuce stage regardless that  
they are not for GALAXY11?

Why can't you do only for GALAXY11 what you need only for GALAXY11  
in the checklayout and savelayout workflows?

(3)  
I cannot actually test what those scripts do  
at least not within foreseeable time.

My goal is to be able to run the `prep` stage also for the `checklayout`
and `savelayout` stages so that the code in `prep` can influence what
happens during the layout code. Examples for this are auto-detect
configuration that is required for the layout code or ensuring that
requirements are met. The GALAXY11 example is auto-discovery of the
CommVault Galaxy 11 filesystem paths.

At the moment, adding the `prep` stage to the layout workflows would
modify the filesystem and create some stuff in `ROOTFS_DIR`. I agree
with you that this is probably a harmless side effect, however the
`usr/share/rear/prep/README` reminded me of the original intention of
the `prep` stage and the reason why it exists whatsoever.

I can't just move the GALAXY11 related stuff from `prep` to `rescue`
because my goal is to run `prep` before the layout code. I don't want to
duplicate code - like the auto-discovery of paths - but I want to fix
the root cause, which is that people added code to the wrong stage and
we didn't notice it earlier.

Yes, nobody here can test all the ReaR features. We nevertheless need to
find a way to move forward even with "bold" changes as otherwise ReaR
will get stuck in its own past.

Now I see the actual bug here:

'rear mkbackuponly' runs the 'prep' stage and  
some 'prep' scripts modify something in ROOTFS\_DIR  
but only 'mkrescue' and 'mkbackup' and 'mkopalpba'  
which call

    SourceStage "rescue"
    SourceStage "build"
    SourceStage "pack"
    SourceStage "output"

to actually make a ReaR recovery system  
should modify something in ROOTFS\_DIR.

But other workflows (i.e. except those that make a ReaR recovery
system)  
should not modify something in ROOTFS\_DIR because  
all those modifications are lost (because no ReaR recovery system  
with those modifications is made).

So the actual bug here is possible inconsistency,  
cf. the probably different but same kind of issue in

Good that the updated `prep/README` now explains this reasoning in
detail, thank you for updating it!

@rear/contributors any chance that we can move forward with this
problem? It is actually blocking me and prevents implementing proper
config check for `rear checklayout` for `GALAXY11`. The reason I'm
blocked is that I need the `prep` stage to determine the `GALAXY11`
configuration (paths primarily) which happens in
[prep/GALAXY11/default/400\_prep\_galaxy.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c5b457395570f283345875a1da14123193fd1657/usr/share/rear/prep/GALAXY11/default/400_prep_galaxy.sh)

My goal is to add the `GALAXY_*_DIRECTORY` paths to `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES`
in
[layout/save/GALAXY11/default/400\_check\_galaxy11\_configuration.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c5b457395570f283345875a1da14123193fd1657/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GALAXY11/default/400_check_galaxy11_configuration.sh)
but I cannot do this right now because `rear checklayout` doesn't run
the `prep` stage.

So I see three options here:

1.  `rear checklayout` will just run the `prep` stage, too (regardless
    of the unwanted side effects this has at the moment)
2.  I add an ugly patch for `GALAXY11` similar to this line in the
    `checklayout` workflow definition:
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c5b457395570f283345875a1da14123193fd1657/usr/share/rear/lib/checklayout-workflow.sh\#L25](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c5b457395570f283345875a1da14123193fd1657/usr/share/rear/lib/checklayout-workflow.sh#L25)
3.  We move forward and work together on making the `prep` stage truly
    "hands-off" so that it can be run without harm or side effects

I actually tried option 1) (simply run `prep` as part of `checklayout`
and it seems to be OK, but of course I can't test this for all
configuration scenarios. I'm trying this out in \#2965 and maybe that is
the easiest way to go forward?

TBH, I still feel like it was a mistake of our past to not be strict
about the `prep` stage only modifying configuration and not including it
earlier in the `checklayout` workflow. The fact that there was a
"special hack" for `NETFS` in the `checklayout` workflow only
illustrates the need for us to fix this problem.
