Hi.

I am executing a rear backup with BACKUP=NETFS using cifs  
i am having an issue if a cifs share contains spaces.

Here is my `local.conf`

    OUTPUT=ISO

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://NZ-SAP-BACKUP1/SAP\040Production\040Servers/NZ-TESTLINUX/ACTIVE/
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/usr/share/rear/conf/nz-sap-backup1.cifs"
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/hana/data/HD1/data/mnt00001/*' '/hana/log/HD1/log/mnt00001/*' '/hana/data/HD1/BACKUP/*' )

Cheers,  
Chance

Where did it fail (see rear.log)? Is it not possible to rename the share
without spaces? Looks easier to me.

@chancesy did you retry it (in debug mode) to catch the error?

I just change the mount point / share without spaces :) easier that way

I have run into the same issue, I tried to escape out of the space and I
tried to put quotes around the whole address and still no go.

I don't think just changing the location is a suitable answer because at
some stage there will be a user that will run into a situation where
they can't change the path as other systems depend on it.

If you want a robust piece of software, then things like this should be
corrected.

@jasonhurd I agree with you and in general we try to use quotes around
such variables in ReaR. I suppose therefore that the fix will be quite
easy.

`grep -r '[^"]\$BACKUP_URL' . | wc -l` in the ReaR source shows 53
matches, I would start from fixing that. If somebody needs this urgently
then please provide a PR, otherwise we will try to pick it up late (but
cannot guarantee a time).

Only as a side note for the fun of weirdness  
have a look at "Non-ASCII characters in file names" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)

In general ReaR is far away from being safe against  
whitespace characters in file and directory names  
or other names that matter for ReaR (i.e. file and directory  
names that are only in the backup do not matter for ReaR).

In general regarding non-ASCII characters  
see "Character encoding" in
