ATM the version string of a release (e.g. from EPEL) is
`Relax-and-Recovery 2.00 / Git` which is confusing to customers who
think that this is a development build from some git commit and not a
real release.

ATM the version string of a dev build contains a date/time string and
the date but not the commit hash.

I suggest to improve that so that we are more clear about the
release/dev status of a package.

I also noitced that but found no time  
to investigate what the root cause is.

@schlomo @jsmeix This will show the effective RELEASE\_DATE of an
official release date. I suppose this enough for v2.1?

Moved the milestone to v2.2 - for v2.1 we did what we needed to do and
we have no time for further corrections/modifications.
