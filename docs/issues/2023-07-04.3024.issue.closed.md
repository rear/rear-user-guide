@prontok  
I think LUKS has nothing to do with this issue here  
because the ReaR recovery system does not use LUKS.  
The ReaR recovery system is unencrypted in ReaR's initrd.

What fails here - as far as I see - is that the  
ReaR recovery system bootloader cannot load  
the ReaR recovery system kernel '/isolinux/kernel'  
because of 'unknown filesystem'.

In your log file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11965596/rear-ubuntu-server.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11965596/rear-ubuntu-server.log)  
I don't see something obviously wrong,  
in particular I don't see something obviously wrong  
while the /usr/share/rear/output/\*.sh scripts are run,  
no real errors as far as I see - I think the many  
grub-mkstandalone info messages

    grub-mkstandalone: info: cannot open '/usr/share/locale/.../LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo': No such file or directory.

can be ignored because I think
'/usr/share/locale/.../LC\_MESSAGES/grub.mo'  
are only optional localization messages.

In particular  
"Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1)"  
and  
"Using /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi as UEFI bootloader file"  
are properly autodetected.

I am not at all a sufficient expert in the ReaR recovery system  
bootloader area or the ISO generation area to be able to imagine  
what may go wrong in this specific case here.

In particular regarding Ubuntu:  
I am not a Ubuntu user (and I won't find time  
to test ReaR with Ubuntu) and we at ReaR upstream  
do not have an active maintainer who uses Ubuntu  
(it seems Canonical is not interested to support ReaR)  
so ReaR support for Ubuntu can be only as good as voluntary  
contributors who use Ubuntu contribute - which is much appreciated!

Only an offhanded guess (I am not at all a GRUB expert):  
When I read

    Print 'Configuring GRUB2 kernel /isolinux/kernel'
    Print 'Configuring GRUB2 initrd /isolinux/initrd.cgz'
    Print 'Configuring GRUB2 root device as '\''set root=cd0'\'''
    Print 'GRUB2 modules to load: ext2 fat part_gpt part_msdos'

I am wondering on what filesystem /isolinux/kernel  
and /isolinux/initrd.cgz are?  
Perhaps for GRUB2 that filesystem is  
an 'unknown filesystem' (neither ext2 nor fat)?

Good afternoon,  
I think i found the problem while recovery.  
Ubuntu has been using ext4 file system on /boot, but R&R load "ext2 fat
part\_gpt part\_msdos" modules at the time of creation an iso image. R&R
doesn't use ext4 module.  
I tried to use this environment:  
GRUB2\_MODULES\_UEFI\_LOAD=( ext4 fat part\_gpt part\_msdos ), but it
didn't work out.

By the way, R&R successfully collected the image from Debian (LUKS2,
UEFI) because Debian use "ext2 /boot"

By "googling" for 'grub ext2 module'  
I found this 10 years old info  
[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/59332/how-is-grub-able-to-read-its-config-file-on-ext3-fileystem](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/59332/how-is-grub-able-to-read-its-config-file-on-ext3-fileystem)  
which tells (excerpts)

    The grub ext2 module also understands ext3 and ext4

    Grub (0.9x) supports ext2 and ext3 but not ext4
    (unless backward-incompatible features are turned-off).
    Whereas, Grub2 (since 1.97) supports ext2, ext3 and ext4
    with the same module [ext2.mod] ...

Accordingly on my openSUSE Leap system I don't have  
a GRUB module named 'ext4' - I only have

    /usr/share/grub2/i386-pc/ext2.mod
    /usr/share/grub2/x86_64-efi/ext2.mod

and your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11965596/rear-ubuntu-server.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11965596/rear-ubuntu-server.log)  
contains

    grub-mkstandalone: info: copying `/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/ext2.mod' -> `/var/tmp/grub.5prE3u/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/ext2.mod'.
    ...
    grub-mkstandalone: info: grub-mkimage --directory '/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi' --prefix '(memdisk)/boot/grub' --output '/var/tmp/rear.qMnV9Tz7ac3UMg
    h/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi'  --dtb '' --sbat '' --format 'x86_64-efi' --compression 'auto'   --memdisk '/var/tmp/grub.70v7P0' 'ext2' 'fat' 'pa
    rt_gpt' 'part_msdos' 'memdisk' 'tar'
    ...
    grub-mkstandalone: info: reading /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/ext2.mod.

so things look good regarding ext2/3/4 support in GRUB2  
but actually things aren't good.

My blind guess is that in this case the filesystem  
(or whatever kind of "filesystem" is used in an ISO)  
where /isolinux/kernel and /isolinux/initrd.cgz are  
is not ext2 ext3 ext4 or fat but "something different"?

E.g. on my my openSUSE Leap system I have

    /usr/share/grub2/i386-pc/iso9660.mod
    /usr/share/grub2/x86_64-efi/iso9660.mod

Perhaps the GRUB module 'iso9660' is needed on ISO?  
Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/310\_create\_grub2.sh\#L39](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/310_create_grub2.sh#L39)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/300\_create\_grub2.sh\#L34](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/300_create_grub2.sh#L34)

But if the GRUB module 'iso9660' is needed on ISO  
why does it then work with BIOS?

Probably the reason why it fails with UEFI is "something else".

"GRUB2 modules to load: ext2 fat part\_gpt part\_msdos" means that these
modules are loaded by default, but other modules should be available as
well embedded in the GRUB image, and should be autoloaded as needed, so
I wonder what the problem is (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/23977a19101b6e6eaeebbe8ce013332ddf9ea517/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh\#L123](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/23977a19101b6e6eaeebbe8ce013332ddf9ea517/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh#L123)).
Can you please execute the `set` command and the `lsmod` on the GRUB
command line and show us the result? To find whether the module is
available, please execute `ls (memdisk)/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/` and also
report the result. You can also try `insmod iso9660` manually and if it
works, try to boot again.

Hello,  
Our EFI boot partition has VFAT filesystem type.  
I have a guess - Ubuntu or Linux Mint kernels have embedded support of
fat/vfat file systems and subsequently don't use fat/vfat modules for
mounting such partitions (it can be detected by lsmod command - no
modules with name fat/vfat will be shown in Ubuntu)  
And I think that rear try to use vfat module for addressing to efi
partition but can't do it due to missing that module.  
It just a guess and I can be mistaken after all.

@prontok

my current understanding is according to those excerpts from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3024\#issuecomment-1623235464](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3024#issuecomment-1623235464)

    What fails here - as far as I see - is that the
    ReaR recovery system bootloader cannot load
    the ReaR recovery system kernel '/isolinux/kernel'
    because of 'unknown filesystem'.
    ...
    Print 'Configuring GRUB2 kernel /isolinux/kernel'
    Print 'Configuring GRUB2 initrd /isolinux/initrd.cgz'

GRUB2 is used as bootloader in the recovery system and  
GRUB2 cannot load the Linux kernel '/isolinux/kernel'  
because of 'unknown filesystem'.

So talking about "modules" above means GRUB2 modules  
but not Linux kernel modules because there is  
no Linux kernel running at that point in time.

@prontok

> Our EFI boot partition has VFAT filesystem type.

In addition to what @jsmeix wrote, aren't you booting from a ReaR rescue
DVD? How is the EFI boot partition (on a hard disk) related to the
inability to read the kernel from the DVD? Or does the DVD also contain
an EFI boot partition?

@prontok thanks, I believe we can make progress thanks to this.

Everything looks good, except that your `root` is set to `cd0` and you
have two DVD drives apparently and your rescue DVD is `cd1`, not `cd0`
(note that this is not the case in Debian, thats IMO why Debian works).
Try `set root=cd1` and then `ls /isolinux` and if it succeeds, return to
the menu (ESC) and boot again.

@pcahyna I applied **set root=cd1** and after that the system has been
normal restored.  
The original system has one cdrom (cd1) device and it is not used by
default in ISO image during restore, but uses some cd0 device.  
I don't understand why there are two cdrom devices during restore
process.

I found some reason (perhaps not the root cause)  
why it fails:

In output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
there is hardcoded `grub2_set_root=cd0` in

        grub2_set_root=cd0
        create_grub2_cfg /isolinux/kernel /isolinux/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME > $efi_boot_tmp_dir/grub.cfg

The `create_grub2_cfg` function  
in lib/bootloader-functions.sh works appropriately  
to respect when `grub2_set_root` is set which means  
the config variable GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND is ignored  
(which is against "final power to the user")

    function create_grub2_cfg {
    ...
        local grub2_search_root_command="$3"
        if ! test "$grub2_search_root_command" ; then
            test "$grub2_set_root" && grub2_search_root_command="set root=$grub2_set_root"
        fi
        if ! test "$grub2_search_root_command" ; then
            test "$GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND" && grub2_search_root_command="$GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND"
        fi
        test "$grub2_search_root_command" || grub2_search_root_command="search --no-floppy --set=root --file /boot/efiboot.img"
        DebugPrint "Configuring GRUB2 root device as '$grub2_search_root_command'"

@prontok  
your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11965618/lsblk.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11965618/lsblk.zip)  
shows only one device '/dev/sr0' of lsblk TYPE 'rom'.

So during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" it would be impossible  
to autodetect that later during ReaR recovery system boot  
there are two devices of lsblk TYPE 'rom' and that the  
ReaR recovery system bootloader boots from the second one.

As far as I see I think your case is a very special case  
where the only way to boot the ReaR recovery system  
is to manually set in GRUB2 the right 'root' for GRUB2.

@prontok  
are your systems (the original and the replacement)

Then I guess that the second CDROM device was added by accident  
instead of assigning the ReaR recovery system ISO image  
to the already existing first CDROM device  
or something like that.

I am not a VirtualBox user.  
I only use QEMU/KVM virtual machines.

Because GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND is empty in default.conf  
I can improve the code of the create\_grub2\_cfg function

GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND when the user has set it.

Perhaps a GRUB2 expert could make a GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND  
which works reasonably well in practice "out there"  
to let GRUB2 automatically find its right 'root'  
regardless from what device GRUB2 is booting?

In default.conf

    # GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND="search --no-floppy --set=root --file /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi"

looks interesting.  
Perhaps we could place a special file at "the right place"  
in the ReaR recovery system so that GRUB2 could automatically  
find the right 'root' to boot the ReaR recovery system?

Ooops. In create\_grub2\_cfg‎

but this function is never called with 3 arguments AFAICT.  
`GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND` is set here:

but this is valid only for USB output and I can't find any corresponding
code for ISO.  
This explains what I wrote in \#2453 "Sometimes the search command in
GRUB2 used in UEFI ISO does not find the root device." - no `search`
command gets executed in the first place. Seems strange that there was
no search command executed at all at the time when I made that PR. Maybe
the code has changed since then?

`grub2_set_root` is set already here:

@prontok could I ask you to boot the DVD again and when it drops to the

It seems that the problem was introduced here:

previously, `search --no-floppy --file /boot/efiboot.img --set` was
introduced unconditionally after `set root=$grub2_set_root`

not).

Hello,  
Draw your attention! This problem "**GRUB2 on ISO with UEFI has 'root'
hardcoded set to 'cd0' so booting from 'cd1' fails**" only occurs when
using LUKS on the original operating system.  
Without the use of LUKS, this problem does not exist !
