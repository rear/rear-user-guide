@jsmeix

This should solve \#828 and \#696. In this pull priority is given to the
`xorrisofs` binary over the other binaries (`mkisofs` and
`genisoimage`).

Let me know what you guys think.  
Cheers.

@carragom  
I cannot comment on packaging/debian/control  
because I know nothing at all about Debian packaging  
which means packaging/debian/control is o.k. for me

Regarding usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
please add an explanatory comment there  
about the priority - i.e. that xorrisofs is used  
with highest priority (if exists), then mkisofs  
and finally genisoimage.

@gdha  
this is a change in default behaviour,  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
now xorrisofs is used with highest priority when it exists,  
before mkisofs was used with highest priority.  
Is this o.k.?

... and preferably I would like to be informed in the  
comment in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
*why* the priority is set this way, cf.

@jsmeix

I have added the required comment, check it out and let know if it's
good.

Cheers.

I tested it on my SLES12-SP2-beta5 test system.  
It works for me (both "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover")  
and my "rear mkbackup" log shows:

</pre>

If the new default does not work on whatever Linux distribution(s)  
there is the easy solution that the user must simply specify his  
actually working ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN in his /etc/rear/local.conf.

The only possible drawback with the new default  
that I recognized up to now is the ISO image size:

On my SLES12-SP2-beta5 test system I get  
with ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN="$( type -p mkisofs )"  
and ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN="$( type -p genisoimage )"  
an ISO image with about 90 M size  
but with ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN="$( type -p xorrisofs )"  
I get an ISO image with about 150 M size.

I.e. about 50% bigger ISO image size with xorrisofs.

Not that 50 M would matter much for one  
or a few ISO images for personal usage  
but in enterprise environments with hundreds or  
thosands of servers megabytes difference for each  
sum up to gigabytes overall difference, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810\#issuecomment-205783287](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810#issuecomment-205783287)

But also when ISO image size matters there is the same  
easy solution as above that the user can simply specify his  
best working ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN in his /etc/rear/local.conf.

Bottom line from my current point of view:  
I would merge it.

@gdha  
objections?

Would love to but I switched my server to BIOS, sorry.
