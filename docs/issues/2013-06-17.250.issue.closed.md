[\#250 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/250) `closed`: RPM needs to require syslinux-extlinux
=======================================================================================================

On Fedora 18, REAR freshly installed via yum fails when attempting
mkbackup:

    # rear -v mkbackup
    Relax-and-Recover 1.14 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-foo.log
    ERROR: Could not find 'isolinux.bin'. Maybe you have to set ISO_ISOLINUX_BIN [] or install the syslinux package ?
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-foo.log for details

After installing the `syslinux` and `syslinux-extlinux` packages, REAR
works normally.

I see that the latest `rear.spec` in the repository includes `syslinux`
as a dependency, but does not include `syslinux-extlinux`.

the package `syslinux-extlinux` is only required in combination of
`OUTPUT=USB` to be able to boot from an USB device. As such it is not a
basic requirement for rear itself, and for that reason we think it is
not needed to make it a dependency. Perhaps, a markdown in the
documentation would be better.

Maybe we should exit with a better error message like "Please install
XXX  
package to support YYY"? We could do these checks fairly early in the
prep  
stage.

I think that most users assume that a packaged piece of software, with
its dependencies, will provide the complete set of documented function.
For that reason, I would argue that *everything* which may be used by
REAR would be considered a package dependency. Disk space is cheap, and
(without looking deeply into the code) I expect the list of dependencies
would be manageable. In the end, it is probably simpler to go this route
than to alter error messages. And I think that broader adoption of REAR
is more likely if everything "just works" out of the box.

Of course complete choice of pieces to install would still be available
to those working from the git repository rather than using RPM.

As a follow-up, I see that this comment
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/247\#issuecomment-19613446](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/247#issuecomment-19613446))
on a similar issue makes it clear that generating a full dependency list
as I describe above will be difficult because of different package
availability on different distributions.

Still, I would argue that the dependency list should provide as much
function as (reasonably) possible.

I agree, but was overruled previously. Some like a slim system.

So what about the following compromise :

We add a subpackage called rear-everything (or whatever speaks for
itself)  
which requires rear and also everything that rear could use and that
is  
available from the default repos

That way slim system lovers would not be bothered and you could
install  
rear with all potential tools in one go.

What do you think?

@burghart How far are you willing to take the *"everything which may be
used by REAR would be considered a package dependency"* ? Should we add
every backup software supported as a dependency, knowing that the user
will only be using one ? Same for transport options, should we require
everything while only one is being used ?

For other types of software I would agree, but Relax-and-Recover is an
exception to the rule IMO. At the moment we only have the most common
tools that are required by the default configuration set as
dependencies. For e.g. Debian-style packages we could (and should) add
*suggested* software though.

BTW I am all for improving the communication to the user, but would hate
to see one script per tool though.

OK, I can see that the dependency list could could quickly slide down a
slippery slope. Can we come up with a short list which would accommodate
the majority of uses, though? E.g, would tar + ISO + USB provide 90%+
coverage?

I wouldn't mind adding syslinux-extlinux, but then we don't have a clear
rule anymore ;-)

I agree with you that tar + ISO by itself is not sufficient for most
users, but the type of media/transport they use might be very diverse.
USB would be a small minority IMO (and I am probably already biased
since I wrote a large part of the USB code ;-)) We do not have any
metrics to base a decision on.

We could look at the impact of each dependency and base a decision on
that, syslinux-extlinux and lftp are pretty self-contained and small
tools.

My statistics come from an unrepresentative sample of 3 users. All of us
use USB. :-) More significantly, though, the example in the QUICK START
GUIDE uses USB. Perhaps that's enough reason to add one requirement...

In the end, maybe more complete documentation on configuration should be
explicit about dependencies, i.e., NETFS -&gt; tar, USB -&gt;
syslinux-extlinux, ISO -&gt; mkisofs + genisoimage, etc.

I actually would draw the line at stuff that runs a service. IMHO it is
legitimate to pull in all dependencies that are just tools that do not
eat up any CPU or RAM after installation.

@schlomo That seems like a reasonable cut-off to me.

@schlomo Like redhat-lsb that pulled cups, gtk and gnome libraries and X
on RHEL5 ? cfg2html ? Bacula ? Other backup-clients ? I am not convinced
that there is any merit in installing all tools on all systems for every
user where only a few tools are needed. As a system engineer it would be
a no-go if a package pulls in everything it potentially could make use
of all at once. I would not even evaluate software that did this to my
system by default.

Dependencies (like on RPM-based distributions) were not designed for a
tool like Relax-and-Recover where dependencies depend on
usage/configuration IMO.

At the moment the RPM (on RHEL) strictly requires:

-   binutils
-   crontabs
-   ethtool
-   gzip
-   iproute
-   iputils
-   mingetty
-   mkisofs
-   parted
-   syslinux
-   tar
-   util-linux

We don't add things like:

-   bacula-mysql
-   cfg2html
-   lsscsi
-   nfsclient
-   portmap
-   redhat-lsb (for RHEL5)
-   rpcbind
-   rsync
-   sg3\_utils

although they've been commented in the SPEC file. Again, I wouldn't mind
adding lftp, rsync or syslinux-extlinux because they are small (on
disk), are likely to be needed (best guess) and have no impact on a
running server. Yet, I wouldn't be adding cfg2html, lsscsi or sg3\_utils
(or the other examples).

We also do not require grub, grub2, lilo and syslinux, just because one
of these bootloaders is being used. For the same reason IMO.

@dagwieers what do you think about providing a `rear-everything` RPM
which contains all dependencies for all optional tools (that don't run
as a service)?

And yes, I hate RH for not splitting the lsb package like Debian/Ubuntu
does.

I think that missing pre-requisites can be reported by existing (or new)
`prep/` scripts. I would avoid making the `rear.spec` file too complex

I didn't see in the docs anything related to syslinux-extlinux being
required.

Actually everything worked up to the point where I tried a test recovery
and found that it's impossible to boot from USB. I walked away and
didn't come back to REAR for over 6 months, spending some more time
today to understand where I'd gone wrong.

If syslinux-extlinux isn't going to be a dependency then could we at
least make it clear in the docs that if your OUTPUT is USB you'll need
syslinux-extlinux installed for this to work?

Hi,

you are right of course. However, I would expect that in your case
latest  
the  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/85\_make\_USB\_bootable.shscript](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/85_make_USB_bootable.shscript)  
should bail out with an error if extlinux is not found.

Can you please confirm that rear mkrescue runs through without errors
with  
OUTPUT=USB and extlinux not installed?

Regards,  
Schlomo

I've compared my version of 85\_make\_USB with that in the Master and
they're identical.

Only by installing syslinux-extlinux on the system being backed up does
the resulting USB volume have a functional boot menu.

Does "rear -s mkrescue" actually show that 85\_make\_USB script? If yes
then  
please add a set -x to this script to see why it does not try to call  
extlinux.

Re-formatted the disk and tried again. Now it bombs out.

The disk was originally created with an earlier version of rear. It
would appear that's somehow interfering with the check for extlinux.

All good on this front then.

Just the matter of the user finding out in a slightly more friendly way
that extlinux is required...

The new `usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/40_check_extlinux.sh` prep
