Sorry if my English is bad. My native is Russian.  
I have clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04.03 at VMWare Workstation 12.0.
ReaR doesn't automatically add itself to the Grub bootloader.  
I tried diffrent variants of /etc/rear/local.conf:

1.  No additional configuration
2.  GRUB\_RESCUE=
3.  GRUB\_RESCUE=y
4.  GRUB\_RESCUE=yes

After each changing of file I tried to reboot several time. No result.  
Is this a bug or I'm doing somithing wrong?

@Nemiroff84 `GRUB_RESCUE=y` should do the trick. Did you check the rear
log file for errors? You do not need to reboot to see if it worked. Just
check `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` and look for a rear entry

I'm new to Linux and beacause of this I think that it may be my mistake.
And I'll show what i do step by step.  
Installation:  
wget
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu\_14.04/all/rear\_1.17.2\_all.deb](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu_14.04/all/rear_1.17.2_all.deb)  
sudo dpkg -i rear\*.deb  
sudo apt-get -f install

Added string GRUB\_RESCUE=y to /etc/rear/local.conf . Saved and closed
filed. After I checked it whith cat command that my changes was saved.

Then I checked /boot/grub/grub.cfg and there is no rear word.  
directory /var/log/rear is empty.

Can you recommend to me something?

Did you run `/usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue`?

@Nemiroff84 Verify is the following package is available:

    # dpkg -S /usr/bin/grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
    grub-common: /usr/bin/grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

@Nemiroff84 Well, seems you hit a bug on Ubuntu - I corrected the code
and now it behaves better. See commit above for the changes if you want
it do correct the script 94\_grub2\_rescue.sh manually.
