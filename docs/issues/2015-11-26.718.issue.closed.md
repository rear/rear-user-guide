I am confused about DISKLAYOUT\_FILE versus LAYOUT\_FILE.

Both are used but it seems both mean usually  
the same "$VAR\_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf".

But sometimes it seems to mean something else  
like "$TMP\_DIR/backuplayout.conf" and others.

It is so confusing that I regard it even as a bug  
(not a bug in runtime function but a bug in programming style).

I suggest to use DISKLAYOUT\_FILE everywhere  
when "$VAR\_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf" is meant  
because its name is more descriptive (i.e. what kind of layout it is)  
and its name matches better to the file name "disklayout.conf".

The other meanings must use different variable names.

Where DISKLAYOUT\_FILE versus LAYOUT\_FILE is currently set:

<pre>
github/rear $ find * | xargs grep 'LAYOUT_FILE='
usr/sbin/rear:DISKLAYOUT_FILE="$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf"
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/15_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh:        LAYOUT_FILE="$file"
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/15_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh:        LAYOUT_FILE=$tmp_layout
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/01_prepare_files.sh:LAYOUT_FILE="$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf"
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/10_create_layout_file.sh:DISKLAYOUT_FILE=${DISKLAYOUT_FILE:-$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf}
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/10_create_layout_file.sh:LAYOUT_FILE="$DISKLAYOUT_FILE"
usr/share/rear/lib/checklayout-workflow.sh:    DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TEMP_LAYOUT
usr/share/rear/lib/mkbackuponly-workflow.sh:    DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf
usr/share/rear/lib/savelayout-workflow.sh:    #DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf # defined in default.conf now (issue #678)
</pre>

This code was original written by Jeroen - I'll assign the issue to him

@jhoekx  
I could fix it provided I do really understand the exceptional cases  
where DISKLAYOUT\_FILE / LAYOUT\_FILE is not  
set to "$VAR\_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf".

I would first change the exceptional cases  
to use a different separated variable name like

<pre>
readonly BACKUPLAYOUT_FILE="$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf"
</pre>

when this is menat to be used globally or

<pre>
local backuplayout_file="$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf"
</pre>

when this is only used in a limited scope, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

After the exceptional cases have been fixed,  
I would like to have

<pre>
readonly DISKLAYOUT_FILE="$VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf"
</pre>

in usr/sbin/rear see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/710](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/710)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/678\#issuecomment-159196316](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/678#issuecomment-159196316)

Finally I would like to change the scripts to  
use $DISKLAYOUT\_FILE everywhere.

Perhaps in the future as time permits I can clean it up on my own.
