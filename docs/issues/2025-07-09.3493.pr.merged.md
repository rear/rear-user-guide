-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

    Rescue ISO image on Ubuntu 24.04 was created via `rear mkrescue` and
    verified that `/etc/resolv.conf` was populated by `dhcpcd` during
    rescue system boot

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

    Some Linux distributions — e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 — use `dhcpcd` as the
    DHCP client. The rescue system for such distributions includes the
    `dhcpcd` binaries, but `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` is missing. As a result,
    `dhcpcd` does not populate `/etc/resolv.conf` properly, leaving it
    empty. Copying `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` to the rescue system resolves the
    issue.

    Alternatively, `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` could be created similarly to
    `/etc/dhclient.conf`, by providing a default configuration for the
    rescue system.

@rear/contributors  
could you please have a look here (as time permits).

I am not (yet) a dhcpcd user  
so currently I cannot properly review it, cf.
