By default in recovery mode, selecting a menu item that requires editing
opens vi. Is it possible to set the default (possibly in local.conf) to
something else, for example nano?

I know nano is available in the ReaR shell, but it would be nice to stay
in the recovery workflow with the desired editor.

Or of course I could try learning vi..

We had the same request in the past, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298)

For now using in user dialogs the generic choice

    Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here

is the only way to do whatever one wants.

I understand the request that in the ReaR recovery system things like

    # export EDITOR="/bin/nano"

    # rear recover

should make those user dialogs use $EDITOR instead of the  
currently hardcoded 'vi'.

Currently - and for some more weeks - I am not in the office  
so that I cannot do actual work on ReaR but as time permits  
I will have another look if I could find a sufficiently simple and  
fail safe working way how the user could specify his preferred  
editor in the ReaR recovery system.
