-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

1.  Plug in an USB-stick
2.  Format it using `rear format -- --efi /dev/sdg`
3.  Start ReaR using `/usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup`
4.  Abort due to an error:

See complete output:

-   What I have tried:

1.  tried two different USB-Sticks, fresh out-of-the box

2.

    mkdir -p /mnt/rear_test

shows

so I don't understand why the case conditional statement
"$usb\_filesystem" in line 32 of file
`/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh` doesn't
find "ext3". I inserted a "sleep 2" before the definition of
usb\_filesystem, no change

`usb_filesystem` gets assigned here:

please show the output of

hopefully we will see what is the problem from there.

I see something suspect in the log:

    2023-12-01 22:55:26.566790320 Including prep/NETFS/default/980_umount_NETFS_dir.sh
    2023-12-01 22:55:26.571158792 Unmounting '/var/tmp/rear.xDPgkw0v4eTr9Dy/outputfs'

I would expect to see outputfs mounted again, but there is just

    2023-12-01 22:57:06.984775757 Including output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh

and no log message from it.

I suspect outputfs is not mounted at this point.

Can you please rerun `rear mkrescue` with `-D` and provide the complete
output?

Well, there is no output...

Your debug log shows that you also have /etc/rear/site.conf with this
content:

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
**OUTPUT\_URL=file:///media/relax**  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}"
'/meinesachen/\*')  
EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS=(/media/disc)  
EXCLUDE\_MD=("/dev/md0" "/dev/md1" "/dev/md2" "/dev/md3" "/dev/md4")  
EXCLUDE\_VG=(lvraid)

Since OUTPUT\_URL is not set in your local.conf, this setting persists,
and since it uses `file://`, ReaR expects that the output filesystem is
already mounted there, which it is not.

There should be some detection and early exit with a meaningful error
message when such condition occurs, but when investinating the code, I
could not understand it and it seems like a mess. In particular, it does
not seem to take into account the possibility that OUTPUT\_URL can be
different from BACKUP\_URL for OUTPUT=USB, although this seems to me a
perfectly legal combination (create bootable USB, but put backup
somewhere else). The code uses USB\_DEVICE, but it is determined
preferably from BACKUP\_URL, although it would be more logical to
determine it from OUTPUT\_URL.

I don't even remember ever using `site.conf` - my little cheat sheet
only has `local.conf` and `default.conf` written down - but in fact this
file was there with my usual entries.  
After deleting it, the backup is smoothly created on the USB stick.  
Thank you very much!

@malvinas2 thanks for the verification!

It would be the best to add more code to the `prep` stage to verify the
consistency of `BACKUP_URL`, `OUTPUT_URL` and `USB_DEVICE`, but I don't
have the energy to untangle all this and this problem does not arise
very often, so I am adding only one check that there is something
mounted at `$BUILD_DIR/outputfs`: \#3102

Why are there multiple configuration files anyway? In my opinion there
should just be the default configuration (`default.conf`) and a custom
configuration (`local.conf`).  
If further user-defined configurations are required, these must be
specified explicitly (e.g. as command line parameters).

@malvinas2  
site.conf is (optionally) for site specific configuration,  
see "man rear" (excerpts):

    FILES
    ...
      /etc/rear/local.conf
        System specific configuration can be set here.

      /etc/rear/site.conf
        Site specific configuration can be set here
        (not created by default).
    ...
      /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
        Relax-and-Recover default values.
        Contains a complete set of parameters and its explanation.
        Do not edit or modify things therein but use
        local.conf or site.conf for specific settings.

thank you for debugging and for your fix!
