Hi @mtquattro,

I'm observing this behavior from time to time when I test ReaR backup on
USB. I did not examine exact reason (maybe udev doing something with
disk links), but what helps me to avoid such situation is following:

locate get\_disk\_size () in */usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh*
and add `sleep 5` before
`local block_size=$(get_block_size ${disk_name%/*})` so the final result
looks something like this:

    get_disk_size() {
        local disk_name=$1

        sleep 5
        local block_size=$(get_block_size ${disk_name%/*})

        [ -r /sys/block/$disk_name/size ]
        BugIfError "Could not determine size of disk $disk_name, please file a bug."

        local nr_blocks=$( < /sys/block/$disk_name/size)
        local disk_size=$(( nr_blocks * block_size ))

        ### Make sure we always return a number
        echo $(( disk_size ))
    }

You can download/check my copy of ReaR in
[https://github.com/gozora/rear](https://github.com/gozora/rear) for
more details.

I'll not create pull request as this workaround is very naive and can
largely increase backup time of "enterprise" systems with lots of disks.

I would appreciate if you could test if it resolves your problem and let
us know. Then we can maybe find some smarter way how to do the
implementation. (Maybe a loop with counter, or apply sleep time only for
OUTPUT=USB?)

@gdha, @jsmeix

What would you say if we update code as follows:

    - local block_size=$(get_block_size ${disk_name%/*})
    + local block_size=$(get_block_size ${disk_name%/*} || sleep 5; get_block_size ${disk_name%/*})

?

IIRC `||` binds closer than `;` so that in this form you will call
`get_block_size` always a second time. IMHO this is a good place to
write a proper if clause instead.

Another way that could be even more efficient could be:

    + my_udevsettle
    local block_size=$(get_block_size ${disk_name%/*})
    ...

But I need to test if this works sufficiently well ...

I didn't check the details but in general  
when a 'sleep' before a device node access avoids errors  
it indicates that some udev related weirdness happens, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)  
and see my currently used code in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327\#issuecomment-296674131](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327#issuecomment-296674131)

Accordingly I think "the ultimate really right fix" ;-)  
could be something like

<pre>
# Wait until the block device node exists:
for pass in trial verification ; do
    until test -b $block_device ; do
        LogPrint "Waiting until $block_device exists (retrying in 1 second)"
        sleep 1
    done
done
</pre>

Why two passes "trial" plus "verification" ?  
See "disappear and reappear" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791\#issuecomment-211318620](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791#issuecomment-211318620)

Alternatively the easiest and perhaps in the end the best what  
ReaR could do is to play dumb and retry the actual command  
until it succeeds:

<pre>
until COMMAND $block_device ; do
    LogPrint "Retrying 'COMMAND $block_device' in 1 second"
    sleep 1
done
</pre>

In particular when all what ReaR could do is to error out  
when 'COMMAND $block\_device' fails which would not help  
the user in any useful way in particular during "rear recover"  
I think it is better when ReaR retries endlessly and verbosely.  
The advantage is that while ReaR is endlessly retrying  
the user could run any commands that may solve it.  
E.g. try yourself:

<pre>
# until cat /etc/issue /tmp/qqq ; do sleep 1 ; done
</pre>

which retries endlessly until you create /tmp/qqq.

FYI:  
I asked a colleague what the best way is how do deal with  
udev's magically appearing (and disappearing) device nodes.  
He replied:  
All what one can do is to wait for the device node.  
For background information and reasoning read  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)  
I am not at all a udev expert I only collected what I noticed.

Thanks @jsmeix,

I'm a bit concerned about possible endless loop though ...  
What about breaking the loop after e.g. 10 retries ?

@gdha regarding the milestone I've set, I think that this is not a big
deal bug so it can wait until 2.2 release.

@jsmeix

I'd let it continue in execution of code (hence let it crash):

     [ -r /sys/block/$disk_name/size ]
        BugIfError "Could not determine size of disk $disk_name, please file a bug."

but change BugIfError to StopIfError ...

@gozora  
what is the advantage in practice for the user of "let it crash"  
compared to endless and verbose retries?

I think the user can at any time press \[Ctrl\]+\[C\] to abort ReaR  
(this is of course a required precondition for endless retries).

I am not against error abort but I wonder why it is better  
compared to endless retries.

Both are not the intended behaviour but perhaps endless retries  
could behave better (i.e. "less fatal") in practice?

Or in other words:  
With endless retries the decision to abort is at the user  
and as long as it retries the user could do something  
that makes it continue.

Of course endless retries only make sense when there is  
a chance that it could later continue (which is the case here).

@jsmeix  
First and foremost normally you don't start `rear mkbackup` from shell
but using Cron.  
Now imagine you have rear scheduled in Cron on hundreds of server and
you magically hit some some bug and end in endless loop ;-).  
Letting it crash with reasonable message can be detected by monitoring
SW and appropriate action can be taken.  
If you let rear running endlessly, you even don't have to realize that
something is wrong ...

@gozora  
thanks for your info - now I understand!

I had overlooked that get\_disk\_size() is called both in  
scripts in layout/prepare (i.e. during "rear recover") and  
also in scripts in layout/save (i.e. during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup").

I had the wrong assumption that udev related delay issues  
could happen only during "rear recover" while block device  
nodes are created.

Now I learned that udev related delay issues could also  
happen during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup".

Now I understand and agree that there must be an upper limit  
how often and/or how long ReaR retires  
until it gives up and errors out.

This leads to the problem what the right value for such  
an upper limit should be.

Assume 10 retries is hardcoded then there is the question  
what is different after 10 retries to error out instead of  
doing an 11th retry (because users on Fubar-Linux  
need at least 11 retries ;-)

Therefore there must be config variables  
(with reasonable default settings)  
so that the user can - if needed - specify  
the upper limits as he needs - something like  
REAR\_TIMEOUT=60  
and  
REAR\_MAX\_RETRIES=10  
probably also a  
REAR\_SLEEP\_DELAY=1  
to specify how fast ReaR retries.

Hello @jsmeix,

Yes I was thinking about similar variable introduction as well.  
I would however recommend to use only `REAR_MAX_RETRIES` and
`REAR_SLEEP_DELAY`. REAR\_TIMEOUT looks a bit useless as ti can be
calculated as `REAR_MAX_RETRIES * REAR_SLEEP_DELAY = REAR_TIMEOUT`.

What do you think?

V.

I mentioned REAR\_TIMEOUT only for completeness.  
For this particular issue it is not needed.

In general REAR\_TIMEOUT could be used for  
any command that may not return after a reasonable time  
i.e. for any command that may actually hang up  
or process longer than one can wait,  
cf. things like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283)

FYI  
in general regarding how one could timeout any command  
you may have a look at my test\_remote\_\* scripts in  
[https://github.com/yast/yast-printer/tree/master/tools](https://github.com/yast/yast-printer/tree/master/tools)  
that implement it via different kind of "time bombs".

For example time bombs with fixed waiting time in any case  
as in  
[https://github.com/yast/yast-printer/blob/master/tools/test\_remote\_socket](https://github.com/yast/yast-printer/blob/master/tools/test_remote_socket)

<pre>
if ( ( echo -n '' >/dev/tcp/$HOST/$PORT ) & ECHO_PID=$! ; sleep 2s ; kill $ECHO_PID &>/dev/null ; wait $ECHO_PID )
then # Test whether port on host accepts data:
     if ( ( echo -en '\r' >/dev/tcp/$HOST/$PORT ) & ECHO_PID=$! ; sleep 2s ; kill $ECHO_PID &>/dev/null ; wait $ECHO_PID )
     then echo -en "\nPort '$PORT' on host '$HOST' accepts data\n"
          exit 0
     fi
     echo -en "\nConnection possible to port '$PORT' on host '$HOST' but does not accept data\n"
     exit 4
fi
</pre>

Or a time bomb that only waits when really needed as in  
[https://github.com/yast/yast-printer/blob/master/tools/test\_remote\_lpd](https://github.com/yast/yast-printer/blob/master/tools/test_remote_lpd)

<pre>
$NETCAT -w $TIMEOUT -p $PORT $HOST 515 &lt;$NETCAT_IN >$NETCAT_OUT 2>/dev/null &
NETCAT_PID=$!
{ sleep ${TIMEOUT}s ; kill $NETCAT_PID &>/dev/null ; } &
</pre>

The former example uses hardcoded 'sleep 2s'  
where ReaR should use 'sleep $REAR\_SLEEP\_DELAY'.

The latter example uses TIMEOUT in a way  
how REAR\_TIMEOUT could be used in general.

Hmmm...

With the generic REAR\_TIMEOUT idea in mind  
there could be perhaps even a global timeout like  
REAR\_TOTAL\_TIMEOUT=3600  
that lets a whole "rear mkbackup/mkrescue/recover" time out  
by a global timebomb that kills the main script.

The use case and reasoning behind would be automated  
usage like running "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" by cron  
or an automated "rear recover" to get a failure/crash result  
after a maximum overall time instead of a possibly endlessly  
running 'rear ...' call,  
cf.

FYI in general regarding "timeout"  
see also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366)

For ReaR 2.2 we should provide some generically working  
basic support for various kind of "timeout" stuff.

Hello @jsmeix,

I guess I can make fix for this issue in v2.2.

Just for summary, from what I've read in communication of this issue,
preferred solution is following:

    # Wait until the block device node exists:
    for pass in trial verification ; do
        until test -b $block_device ; do
            LogPrint "Waiting until $block_device exists (retrying in 1 second)"
            sleep 1
        done
    done

Combined with loop break if timeout (REAR\_MAX\_RETRIES \*
REAR\_SLEEP\_DELAY) is reached, is that correct?

V.

Only FYI:  
Perhaps this issue is not yet properly fixed because  
the current get\_disk\_size function calls get\_block\_size  
before it tests /sys/block/$disk\_name/size  
but get\_block\_size also aceesses /sys/block/$disk\_name  
namely /sys/block/$disk\_name/queue/logical\_block\_size  
and I assume when udev is not yet ready the whole  
/sys/block/$disk\_name stuff is not yet there but  
fortunately get\_block\_size has a fallback when  
/sys/block/$disk\_name/queue/logical\_block\_size  
is not accessible so that in most cases things  
should work by better luck now...
