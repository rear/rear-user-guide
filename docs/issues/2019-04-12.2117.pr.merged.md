##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116)

-   How was this pull request tested?

By installing a Leap15 VM, creating a recovery ISO + backup archive with
the modified version of ReaR (official 2.4 + my changes), then shutting
down the VM, deleting its disk image, recreating a new disk (same size
in this case), booting the VM on the recovery ISO and running "rear
recover".

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

New script
(usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/640\_install\_shims.sh) that
calls 'shim-install' inside a chroot on the recovered system, and uses
the (sed-processed) /boot/grub2/grub.cfg as input to recreate 2 needed
EFI files:

    /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi/core.efi
    /boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/grubx64.efi

(both files are binary-identical, by the way).

@petroniusniger  
thank you for your pull request.

I will have a look as time permits - could be delayed e.g. until
Wednesday  
(we have Easter school holidays in Germany and my kids take precedence
:-)

@petroniusniger  
some things have changed in the finalize scripts since ReaR 2.4,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045)  
and its
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047)  
where in particular the bootloader install scripts were renumbered  
and things like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055)

Accordingly based on your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2117/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2117/files)  
I made a not yet tested preliminary  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/665\_install\_shim.sh  
that should (hopefully) better match the current code:

[665\_install\_shim.sh.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3080298/665_install_shim.sh.txt)

I would appreciate it if you could have a look at it  
and tell me what you think about it.

@jsmeix  
I reviewed your proposed '665\_install\_shim.sh.txt' and it looked OK to
me at first sight.  
I then set about to test it. It doesn't work, unfortunately, BUT it also
allowed me to better understand the situation in which this shim file
recreation is necessary.

Here is what I did:

-   I first realigned my working copy by merging changes from
    "trunk/LATEST" (so I'm now "beyond" 2.5)
-   then I put this working copy inside my test VM
-   inside the working copy, I removed my own version of the script and
    replaced it with yours (called '665\_install\_shim.sh')
-   I then generated a new recovery image + backup from within that
    working copy ('./usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup')

I then proceeded to test recovery of the VM (delete and recreate disk
image, boot on recovery media). While doing this, I noticed the
following problems (or simple change in behaviour):

-   the new script '665\_install\_shim.sh' now runs **before**
    '670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh'
-   new script '665\_install\_shim.sh' fails with error message:  
    "Cannot install secure boot loader (shim) because GRUB2 was not  
    successfully installed"

So I thought that my recovered VM would fail to boot, but **it did**!

Then I thought I would redo the test, but this time creating a slightly
larger disk image after deleting it (because I noticed that no 'sed'
replacement took place in '/boot/grub2/grub.cfg' during my first test).
This time, the behaviour of '665\_install\_shim.sh' was exactly the same
(same error message), but the volume group had been recreated from
scratch instead of performing a "vgrestore", which means the UUIDs were
indeed different now, and the VM **no longer booted**.

I'll recover it manually tomorrow, and start investigating why ReaR
reports failing to install GRUB2, whereas that component is obviously
present in the recovered VM and seems to be functional.

OK, I now understand the reason for the failure:

-   grub2 is meant to be installed by
    'finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh' but this script aborts
    if $USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is true, which is the case for us =&gt;
    660\_install\_grub2.sh does nothing (as confirmed by the absence of
    any message in the log)
-   a comment in the grub2 install script mentions that
    'finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh' is to be used instead
    when $USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is true and this script **does
    indeed** run successfully based on the recovery log and it does set
    $NOBOOTLOADER to empty (meaning success)
-   **BUT:** 665\_install\_shim.sh now runs **before**
    670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh, hence the fact that it doesn't do anything!

I'll now perform a new test renaming 665\_install\_shim.sh to
675\_install\_shim.sh

I'm happy to confirm that all works as expected after having renamed the
script to '675\_install\_shim.sh' (thereby making sure it executes
**after** 670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh).

I will now commit the changes and push them to branch issue-2116.

@petroniusniger  
many thanks for all your work and in particular for your explanatory
comments.  
I appreciate it because it makes it so much easier for me to understand
things.  
As time permits I will have a closer look next week...

@rmetrich  
could you have a look here, perhaps it is also of interest for Red
Hat?  
With this current pull request ReaR woud get a new SUSE specific  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
but I wonder if something similar isn't also needed for Red Hat?

@pcahyna Could you confirm this kind of code is not needed on RHEL8?

I think this would be discovered in our downstream testing if needed,
@xjezda00 what do you think?

I will merge it in its current form right now.

If we need it in general we can move it  
from finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
to finalize/Linux-i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
or link to it like  
finalize/Fedora/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh -&gt;
../../SUSE\_LINUX/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
or whatever else fits our needs.

thank you for your contribution that improves ReaR.
