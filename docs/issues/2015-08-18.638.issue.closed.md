When I then try and do a restore from the created ISO onto a smaller
SSD, though it is big enough for the partitions and data I have in the
backup, I get to:  
could not find directory /boot/grub  
Backups seem to succeed, but can't get anywhere with restores, nor can I
stop the issue on mkrescue.

@jmp242 When using `BACKUP=DUPLICITY` then the `BACKUP_URL` has no
meaning anymore as duplicity is an external backup mechanism which uses
its own transport mechanism (you can define it in `/etc/rear/local.conf`
- see the `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` file section *Extention
for DUPLICITY* for the possibilities.  
You cannot mix two backup methods in one go! You could have for example
2 local.conf files and use the `-c config-file` option with the `rear`
command to use a different config file then then default one.

However, I noticed that you got a segmentation fault which might
indicate that something went wrong when traces the required libraries
for duplicity (python script). That need some investigation.

So how does ReaR know where to put the ISO file without the BACKUP\_URL?

@jmp242 OUTPUT\_URL is your friend for ISO destination

@jmp242 also noticed the following:  
`COPY_AS_IS=( $COPY_AS_IS[@] /usr/sbin/mount.cifs /usr/sbin/mount.ntfs /usr/sbin/mount.ntfs-3g /usr/sbin/mount.ntfs-fuse )`  
be aware that `$COPY_AS_IS[@]` should be corrected into
`${COPY_AS_IS[@]}` which is the correct syntax for an array output.

I did get this on the mailing list. I swear I copied that from the
net,  
but it apparently is wrong. I have now fixed that. I've also done some  
more tests with duplicity / duply and I think the failure to find grub  
is a bit misleading, it seems like just prior to that the restore
fails  
with 'code 30' which I haven't been able to find out what exactly it  
means, but I wonder if it's an error mounting the remote drive due to  
not running pre command, which is:

mount -t cifs //lnx121/windr /tmp/backup -o  
username=user,password=secret,mapchars

I added to the COPY\_AS\_IS the /etc/duply/standard/pre and  
/etc/duply/standard/post and that didn't help either. I also still
have  
the mount.cifs in there. Maybe it all goes back to the segfault making  
the ISO?

Using  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental

works, including accessing the cifs filesystem, but the incremental  
backup and selection doesn't work (or I'm not sure how to make it work).

I'm happy to help debug, but I think I've tried all the config things
I  
can at this point.

BTW, I was just wondering why you had to add so much config for the CIFS
use case. IIRC that should happen automatically once you set
`BACKUP_URL=cifs://...`

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc)
for an example.

I think it was related to duply not working for me with rsync, so I  
tried file based as suggested in their docs where I handle the mount
in  
the pre command. Not specifically a ReaR issue there, that's Dulpy,
it's  
just that it seems to cause an issue on restore from the ReaR boot
disk.  
I'm thinking about testing with ssh to see if it could be related, but  
the build and restore would be the same no matter the backup method in  
the Duply profile in terms of the segfault trying to copy over Duply /  
Duplicity to the ReaR restore CD right?

Not sure... I wasn't using rsync directly, only using inside of duply,  
and currently (in generating the errors) using a file:/// backed by a  
mounted CIFS directory. Although, if you mean that duply in general is  
crashing because of getting an unexpected restore flag, then that
could  
be what's going on.

I'm not sure what's special about my set-up. I have had NETFS work  
perfectly including a restore. I then just used duply to do a second  
restore from the incremental backups and that worked pretty well for
me.  
So I have a workaround.

unclear?
