During a recover exercise on SAN based disks I get an error during the
partitioning:

    2012-11-30 13:48:37 An error occured during layout recreation.

When we look on the devices with parted we see the following:

Before restarting the recovery we dd all devices belonging to dm-0

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000 bs=512 count=1
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1
    ...

but it still complains

the 400001 should be a 1 ! The layout code somehow wrongly converted
this.

Digging into the code for this issue (script
`layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10_include_partition_code.sh`) and the lines
of interest producing above mentioned lines are:

            # Get the partition number from the name
            local number=$(echo "$partition" | grep -o -E "[0-9]+$")

Simulating the input as follows:

    $ partition=/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c400001
    $ echo "$partition" | grep -o -E "[0-9]+$"
    400001

Under normal circumstances we give the following entries as input:

    $ partition=/dev/cciss/c0d0p1
    $ echo "$partition" | grep -o -E "[0-9]+$"
    1

@jhoekx : how shall we fix this? Cutting the last 2 digits?

No, that is too much of a hack :-)

What is the normal path of one of the partitions?

@jhoekx In the following gist several input files are listed so you've
get an idea of how the `diskrestore.sh` script was created:

I see, that leaves us no choice at all if we want to support that. So go
ahead and add the cut. I think we also need to strip leading zeros.

Need to review the code as input device name does not have any
indication of a partition layout yet...need some more thoughts.

I think the problem we have with SAN disks is due to missing code in
`layout/prepare/default/32_apply_mappings.sh`  
The case statement does not cope with SAN disks (yet):

    # Replace all replacements with their target
    while read source target junk ; do
        replacement=$(get_replacement "$source")
        # Replace whole device
        sed -i -r "\|$replacement|s|$replacement\>|$target|g" $LAYOUT_FILE
        # Replace partitions
        case "$target" in
            *rd[/!]c[0-9]d[0-9]|*cciss[/!]c[0-9]d[0-9]|*ida[/!]c[0-9]d[0-9]|*amiraid[/!]ar[0-9]|*emd[/!][0-9]|*ataraid[/!]d[0-9]|*carmel[/!][0-9])
                target="${target}p" # append p between main device and partitions
                ;;
        esac
        sed -i -r "\|$replacement|s|$replacement([0-9]+)|$target\1|g" $LAYOUT_FILE

Therefore replacement disk
`/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000` becomes
`/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c400001` instead of
`/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000_part1`

Wow - it took a while to trace this one.

I'm not sure SAN disk devices are always presented this way? Can we
assume `/dev/mapper/` is an indication or not?

If you are restoring to the same SAN LUN the replacement code shouldn't
be triggered at all. If it is, that's the problem?

it was a migration from a (source) system with cciss-internal disk to a
(target) system with only SAN-disk(s)

@gdha I have never seen anything other than the following convention:

-   If the blockdevice ends with a letter, add the partition number
-   If the blockdevice ends with a number, add 'p' followed by the
    partition number

So disk /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000 has first
partition /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000p1

@gdha In ReaR `2.00 git` there is still a similar issue for sd to nvme
device migrations.  
The source drive device was named: `/dev/sda`  
The target drive device is named: `/dev/nvme0n1`

`rear recover` tries to:  
`+++ parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 set 11 boot on`

The `11` should be a `1`.

disklayout.conf (shortened) lists:

    ...
    part /dev/nvme0n1 1G 4M EFIboot boot /dev/nvme0n11
    part /dev/nvme0n1 172G 107G root none /dev/nvme0n12
    ...
