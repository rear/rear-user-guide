In our GPFS Analytical environment, the ReaR goes through the setup
steps but never starts the actual backup because it takes so long to
query all of the disk on the system

(root@myserver) /root \# wc -l /proc/partitions  
2458 /proc/partitions

Wow, I have never seen so many block devices!

Can you please provide a log and your configuration?

Also, does the same happen with `rear mkrescue` too?

We've not tried rear mkrescue. I'll respond to the mail with an
attachment because I cannot paste a zip file here.

I've update the Git thread. Here is the attachment with the requested  
information in it. I have included:

lshw  
multipath -ll  
/etc/redhat-release  
rear.log

Attachments don't work. Please use
[https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) for your logs and
also add your ReaR configuration (there or here).

I have there, the following:

/etc/redhat-release  
lshw  
multipath -ll  
rear.log

Thanks!

As to the configuration:

NFS v4 to an AIX server. I think we are on Version 15 of ReaR. The  
configs are standard across all 1600 of our servers. Only these two
with  
the large number of disks are failing.

@bjverzal the link to the gist stays blank with me?

@gdha I am a co-worker of @bjverzal, if you knock the .git off the end
of his gist, you can see the 4 files. The raw's of each are as follows:

If there is a quick hack I can implement that ONLY scans the partition
structure of sda, for example, instead of all disks, that is all I
really need to get these couple servers backed up properly. Then we can
try for a "real" solution later.

A quick hack could be to put in script
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/28_multipath_layout.sh` the
following lines in front of the other code:

    if [[ "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH" =~ ^[yY1] ]] ; then
        return
    fi

I assume we should also then set AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH = 1 in our
local.conf, to activate this skip?

Edit: Never mind. I tried adding the if statement you provided without
defining that variable anywhere, and it seems to have worked! I will be
adding this hack to all my systems currently experiencing this issue.

Thank you very very much @gdha !

It seems to be enabled by default:

    $ grep -r AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH .
    ./usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:    if [[ -n "$res" || "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH" =~ ^[yY1] ]]; then
    ./usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y
    ./usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/32_autoexclude.sh:if [[ "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH" =~ ^[yY1] ]] ; then
    ./doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.txt:A similar mechanism exists for multipath disks. The +AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y+

Maybe the check was just missing from `28_multipath_layout.sh`

no the check was not there on purpose as we like to have our multipath
config in our layout and what later it will be commented anyway. It is
always nice to see what was originally configured on your system (handy
in DR mode to see what was on the production system).  
However, in rare cases there are just too many devices. I would not
modify this script.  
Just gonna close this issue.
