We are waiting for feedback from the original reporter in order to get
this ball rolling again...

@schlomo: Is there a possibility to get in contact with the reporter
using private email ?

I just went over the SF bug again. I would say close it and wait if it
pops up again. I hope that we will have some Ubuntu 64bit as part of our
regular test setup. Who knows, maybe he upgraded his system from
something older and that caused his /lib dirs to be different.

Also, I think that now we have even smarter /lib cloning code so maybe
it already fixed it for this user.

(I don't know this user and don't have private contact)

Alright, closing this issue because we lack feedback about a recent and
relevant release. If this is still an issue, please re-open this issue.

Hi, I ran into the same issue:

    root@icinga:~/rear/manual/rear-1.13.0# rear mkbackup
    ERROR: BUG BUG BUG!  ROOTFS_DIR '/tmp/rear.6xGZWDET8u49JGS/rootfs' is broken, chroot
            Please report this as a bug to the authors of Relax and Recover
    Aborting due to an error, check /tmp/rear-icinga.log for details
    Finished in 9 seconds
    You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.6xGZWDET8u49JGS
    Terminated

I ran into this error with Debian/Ubuntu Package from opensuse build
service with Version 1.12 and tried the newer 1.13 Release as tar.gz
(purged any debian package before). My local.conf:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    MODULES_LOAD=( vmxnet )
    ISO_DIR=/localbackup/sysrescue
    BACKUP=EXTERNAL
    COPY_AS_IS=(${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /usr/local/sbin/restore_localhost.sh)
    EXTERNAL_BACKUP="/usr/local/sbin/backup_localhost.sh"
    EXTERNAL_RESTORE="/usr/local/sbin/restore_localhost.sh

running on system: Ubuntu 11.10

The bug did'nt show up on rear version 1.10 I used before; but this
version didn't allow me to restore the system (as stated in some other
bugreport) so I tried to upgrade.  
A manual chroot to reproduce the behaviour also failed:

root@icinga:~\# chroot /tmp/rear.2SahWSVBl6Oualf/rootfs/  
chroot: failed to run command \`/bin/bash': No such file or director

where /tmp/rear.2SahWSVBl6Oualf/rootfs/bin/bash is existing and
executable

I tried also to chroot into a rear-rootfs I copied from a debian system
to the ubuntu-box, that worked for fine me.

Kind regards  
Jan

Hi,  
played around a bit and got it working through copying some more libs
explicitly into the rescue image. I extended my local.conf the following
way:

    COPY_AS_IS=(${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /usr/local/sbin/restore_localhost.sh /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/*

I assume there is a cleaner way to include this into rear (maybe some
rule especially for Ubuntu 11.10 so that rear works out of the box.

@jpeschke What version did you try ? We made an important change in the
master branch that should have fixed the issue you see. And so we would
like to know if that effectively fixes your issue as well. I would
appreciate if you could test the version in the master branch. This is
also the first release that can be used without requiring to install it,
so you can simply do a `git clone` and then run `./usr/sbin/rear`.

I tried this version
[https://github.com/downloads/rear/rear/rear-1.13.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/downloads/rear/rear/rear-1.13.0.tar.gz)  
and the debian package from here  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/sschapiro/xUbuntu\_11.10/all/rear\_1.12.0-1\_all.deb](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/sschapiro/xUbuntu_11.10/all/rear_1.12.0-1_all.deb)  
Actually not the masterbranch, maybe I'll find the time to test it.

The expected fix for your issue was part of issue \#36.
([https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c1ef53238ee009d726d8a2da8ad4b8526393ca88](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c1ef53238ee009d726d8a2da8ad4b8526393ca88))

I can confirm, that the masterbranch fixed any issue I had with stable
versions on Ubuntu 11.10; thanks a lot.
