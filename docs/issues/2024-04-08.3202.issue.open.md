I find in particular this one interesting:

[https://mastodon.social/@AndresFreundTec/112208281684931915](https://mastodon.social/@AndresFreundTec/112208281684931915)

From my point of view the most important outcome in that discussion is
this  
posting (excerpt):

    Elias Probst @eliasp

    @jejb so it all comes down to being able
    to actually understand and review every contribution,
    so it doesn't really matter in the end who contributed,
    but what was contributed instead.

I.e. take out the "who" part from finding a solution  
how to avoid malicious code changes and  
focus on the code changes itself.

Another posting in that discussion also indicates  
that the "who" part likely does not help  
to avoid malicious code changes (excerpt):

    Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social

    @eliasp @AndresFreundTec But even with the web of trust.
    How should that scale in a global way and also
    not exclude less privileged people?

    A student in a remote country side
    wants to start contributing to code.
    Welp, nobody there to establish web of trust.

I.e. trying to solve the "who" part via a "web of trust"  
does not work in practice.  
In contrast understanding what was contributed  
(regardless who contributed it)  
should work in practice.

From my personal point of view this means:

New code that is not easy to understand should be  
rejected at upstream by those upstream maintainers  
who review contributions from others  
regardless if some other one is an unknown newcomer  
or a "well known expert in sophisticated coding ingenuity".

Old code that is known to be OK since ages can stay as is.  
But when old code is changed the changes must be easy to understand  
(which may mean that bigger parts of old code must be overhauled).

Simply put:  
Code that is hard for others to understand must be rejected  
because it would be unmaintainable by others in the future.

So in the end from my personal point of view  
it means to more enforce what is meant with

[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

i.e. not some nitpicking coding syntax style "rules"  
(which cause more annoyance than being actually helpful)  
but to more enforce the overall idea behind:

    Make yourself understood
    to make your code maintainable which means
    at any time later others still understand your code
    so they can properly fix and enhance your code as needed.

An important aspect is to meet the active contributors once personally.
A "web of trust" should be a "people of trust" (in our case). All ReaR
contributors have met each other in person - that helps.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2024-04-08 13:08](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3202#issuecomment-2042718569):

In addition to enforce that code must be easy to understand  
I think we should also enforce to review all code changes.

This means that all code changes  
(also code changes by us, the upstream maintainers)  
must be approved by at least one other upstream maintainer  
even if that makes merging code changes into 'master' slower.

But I think that a certain kind of slowness is helpful  
because it results from "verify" in "Trust, but verify"  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,\_but\_verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify)

In practice enforced code change reviews means  
that all code changes must happen via a pull request.

I mean only actual code changes (at least for now).  
I.e. all what changes what ReaR does on the user's system.

E.g. typo fixes in comments can still be directly merged  
regardless that even a "typo fix" in a comment may  
(unintentionally or by evil intent) be a false change  
of the meaning of a comment so others get a false  
understanding what (some weird looking) code  
actually does which could be a first step to do  
later a malicious change in the actual code.

@gdha  
yes, that all ReaR contributors have met each other in person  
does help very much.

But:

This would exclude people in far away countries.  
Currently I have no good idea how to solve that properly.

And it does not help when the account  
of a ReaR upstream maintainer got hijacked  
or when a ReaR upstream maintainer was tricked  
by a malicious external person.  
I think enforced code change reviews  
by at least one other upstream maintainer help.  
And at least two active upstream maintainers help  
against social engineering attrition of single  
upstream maintainers (as it happened to the  
single upstream maintainer during the XZ Attack).

As mentioned already mentioned before all Pull Requests must be reviewed
by another person then the author, and I would like to add an additional
third person - the co-called "approver" of the PR. This way there always
3 persons involved before a PR is getting merged.

We can enable [branch
protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
to help us "remember" the PR rule, although maintainers of course can
override that.

I'm against a 6-eyes approval, at least now, because I think that going
from "just do it" to "everything via PR" is already a big and probably
sometimes inconvenient step for us. As we don't have any actual problem,
I'd like to take this slowly, step by step. And inspect and adapt after
every change.

I also think that 6-eyes approval is too much for us for now.  
Often I don't get a single approval for my pull requests and  
when I get one I think it is often not after a thorough review.  
I totally understand this because in most cases I don't do  
a thorough review but only have a look if I spot something  
and if not I just trust you.

I always prefer to change things slowly, step by step.

In think for now it is enough to have some kind of "enforced"  
approval by at least one other upstream maintainer  
for pull requests from an upstream maintainer.

Perhaps we should "enforce" approval by at least  
two upstream maintainers for pull requests  
from external contributors?

With "enforce" I mean that we set up something in GitHub  
which we can of course override but that would at least  
remind us each time to not "just merge" something without  
approval by at least one other upstream maintainer.

FWIW:  
I remember well how @pcahyna asked me  
again and again questions during  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2961](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2961)  
because he did not understand my description in default.conf.  
I even felt somewhat annoyed by his insisting questions  
("why the heck doesn't he understand my nice description?")  
until finally I saw it that what I described  
did not match what I had implemented, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2961\#discussion\_r1363679930](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2961#discussion_r1363679930)  
I was blind regarding my own faulty description  
(from 09. Oct. 2023 until 18. Oct. 2023).  
I still cannot understand why I was so blind.  
So @pcahyna helped me to finally see my fault and  
he helped our users to not get my faulty description.

Perhaps, the biggest danger is not in the source code itself, but in the
produced ISO images stored on a NAS location where everybody (within a
company) can replace it with a malicious code (or whatever evil).

Yes, that is however by design and we shouldn't worry about it.

Maybe Secure Boot with custom keys can be used to create end-end secured
DR boot media

With this issue here I meant only our source code,  
in particular how to better ensure that our users  
actually get what we intended to provide them.

Regarding secure ReaR recovery system images:  
I don't remember there had been a user request in the past  
for a secured ReaR boot medium so at least currently  
this seems to be not an issue for our users.  
I assume our users know how to keep e.g. ReaR ISOs secure.  
I assume they handle ReaR boot media same as their backups.  
One does not want to restore a maliciously modified backup  
(e.g. where /usr/sbin/sshd got "additional functionality").
