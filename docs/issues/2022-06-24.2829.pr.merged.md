-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh  
set USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL to match format-workflow.sh  
which means when a format workflow option -b/--bios or -e/--efi was
specified  
set USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL to "msdos" or "gpt" accordingly  
and when no format workflow option -b/--bios or -e/--efi was specified  
it means hybrid boot supporting BIOS and UEFI by default  
so USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL must be set to "gpt".

It is only a "minor bug" because current ReaR  
does usually not "just work out of the box",  
cf. "Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

So the need to explicitly specify the right

    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL="gpt"

in etc/rear/local.conf is OK in current ReaR.

The minor bug is that the old default setting

    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL="msdos"

conflicts with the new default behaviour of what  
usr/share/rear/lib/format-workflow.sh  
does which is now UEFI and BIOS dual boot

I fear now things fail in  
prep/USB/Linux-i386/340\_find\_mbr\_bin.sh  
because with the changes in this pull request  
USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL is not set during "rear mkrescue".

Sigh - so many subtle interdependencies everywhere...

I tested on my openSUSE Leap 15.3 homeoffice laptop with BIOS  
that with this changes the new default works for me with BIOS  
so there should be no regressions with the new default  
hybrid UEFI and BIOS dual boot.

I use `USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=10` only

I can boot the ReaR recovery from that USB disk  
on another rather old laptop that only supports BIOS  
and the booted ReaR recovery seems to work normally for me  
(i.e. logged in as 'root' and tried this or that commands).

But I cannot actually test "rear recover" because I want  
to keep what there currently is on that old laptop.

Currently I cannot test UEFI because I don't have  
sufficient test machines available for testing in homeoffice  
(currently I need my newer UEFI laptop for other work).

@jsmeix thanks! I've also tested this PR in the BIOS setting and
formatting works and rescue boots and recovers fine. I'm testing EFI and
I'll report with the results soon.

@lzaoral  
thank you so much for your testing!  
It helps so much when at least one other person verifies things.  
Now I am rather confident that we don't introduce bad regressions  
with the new default hybrid UEFI and BIOS dual boot.

I will document possible consequences of that change  
in our release notes for ReaR 2.7  
which are currently (unfinished) at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/jsmeix-release-notes-2-7/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/jsmeix-release-notes-2-7/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md)

I tried to boot from my above made USB disk also  
on my newer UEFI laptop but I failed to specify  
in its rather limited "InsydeH2O UEFI BIOS" \[sic!\]  
(see
[https://www.insyde.com/products](https://www.insyde.com/products)  
they call their UEFI firmware "BIOS")  
how to boot from my USB disk.

I have openSUSE Leap 15.3 installed on this laptop  
from a USB stick so it must be possible to boot  
from an appropriately made USB stick.

My blind guess is the reason is that my current USB disk  
is not ready for EFI boot in particular because its ESP is empty:

    # mount /dev/sdb2 /tmp/sdb2

    # find /tmp/sdb2 -ls
            1      4 drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         4096 Jan  1  1970 /tmp/sdb2

I will try out how things behave with

    USB_BOOTLOADER="grub"

this does not look good - does the master branch code (without your
change) behave the same way?

@jsmeix EFI seems to work both with hybrid and `--efi` USB layout
(though I tested it without the two latest commits). Rescue image boots
fine and the recovered OS also seems to work.

> my current USB disk  
> is not ready for EFI boot in particular because its ESP is empty

I've tested it on RHEL 8 and the ESP always contained all the necessary
files so maybe is this problem openSUSE specific? ESP on RHEL 8:

    # tree /mnt/rear-esp/
    /mnt/rear-esp/
    └── EFI
        └── BOOT
            ├── BOOTX64.efi
            ├── grub.cfg
            ├── initrd.cgz
            └── kernel

I've also tested `-b` layout on a BIOS machine with latest `HEAD`without
`USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL` being set and everything worked fine.

@lzaoral  
again very many thanks for your UEFI testing!

I don't have sufficient UEFI testing hardware  
so I cannot sufficiently test UEFI booting.  
But that is OK for me because I cannot do  
all and everything alone for ReaR in openSUSE and  
OUTPUT=USB is not much used in business environments.  
So whether or not OUTPUT=USB "just works" with UEFI  
has currently no high priority regarding SLES customers  
(which may instantly change when a SLES issue appears  
from a customer with an official SUSE support contract).  
Currently for me the topmost important thing is that  
our new UEFI and BIOS dual boot default for OUTPUT=USB  
does not cause major regressions.

Booting that same newer homeoffice laptop with UEFI  
from the USB disk in UEFI mode works for me.

The USB disk is automatically listed in the  
boot menu of the laptop's firmware.

When I boot from the USB disk I get the GRUB2 boot menu.

On that laptop it did not work out of the box  
to start up the ReaR recovery system  
because after some kernel boot messages  
there was no further output at the boot message

    Found device /dev/ttyS0.

but I still noticed some USB disk access activity noise.

I guessed it is perhaps only a graphics driver issue  
(i.e. a kernel mode setting issue)  
because that laptop has a separated Nvidia GPU  
and an AMD CPU with integrated AMD graphics  
so I guessed the actual issue is that I only  
do no longer see any further output on the console.

So I did another boot attempt and  
in the GRUB2 boot menu I edited the boot entry:  
I added the kernel command line parameters

    nomodeset vga=normal

(into the 'linux' line of the the boot entry)  
and with that the ReaR recovery system startup looks normal.

I don't know if both kernel command line parameters are needed.  
Perhaps only 'nomodeset' or only 'vga=normal' is sufficient.  
I try that out later.

The booted ReaR recovery seems to work normally for me  
(i.e. logged in as 'root' and tried this or that commands).

But I cannot actually test "rear recover"  
because I need that laptop for my normal work.

Regarding kernel command line parameter

    vga=normal

see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2791](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2791)  
where we tried to set it everywhere when booting  
the ReaR recovery system but it seems 'vga=normal'  
is missing when booting from USB via GRUB2.

Furhermore we should think about if additionally  
the kernel command line parameter

    nomodeset

may make sense in general when booting the ReaR recovery system  
because in general the ReaR recovery system does not need  
any sophisticated graphical mode so sticking to plain default  
traditional text console mode should be sufficient and  
perhaps enforcing that via 'nomodeset vga=normal' could  
make booting the ReaR recovery system more fail-safe.

But this would be a separated issue for ReaR 2.8  
that does not belong to this pull request.

Sigh - last Friday somehow I overlooked another place where  
the value of USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL is used:

It is also used in output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh

    LogPrint "Writing syslinux MBR $SYSLINUX_MBR_BIN of type $USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL to $RAW_USB_DEVICE"

So I will change prep/USB/Linux-i386/340\_find\_mbr\_bin.sh  
to set USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL to the right value  
via the current 'lsblk' automatism in this pull request  
and use a user specified value only as fallback  
when the 'lsblk' automatism doesn't work (on older systems).

The hybrid boot USB disk that I made  
on newer homeoffice laptop with UEFI in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829\#issuecomment-1166925033](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829#issuecomment-1166925033)  
booted well also on my rather old laptop that only supports BIOS.

In a second test I also added 'nomodeset'  
('vga=normal' was already there)  
to the SYSLINUX/EXTLINUX boot entry  
(via the \[Tab\] key in the SYSLINUX/EXTLINUX boot menu)  
and it made no difference how booting looks and  
how the running ReaR recovery system looks  
on that rather old laptop that only supports BIOS.

One thing that might look a bit inconsistent is

    Running 'prep' stage ======================
    Found EFI system partition /dev/nvme0n1p1 on /boot/efi type vfat
    Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1)

versus

    Running 'output' stage ======================
    Configuring EFI partition '/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-EFI' for EFI boot with 'grubx64.efi'

i.e. it checks if there is an ESP on the original system  
to set USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1 but later it checks  
if there is an ESP on the USB disk to set up EFI booting on the USB
disk.

I am not an EFI expert but I think this is not inconsistent  
but exactly right because to set up EFI booting on the USB disk  
an EFI application is needed and for that a prerequirement is  
that there is an ESP on the original system  
where such an EFI application can be found.

In rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is set to such a found EFI application  
inside the ESP on the original system and later  
in output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
that UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is copied into the ESP on the USB disk.

there was no further output at the boot message

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829\#issuecomment-1166985075](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829#issuecomment-1166985075)

But adding only the kernel command line parameter 'nomodeset'  
is sufficient to let the ReaR recovery system startup look normal.

Again the booted ReaR recovery seems to work normally for me  
(i.e. logged in as 'root' and tried this or that commands).
