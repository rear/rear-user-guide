As per /usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh,
backup via rsyncd does not care about config:

    ```
    # The following exit codes from EXTERNAL_* should not abort the backup or recovery
    # This example is useful for rsync
    EXTERNAL_IGNORE_ERRORS=( 23 24 )
    ```

as
/usr/share/rear/backup/EXTERNAL/default/500\_make\_backup\_with\_external.sh
instead does.  
Using rsync vanished files are quite familiar.  
Is it possible to include an exit code check in
500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh ?

Currently EXTERNAL\_IGNORE\_ERRORS is meant only for BACKUP=EXTERNAL  
according to how it is described in default.conf  
currently online starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2834](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2834)

So what is needed is an enhancemnet for the BACKUP=RSYNC method  
with a new separated config variable in default.conf  
e.g. something similar as BORGBACKUP\_IGNORE\_WARNING  
cf.

OK, btw the comment "\# This example is useful for rsync" is misleading
imo.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2872](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2872)  
there should be now a better (i.e. less misleading)  
description of the BACKUP=EXTERNAL config variables  
in default.conf.

@fadamo how do you deal with "rsync vanished files " right now ?

I currently have an almost endless list of exclusions. I am studying how
to "inject" an error check without modifying the original ReaR scripts,
otherwise at the first "yum update" I lose the changes. However I think
the correct solution is to do as in
/usr/share/rear/backup/EXTERNAL/default/500\_make\_backup\_with\_external.sh.
