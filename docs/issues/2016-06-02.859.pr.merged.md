See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845)

I tested it on SLE12 x86\_64 kvm/qemu virtual machine  
with BIOS and this /etc/rear/local.conf:

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=ftpfs://rear:rear@10.160.4.244/rear
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

The currently supported ftpfs BACKUP\_URL syntax is

<pre>
ftpfs://user:password@host/path
</pre>

where password is optional.

The only missing piece for me is that  
in the rear recovery system one must  
manually load the fuse kernel module with

<pre>
modprobe fuse
</pre>

because otherwise "rear recover" aborts with

<pre>
Mount command 'curlftpfs ...' failed.
</pre>

At least for me the backup via curlftpfs is  
very much slower than the backup via NFS.

For backup via NFS "rear mkbackup" reports

<pre>
Archived 916 MiB in 163 seconds [avg 5759 KiB/sec]
</pre>

while in contrast for backup via curlftpfs "rear mkbackup" reports

<pre>
Archived 916 MiB in 1744 seconds [avg 538 KiB/sec]
</pre>

But the restore via curlftpfs is as fast as via NFS.  
For restore via curlftpfs "rear recover" reports

<pre>
Restored 2409 MiB in 38 seconds [avg 64942 KiB/sec]
</pre>

@gdha  
could you please have a look  
whether or not it seems to be o.k. for you.

In particular I like that you have a look at my  
"FIXME" comments in 05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
because I think those are real (minor) bugs.

With latest commits I improved it as follows:

In global-functions.sh I ensure the fuse kernel module  
is loaded for the new ftpfs BACKUP\_URL because  
ftpfs (via CurlFtpFS) is based on FUSE.  
I simply call "modprobe fuse" when fuse in not yet loaded.  
I found such kind of code at other places in rear  
so that I assume it is o.k. to do it this way.

In 05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
I soveld some FIXME issues according  
to the above comments from @gdha

FYI:  
Without password in the ftpfs BACKUP\_URL e.g.

<pre>
BACKUP_URL=ftpfs://rear@10.160.4.244/rear
</pre>

the password is requested multiple times.

Three times for "rear mkbackup"

<pre>
# rear -d -D mkbackup
...

Enter host password for user 'rear':

...

Two times for "rear recover"

<pre>
# rear -d -D recover
...

insmod /lib/modules/3.12.51-60.25-default/kernel/fs/fuse/fuse.ko

Restored 2393 MiB in 38 seconds [avg 64490 KiB/sec]
</pre>

But all in all it now works sufficiently well for me as a  
"First step to support new ftpfs BACKUP\_URL"  
so that I think I will merge it.

@gdha regarding  
"more complex ... if we are working with SSL certificates":

I will leave such enhancements for  
"Further steps to support new ftpfs BACKUP\_URL".

I think as a first step it is now good enough.

@gdha  
many thanks for your valuable feedback and comments!
