##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149)

-   How was this pull request tested? `rear dump` and then rescue on
    x86\_64 Fedora Rawhide and RHEL 9.4

-   Description of the changes in this pull request - Notable changes:

1.  Before this change, ReaR would just grep `/etc/os-release` for
    suitable string. This is wrong because, e.g. Fedora was classified
    as RHEL because its `/etc/os-release` contains the 'redhat' string
    in URL for its issue tracker.  
      
    `os-release(5)` \[1\] specifies `ID` and `ID_LIKE` fields for
    reliable identification of the distribution. First, use the
    `ID_LIKE` field to deal with derivative Linux distributions (e.g.
    CentOS and RHEL, or Ubuntu and Linux Mint). Then use `ID` to detect
    distributions that are either not a derivative (e.g. Arch or Fedora)
    or ReaR already recognized the derivate separately (e.g. Fedora vs.
    RHEL or Debian vs. Ubuntu).

2.  Set `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` only for derived distributions recognized by
    ReaR.  
      
    This change ensures that `OS_VENDOR` and `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` will not
    be set to equal values which subsequently caused some ReaR stages to
    be sourced more than once.

3.  Use `OS_MASTER_VERSION` for major releases.  
      
    Contrary to its name, the `OS_MASTER_VERSION` variable was already
    used for this purpose for some versions, e.g. RHEL 7. This fixes
    version comparison on RHEL 8 and newer.

Thank you for the analysis, @jsmeix! I've pushed changes that rename
`Arch` to `Arch_Linux` and completely remove `RedHatEnterpriseServer`. I
still have to test these changes on an actual RHEL machine so I'll let
you know ASAP if the recovery is still ok.

Good news is that the changes recovered the machine successfully.
However, I've just remembered that ReaR uses `OS_VENDOR` for the name of
the recreated EFI boot entry so we will not get `Fedora` for all
Fedora-like distributions.

@pcahyna What do you think?

Hi  
Clould this OS detection fix also solve the root problem for \#3170 ?  
Which is in my opinion also related to OS detection.

Hey @rvdkraan! Unfortunately, this PR will not fix your issues because
both the `OS_VENDOR` and `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` variables from your report
were already correct.

Some further thoughts regarding the  
get\_var\_from\_file() function:

Because at least at first glance it looks rather confusing  
what $0 $1 $2 actually is when looking at the  
get\_var\_from\_file() function code, better tell in a comment  
how get\_var\_from\_file() needs to be called,  
e.g. like

    # get_var_from_file file_name variable_name

I think it would be good to BugError()  
when $file\_name is no readable file  
and/or when $variable\_name is empty.

Perhaps it is somehow possible to let  
get\_var\_from\_file() provide a useful exit code.  
Currently it always results exit code 0 because  
`echo something` is (basically) always successful:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0"; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2"; }

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    opensuse-leap
    OK

    # get_var_from_file qqq ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory

    OK

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release QQQ && echo OK || echo FAIL

    OK

    # cat my-invalid-assignments
    if then
    VAR="value"

    # get_var_from_file my-invalid-assignments VAR && echo OK || echo FAIL
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: `if then'

    OK

Therefore I suggest a better implementation  
of the actual get\_var\_from\_file() code body:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" && echo "${!1}" || false' "$1" "$2" ; }

    # get_var_from_file my-invalid-assignments VAR && echo OK || echo FAIL
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: `if then'
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release QQQ && echo OK || echo FAIL

    OK

    # get_var_from_file qqq ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    opensuse-leap
    OK

An offhanded proposal how to let get\_var\_from\_file()  
return non-zero exit code when $variable\_name is not assigned:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" || false ; test -v "$1" && echo "${!1}" || false' "$1" "$2" ; }

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    opensuse-leap
    OK

    # get_var_from_file /etc/os-release QQQ && echo OK || echo FAIL
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file qqq ID && echo OK || echo FAIL
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory
    FAIL

    # get_var_from_file my-invalid-assignments VAR && echo OK || echo FAIL
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-invalid-assignments: line 1: `if then'
    FAIL

@jsmeix Not at all, both yours and @pcahyna's suggestions are very
constructive!

@jsmeix A bit shorter approach is to use the `-u` shell option. Also,
`source "$0" || false ; ...` will not halt the execution immediately in
your second implementation.

This should return `0` if the sourcing succeeded and the given variable
is set. Otherwise, it returns `1` (the final `|| return 1` is necessary
because bash returns `127` on unbound variables).

    $ function get() { bash -c 'source "$0" || exit 1; set -u; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 }
    $ get /etc/os-release ID; echo $?
    fedora
    0
    $ get /etc/osrelease ID; echo $?
    /etc/osrelease: line 1: /etc/osrelease: No such file or directory
    1
    $ get /etc/os-release IDD; echo $?
    /etc/os-release: line 1: !1: unbound variable
    1

On the other hand, if it would be ok to fail on any problems in the
sourced file as well, `bash -euc ...` may be enough.

I like `bash -euc` very much because it is simple  
and it makes useful use of the "bash in between"  
which was up to now more a workaround for `source`  
that has a problem with `readonly` variables,  
cf. our "late but helpful party guest" ;-) comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#discussion\_r1521750947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#discussion_r1521750947)

So I played around with `bash -euc` and  
this seems to behave best at least for my tests:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -eu -c 'source "$0" && echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

FYI: Intentionally I separated `-eu` form `-c` to make it  
more clear that there is different meaning of arguments  
and I used `source ... && echo` to make it more clear  
that successful `source` is a condition for `echo`  
(instead of having this condition as an implicit result of `-e`).

During my tests how it behaves in error cases  
I was thinking about that it could be helpful for debugging  
when also within the bash inside that function  
ReaR's outer DEBUGSCRIPTS setting would be supported,  
so I enhanced it further to

    # function get_var_from_file() { test "$DEBUGSCRIPTS" && local debug="-x" ; bash $debug -eu -c 'source "$0" && echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

That seems to behave well at least for me on command line

    + source my-shell-assignments
    ++ VAR=value
    ++ STRING='lvalue = rvalue'
    ++ ARR=('first element = 1' 'second element = 2' 'last element = 3')
    my-shell-assignments: !1: unbound variable

    ++ ARR=('first element = 1' 'second element = 2' 'last element = 3')
    + echo value
    OK
    declare -- myvar="value"

The last two examples (i.e. when 'source' succeeds with
DEBUGSCRIPTS=1)  
show that the whole sourced file gets output via 'set -x'  
which might be unwanted e.g. when that file is huge and  
which might expose (sensitive) variable values in ReaR's log file  
(where stderr is redirected within ReaR's runtime environment).

So we must also test it within ReaR's runtime environment.

Perhaps it is best to "Keep It Simple and Secure"  
and omit such transitive DEBUGSCRIPTS setting?

For completeness:  
Tests with added EMPTY and BLANK variables and  
with STRING (correct) and ARR (wrong) results  
(with `DEBUGSCRIPTS=1`):

    # cat my-shell-assignments 
    VAR="value"
    EMPTY=
    BLANK=' '
    STRING="lvalue \
    = \

    ARR=( 'first element = 1'
          'second element = 2'
          'last element = 3' )

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-shell-assignments EMPTY && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2  )" ; declare -p myvar
    + source my-shell-assignments
    ++ VAR=value
    ++ EMPTY=
    ++ BLANK=' '
    ++ STRING='lvalue = rvalue'
    ++ ARR=('first element = 1' 'second element = 2' 'last element = 3')
    + echo ''
    OK
    declare -- myvar=""

I think so, I would not bother with it.

More important question is whether it is ok to fail on any problems in
the sourced file as well. I think that the sourced file may use variable
assignments that are not intended to work correctly with `set -eu`. For
example FOO="$BAR" where BAR is unset. For this reason I think I would
prefer to add `set -u` or `set -eu` after the `source` instead of having
-eu as flags on the `bash` invocation.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2015507343](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2015507343)

I do fully agree.

Meanwhile  
(after I had some "deep thought" about it over the weekend)  
I consider hardcoded "transitive DEBUG options setting"  
a horrible idea regarding security and privacy.

Not only in this specific case but in general:  
I.e. when ReaR scripts run with 'set -x'  
it does not mean that programs which are called by ReaR  
also run with whatever program-specific debug settings.

Reasoning  
with this specific case as an example:

For example (as far as I know) some networking config files  
could contain confidential data (like WLAN passwords)  
so when ReaR needs some other value from such a file  
the whole file (except bash comments)  
would appear in the log (in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode)  
so the confidential values would leak out =&gt; security issue.

Furthermore when whole user config files (except bash comments)  
appear in the log (in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode)  
ReaR would cross a privacy boundary:  
From what belongs to ReaR (e.g. the value that ReaR needs  
from a user config file) to what belongs only to the user  
i.e. his whole config file with all his values =&gt; privacy issue.

If at all "transitive DEBUG options setting" might be enabled  
only on explicit user request via '--expose-secrets'.

But in this specific case "transitive DEBUGSCRIPTS setting"  
is not needed in practice because also without 'set -x'  
the stderr messages tell sufficiently what the problem is  
so that the user can inspect his config file on his own  
what the actual reason inside his config file is.  
Also when a user reports an issue to us  
we can show him by the stderr messages what the problem is  
but we neither need to know all his config values  
nor should we know all his config values  
to help him sufficiently.

The current implementation

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0"; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

does not yet work correctly  
when there is stdout output of the sourced file

    # cat my-assignment 
    if echo HELLO ; then
      VAR="value"
    fi

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2 ; declare -p myvar
    OK
    declare -- myvar="HELLO
    value"

    # unset VAR ; source my-assignment && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2 ; declare -p VAR
    HELLO
    OK
    declare -- VAR="value"

This one fixes it for me:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" 1>/dev/null ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" ; }

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" && echo OK 1>&2 || echo FAIL with $? 1>&2 ; declare -p myvar
    OK
    declare -- myvar="value"

The fix here (by added `1>/dev/null` to the 'source' call)  
is only meant as an offhanded proposal to fix  
when there is stdout output of the sourced file.

It is not meant as a proposal how to deal with errors  
(via `set -e` or `set -eu` or `... || exit 1` or ...).

A 'nit' reply only for the fun of it:  
I prefer `1>` over `>` because I prefer explicit code.  
In particular explicit `1>` would make it easier  
in theory to search the code where stdout is redirected.  
In practice this does not work because also `>` is used  
so in the end it does not matter if `1>` or `>` is used

@jsmeix I happen to disagree here because everyone knows `> /dev/null`

what is the `1` doing there, while `> /dev/null` is immediately obvious.
Related: `> /dev/null` is more visually recognizable from let's say
`7> /dev/null`, and we use numbered redirections often in ReaR.

Sigh - endless problems - here the next one:

We cannot fail when 'source' fails because  
'source' returns the status of the last command  
executed in the sourced file so

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null || exit 1 ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

    # cat my-assignment

(emphasis mine).

So, why to worry about the exit status from `source` if the only allowed
statements are variable assignment statements? (`ls` in your example is
thus not allowed.) I consider this a non-issue.

@pcahyna  
in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#discussion\_r1521750947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#discussion_r1521750947)  
you wrote that  
"the get\_var\_from\_file function is meant to be generic"  
which was the reason that I suggested in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#discussion\_r1523283636](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#discussion_r1523283636)  
that "it fits perhaps better in lib/global-functions.sh"

When we have a generic get\_var\_from\_file function  
then it must work reasonably well for any file  
that can be sourced, in particular for a bash script.

Otherwise when we only want a function to get values  
from os-release then we must not have such a function  
as a generic function lib/global-functions.sh  
but preferably as it was before only a "local" function  
called explicitly get\_var\_from\_os\_release to make it clear  
that this function cannot be used generically  
to get a value from any file that can be sourced.

But why not have a generic get\_var\_from\_file function  
when it seems it can be implemented reasonably well,  
for example as I proposed in my last  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2019541083](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2019541083)

Or is there something severely wrong with my recent proposal?

I mean: It is certainly possible to make a bash script  
where my recent get\_var\_from\_file function fails  
but in "sufficiently normal" cases it seems to work OK

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

    # cat my-assignment 
    echo HELLO && VAR="$( echo -n "Today is $( date )" )"
    ls QQQ && VAR="qqq"
    if then

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" && echo OK || echo FAIL with $? ; declare -p myvar ; date
    ls: cannot access 'QQQ': No such file or directory
    my-assignment: line 3: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
    my-assignment: line 3: `if then'
    OK
    declare -- myvar="Today is Tue 26 Mar 2024 03:06:09 PM CET"
    Tue 26 Mar 2024 03:06:09 PM CET

For the fun of it:  
I even found a simple bash script where  
my recent get\_var\_from\_file function fails,  
something like:

    poweroff
    sleep 120
    VAR="value"

;-)

Depends on how "generic" we want it to have. We can define it as being
generic enough to be able to read files that have the same format as
os-release, i.e. variable assignments but no other shell commands. I
believe that files under `/etc/sysconfig` fall in this category.

My only problem with it is that we lose the ability to detect errors
when sourcing the file (including file not found or readable), compared
to the `source ... || exit 1` version.

It also fails for file not found or not readable

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file qqq VAR )" && echo OK || echo FAIL with $? ; declare -p myvar
    qqq: qqq: No such file or directory
    qqq: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1
    declare -- myvar=""

    # unset myvar ; myvar="$( get_var_from_file /etc/shadow VAR )" && echo OK || echo FAIL with $? ; declare -p myvar
    /etc/shadow: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
    /etc/shadow: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1
    declare -- myvar=""

but it always fails at 'set -u' because of "unbound variable".

As far as I see it is not possible to  
fail at 'source' for file not found or not readable  
but not fail at 'source' when the last command in file  
results non-zero exit code which is usually '1'

    $ source /etc/shadow || echo $?
    bash: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
    1

    $ source qqq || echo $?
    bash: qqq: No such file or directory
    1

    $ cat my-script
    grep qqq /etc/fstab

    $ source my-script || echo $?
    1

so we would have to add special checks  
for cases like file not found or not readable.

I think such specific checks are not needed  
because stderr shows the root cause why it failed  
regardless that actually it failed at 'set -u'.

Bottom line of what I mean is:

As far as I see

    function get_var_from_file() {
        bash -c 'source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1
    }

provides simple "all or nothing" return code behaviour:

Zero return code means the variable was set in the file and  
stdout is the value of the variable (could be empty or blank).

Non-zero return code in all other cases.

So get\_var\_from\_file can be used in a simple way like

    if my_var="$( get_var_from_file FILE_NAME VAR_NAME )" ; then
        # Code when VAR_NAME was set in FILE_NAME:
        ...
    else
        # Code when the value of VAR_NAME is unknown
        # (e.g. error handling code or fallback code):
        ...
    fi

For the fun of craziness:

My above described simple "all or nothing" return code behaviour  
does not hold in any case, in particular not for shell variables:

    # cat my-assignment
    VAR="value"
    BASH="my bash"
    BASHPID=99999999

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="my bash"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASHPID )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="6854"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH_COMMAND )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="echo \"\${!1}\""

but BASHPID cannot be set in my-assignment because it is readonly  
and BASH\_COMMAND was not set in my-assignment.

So for the fun of craziness I further enhanced it:

    # function get_var_from_file() { bash -c 'unset $1 || exit 1 ; source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1 ; }

This seems to even behave correctly - as far as I tested:

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment VAR )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="value"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    declare -- myvar="my bash"

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASHPID )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    my-assignment: line 0: unset: BASHPID: cannot unset: readonly variable
    FAIL with 1

    # unset myvar ; if myvar="$( get_var_from_file my-assignment BASH_COMMAND )" ; then declare -p myvar ; else echo FAIL with $? ; fi
    my-assignment: !1: unbound variable
    FAIL with 1

The idea behind to ensure the above described  
simple "all or nothing" return code behaviour  
is:

When VAR\_NAME cannot be unset before 'source FILE\_NAME'  
then VAR\_NAME cannot be (successfully) set in FILE\_NAME  
so get\_var\_from\_file must return non-zero return code.

@pcahyna @lzaoral  
when you agree that having a generic function

    function get_var_from_file() {
        bash -c 'unset $1 || exit 1 ; source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2" || return 1
    }

is useful in ReaR - in particular when you think  
the above implementation is reasonably correct,  
would it then help you with this pull request here  
when I make a pull request to add that function  
to lib/global-functions.sh so that this part  
can be excluded from this pull request?

And in case of issues with that function  
I am to "git blame" for it ;-)
