At many places scripts use $LOGFILE.

But LOGFILE can be specified by the user  
in user config files (e.g. local.conf) different  
to what usr/sbin/rear uses during runtime.

REAR\_LOGFILE is the one that is used while  
usr/sbin/rear runs.

First I will rename the meaningless REAR\_LOGFILE  
(what a surprise: that thingy belongs to ReaR! ;-)  
to RUNTIME\_LOGFILE to make its name tell  
what it actually is.

Then I will use RUNTIME\_LOGFILE in the scripts  
(except some exceptions where actually LOGFILE is meant).

and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1121](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1121)

it works again for me.
