As was discussed in issue \#150, there are reasons for influencing the
location of TMP\_DIR (or maybe even better the location of BUILD\_DIR).
However, beware that this is not trivial, especially when the location
is inside a world-writable directory. The question is, why use /tmp by
default now if we require root anyway ?
