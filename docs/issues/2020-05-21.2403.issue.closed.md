-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    ReaR never removes by itself temp folder and its content after
    successful backup.

<!-- -->

    Exiting rear mkbackup (PID 8392) and its descendant processes
    Running exit tasks
    You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.eh4lvdCjfVEOU5A

Are you sure that it never removes them? I changed the behavior in PR
\#2218 and this change is present in `rear-2.4-11.el7`. See
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1693608](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1693608)
.  
What should happen is that ReaR preserves those directories when run
interactively (from a terminal) and does not preserve them when run
non-interactively (like from cron).

@bobbysch

What is the exact command you are using to launch ReaR?

@gozora:  
rear -d -v mkbackup

@gozora good question! @bobbysch see the description of
KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR: "is automatically set to true in debug mode (-d) and
in debugscript mode (-D)." ( `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` )

@pcahyna  
I ran it interactively from a terminal.  
I also tried after your suggestion to run it using cron, the same
behavior still occurs.

@bobbysch to be on same site.  
Can you run `rear mkbackup` (without `-d` and `-v`) and check if
*/tmp/rear.\** is still kept?

Problem solved without -d debugging option (-v option can be used).  
Thanks a lot guys for your valuable time and contribution to this great
project.

That was misleading, sorry. It applies only when ReaR encounters an
error. When successful, it should not preserve the build directory.

Good job guys! I'm very impressed for the very short answers to my
question.
