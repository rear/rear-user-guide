### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently, ReaR only supports the reference implementation of `dbus`
since commit
<https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d82a9553cda33ad89053a00e801d157e0de080d9>.
Note that the commit message does not mention "why" is was actually
added because the "Fedora dbus service required for better debugging
systemd" rationale makes no sense to me.

Fedora 29+, RHEL 9+ and possibly other distributions have switched to
`dbus-broker` instead (a more-performant replacement for the reference
implementation) which ReaR does not support.

So far, I have not seen any issues with the restore on such systems,
with the exception of the following harmless (but rather annoying!) log
messages during the installation of GRUB2 on x64 BIOS and ppc64le
PowerVM machines:

### Describe the solution you'd like

I'd like to discuss whether we actually need `dbus` support in the ReaR
rescue environment. If not, I suggest to just remove everything
`dbus`-related from the repository. Otherwise, the support for
`dbus-broker` should be implemented.

@lzaoral  
a totally offhanded and untested question:  
`Installing GRUB2 boot loader...` happens in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
where 'grub\[2\]-install' is run within `chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT`  
so I am wondering if `Starting dbus.service` and the  
subsequent `Failed to start dbus.service` happens  
within the ReaR recovery system or  
within the restored target system?

@jsmeix Both, to be honest. `grub2-install` is executed in the restored
system using `chroot`. GRUB2 installer executes `os-prober` at some
point, which executes some other commands which subsequently trigger the
`dbus.socket` because `/run` is bind-mounted in that `chroot`.
Therefore, `systemd` in the recovery system will try to start the
`dbus.service` (which then fails on Fedora because `dbus-broker` is an
incompatible implementation).

I have experimented a bit with `dbus-monitor` and `os-prober` on a
regular Fedora 42 machine and it seems that the triggering messages are
just harmless signals from systemd about added/removed and (un)mounted
block devices. Mounting of various block devices is in implementation
detail of `os-prober`.

(@pcahyna, please, correct me if I'm wrong.)

@lzaoral  
thank you for your explanation.  
Now I understand that "it is complicated".
