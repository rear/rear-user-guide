Hi, I'm using BORG backup as a backend with REAR.  
Is there any way to display the progress when using REAR with BORG as a
backend?

If I just run "rear -v -d mkbackup"  
then the log file only lists the steps up until the point where the
actual transfer via borg happens. It would be nice to be able to see how
far a long the backup process is when using BORG.

I guess that I've suppresses Borg backup output, unfortunately I don't
remember the exact reason any more. (probably it messed up logs).

I'll take a look on this issue and let you know ...

@gozora  
because in backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh there is

<pre>
# Start actual Borg backup.
borg create --one-file-system --verbose --stats $BORGBACKUP_OPT_COMPRESSION \
$BORGBACKUP_OPT_REMOTE_PATH --exclude-from $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt \
$BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_REPO::\
${BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX}_$BORGBACKUP_SUFFIX \
${include_list[@]}
</pre>

I guess that the '--verbose' output is no longer visible  
since STDOUT is redirected into the log file, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398)

The general solution to show intended output  
on the user's terminal is described at  
"What to do with stdout and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

FYI:  
In general there should be no hardcoded '--verbose'.  
To run commands verbosely only in verbose mode  
(i.e. when ReaR was called with the '-v' option) use

<pre>
COMMAND $verbose
</pre>

or

<pre>
COMMAND $v
</pre>

because usr/sbin/rear sets $verbose and $v in verbose mode.

@gozora  
I guess the following 'borg' command calls  
may need to be enhanced:

In backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

<pre>
borg create --one-file-system --verbose ...
</pre>

In backup/BORG/default/800\_prune\_old\_backups.sh

<pre>
borg prune --verbose ...
</pre>

In restore/BORG/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh

<pre>
borg extract ...
</pre>

In prep/BORG/default/300\_init\_archive.sh

<pre>
borg init ...
</pre>

Hello @jsmeix,

Would approach like this be acceptable ?

    # Run Borg with verbose options (output to stdout)
    if [[ "$VERBOSE" ]]; then
        borg create --one-file-system --progress $verbose --stats \
    $BORGBACKUP_OPT_COMPRESSION $BORGBACKUP_OPT_REMOTE_PATH \
    --exclude-from $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt \
    $BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_REPO::\
    ${BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX}_$BORGBACKUP_SUFFIX \
    ${include_list[@]} 1>&7 2>&8
    else
    # Run Borg silently (just output to logfile)
        borg create --one-file-system --stats $BORGBACKUP_OPT_COMPRESSION \
    $BORGBACKUP_OPT_REMOTE_PATH --exclude-from $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt \
    $BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_REPO::\
    ${BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX}_$BORGBACKUP_SUFFIX \
    ${include_list[@]}
    fi

The functionality we are looking for is `--progress` and I've did not
used it because it outputs in pretty way to terminal (just updates last
line of terminal) but it messes up logfile pretty badly.

@gozora  
I would not repeat the whole complicated 'borg' command  
because it makes it hard to see what the difference is.

I would only define the relevant options as variables  
and leave them empty if not needed, something like:

<pre>
local borg_progress=''
# Only in ReaR verbose mode also show borg progress output:
test "$verbose" && borg_progress='--progress'
# Have STDIN and STDOUT on the user's terminal
# (perhaps borg asks for user confirmation via STDOUT)
# but keep STDERR in the ReaR log file:
borg create $verbose $borg_progress --one-file-system ... 0<&6 1>&7
</pre>

If borg might ask the user via messages on STDERR  
(many programs do it this way - e.g. the 'read' bash builtin)  
you would have to call it as

<pre>
borg ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

to also get STDERR on the user's termial.

To be on the safe side also redirect STDIN to the  
user's terminal because in special cases we may have  
to redirect it to "something weird" in the future, cf.

Hello @jsmeix,

if you run Borg command they always do some output e.g.:

    #borg create ...

This would mean a unwanted output when running plain `rear mkbackup`

What about something like this, where repeating command if omitted and
things stays separated:

    # Only in ReaR verbose mode also show borg progress output:
    test "$verbose" && borg_progress='--progress'

    local borg_command="borg create --one-file-system $borg_progress $verbose
    --stats $BORGBACKUP_OPT_COMPRESSION $BORGBACKUP_OPT_REMOTE_PATH \
    --exclude-from $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt \
    $BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_REPO::\
    ${BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX}_$BORGBACKUP_SUFFIX \
    ${include_list[@]}"

    if [[ $verbose ]]; then
        $borg_command 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
    else
        $borg_command
    fi

@jsmeix ignore my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1588\#issuecomment-346110754](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1588#issuecomment-346110754)
as it is simply not true. The Borg output can be silenced by removing
`--stats` option.  
So I guess we can patch this as you proposed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1588\#issuecomment-346102893](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1588#issuecomment-346102893).

@gozora  
I am sorry I did my above comments in a hurry  
so I probably caused more confusion than being helpful  
but - as always - sleeping over it helped to clear my mind:

I am not a borg user so that I cannot tell what the right way  
is when calling borg commands.

Regarding '--stats' you may still show that but only in verbose mode  
or perhaps even only in debug mode (implement it as you like)  
e.g. via

<pre>
local borg_stats=''
test "$DEBUG" && borg_stats='--stats'
...
borg create $verbose $borg_stats ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

In general when calling commands in ReaR the crucial point  
is whether or not a command is or could be interactive.

When a command is or could be somehow interactive  
(also progress output is "somehow interactive")  
it should usually be called as

<pre>
COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

to ensure any command output will be visible by the user  
and the command can get input from the user.

Examples:

The bash builtin 'read' gets input from STDIN,  
echoes the input probably via STDOUT (or directly to the terminal?)  
and shows its prompt via STDERR so that it must be called like

<pre>
read -p 'enter your input ' user_input 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

The command 'rm -v -I' only prompts when removing more  
than three files and then its prompt is shown on STDERR  
(but also error messages are shown on STDERR)  
and its verbose output is shown via SDTOUT  
so that it can be called like

<pre>
rm -v -I $files 0<&6 1>&2 2>&8
</pre>

to get only its verbose output in the ReaR log file  
but error messages are shown to the user  
or more consistent and therefore probably better

<pre>
rm -v -I $files 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

that simply and consistently shows all output to the user.

From the last example I conclude that in general  
when a command is or could be interactive  
it should usually be called as

<pre>
COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

to ensure the command behaves consistently to the user.

I think in case of doubt it is more important  
that ReaR behaves consistently to the user  
than having everything in the ReaR log.

When a command is called as

<pre>
COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

it is still possible to have something meaningful in the log like

<pre>
if COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8 ; then
    Log "COMMAND finished with zero exit code"
else
    Log "COMMAND finished with non-zero exit code $?"
fi
</pre>

Optionally only FYI you may have a look at  
backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
what advanced code there is implemented only  
to show some progress information to the user  
while the 'tar' backup command is running.  
It runs the 'tar' backup command in a sub-process  
while the parent bash polls the backuparchive file size  
that gets shown to the user.
