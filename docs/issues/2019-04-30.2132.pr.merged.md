-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

When using the NetBackup method, the files in the logs directory are
excluded because they are useless. However, if, for some reason
`/usr/openv/netbackup/logs` is a symlink to some other directory (a user
customization), then ReaR will fail to create the ISO, due to having a
skeleton directory for NBU in ReaR, causing the 'tar | untar' of
`COPY_AS_IS` items to fail.

Hello @rear/contributors , this issue was encountered by a Red Hat
customer due to him having moved the netbackup log directory to some
other place.  
I found out this issue is in fact wider and may affect other components
as well, even though it is quite unlikely to happen in normal
situations.  
For example, using the following configuration file and scenario, the
ISO creation will die:

-   Configuration file

        COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/scripts )

-   Scenario

        # ln -s /var/log /etc/scripts
        # rear mkrescue

-   Output

        tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
        tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
        tar: etc/scripts: Cannot open: File exists
        tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

@gdha  
should we have that in ReaR 2.5?  
I would say yes.

@rmetrich Feel free to merge it as I just approved the PR (and @jsmeix
did the same). It may be included in the 2.5 release
