#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

I try to recover a dell bare metal (OS: RHEL 7.8) by rear backup that i
did  
When i lanch the command "rear recover" it gives me this error:

/bin/rear: /sbin/id : /sbin/ksh: bas interpreter: No such file or
directory  
ERROR: Relax and recover needs 'root' priveleges (effective user ID is
not 0)

and i'am logged with root user

Thank you for your help with this

ReaR requires real bash, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2307\#issuecomment-577591217](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2307#issuecomment-577591217)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2322](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2322)

The interesting part of this issue here is how it could happen  
that there is no true bash in the ReaR recovery system?

Maybe a symbolic link (/bin/bash -&gt; /sbin/ksh) ?

`/bin/sh` can be a POSIX shell or a symbolic link to a POSIX shell  
but `/bin/bash` must be a real bash (or perhaps a symbolic link to a
real bash)  
because otherwise `#!/bin/bash` would not run a script with bash.

Thank you so much for have taken the time to answer me

Actually i found that this came from the bin/id script  
On the server beside the /sbin/id, i have another sbin/id that it used
for another purpose under another directory  
So i guess that rear when it build the backup instead of taking the
/sbin/id of the system it take the last one /DIRECTORY/sbin/id, and this
last id file doesn't contain usual binary like /sbin/id  
even when i exclude the /DIRECTORY/sbin/id from backup, he still use the
same "id" the wrong one  
How could i do that rear take the usual id of Redhat OS uder /sbin/id
and not the customized one under /DIRECTORY/sbin/id ?

Thank you for your help

How programs get copied into the ReaR recovery system  
in this case for the example `id`:

usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf contains (excerpt)

    PROGS+=(
    ...
    id
    ...
    )

which gets evaluated in  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh via
(excerpt)

    local all_binaries=( $( for bin in "${PROGS[@]}" "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" ; do
                                bin_path="$( get_path "$bin" )"
                                if test -x "$bin_path" ; then
                                    echo $bin_path

where `get_path` is in usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

    # Get the name of the disk file that would be executed.
    # In contrast to "type -p" that returns nothing for an alias, builtin, or function,
    # "type -P" forces a PATH search for each NAME, even if it is an alias, builtin,
    # or function, and returns the name of the disk file that would be executed
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729
    function get_path () {
        type -P $1
    }

so what you get in the recovery system for `id` is  
what `type -P id` results on your system, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729\#issuecomment-161659010](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729#issuecomment-161659010)  
for the reasoning behind.

So when you change your system so that `type -P id` results  
a special `id` binary when root calls `type -P id` then this special
binary  
that is your intended one when root calls `id` will also be used in your
recovery system.  
This way your recovery system should be consistent with what you have
set up  
for the user root on your original system.

@rearuser  
it seems you mix up different things:  
The ReaR recovery system versus the backup of your files.  
Both are two different and separated things, cf.

Hello,

Thank you for your feedback  
Actually, i find a workaround by changing the $PATH of my environnement
to not using the custome bin (/DIRECTORY/sbin), so that type -P get the
right path for id binary  
i will do a little script to export the PATH variable by deleting the
(/DIRECTORY/sbin) and keeping only the
"/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:" before lanching the
"rear mkbackup"

Thank you for your explanation and help on this topic

Only as a side note FYI:  
If you changed $PATH for 'root' so that 'root' runs special programs  
you probably have messed up how things behave for 'root' by default  
and as a consequence arbitrary weird issues appear for 'root'.

If an exceptional program should be run that program needs to be
called  
with its full path so the special program only runs when actually
intended.

FWIW some other scaring examples of same kind:

We at ReaR had noticed that some third party software had set up  
some LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH by default so that all programs used then  
the special libraries versions of that third party software which
caused  
in particular some "interesting effects" for ReaR.

Others had added "foreign" libraries directories to /etc/ld.so.conf  
with same kind of "interesting effects" for all normal programs.

We at ReaR had also noticed that some third party software had set up  
some special udev rule that changed device names (I think it was the
names  
of symbolic links to certain kernel devices) so that other programs  
did no longer find the devices via the usually expected link names  
which also caused "interesting effects" in particular for ReaR.
