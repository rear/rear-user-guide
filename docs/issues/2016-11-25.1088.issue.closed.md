Only a totally untested idea off the top of my head  
how to get support for "Multiple Backup Methods"  
implemented as some kind of pure add-on so that  
all the existing code for single backup method  
could still work as before (i.e. I really want to avoid  
to do major changes in existing code):

The idea is based on the assumption that  
a "rear mkbackup" run can be splitted into  
a "rear mkrescue" run plus a "rear mkbackuponly" run  
and that the result is still the same.

If that is true (or can be made true with reasonable effort)  
support for "Multiple Backup Methods" could be simply  
an initial "rear mkrescue" run plus a sequence of  
subseqent "rear mkbackuponly BACKUP\_METHOD" runs  
where the BACKUP\_METHOD option specifies what  
backup method has to be run.

The configuration values for "Multiple Backup Methods" could  
then be simply additional /etc/rear/BACKUP\_METHOD.conf files  
that are read for each "rear mkbackuponly BACKUP\_METHOD" run  
after the usual config files were read so that the values in a  
/etc/rear/BACKUP\_METHOD.conf file overwrite values regarding  
the backup in a global config file like /etc/rear/local.conf.

This way support for "Multiple Different Backup Methods" should  
be possible but I even can imagine that it is hopefully not too  
hard to also support "Multiple Same Backup Methods" in an  
analogous way.

But all that depends on whether or not "rear mkbackup"  
can be replaced by "rear mkrescue" plus "rear mkbackuponly".

Reading `rear --help` I've found option *-c DIR*.  
If I got your idea right, same would be archived with having multiple
of:

    rear -c /etc/rear/BACKUP_METHOD1 mkbackup
    rear -c /etc/rear/BACKUP_METHOD2 mkbackup
    rear -c /etc/rear/BACKUP_METHOD3 mkbackup

in crontab, or?

Wih "-c DIR" one gets an "alternative config directory; instead of
/etc/rear"  
which should also work but then one needs to manually maintain
multiple  
whole local.conf files in each of the alternative config dirs.

My proposal means that all can use one same base /etc/rear/local.conf  
but on top of that an additional /etc/rear/FOO.conf is sourced so that  
the values in FOO.conf could overwrite (if needed) values in local.conf.

Basically I mean a different command line option, something like

<pre>
  -a file
    additionally source file after the usual config files had been sourced
    but before any script is sourced
</pre>

By the way:

Another possible advantage of "Multiple Backup Methods"  
when it can be done as described above is that then  
multiple backups could run in parallel, i.e. basically like

<pre>
rear mkrescue ; rear -a backup1 mkbackuponly & rear -a backup2 mkbackuponly & ...
</pre>

For example think about a multiple-core machine  
with tons of main memory and several disks  
e.g. sda for the system and sdb for /home and sdc for a database  
where multiple independent backups could run in parallel.

Of course multiple backups require  
the counterpart for the restore, cf.

I got your idea now. Despite I dont like idea of overriding config files
(can be quite messy), it is a good start.

Sounds like HANA :-)

I need overriding config files because of backward compatibility  
and to keep the code simple (there is no support for arrays  
of arrays in bash and even if that was supported, I would  
try to avoid it because it would be a nightmare for the user  
to specify such config structures correctly).

With overriding values by a subsequent config file  
one can have e.g. in /etc/rear/backup1

<pre>
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://server1/systembackup
</pre>

and in /etc/rear/backup2

<pre>
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://server2/homebackup
</pre>

and in /etc/rear/backup3

<pre>
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://server3/databasebackup
</pre>

and - if my above assumptions are right - then

<pre>
rear mkrescue ; rear -a backup1 mkbackuponly & rear -a backup2 mkbackuponly & rear -a backup3 mkbackuponly
</pre>

should (hopefully) "just do the right thing".

Simply put:  
"Multiple Backup Methods" could be "Backups on Steroids" ;-)

Seriously:  
If "Multiple Parallel Backups and Restores"  
would be possible, it could be a major boost for ReaR.  
ReaR is know to be fast but then it could be made  
baically theoretically unlimited fast - in practice  
only limited by what the hardware can do.

The possible advantages are so compelling  
that I will try to get it implemented for ReaR 2.0  
at least in an initially basically working way  
(or I learn it is not possible with reasonable effort).

Definetely! Then we can have NTFS with Windows deployment in ReaR 3.0

Of course you meant  
"Parallel Deployments of Multiple Systems"  
...  
hmmmm...  
...  
perhaps not a real bad idea.  
Think about hundreds of virtual machines on one host.  
Way cool to restore all the virtual disk images in parallel...

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1090](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1090)  
I use the new option '-C' to source additional  
config files because according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-263013427](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-263013427)  
those additional files are sourced after the usual config files  
had been sourced but before any script is sourced which  
means those files behave as additional config files so that  
the option name '-C' matches better the main purpose  
(regardless that in ReaR any file is a bash script).

Hi,

Sorry but I'm quite confused last days viewing lots of messages about
add multiple backup methods, NTFS,... to ReaR.

In a previous discussion \#769 we were talking about moving out external
backup methods from ReaR to maintain stability and use a separate
package to provide those external backup methods, and now seems a 180º
turn.

Those thoughts are gone? because seems adding more and more extra stuff
to ReaR instead of moving out from main package, what was discussed
previously.

I just want to clarify my thoughts :P

Regards,

@didacog  
extracting the backup functionality from ReaR  
into a separate open source project is a different  
(strictly speaking unrelated) issue, cf. in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769\#issuecomment-183331359](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769#issuecomment-183331359)

As long as extracting the backup functionality is not decided  
the scripts that provide the backup functionality stay in ReaR.  
I assume for ReaR 2.0 it will not be extracted because  
we do not have a clear and stable interface between  
ReaR and the backup software, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769\#issuecomment-183370695](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769#issuecomment-183370695)

Currently I am implementing support for multiple backups  
in ReaR and right now I did my very initial simple first  
succesful recovery with two backups using the same  
backup method (NETFS and 'tar').

As expected there are several unexpected things  
but up to now I could solve all of them reletively easily  
so that currently it looks really promising.

For a very basic and initial way how recovery with two backups  
using same backup method (NETFS and 'tar') worked for me, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091\#issuecomment-263621714](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091#issuecomment-263621714)

For initial usage with different backup methods  
one needs to get all the binaries and other needed files  
of all used backup methods into the recovery system  
during the initial "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" run.  
I think for now one can do that maually via  
REQUIRED\_PROGS and COPY\_AS\_IS  
in /etc/rear/local.conf - later this should happen  
somehow automatically...

With

together with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1090](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1090)  
there is now a first initial (and actually usable) implementation  
for multiple backups of same backup type.

E.g. several 'tar' backups via NETFS  
which is currently the only kind that I have used.

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091\#issuecomment-263621714](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091#issuecomment-263621714)

@gozora  
I count on you to try it out with two different backup methods like  
a 'tar' backup via NETFS for the basic system plus an additional  
backup via BACKUP=BORG e.g. for things like /home/\*

In particular I would be interested regarding what I wrote above in

For Borg I would assume that something like

REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" borg locale )
</pre>

is needed in the config file that is used while  
"rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue" is run to get all  
what Borg needs for restore into the recovery system.

Hello @jsmeix,

I'll definitely going to test it! (not sure if I can make it today ...)

Copy of base progs needed for Borg is done in
*usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/200\_prep\_borg.sh*

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" "${PROGS_BORG[@]}" borg locale )

So to my understanding not explicit action is necessary.

I know about prep/BORG/default/200\_prep\_borg.sh  
(this is wherefrom I made my REQUIRED\_PROGS proposal)  
but I think you misunderstand because you cannot have  
both BACKUP=NETFS and BACKUP=BORG in the  
config file that is used for "mkbackup/mkrescue"  
(i.e. when the recovery system ISO gets created).

E.g. for a 'tar' backup via NETFS for the basic system plus  
an additional backup via BACKUP=BORG e.g. for /home/\*  
you would use BACKUP=NETFS and all what the  
'tar' backup via NETFS needs in one config file  
that is used for "mkbackup/mkrescue"  
(i.e. when the recovery system ISO gets created)  
and you would use BACKUP=BORG and all what the  
Borg backup needs in another config file  
that is used for "mkbackuponly"  
(i.e. when only the additional backup gets created), cf. in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091\#issuecomment-263621714](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091#issuecomment-263621714)  
my local.conf plus base.conf versus rest.conf and how I used them

<pre>
rear -C base -d -D mkbackup
rear -C rest -d -D mkbackuponly
...
rear -C base -d -D recover
rear -C rest -d -D restoreonly
</pre>

In your case I think you need in base.conf (whatever you call it)

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" borg locale )
</pre>

to get all what Borg needs for restore into the recovery system.

FYI:

My next step is to automate the rear calls as in

<pre>
rear -C base -d -D mkbackup
rear -C rest -d -D mkbackuponly
...
rear -C base -d -D recover
rear -C rest -d -D restoreonly
</pre>

with a new config array variable in local.conf like

<pre>
MULTIPLE_BACKUPS=( base rest )
</pre>

so that one single call of

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

actually runs the equivalent of

<pre>
rear -C base -d -D mkbackup && rear -C rest -d -D mkbackuponly
</pre>

and one single call of

<pre>
rear -d -D recover
</pre>

actually runs the equivalent of

<pre>
rear -C base -d -D recover && rear -C rest -d -D restoreonly
</pre>

My private top secret future plan:  
Something like

<pre>
MULTIPLE_BACKUPS=( first second& third& )
</pre>

should run first

<pre>
rear C first mkbackup
</pre>

and afterwards the two mkbackuponly in parallel like

<pre>
rear -C second mkbackuponly &
rear -C third mkbackuponly &
</pre>

and analogous behaviour for "rear recover".  
I.e. backup and restore on speed ;-)

multiple backups work sufficiently well  
and when there are no serious regressions,  
i.e. when it can be considered to be somewhat stable  
so that it is unlikely that I need to do incompatible changes  
how multiple backups work.

Currently there is intentionally nothing documented  
so that nothing is officially announced for the users  
and we can freely change as we like how multiple  
backups work until it works sufficiently o.k. for us.

I am playing around with the current implementation  
and I had already some interesting "effects" - i.e. I am  
learning how it actually behaves in practice - which is  
probably helpful to write usable documentation ;-)

My very first experiments with manually running  
two "rear mkbackupoly" and two "rear restoreonly"  
in parallel worked in principle.  
I did only this changes:  
In usr/sbin/rear I added a test  
for REAR\_ALLOW\_RUNNING\_IN\_PARALLEL

<pre>
# LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS can run simultaneously with another instance by using a LOGFILE.lockless:
if IsInArray "$WORKFLOW" "${LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS[@]}" ; then
    LOGFILE="$LOGFILE.lockless"
else
  if ! test "$REAR_ALLOW_RUNNING_IN_PARALLEL" ; then
    # When this currently running instance is not one of the LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS
    # then it cannot run simultaneously with another instance
    # in this case pidof is needed to test what running instances there are:
    if ! has_binary pidof ; then
        echo "ERROR: Required program 'pidof' missing, please check your PATH" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    # For unknown reasons '-o %PPID' does not work for pidof at least in SLES11
    # so that a manual test is done to find out if another pid != $$ is running:
    for pid in $( pidof -x "$SCRIPT_FILE" ) ; do
        if test "$pid" != $$ ; then
            echo "ERROR: $PROGRAM is already running, not starting again" >&2
            exit 1
        fi
    done
  fi
fi
</pre>

and in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
I added current PID ($$) to the LOGFILE name

<pre>
LOGFILE="$LOG_DIR/rear-$HOSTNAME-$$.log"
</pre>

and then it works

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -C base -d -D mkbackup
# export REAR_ALLOW_RUNNING_IN_PARALLEL="yes"
# usr/sbin/rear -C rootbackup -d -D mkbackuponly &
# usr/sbin/rear -C homebackup -d -D mkbackuponly &
</pre>

But it seems not to make a real difference because  
on a virtual machine with even 2 CPUs and 2 GiB memory  
each two backup and restore 'tar' processes seem to run  
not simultaneously but one after the other :-(

Just finished "Multi-backup" backup/restore with NETFS + BORG, with
overall result: SUCCESS!

Must admit that configuration was a bit tricky, but as sysadmin I really
want to scarify my comfort for this.  
When talking about "tricky" part, all I have on my mind is that you must
know what configuration option to put in which config (as discussed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-263861320](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-263861320)
), but I believe that this will get better over time.

In my humble opinion, this feature adds another, very useful dimension
to ReaR possibilities.

Good job @jsmeix !

If there is someone curious, here are sample configs I've used for NETFS
+ BORG backup/restore:

    root@mate:/etc/rear# cat base_os.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://beta.virtual.sk/mnt/rear/iso
    GRUB_RESCUE=n
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" borg locale )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" "/root/borg_keys" )

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://beta.virtual.sk/mnt/rear
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/media/*' '/home' )

    root@mate:/etc/rear# cat home.conf 
    MANUAL_INCLUDE=YES
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home' )

    ### Borg stuff ###
    BACKUP=BORG
    BORGBACKUP_HOST="beta.virtual.sk"
    BORGBACKUP_USERNAME="root"
    BORGBACKUP_REPO="/mnt/rear/borg/${HOSTNAME}"
    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_HOURLY=5
    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_WEEKLY=2
    BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION="zlib,9"

    ## Borg repository encryption
    BORGBACKUP_ENC_TYPE="keyfile"
    export BORG_KEYS_DIR="/root/borg_keys"
    export BORG_PASSPHRASE="S3cr37_P455w0rD"

    ## Borg behavior
    export BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="yes"
    export BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="yes"
    export BORG_REMOTE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/borg"

Then for backup:

    root@mate:/# rear -C base_os mkbackup
    root@mate:/# rear -C home mkbackuponly

And restore:

    RESCUE mate:~ # rear -C base_os recover
    RESCUE mate:~ # rear -C home restoreonly

@gozora @jsmeix indeed an excellent job done by you both! Now that you
have the experience in configuration why not write it down on our
relax-and-recover web pages? The web pages are also in GitHub so that
would be easy to extend, if you wish of course. Otherwise, it will be a
dead functionality if nobody knows about it (or when it is too complex
to get it right).

@gozora  
many thanks for your testing  
and your enlightening feedback.

In particular I learned that MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES  
works when used with "mkbackuponly" because in this case  
it does not matter that MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES  
disables all entries in disklayout.conf (at least for me it does)  
so that one cannot (at least I cannot) use MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES  
with "mkbackup" (or "mkrescue"), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019\#issuecomment-251348729](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019#issuecomment-251348729)

Therefore I invented BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE  
so that I do not have to use MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES  
and - by the way - I invented also its logical counterpart  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE which could be useful to get things  
in the backup that are not intended to be restored (i.e. have  
the content of EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS in the backup)  
because I think in general a backup should be complete  
(i.e. basically it should contain all regular files - except tmp
files)  
regardless what exactly is actually needed to be restored,  
see also BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES  
in default.conf.

@gdha  
don't worry regarding documentation  
but also don't hurry ;-)

I will properly document multiple backups.

I think as long as I am actively working on it I will not  
forget details.

But as long as multiple backups is under development  
I do intentionally not document it as I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-263894804](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-263894804)

Multiple backups will be documented in time  
before the ReaR 1-20 release.

I have even more good news today:

Regarding

<pre>
... manually running two "rear mkbackupoly" ... in parallel ...
... seems not to make a real difference ...
... 'tar' processes seem to run not simultaneously ...
</pre>

I only misinterpreted ReaR's output messages  
which is the result of ReaR's current logging that is  
not prepared for multiple simultaneous rear runs  
together with mixing up progress subsystem messages  
that is also not prepared for multiple simultaneous rear runs.

Actually things do run well in parallel.

With some quick-and-dirty experimantal logging enhancements  
and progress subsystem changes (mainly showing messages  
with a leading PID and let the progress subsystem output each  
message on a separated line which effectively disables the intent  
of the progress subsystem, cf. lib/progresssubsystem.nosh)  
one can nicely see how things "just work" even in parallel:

And for "restoreonly" in parallel the only thing  
that gets in the way is when  
usr/share/rear/restore/default/995\_remount\_sync.sh

Quick and dirty disabling

makes running two "restoreonly" in parallel "just work".

I don't know what it is now  
but I have a dim feeling what it will be in the future ;-)

FYI:  
One cannot run "recover" in parallel with "restoreonly"  
because first the basic system with all the mountpoints  
below /mnt/local must be there.  
Afterwards one can run multiple "restoreonly" in parallel.

Tomorrow I will test with bigger additional backups  
to get some time data how much running multiple  
"restoreonly" in parallel actually makes it faster  
(on sufficiently powerful hardware).

I've adapted my config:

    root@mate:~# diff /etc/rear/home.conf.old /etc/rear/home.conf
    1c1
    < MANUAL_INCLUDE=YES
    ---
    > BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE=YES

And I can confirm that *BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE* works perfectly fine with
Borg.

@jsmeix  
for sure, extracting the backup functionality is not decided yet. Maybe
never becomes it that way, but as we started that discussion, could be
possible and well, seems that those are features could break backwards
compatibility and could make things harder to "extract backup
functionality" if will happen in some future.  
Just were some thoughts about my impressions on those features appearing
last days in relation with \#769. Nothing else.

@didacog  
if "extracting the backup functionality" ever happens  
my current understanding what that means is basically  
a simple move of the scripts that implement the actual  
backup and restore into a separated project but I would  
insist on that the underlying framework that ReaR can  
call external tools for backup and restore must be kept  
in ReaR and what I implemented in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1090](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1090)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091)  
are primarily enhancements of that framework.  
The only real backup scripts that I enhanced  
was to make NETFS 'tar' support the new  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
flags.

@didacog  
what I would like to see from you is that you test the  
current multiple backup implementation in ReaR  
with your preferred backup method and that you enhance  
your preferred backup method as needed to work well for  
multiple backups.  
In particular it must be possible that the user can specify  
exactly what he wants to have in the backup and what not  
for your backup method (e.g. via support for things like
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
or something similar as appropriate for your backup method).

@jsmeix  
Of course we will test multiple backup as fast as we can have time after
completing DRLM roadmap for 2.1.0 version.

I may have some thoughts about using it, but well, maybe could be better
to talk about this after testing and knowing better how it works. maybe
at FOSDEM'17 we'll have time to talk about it. ;)

Please do not misunderstand me when I talk about my doubts on new
features, the idea was just to clarify my thoughts, nothing else.  
Writing is harder to tint the words than talking about them face to
face. :P

I look forward to seeing you at FOSDEM 2017 and  
I do appreciate your thoughts and your doubts  
because if all just blindly applaud "hooray" for  
anything I do, I would do very lot of nonsense.

with bigger backups 1 GB urandom.data in /root/ and in /home/

<pre>
# cat /dev/urandom | head -c 1G >/home/urandom.data
# cat /dev/urandom | head -c 1G >/root/urandom.data

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.0G Dec  2 14:29 /root/urandom.data
</pre>

that result  
1.2G backup-homebackup.tar.gz  
and  
1.4G backup-rootbackup.tar.gz  
(how evil from me to torture 'tar' with random data ;-)

My timing results for two sequential mkbackuponly  
versus running them in parallel:

<pre>
# date +%s ; usr/sbin/rear -C rootbackup -d -D mkbackuponly ; usr/sbin/rear -C homebackup -d -D mkbackuponly ; date +%s
1480687026
...
1480687139

# date +%s ; usr/sbin/rear -C rootbackup -d -D mkbackuponly & usr/sbin/rear -C homebackup -d -D mkbackuponly & wait ; date +%s
1480687162
...
1480687265
</pre>

113 seconds for two sequential mkbackuponly  
versus  
103 seconds for two mkbackuponly in parallel

This is an unexpected good result because during  
single mkbackuponly run my "virt-manager" shows  
permanent 100% CPU usage when only one 'tar' runs  
so that I would not have expected any speed gain  
when running two of them in parallel.  
But even on that weak machine running in parallel  
gets the whole job done about 10% faster!

FYI:  
I did run those tests several times to be safe against  
random results - i.e. I can reproduce my timing results.  
I have even worse examples: 115 seconds for sequential  
versus 101 seconds for parallel.

Any kind of "nice to use simple automatisms"

@gozora  
I have a request:

In my current documentation for multiple backups  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
I describe in particular  
"Relax-and-Recover Setup for Different Backup Methods"  
using NETFS/'tar' and Borg which is based on your above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-264009984](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-264009984)

To be on the safe side I would very much appreciate it  
if you could test if it actually works what I describe there.

Optionally - if possible - even together with  
"Running Multiple Backups and Restores in Parallel"

@jsmeix  
Remarks from my quick tests:

-   `BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX="backup-${this_file_name%.*}"` can be
    used only if it expands to alphanumeric values only, hence config
    filenames like backup\_home.conf will not be accepted.
-   if ReaR fails it reports: "Aborting due to an error, check
    /var/log/rear/rear-mate.log", this looks to be wrong since e.g.
    "rear-mate.1084.log" was in use.

Unfortunately I don't have more time for tests today :-(. I'll try to
continue tomorrow.

Guess wherefrom I got that value ;-)

I like to mention BORGBACKUP\_ARCHIVE\_PREFIX  
because it matches the BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE  
that I use for NETFS/tar because for multiple NETFS/tar  
backups one must explicitly specify different  
BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE values in the  
different config files.

I assume when one does multiple Borg backups  
it is also required to explicitly specify different  
BORGBACKUP\_ARCHIVE\_PREFIX values  
in the different config files?

Perhaps you could try out if multiple Borg backups work?

As far as I remember Borg does not support multiple writes to single
archive. (It was not even possible to mount archive while backup was
running).  
I could however try writing to two separate archives ... In any case
BORGBACKUP\_ARCHIVE\_PREFIX can be omitted (I think ;-) )

Hello @jsmeix  
One other remark regarding docu. There is a slight problem with:

    rear -C basic_system mkbackup
    rear -C home_backup mkbackuponly

The thing is, that if you run `rear -C basic_system mkbackup` for the
very first time */borg/keys* will be empty. (as Borg creates encryption
keys during repository initialization). This means that ReaR
rescue/recover system will have not encryption keys available.  
This can be corrected by successive executing of
`rear -C basic_system mkrescue` or running
`rear -C home_backup mkbackuponly` before
`rear -C basic_system mkbackup`

So I'd correct docu as follows:

-   Option 1

<!-- -->

    rear -C home_backup mkbackuponly
    rear -C basic_system mkbackup

-   Option 2

<!-- -->

    rear -C basic_system mkbackup
    rear -C home_backup mkbackuponly
    rear -C basic_system mkrescue

Hello @jsmeix ,

Maybe one more similar to:

> if ReaR fails it reports: "Aborting due to an error, check
> /var/log/rear/rear-mate.log", this looks to be wrong since e.g.
> "rear-mate.1084.log" was in use.

Once I was booted in ReaR restore/recover media, and run
`rear -C base_or recover` and encounter failure, I had that menu with
choices displayed (sorry I don't know how it is called and how it looks
;-), but I'm sure you will know what I'm talking about)

    rear failed to recover 
    1) edit something
    2) edit that thing
    3) ....
    4) show log /var/log/rear/...
    5) Abort
    ...

Once I choose **4** I got error */var/log/rear/...* does not exist ...

If you can't locate where could be the problem I can try to reproduce
today evening ...

Yes - one of many such cases.

The whole logging in ReaR is currently an overcomplicated mess.  
At some later time I will clean that up.

But for the next ReaR 2.0 I will try to deal with the current mess.

I think I need to replace bacically everywhere  
$LOGFILE by $REAR\_LOGFILE

$REAR\_LOGFILE is the one that is used while rear runs  
while $LOGFILE can be specified different by the user  
to be used as final name for the log file.

I think I will rename the meaningless REAR\_LOGFILE  
(what a surprise: that thingy belongs to ReaR! ;-)  
to RUNTIME\_LOGFILE to make its name tell  
what it actually is.

I submitted  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1119](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1119)  
to fix that.

I have not yet tested it but I have the dim feeling that  
currently multiple backups will horribly fail with  
BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP\_TYPE=differential  
because those use hardcoded fixed backup archive names,  
cf. prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh

[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/032203812ce85fed8f8745a902824811662163b7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/032203812ce85fed8f8745a902824811662163b7)  
documents that multiple backups are in general not supported for  
BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP\_TYPE=differential

I think one can use incremental or differential backups  
for one single part of the multiple backups (e.g. for the  
backup of the basic system) but what will fail is  
using multiple incremental or differential backups.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-266404883](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-266404883)  
where "rear recover" fails with some kind of menue that contains  
"View Relax-and-Recover log":  
I have tested it with current GitHub master code  
and now it works for me.

For the fun of it:  
My main testing problem was to make "rear recover" fail in the  
right way so that I get that "View Relax-and-Recover log".  
I.e. for me "rear recover" works too good ;-)

Thanks, I'll check that during my next restore failure.  
For me it is not that hard to make ReaR fail during restore :-)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1116](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1116)  
fixed by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1129](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1129)  
there are currently no issues left regarding multiple backups  
according to how currently multiple backups is documented  
to work in doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc  
so that I close this issue now because  
from my current point of view multiple backups  
should now work sufficiently to be released in ReaR 2.0.

For further issues with multiple backups  
please report them as separated GitHub issues.

@gozora  
again many thanks for all your valuable help and work!
