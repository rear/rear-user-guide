-   Brief description of the issue  
    If you want to boot SLES11 SP4 ppc64 to an lpar on IBM 9119-MME
    (P8 880) with firmware&gt; = 840 via a TFTP server (NIM), the initrd
    must be less than or equal to 32 MB (with yaboot). Unfortunately, a
    standard HANA on Power (with SLES HA ) installation is larger than
    32 MB.

-   Work-around, if any  
    The solution to the problem of switching from cpio/gzip to
    cpio/xz-lzma. This reduces the generated initrd by approximately 13
    MB. With gzip, the initrd is 34.1 MB with xz and lzma 21.4 MB. For
    this purpose the file 900\_create\_initramfs.sh in
    /usr/share/rear/pack and the File 800\_copy\_to\_tftp.sh in
    /usr/share/rear/output/ must be adapted.

@abbahag  
many thanks for your descriptive issue report  
and your problem analysis plus a solution!

Regarding switching from cpio/gzip to cpio/xz-lzma  
we need to check if cpio/xz-lzma is supported on  
all platforms (even older ones) where ReaR runs,  
cf. "Maintain backward compatibility" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Next Monday I will have a closer look.

For now:  
Happy New Year!

Not for the right now upcoming ReaR 2.0 but after that.

Could it be specified via a VARIABLE OPTION in /etc/local.conf ?
(INITRD\_CPIO\_COMPRESSION)  
Default could stay unchanged "cpio/gzip", but we could change it to
"cpio/xz-lzma" (if available)  
The idea is similar to BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS or
BORGBACKUP\_COMPRESSION options.

I think your suggestion is the more elegant and more flexible. It
should  
be implemented via the local.conf.

@schabrolles  
I do fully agree.

In general:

I like it very much when "all and everything"  
can be adjusted via configuration variables.

The less is hardcoded in the actual code and  
the more is specified via configuration variables  
the better it is.

When "all and everything" can be adjusted  
via configuration variables the crucial word  
is "can".

This means that usually the user should not need  
to manually specifiy "all and everything".

For "all and everything" there should be a reasonable  
fail-safe default setting where the primary intent behind is  
to make things "just work" in the usual use cases (where  
it is of course the question what "the usual use cases" are).

Furthermore for "all and everything" there should be a reasonable  
fallback behaviour when there is no default setting  
(e.g. when the user has specified VAR="")  
or when it does not work with the default setting.

In this particular case we may even be able  
to "automatically do the right thing" via the  
"Dirty hacks welcome" method as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
something like the following:

<pre>
# 900_create_initramfs.sh
#
# create initramfs for Relax-and-Recover
#
# This file is part of Relax-and-Recover, licensed under the GNU General
# Public License. Refer to the included COPYING for full text of license.

LogPrint "Creating initramfs"

pushd "$ROOTFS_DIR" >/dev/null
# First try to create initrd.xz with the newer xz-lzma compression,
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142
if find . ! -name "*~" | cpio -H newc --create --quiet | xz --format=lzma --compress --stdout > "$TMP_DIR/initrd.xz" ; then
    LogPrint "Created initrd.xz with xz-lzma compression ($( stat -c%s $TMP_DIR/initrd.xz ) bytes)"
else 
    # If it fails to create initrd.xz with xz-lzma compression
    # fall back to the traditional way and create initrd.cgz with gzip compression,
    # cf. "Dirty hacks welcome" at https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style
    if find . ! -name "*~" | cpio -H newc --create --quiet | gzip > "$TMP_DIR/initrd.cgz" ; then
        LogPrint "Created initrd.cgz with gzip compression ($( stat -c%s $TMP_DIR/initrd.cgz ) bytes)"
    else
        Error "Failed to create initramfs"
    fi
fi
popd >/dev/null
</pre>

As a consequence all scripts where initrd.cgz is useed  
must be adapted accordingly to try first initrd.xz  
and fall back to initrd.cgz if initrd.xz does not exist like  
in 800\_copy\_to\_tftp.sh at the beginning

<pre>
# In 900_create_initramfs.sh the Relax-and-Recover initrd is created
# either as initrd.xz with the newer xz-lzma compression
# or as initrd.cgz with gzip compression
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142
test -s "$TMP_DIR/initrd.cgz" && initrd_filename="initrd.cgz"
test -s "$TMP_DIR/initrd.xz" && initrd_filename="initrd.xz"
test "$initrd_filename" || Error "Neither initrd.cgz nor initrd.xz found"
</pre>

and then using $initrd\_filename everywhere.

I will do a pull request to make it more clear  
what I propose to change...

I fear my "automatically do the right thing" attempt  
is not sufficiently fail-safe in practice because  
the ReaR initrd is loaded by possibly various  
bootloaders (normally syslinux - but I assume  
any bootloader blindly loads any initrd file)  
but currently I do not know if a xz-lzma compressed  
initrd will always work, in particular with older kernels  
that may not support a xz-lzma compressed initrd?

In other words:  
To "automatically do the right thing" when  
compressing the initrd does not imply that  
later that initrd can be used (decomressed)  
by whatever kernel that will be booted later.

The solution with xz-lzma is necessary for me to boot under IBM Power8  
SLES 11 with a HANA installation.  
Unfortunately yaboot only has a maximum size of 32 MB. I have the
initrd  
with cpio / gz not get below the limit of 32 MB.  
I found the idea good and flexible with an option in the local.conf to  
determine whether one would want a different compression than the  
standard.

I am currently testing  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182)

I noticed a big disadvantage of xz-lzma:  
I takes "ages" while xz runs at 99% CPU usage  
(the remaining 1% CPU is used by cpio).  
From the "rear -d -D mkbackup" log file:

<pre>
2017-01-26 14:34:42.321885598 Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd
...
2017-01-26 14:36:37.937206502 Created initrd.xz with xz-lzma compression (91401572 bytes)
</pre>

I.e. 116 seconds (almost two minutes)  
to create initrd.xz (about 87 MB)

In contrast with 'gzip':

<pre>
2017-01-26 14:51:32.230285525 Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd
...
2017-01-26 14:51:48.339397663 Created initrd.cgz with gzip compression (149199959 bytes)
</pre>

I.e. 16 seconds (more than 7 times faster as xz-lzma) to create  
initrd.cgz (about 142 MB about 1.6 times bigger than xz-lzma).

This matters because "rear mkbackup" is meant to run  
while the system is in use - probably not while the system  
runs under full load - nevertheless we should try to avoid  
stuff that needs much ressources unless it is really needed.

Accordingly I will change my current implementation  
from "automatically do the right thing"  
to use by default gzip and have a config variable  
so that the user can if needed specify xz-lzma.

This way it is even safe against regerssions because  
I do not change the current behaviour by default.

@abbahag  
I know what you had already reported.  
I am only thinking about the right way how to implement it.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182)  
I implemented now the new config variable  
REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION  
so that the user can if needed specify  
the compression as described in default.conf:

<pre>
# REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION
#
# What compression to use when creating the initramfs/initrd for Relax-and-Recover.
# By default and also as fallback an initrd.cgz with gzip default compression is created.
# The default is known to work well in practice.
# The ReaR initrd is loaded by possibly various bootloaders (normally syslinux).
# Usually any bootloader should be able to load any initrd file but then
# the initrd must be usable by the kernel which means a specially compressed initrd
# may not always work, in particular not with older kernels.
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="fast"
# an initrd.cgz with gzip --fast compression is created (fast speed but less compression).
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="best"
# an initrd.cgz with gzip --best compression is created (best compression but slow speed).
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lzma"
# an initrd.xz with xz using the lzma compression is created
# (see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142).
REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION=""
</pre>

Results on my SLES12 test system

"rear mkrescue" with the default:

<pre>
Created initrd.cgz with gzip default compression (149198234 bytes)
</pre>

about 142 MiB.

"rear mkrescue" with REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="fast"

<pre>
Created initrd.cgz with gzip fast compression (159204253 bytes)
</pre>

about 152 MiB.

"rear mkrescue" with REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="best"

<pre>
Created initrd.cgz with gzip best compression (148502717 bytes)
</pre>

about 142 MiB.

"rear mkrescue" with REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="lzma"

<pre>
Created initrd.xz with xz lzma compression (91405354 bytes)
</pre>

about 87 MiB.

I found an advantage of using a high compression:  
The smaller initrd is loaded noticeable faster by the bootloader.

This matters also because system recovery time is very  
important to get back the system as fast as possible.

ReaR is known to be fast so that this way we could  
make it even a bit faster!

@abbahag  
Please try out the newest rear GitHub master code  
when you set in local.conf

<pre>
REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lzma"
</pre>

and provide feedback whether or not  
that works for you.

How to test the currently newest rear GitHub master code  
independent of an already installed ReaR software:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and then  
configre and run it from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

(note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/").

I have a general question about ReaR's initrd size:

On my x86\_64 system (using BIOS) the ReaR initrd.xz  
with xz lzma compression has a size of 87 MiB, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142\#issuecomment-275412073](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142#issuecomment-275412073)

In contrast  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142\#issue-197976731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142#issue-197976731)  
reads that on ppc64 with yaboot only 32MiB are possible  
and that on ppc64 "With gzip, the initrd is 34.1 MB  
with xz and lzma 21.4 MB".

I think independent of the architecture the ReaR initrd should  
cointain basically the same set of files because I assume  
the ReaR rescue/recovery system on x86\_64 and on ppc64  
should be basically the same.

Therefore I wonder why the ReaR initrd.xz on ppc64  
is less than half of the size compared to x86\_64.

Can someone explain to me what the reason  
for this big difference is?

FYI:  
On my x86\_64 system (using BIOS) my ReaR ROOTFS\_DIR  
/tmp/rear.BBbYtTeC5sJIVFt/rootfs (i.e. the uncompressed  
content of the ReaR initrd) has a disk usage of 338M:

<pre>
e205:/tmp/rear.BBbYtTeC5sJIVFt/rootfs # du -shc *
37M     bin
7.5M    boot
132K    dev
9.2M    etc
0       init
196M    lib
9.5M    lib64
20K     mnt
8.0K    proc
5.2M    root
28K     run
0       sbin
8.0K    selinux
8.0K    sys
1.4M    tmp
72M     usr
136K    var
338M    total

e205:/tmp/rear.BBbYtTeC5sJIVFt/rootfs # du -shc lib/*
143M    lib/firmware
54M     lib/modules
0       lib/udev
196M    total
</pre>

It seems more than the half of ReaR's initrd  
on my x86\_64 system is used for firmware.

Perhaps on ppc64 there is much less firmware?

Hi @jsmeix,  
I think it is because `/lib/firmware` is not included in the initrd when
the Linux OS is running Virtualized under PowerVM (which is always the
case in ppc64 arch, but not in ppc64le).

`Linux-ppc64.conf` file contain the following variable:

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]} /lib*/firmware )

Created initrd.cgz with gzip default compression (156865102 bytes)  
Created initrd.xz with xz lzma compression (90740089 bytes)

Now it's time to clean up `/usr/lib/firmware`.

@ProBackup-nl  
many thanks for sharing your results on your particular system.  
Such information helps a lot to get a better overview  
and better general understanding how things are  
on various Linux distributions.

For the bare minimum Arch Linux system installers, cleaning up
`/usr/lib/modules` might not be such a good idea. It will generate
errors when rebuilding your initramfs in the fallback section
`/etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset: 'fallback'`.

After removing **/usr/lib/firmware** contents except for
/usb/lib/firmware/rtl\_nic
(`# find /usr/lib/firmware/* -maxdepth 0 -name 'rtl_nic' -prune -o -exec rm -rf '{}' ';'`),
I ended up with:

> Created initrd.xz with xz lzma compression (48327540 bytes)

After removing a load of **/usr/lib/modules** contents, like bluetooth,
pata, pcmcia, infiniband, parport, Wi-Fi, snd, wimax, etcetera, 83M
/usr/lib/modules shrank to 48M, resulting in:

> Created initrd.xz with xz lzma compression (35513549 bytes)

PS The beauty of Arch Linux is that you can prevent /usr/lib/firmware
re-creation upon firmware package upgrades by adding a line to
`/etc/pacman.conf`:

> NoExtract = usr/lib/firmware/\* !usr/lib/firmware/rtl\_nic/\*

@jsmeix Is it really necessary to create an initrd file when the kernel
of Arch Linux runs with a 6M/11M initramfs (instead of 35M/150M
generated initrd)?

@ProBackup-nl  
I think you misunderstand something here.  
ReaR's own initrd that is created here contains first and foremost  
the whole ReaR recovery system, cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142\#issuecomment-276015345](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142#issuecomment-276015345)  
To inspect what during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" ReaR's initrd  
contains set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes" in etc/rear/local.conf  
and then after "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" check what  
/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs  
contains. In particular it contains all the ReaR scripts plus all  
binaries (like parted, mkfs.\*, mount, tar, ...) and all other files  
(like kernel modules, systemd stuff, system startup scripts, ...)  
that are needed so that "rear recover" can run sucessfully  
when it is run in the ReaR recovery system.

<pre>
I assume on ppc64le in BareMetal Mode (PowerNV)
it does not work with yaboot.

Yes, you are right.   
   
In BareMetal mode (PowerNV), only recent Linux distro are supported
(rhel7.2+ and ubuntu16.04)  
   
But we can have older distro in PowerVM or PowerKVM (sles11, rhel6)
=&gt; They still uses yaboot/lilo

@jsmeix After the modules and firmware cleanup in my x86-64 UEFI booted
Arch Linux, these (manual) folder traverse size sorted listings of
ROOTFS are potential suspects for further size reduction.

Additionally, for the cases where you don't need networking to recover
(as is the goal of my USB setup), removing all network related stuff
(sshd, ssh, ip, rsync, kernel/net, kernel/drivers/net) could save a
considerable amount of space and time to create the initrd.
