-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I just see the error in the log file /var/log/rear/rear-c202s.log
    about the integer expression expected.  
    I do have the problem that the USB flash drive boots and I get the
    menu, but I get all of these messages for each menu item.  
    I am listing the visible menu item that you see on the screen and
    then error lines are what I see when I hit enter to select the menu
    item.

    I added the Log line so I could see what it was comparing and saw the p1

The messages in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11291981/rear-c202s.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11291981/rear-c202s.log)

    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh: line 83: test: p1: integer expression expected
    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh: line 83: test: p2: integer expression expected
    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh: line 83: test: p3: integer expression expected

are unrelated to the GRUB2 error messages.

Regarding the 'integer expression expected' messages:

In general what layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh
does  
is not required functionality to make ReaR work because it is only
there  
as a safeguard that the entries in disklayout.conf are syntactically
OK  
which they should normally be.

The part in layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
that results those 'integer expression expected' messages  
only checks for non consecutive partitions and only when  
partitions of the form /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdX2 /dev/sdX3  
(i.e. of the form $disk\_dev$part\_num) are used,  
see the comments in that code.  
When partition devoce nodes like /dev/mmcblk0p1 /dev/mmcblk0p2  
/dev/mmcblk0p3 /dev/mmcblk0boot0 /dev/mmcblk0boot1 are used  
(i.e. of the form ${disk\_dev}p$part\_num)  
that test is skipped.

So the 'integer expression expected' messages  
are no errors but expected failures of the 'test'  
to also find out if the form $disk\_dev$part\_num is used.

@Jerry2840  
in general when you run ReaR (or any other rogram) in debug mode  
you may get various kind of messages that indicate this or that
failures  
but you would need to understand what is actually meant to happen  
in each case to decide if a failure is expected and handled  
or if a failure is unexpected and indicates a real error.

For example on my currently used computer:

    # dmesg | egrep -i 'fail|error'

    [    0.000000] tsc: Fast TSC calibration failed
    [    0.000000] DMAR: Parse DMAR table failure.
    [    3.400876] RAS: Correctable Errors collector initialized.
    [   46.184357] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Could not resolve symbol [\_TZ.PSL.CFGD], AE_NOT_FOUND (20210730/psargs-330)
    [   46.185935] ACPI Error: Aborting method \_TZ.PSL due to previous error (AE_NOT_FOUND) (20210730/psparse-531)
    ...

My computer works perfectly well for me as far as I can tell  
and I don't have sufficient low-level knowledge to decide  
if those messages mean or indicate some real problem  
so I just ignore them and go on bona fide.

Regarding the GRUB2 error messages  
I am afraid I cannot really help here  
because I am not a sufficient GRUB2 expert  
to imagine what their reason could be.

Only a blind guess  
in particular because you use a Red Hat system  
(but I am not a Red Hat user):

As far as I know on Red Hat based systems  
the whole GRUB2 software is split into several RPM packages  
and by default not all GRUB2 software is installed - in particular  
some GRUB2 modules are not installed by default - so you may  
need to additionally install certain GRUB2 RPM packages  
to get GRUB2 working for ReaR.

@pcahyna  
could you have a look here (as time permits)  
regarding the GRUB2 error messages?

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c8f5e3f41c970a89304cd2b1bc5d04a2d2a7fdb4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c8f5e3f41c970a89304cd2b1bc5d04a2d2a7fdb4)  
in layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
it now suppresses unhelpful stderr messages like  
"test: p1: integer expression expected"  
that appear for partitions of the form like  
/dev/mmcblk0p1 (i.e. of the form ${disk\_dev}p$part\_num).

Later if needed and as time permits  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
may be enhanced to check for non consecutive partitions  
also for partitions of the form like  
/dev/mmcblk0p1 (i.e. of the form ${disk\_dev}p$part\_num).  
Probably this is not needed in practice because  
the parted versions that are nowadays used  
should be sufficiently new so that they  
support FEATURE\_PARTED\_RESIZEPART or FEATURE\_PARTED\_RESIZE  
(i.e. the 'resizepart' or 'resize' command),  
cf. lib/layout-functions.sh

First of all, @Jerry2840, big congratulations of probably being the
first ReaR user on a *Chromebook* 😄 (I also use an old Chromebook as a
"kitchen dashboard"...)

Your GRUB2 error looks like the Grub modules are missing or not found,
please take a look at your rescue media and check the location of the
`echo.mod` file on it. In your logfile I found this line

    grub2-mkstandalone: info: copying `/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/echo.mod' -> `/tmp/grub.XXpN8c/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/echo.mod'.

which suggests that the module was copied, but maybe it got copied to
the wrong place.
