@gdha  
I am afraid I cannot actually review systemd related things because  
in practice I had to learn that I know nothing about systemd units
setup:  
Each time I tried to get any systemd unit setup done things ended in
havoc.  
Probably systemd is just too complicated for a simple mind like me  
or systemd is a too fast moving target for a slow mind like mine ;-)

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1230\#issuecomment-311085676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1230#issuecomment-311085676)  
from `Jun 26, 2017` the syslog.target became `obsolete by now`  
so that I wonder if disabling of `After=syslog.target` may cause  
regressions when ReaR is used on an older system were an  
older systemd is in use where that target is still needed?  
Simply put: Is that change here sufficiently backward compatible?

@rear/contributors  
could another ReaR contributor have a look here?

@jsmeix The `dbus.service` file was created by me **7** years ago for
Fedora 16 of 17 (I guess), or equal to RHEL 6 (I think). However, RHEL 6
is still not using systemd so we are on the safe side here.  
All more recent Linux distributions are evolved from the old systemd
incarnation, so we are good here as well. I'm pretty sure it will not
have a negative impact on the start-up of systemd based systems.

@gdha  
thank you for the explanation.

Because `After=syslog.target` will get only disabled but not completely
removed  
we are fully sufficiently on the safe side here because a user of an old
systemd  
can manually re-enable it again if he needs it in his particular case.
