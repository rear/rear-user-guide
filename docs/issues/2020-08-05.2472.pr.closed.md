-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In 500\_make\_backup.sh fixed the exit code logic that I had messed up
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2674807f6ad48da80b193ae977d345ad2ef5fdd1](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2674807f6ad48da80b193ae977d345ad2ef5fdd1)  
where I had removed the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_OPTIONS="cat"  
which breaks the exit code logic around pipes\_rc=( ${PIPESTATUS\[@\]}
)  
because backup\_prog\_shortnames does no longer match.

Additionally filter informational tar messages from output  
cf.
