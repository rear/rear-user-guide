Raer Version = 1.14  
OS = RHEL 6.2

Scenario: Redhat Server with Oracle Database on SAN Disks

I would live to make a backup of vg00 and want to exclude all other
disks mounted via SAN. Is there a way to configure this?

I think your request is related to \#54. There is a workaround by
excluding all other volume-groups. Since the configuration is a shell
script you could even script it so that the exclude list is
automatically correct.

Let me know if \#54 is exactly what you needed, so we can close this
issue as a duplicate.

Yes, \#54 and \#228 answer my questions. Thanks.  
Just a proposal: If you inculde some more configuration options in the
default local.conf with some comments would help (at least me).
