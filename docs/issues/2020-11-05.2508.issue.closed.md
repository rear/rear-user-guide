@dcz01  
thank you - I will have a look next week (as time permits).

In the meantime you could play around with  
the `BOOTLOADER` config variable, cf.

    ERROR: Cannot autodetect what is used as bootloader,
    see default.conf about 'BOOTLOADER'

In general when a program fails with an error message  
it means that the reason that lead to the error message  
is a known case that is handled within the program  
so it is normally not a bug in the program because  
the program works as intended in this particular case.

Have a relaxing and recovering weekend!

@dcz01  
your

shows that you should have got those messages on your terminal  
wherefrom "rear -D mkrescue" was run (excerpts):

    Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.0Tsyc8vA3jupI3s/rootfs contains a usable system
    There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries
    /bin/gdisk requires additional libraries (fatal error)

and with that inspecting the log file about `/bin/gdisk` shows
(excerpts):

    ++ chroot /tmp/rear.0Tsyc8vA3jupI3s/rootfs /bin/bash --login -c 'cd /bin && ldd /bin/gdisk'
    ++ broken_binaries=' /bin/gdisk'

            libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fa16fd03000)
            /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fa170e2f000)'

and the matching code in
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
is (excerpts):

        chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "cd $( dirname $binary ) && ldd $binary" </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'not found' && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary"
    done
    # Restore the LD_LIBRARY_PATH if it was saved above (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had been set before)
    # otherwise unset a possibly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had not been set before):
    test $old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH || unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    # Report binaries with 'not found' shared object dependencies:
    ...
            # Run the same ldd call as above but now keep its whole output:
            ldd_output="$( chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/ldd $binary )"
            # Have the whole ldd output only in the log:
            Log "$ldd_output"
            # Show only the missing libraries to the user to not flood his screen with tons of other ldd output lines:
            PrintError "$( grep 'not found' <<<"$ldd_output" )"

This looks inexplicable on first glance  
because the first `ldd /bin/gdisk` results a 'not found' library  
while the second `ldd /bin/gdisk` does no longer result a 'not found'
library.

The only explanation I have is that the second `ldd /bin/gdisk`  
is no longer run with the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting that was  
used for the first `ldd /bin/gdisk`.

So my conclusions are:

1.)  
Your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting that is needed  
for your particular third party backup tool  
somehow messes up something with system libraries so that  
the first `ldd /bin/gdisk` with the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting  
results a 'not found' library.

2.)  
The second `ldd /bin/gdisk` should also be run with the
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting  
so that results are the same for both `ldd` runs.

@dcz01  
to verify if my conclusion is right, manually change your  
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2515/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2515/files)  
i.e. remove the

    # Restore the LD_LIBRARY_PATH if it was saved above (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had been set before)
    # otherwise unset a possibly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had not been set before):
    test $old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH || unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

part from where it currently is  
and copy it directly below the

    # Report binaries with 'not found' shared object dependencies:
    local fatal_missing_library=""
    if contains_visible_char "$broken_binaries" ; then
        ...
    fi

part so that in the end that part becomes

    # Report binaries with 'not found' shared object dependencies:
    local fatal_missing_library=""
    if contains_visible_char "$broken_binaries" ; then
        ...
    fi
    # Restore the LD_LIBRARY_PATH if it was saved above (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had been set before)
    # otherwise unset a possibly set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had not been set before):
    test $old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$old_LD_LIBRARY_PATH || unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Then re-run "rear -D mkrescue" and attach the new log file.

@jsmeix Thanks for your response and the investigation of the code.  
I changed the file like you wrote but i got the same error again.  
Here is the new log:

@dcz01  
I wrote

    remove the

    # Restore the LD_LIBRARY_PATH if it was saved above (i.e. when LD_LIBRARY_PATH had been set before)

So your usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
must be exactly as this one  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/1f409f730d08511fe3f0b6f012f3709806c782c4/usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/1f409f730d08511fe3f0b6f012f3709806c782c4/usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh)  
from my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2515](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2515)

This new usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
will not and cannot fix possible mess with LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
but this new usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
will show the 'ldd' output where things had failed with
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set  
to show a useful message that should indicate where the root cause could
be.

In ReaR you can use NON\_FATAL\_BINARIES\_WITH\_MISSING\_LIBRARY  
to ignore that error exit in ReaR when you know it is only false alarm,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1620](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1620)

But to be more on the safe side I would recommend to find out  
if your shared object dependencies perhaps got somehow messed up  
by that LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting.

As I said in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508\#issuecomment-725914211](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508#issuecomment-725914211)

    Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting that is needed
    for your particular third party backup tool
    somehow messes up something with system libraries so that
    the first ldd /bin/gdisk with the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting
    results a 'not found' library.

So to be on the safe side I suggest to talk to the provider of your
third party backup tool  
perhaps even together with CentOS Linux people what you could do about
it.

I close this issue because it depends on special environment settings  
(LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH) for an external tool (a third party backup tool)  
that we at reaR upstream do not have so we cannot reproduce anything  
and ReaR provides a workaround to ignore such issues in ReaR.

@dcz01  
nevertheless I would appreciate feedback from you  
if you find out what the root cause is  
and how you could solve it.

@dcz01  
perhaps something is wrong how build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh
calls 'ldd'  
because currently it calls 'ldd' with a special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
setting  
for all binaries in the recovery system when third-party backup tools
are used  
that need to run with a special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting.

But I think in case of third-party backup tools that need to run  
with a special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting  
only for the third-party backup tool binaries in the recovery system  
'ldd' should be called with the special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting  
but for all the other "normal" binaries in the recovery system  
'ldd' should be called without the special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting.

I will have a closer look next week (as time permits).  
Have a relaxing and recovering weekend!

@jsmeix Hi Johannes, i finally found the solution of the problem with
the missing library.  
And now my older case
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533)
is solved too without the need of the option
"NON\_FATAL\_BINARIES\_WITH\_MISSING\_LIBRARY".  
I only added a new file `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/TIVsm.conf` with that into:

    /lib64/
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/

Later i activated that config with `ldconfig`.

And then my ldd output looks fine:

@jsmeix I also received an answer from the IBM Software Support for my
ticket with this library.  
It is part of the TDP for VMware package.  
But we could also only link the library to /lib64 like:  
`ln -s /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/libvixDiskLib.so.6 /lib64/libvixDiskLib.so.6`

If you would like to test with the client package you can download it
here for free (there is no need for licensing if you haven't any TSM
server):

@dcz01  
thank you for your feedback.  
I will have a look when time permits.  
Currently I am too busy with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2514](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2514)

to also investigate this issue which is also rather complicated.  
Better carefully one at a time than several botched in a hurry ;-)

@dcz01  
thank you for testing
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523)  
and your prompt feedback.

Please submit a new separated GitHub issue for your latest  
`grub2-mkstandalone: error: /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/modinfo.sh doesn't exist`  
with your CentOS 8 system with UEFI and GRUB2 as bootloader and  
re-attach your debug log file to that new issue so that it is directly
available there.

I cannot help with CentOS bootloader issues because I do not use it  
so I can neither reproduce nor help with such issues on CentOS.  
Generic issues like the `ldd` testing are different but bootloader
issues  
often depend very much on how things are on a particular Linux
distribution.

Therefore a separated issue makes it possible that others who know about
CentOS  
and in particular its bootloader specific things could notice your new
issue.
