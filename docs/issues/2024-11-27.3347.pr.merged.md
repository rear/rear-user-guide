    High impact (i.e. "highly needed") only on SLES with btrfs.

In backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh

because btrfs snapshots cannot be recreated

I get

    ...
    Running 'layout/save' stage ======================
    Creating disk layout
    SLES12-SP1 (and later) btrfs subvolumes setup needed for /dev/vda2 (default subvolume path contains '@/.snapshots/')
    Added  /dev/vda2 to BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP in /var/tmp/rear.5Cyn1w6VGN2YFok/rootfs/etc/rear/rescue.conf
    ...
    Running 'backup' stage ======================
    By default skip /.snapshots in the backup include list (btrfs snapshots cannot be recreated)
    Making backup (using backup method NETFS)
    ...

What I get in the backup regarding 'snapshots'  
is only the plain .snapshots/ directory.

With the `BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( /.snapshots )` workaround  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3346](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3346))  
there is no .snapshots/ directory in the backup  
which does not harm because it gets created anyway  
anew from scratch during "rear recover".

"rear recover" test worked well for me.

Some details:

@rear/contributors  
please have a look here if it is OK for you.

Provided there are no objections  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

A side note primarily for my own information  
because I detected it right now here:

In the rebooted recreadted system directly after "rear recover":

    # find /.snapshots -xdev
    /.snapshots
    /.snapshots/1
    /.snapshots/1/snapshot
    /.snapshots/1/info.xml

I called

    # yast2 users

but did not change anything therein and just closed it with `OK`  
to get artificially some snapshots created  
(YaST creates a snapshot before and after a YaST module run)  
so after `yast2 users` I have now

    # find /.snapshots -xdev
    /.snapshots
    /.snapshots/1
    /.snapshots/1/snapshot
    /.snapshots/1/info.xml
    /.snapshots/2
    /.snapshots/2/snapshot
    /.snapshots/2/info.xml
    /.snapshots/2/grub-snapshot.cfg
    /.snapshots/3
    /.snapshots/3/snapshot
    /.snapshots/3/info.xml
    /.snapshots/3/grub-snapshot.cfg
    /.snapshots/3/filelist-2.txt
    /.snapshots/grub-snapshot.cfg

and - voila! - after reboot I got "magically"  
that additional GRUB boot menu entry  
`Start bootloader from a read-only snapshot`

So - hooray! - I now finally understand what "magic"  
makes that additional GRUB boot menu entry :-)
