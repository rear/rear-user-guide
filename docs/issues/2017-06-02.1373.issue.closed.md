@jsmeix Please check out
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-1](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-1)  
You can always add/modify some bits in the release notes. Once you are
done I will prepare an official release of ReaR

@jsmeix @schlomo Do you want to add something to the man page.
Personally, I think experimental stuff should not yet be added. What is
your opinion?

Looks good to me

Experimental functionality or work-in-progress stuff  
should not be officially documented  
(in particular because it may change arbitrarily).

@gdha  
I added two comments regarding possible typos to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd4336609da10388a9de0c0bc927d9b3f72e2fae](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd4336609da10388a9de0c0bc927d9b3f72e2fae)

@gdha  
could you add the new-style openSUSE distributions

<pre>
openSUSE Leap and openSUSE Tumbleweed
</pre>

to the list of supported Linux based operating systems.

What do you think about dropping official support  
for the old-style openSUSE distributions

<pre>
openSUSE 11, 12 and 13
</pre>

?

But I would like to keep SLES11 as supported.  
This would somehow contradict to drop support for  
openSUSE 11, 12 and 13  
because SLES11 is based on openSUSE 11.1  
so that when SLES11 is still supported the old-style  
openSUSE distributions should also still work.  
But I never test ReaR on those distributions.

I've made it like:

    Rear-2.1 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

    * Fedora 24 and 25
    * RHEL 5, 6 and 7
    * CentOS 5, 6 and 7
    * ScientificLinux 6 and 7
    * SLES 11 and 12
    * openSUSE Leap and openSUSE Tumbleweed
    * Debian 6, 7 and 8
    * Ubuntu 12, 13, 14 and 15

    Rear-2.1 dropped officially support for the following Linux based operating systems:

    * Fedora <24
    * RHEL 3 and 4
    * SLES 9 and 10
    * openSUSE <13
    * Debian <6
    * Ubuntu <12

Like this OpenSuSe 13 is an open question - it may or may not work.

Perfectly o.k. for me.

Should I fix  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1376](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1376)  
before or after the 2.1 release?

As rear-2.1 has been released at OBS on Jun 7th we can announce the
release as of today (I was unable to do that yesterday)
