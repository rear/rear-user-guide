Hi all,

We've been wondering how to provide better DRLM & ReaR integration
lately. We have some stuff, new and old, that would be better to
integrate directly to the rear repo.

That being said, for us, makes no sense to push code that we cannot
maintain or review other changes that can affect us with the
integration, so we offer ourselves (DRLM Team) to be added as
maintainers of the rear project, if no objections.

Waiting on your feedback.  
Kind regards,  
Didac

*We hope that ReaR continues to prove useful and to attract more
developers who agree to be maintainers.*
