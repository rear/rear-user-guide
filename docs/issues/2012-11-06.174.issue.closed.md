=============================================================================================================

I had problems while trying to restore my drbd system. In my opinion
this part of rear should be reviewed.

Lets have a look on (line 21 to 34):  
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/15\_include\_drbd\_code.sh

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ask if we need to become primary
================================

    read 2>&1 -p "Type \"Yes\" if you want DRBD resource $resource to become primary: "
    if [ "$REPLY" = "Yes" ] ; then
        cat >> $LAYOUT_CODE <<EOF

\# We assume DRBD on LVM  
drbdadm attach $resource  
drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary $resource  
EOF  
else  
cat &gt;&gt; $LAYOUT\_CODE &lt;&lt;EOF

LVM on DRBD
===========

drbdadm up $resource  
EOF

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Issue  
    The request if drbd should become primary is case sensitive. I think
    this is a usability problem.
2.  Issue  
    I don't understand why a primary drbd means that we can assume drbd
    on lvm? Its the other way around in my opinion.  
    If we type "Yes", in most cases we have LVM on DRBD and then we need
    the command "drbdadm up $resource". If we type something else, we do
    not have LVM or something else on DRBD and we only use "drbdadm
    attach $resource".

Your issue 1. is deliberate. It's like that in all of ReaR. We should
probably make things consistent though.

Issue 2 looks like it needs review indeed. The comments are leftovers
from 2 years ago. The decision to become master is not related to if we
have LVM on top of it or not... I don't have access to a DRBD setup
right now to test, but we have plans for automated testing of ReaR and
will include it then.

If you can't wait and can fix it yourself, we'll gladly take pull
requests!
