-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I have a LUKS encrypted LVM that can be successfully captured and
    restored using rear. The problem is when I use
    `clevis luks bind -d /dev/sda2 tang '{"url":"http://tang.srv"}'` to
    enable NBDE unlocking the rear restore no longer works. After using
    clevis to bind the key you have to run dracut in order for the VM to
    boot properly as described
    [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption_security-hardening#configuring-manual-enrollment-of-volumes-using-clevis_configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption).

I can capture a backup and restore the image but upon reboot the error I
receive is:  
`dracut-initqueue[683]: Failed to start systemd-cryptsetup@luks\x2d....service: Unit systemd-cryptsetup@lus\x2d.....service not found`  
`Dependency failed for cryptography Setup for luks-... `  
I went through this [post](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2509) but
my UUIDs in the crypttab matched fine. I even set a partlabel on the
working VM LUKS partition and modified the crypttab to use PARTLABEL=
instead of UUID but that did not work either. Is there a module that is
not getting put into the initrd upon restore?

I just wanted to update that I found a workaround for this issue by
using the PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT settings. The pre
script unbinds the tang key and then the post script adds it back. Seems
to work well.

The PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is set to run right before the backup phase from
what I understand. I needed it to happen earlier in the process. I
changed the name and moved
/usr/share/rear/backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh to
/usr/share/rear/init/default/001\_pre\_backup\_script.sh and this ran
the script earlier in the process and I was able to achieve the outcome
that is needed. If there is a better way to change the order of
processes, then please let me know.

Thanks
