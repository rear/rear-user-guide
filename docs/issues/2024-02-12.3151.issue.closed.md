hi,

this is an minor issue as it does not affect functionality but can be
fixed quite easily:

Executing "vi" within the bootet recovery iso (sles15 sp5) shields the
following error:

    E1187: Failed to source defaults.vim
    Press ENTER or type command to continue

workaround is to create an empty `/root/.vimrc` file.

would

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130\_create\_dotfiles.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130_create_dotfiles.sh)

be the right place to simply touch the file?

I suppose this would work, but I suspect
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/root](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/root)
would be an even better place, as the file is static and if you put it
there, you will see just by looking at the directory listing that it is
there, instead of having to look inside the code and think about what it
is doing.

if the user wants to ship its custom .vimrc file that might be the
better place.. yes. But by default? Touching it ifs existant  
during dotfiles creation doesnt hurt anyone and would create it if not.

I don't say it will hurt, but having a static file in the directory
structure is easier to understand for developers who sometimes need to
check how something happens (I am among them), than having a code to
generate it dynamically.

I can reproduce it.  
I will have a look how to solve it properly.

Offhandedly I think that  
dynamically generating something static  
is (or at least looks) self-contradicting.

The current static

    nano /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  # disk restore
    nano /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf # disk layout

in usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130\_create\_dotfiles.sh  
is not fully correct because there is not always 'nano'  
in the ReaR recovery system so that .bash\_history lines  
should be dynamically generated depending on whether  
or not 'nano' is in the ReaR recovery system.  
Probably the same is true for the current static

    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh    # disk restore
    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf   # disk layout

because I vaguely remember there are systems without 'vi'  
which use 'nano' as basic text editor - perhaps Ubuntu?

I would keep dynamic generation of (currently) static .bash\_history
there though because I hope that we would eventually make it dynamic.
For example, it does not make much sense to preload `nano` into history
if there is no `nano` in the rescue image. But this issue does not have
a high priority for me :-)
