It has to do with the `--metadata=imsm` Intel Raid - I have heard it
before ReaR cannot cope with it. Sorry, we do not have this kind of
hardware so it is very difficult to help you.

I have RAID1 made by BIOS and I tried make some fix adding follow:

    # If imsm is set, we can ignore RAID altogether
    if grep -qw 'imsm' /proc/mdstat; then
       return
    fi

on the beginning of the:  
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh`  
and  
`/usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/230_include_md_tools.sh`

Because, I do not want to touch any on RAID through Linux, just make
partitions and LVM if exists, but I did not finish it, because I have
some another issues. Maybe, you can try this on your environment if you
have similar situation.

@urobasa  
I assume you also have the special Intel Matrix RAID hardware, cf.

Intel RST on Linux documentation:  
[https://www.intel.com.au/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/rst-linux-paper.pdf](https://www.intel.com.au/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/rst-linux-paper.pdf)

Check if HW supports RST:  
`mdadm -–detail-platform`  
or less reliable:  
`lspci | grep "SATA RAID Controller"`
