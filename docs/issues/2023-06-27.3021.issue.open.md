Backup (`rear -v mkbackup`) reports that a necessary file is missing. I
don't understand ...

-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git
-   OS version: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
-   ReaR configuration files: (attached)
-   System architecture: x86\_64
-   Storage layout: (attached)
-   Description of the issue:  
    I am not sure if this is a `rear` issue yet I cannot find any useful
    information elsewhere. (I've tried!) During backup, I get the
    following message ...

`dpkg --get-selections | grep libsystemd-shared` shows that it's
installed.  
`dpkg -L libsystemd-shared` gives me the following ...

I am not a Debian user  
so I cannot reproduce Debian specific issues.

In general when things are missing in the ReaR recovery system  
you could manually add what is needed via something like

    LIBS+=( /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-shared-252.so )

or

    LIBS+=( /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/*.so* )

in your etc/rear/local.conf file.

See the descriptions about LIBS and COPY\_AS\_IS  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

I see a similar message on Fedora 37:

    Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.OBGH5kwM9RvJv5S/rootfs contains a usable system
    There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries
    /usr/lib/systemd/libsystemd-core-251.14-2.fc37.so requires additional libraries
    libsystemd-shared-251.14-2.fc37.so => not found

Weird.

A quick run of
`ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-252.so` did
report that `libsystemd-shared-252.so` was missing. This is damned
odd.  
I took my question to the [Debian
forums](https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=155102). I'll post
here what I discover.

Similar on Fedora 37:

    # ldd /usr/lib/systemd/libsystemd-core-251.14-2.fc37.so 
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffefb5d6000)
            libsystemd-shared-251.14-2.fc37.so => not found

libsystemd-shared-251.14-2.fc37.so is actually in /usr/lib/systemd .

I guess that the RequiredSharedObjects function in ReaR  
does not get called for libsystemd-core-252.so  
so libsystemd-shared-252.so is not automatically  
included into the ReaR recovery system.

RequiredSharedObjects is called in  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
for all existing programs in PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
and for all libraries in LIBS via

    local all_libs=( "${LIBS[@]}" $( RequiredSharedObjects "${all_binaries[@]}" "${LIBS[@]}" ) )

and RequiredSharedObjects is called in  
build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
for all executable files in COPY\_AS\_IS via

    for required_library in $( RequiredSharedObjects "${copy_as_is_executables[@]}" ) ; do

So when libsystemd-core-252.so is not specified in LIBS  
but gets included into the recovery system via COPY\_AS\_IS  
and when libsystemd-core-252.so is not an executable file  
then RequiredSharedObjects is not called for libsystemd-core-252.so  
so libsystemd-shared-252.so gets not automatically included  
and when libsystemd-shared-252.so is not explicitly  
specified to be included into the recovery system  
then libsystemd-shared-252.so is missing in the recovery system.

@pcahyna  
Ah!  
It seems the library configuration on the original system  
(i.e. things like `ldconfig` and so on)  
could be incomplete when `ldd` does not find it.

FYI:

On my current openSUSE Leap 15.4 system  
I have systemd-249.16 which contains only  
/usr/lib/systemd/libsystemd-shared-249.so  
and I noticed no issues with that in ReaR.

After "rear -D mkrescue" I get:

    # find /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs | grep libsystemd

    /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs/usr/lib64/libsystemd.so.0
    /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs/usr/lib64/libsystemd.so.0.32.0
    /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs/usr/lib/systemd/libsystemd-shared-249.so

and my var/log/rear/rear-HOSTNAME.log contains

    + source /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh
    ...
    ++ Log 'Adding required libraries of executables in all the copied files to LIBS'

As far as I see in particular in  
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/280\_include\_systemd.sh  
and in usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
it seems that  
libsystemd-shared-249.so and libsystemd.so.0  
are not specified in LIBS  
but get included into the recovery system  
via executables in COPY\_AS\_IS or  
via programs in PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
which should normally be the preferred way  
according to my reasoning in

I found [this
post](https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/703825) that
offered some "solutions." Even though the question was asked for Ubuntu,
I found it helpful for Debian.

TL;DR

One-off solution:  
`sudo bash -c "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-shared-252.so" rear -v mkbackup`  
(untested)  
... OR ...  
create an file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d`  
(This is the method I chose.)

I created `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libsystemd-core.conf`  
... into which I put `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd`  
I then ran `sudo ldconf`

A run of `ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-252.so`
now resolves `libsystemd-shared-252.so`

I rebooted for good measure and ran a straight `rear -v mkbackup` -- it
ran flawlessly.

I suppose why `libsystemd-core-252.so` has this issue is a question for
the distro and subsystem teams.
