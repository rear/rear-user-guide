You are in migration mode and  
your ReaR scripts are messed up because there should be  
either the old  
layout/prepare/default/400\_autoresize\_disks.sh  
or the new  
layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
plus  
layout/prepare/default/430\_autoresize\_all\_partitions.sh

The old layout/prepare/default/400\_autoresize\_disks.sh  
had severe issues, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1746](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1746)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/32eafc491f793e5b8a510ff8f4219ff9be2a7edf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/32eafc491f793e5b8a510ff8f4219ff9be2a7edf)

Therefore I recommend that you  
first and foremost use a clean set of ReaR scripts  
before we do any further debugging of issues.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

@ritzmann  
because your current ReaR scripts are messed up  
I close this issue as invalid.  
If issues appear with a clean set of ReaR scripts  
report them as new separated issues.

Hello @ritzmann,

EFI based USB device needs to be formatted with command \`rear format --
--efi /dev/&lt;device\_name&gt;'

So in your case it would be:  
`# rear format -- --efi /dev/sdl`

Also make sure that you are restoring to correct USB device. I happened
several times already that ReaR recovery system (source boot USB disk)
was overwritten due bad user decision.

V.

@ritzmann  
only FYI regarding your

<pre>
UEFI on backed up machine, BIOS in VirtualBox
...
Format USB stick: rear -v mkformat /dev/sdl
Create rescue image: rear -v mkrescue
Boot stick from VirtualBox image with single hard drive attached and run rear restore
</pre>

It seems you also like to migrate from UEFI to BIOS.

Bootloader migration is not supported by ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437)  
and for an example how bootloader migration may go wrong see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271\#issuecomment-347555836](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271#issuecomment-347555836)

Sorry for the unnecessary work that I caused. I will clean up my
installation as instructed.

The UEFI - BIOS mess was of course not intentional either, VirtualBox
was just the easiest way to test the restore procedure without messing
with my existing setup. I believe I can switch the virtual machine to
boot with UEFI in VirtualBox.

No worries!  
Your issue report was good so that it was easy  
to detect what is wrong in your case.

FYI:

For real debugging an issue a log with debug info is needed,  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding bootloader migration:

That bootloader migration is not supported by ReaR  
only means exactly what it tells:

The ReaR scripts do not help you to migrate your bootloader.

But you can of course manually migrate your bootloader  
after "rear recover" had finished when you are still in the  
running ReaR recovery system.

The ReaR recovery system is a rather minimal  
but fully working installation system where you can do  
all what is needed to install a system from scratch.

But by default the ReaR recovery system contains only  
those programs that are needed to recreate the original system  
as it was before.

For example when you like to migrate from one filesystem  
to a different one (e.g. from btrfs to XFS) the needed things  
to create an XFS filesystem (mainly mkfs.xfs plus perhaps  
some XFS-specific kernel modules) get by default not  
included in the ReaR recovery system when that is made  
(i.e. during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" on the original system).  
E.g. regarding migration from btrfs to XFS see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html)

But via ReaR config variables like COPY\_AS\_IS, PROGS,  
LIBS, MODULES,... you can specify any additional stuff  
that you need to get included in your ReaR recovery system  
during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" to have your ReaR recovery  
system prepared for basically any special manual migration  
actions that you like to do.

I am not at all a bootloader expert but I guess migrating the  
bootloader from UEFI to BIOS is perhaps relatively easy.  
I would hope manually recofiguring and reinstalling GRUB is
sufficient.  
In contrast I guess migrating the bootloader from BIOS to UEFI  
is more complicated because for UEFI you also need the right  
GPT partitioning (e.g. with an ESP partition and things like that)  
and if you like to migrate BIOS with MBR partitioning to UEFI  
I assume things could get somewhat complicated.
