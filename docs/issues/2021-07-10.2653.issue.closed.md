-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hello! When I try to restore, I get an error RPC unaviable. The problem
is similar to \#2487 .

`ERROR: RPC portmapper 'rpcbind' unavailable`

I use only NFSv4 and i don't need compatibility with NFSv3.

I get an error when trying to run rpcinfo -p in the recovery
environment.

`rpcinfo: can't contact portmapper: RPC: Remote system error - Connection refused`

If I edit in
`/usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050_start_required_nfs_daemons.sh`
to

`test "ok" = $ attempt || LogPrint "RPC portmapper '$ portmapper_program' unavailable."`

Then everything works.

I also tried the rear 2.6 package and it didn't help. I am getting
another error related to NFS.

You have a very cool product, Thank you!

Add the following to your local.conf file:

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" showmount mount.nfs umount.nfs )
    MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" nfs )
    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT="systemctl start rpcbind.target"

This didn't change the error. All the same

Relax-and-Recover 2.4 is rather old (from June 2018), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
so you may try out if things perhaps work with our current master code.

See the section "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In general we at ReaR upstream support (on a voluntary basis)  
only the newest ReaR upstream version or  
preferably the ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

This does not mean we reject all issues with older ReaR versions  
but we only spend time with older ReaR versions when it is obvious  
that the issue also exists in current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because we fix only the ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

Therefore "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"  
would help us at ReaR upstream most and at the same time  
it should help you most because when you are used to use  
our current upstream master code you get all our fixes directly.

@alexgdi Try with commenting ISO\_RECOVER\_MODE=unattended and login as
root and see what the status is on that point.  
Does rpcinfo -p working? Is `portmap` executable available? Try to start
it manual first.

@alexgdi See also issue \#2672 - might be the fix you are looking for...
