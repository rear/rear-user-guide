In order to use rear in ubuntu 15.04, you must symlink mbr.bin file from
/usr/lib/SYSLINUX/ to /usr/lib/ISOLINUX/ (sudo ln -s
/usr/lib/SYSLINUX/mbr.bin /usr/lib/ISOLINUX/).

It is possible to change the rear corresponding script?

I did some checking.

    $ lsb_release -ds ; dpkg -S /usr/lib/*/mbr.bin /usr/lib/*/mbr/mbr.bin
    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
    syslinux-legacy: /usr/lib/syslinux-legacy/mbr.bin
    syslinux-common: /usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin
    dpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /usr/lib/*/mbr/mbr.bin

    $ lsb_release -ds ; dpkg -S /usr/lib/*/mbr.bin /usr/lib/*/mbr/mbr.bin 
    Ubuntu 15.04
    syslinux: /usr/lib/SYSLINUX/mbr.bin
    syslinux-common: /usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin

The code looking for mbr.bin looks in `$SYSLINUX_DIR` which is set in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh\#L48](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh#L48)
like this:

        if [[ -z "$SYSLINUX_DIR" ]]; then
            for file in /usr/{share,lib,libexec}/*/isolinux.bin ; do
                if [[ -s "$file" ]]; then
                    SYSLINUX_DIR="$(dirname $file)"
                    break # for loop
                fi
            done
        fi

I think the problem is that in 15.04 the mbr.bin file is now not any
more found in the same location as isolinux.bin.

The ideal solution would somewhat reorganize the way how we find the
various syslinux files and make the searches independant from each
other.

I would suggest to create a new function called `find_syslinux_file`
that returns the full path to a file given as argument and that searches
for that file in "typical" syslinux paths.

@schlomo no problem - seems a good idea as such we can mask the
complexity per OS distro.

I think this is OK in the meantime, but did not received conclusive
feedback yet
