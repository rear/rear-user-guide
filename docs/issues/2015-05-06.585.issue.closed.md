Hello,

I was able to run a ReaR mkbackup and recompiled the mkisofs for UEFI. I
am running this on a brand new HP DL360 G9 server and running SLES 11
SP3.

My local.conf

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
NETFS\_URL=cifs://server/nfs/  
NETFS\_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"  
EXCLUDE\_VG=('/dev/vgoracle' '/dev/vgsap00' '/dev/vgsap01' )  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/efi/SuSE/elilo.efi  
ISO\_ISOLINUX\_BIN="/usr/share/syslinux/isolinux.bin"

TEST 1 - Standard UEFI boot  
i tried booting up the cdrom which i burned from the iso image and it
just error out and stating that it couldn't find the config in the
/EFI/BOOT. i looked there is a BOOTX64.conf in the iso image and it
contained "default=0  
timeout 5  
splashimage=/EFI/BOOT/splash.xpm.gz  
title Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)  
kernel /isolinux/kernel  
initrd /isolinux/initrd.cgz"

however, i don't see splash.xpm.gz in the path /EFI/BOOT.

TEST 2 - OLD BIOS MODE  
The HP Bios allows me to boot up in the OLD BIOS mode, i was able to
boot the CD and i was able to get the ReaR Recover menu. i was able to
go through the process on restoring the OS from backup. However, i tried
rebooting after running rear recover, i just got a message that there is
no operating installed.

If you can guide me the right direction, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Boon

Is related with \#583 - currently UEFI booting with SLES11/OpenSuse is a
bit of a pain.

1.  EFI ISO booting is not supported by mkisofs executable delivered
    with standard OS
2.  elilo is not yet supported (working on it)

I tried Parted Magic and it allows me to boot up in UEFI mode and i am
hoping that it would be some help on booting up in the elilo mode.

@pomusa please give 78a6f9f a try.. that will detect the correct
bootloader. Feedback is welcome.

Instead of using mkisofs, Would it be possible to make a usb flash drive
UEFI bootable?

@pomusa Have a look at
[http://www.it3.be/2015/10/27/uefi-iso-boot-with-ebiso/](http://www.it3.be/2015/10/27/uefi-iso-boot-with-ebiso/)
to make a bootable ISO image on UEFI systems. It does work as I already
used it for SLES11 SP3/SAP HANA systems.
