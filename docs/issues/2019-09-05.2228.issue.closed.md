2.5-1

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.6 (Maipo)

OUTPUT=ISO  
USE\_DHCLIENT=NO  
USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=YES  
USE\_RESOLV\_CONF=( NO )  
PROGS=( more )

Fujitsu Server

BIOS Grub2

local RAID5

Tried to build rescue system WITH OPTIONALLY ADDED PROGRAM "more" : rear
mkrescue

Build process complains 'ldd' would be missing and requests new issue.

NO Workaround: if you include 'ldd' as well into the inclusion list,
build process completes, BUT rescue kernel runs immediately into panic.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

@guru4712  
etc/rear/local.conf is sourced as a bash script so you need bash
syntax,  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
where also each user config variable is described (at least a bit).

I.e. use

    PROGS+=( more )

to add `more` to the default PROGS array.
