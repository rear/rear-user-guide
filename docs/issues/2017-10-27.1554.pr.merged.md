This adds Support for NETFS URLs when using duplicity so you can now
backup to an CIFS or NFS share etc.

The latest Commit is needed for restore to work on Debian Testing,
however it might break it for other Distributions.

Well, for me duplicity was complaining about not being able to find some
Python-Module, do I commented out those Variables and it worked fine
afterwards. Also my Python version is indeed 2.7 so that could be the
actual problem. But so far I couldn't see any problems with not setting
these Variables.

So far everything is Tested and working on my side.  
@gdha Can you test the original way this was meant to work with
`DUPLICITY_USER`, `_HOST`, `_PROTO`, `_PATH` and
`BACKUP_DUPLICITY_GPG_*` etc.? Just to be sure, I don't think I broke
anything.

@Lukey3332 Give me some time to setup my test cases.

@Lukey3332 I'm so sorry, but I did not find enough time to get this
tested for rear-2.3, therefore, I shift to rear-2.4.

No Problem :)

@Lukey3332 Did you never had the following error?

And `rear recover` bails out.  
In my tests with `duply` I used `/mnt/local/tmp` as temporary directory
and that worked fine.

Hi,  
Sorry, I was on Vacation. The Problem is that I forgot to add an check
if the `$BACKUP_DUPLICITY_TEMP_RAMDISK` is not set, in which case it
will create an Temporary Directory on the Target Filesystem (as `/tmp`
doesn't exist yet) for Temporary Data before restore. This is what the
rm wants to remove.
