Add support for a config variable that contains  
additional rear config file names so that  
(when that variable is properly set) plain

<pre>
# rear mkbackup
versus
# rear recover
</pre>

runs a sequence of rear calls for multiple backups, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-263887450](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-263887450)

Actually this means support in usr/sbin/rear to call itself.
