@gdha  
I added you as reviewer because  
"git log -p --follow
usr/share/rear/prep/default/310\_include\_uefi\_tools.sh"  
lists you as the main author.

@gozora  
I added you as reviewer because it is about "UEFI".

I'd say that whole condition

    if [[ ! -d /boot/[eE][fF][iI] ]]; then
        if is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER; then
            Error "USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER = 1 but there is no directory at /boot/efi or /boot/EFI" # abort
        fi
        return # skip
     fi

is somehow "off topic".

Is there benefit from such check?

Hmm, OK maybe not fully "off topic", but maybe we could simplify it bit.

Something like

    if ! is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER; then
        return 
    fi

I can reproduce the problem with rear-2.00, but not with the git master
branch (revision 082807944a186a916b9f03235b8666568c349bc6). I suspect
this fix does not apply to master anymore.

I have tested the current master branch on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. On my
UEFI boot system, `rear mkrescue` failed to include `efibootmgr` and
thus `rear recover` failed to create a booting system. Seems like two
effects contributed to the problem:

#### 1. The test in line 7 of `310_include_uefi_tools.sh` returns the wrong result if `/boot/[eE][fF][iI]` exists:

Quoting the [bash manual
page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man1/bash.1.html):

> Word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the words
> between the \[\[ and \]\];

Changing the test to `[ ! -d /boot/[eE][fF][iI] ]` (single brackets)
makes it work.

Script to demonstrate:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    ls -ld /boot/[eE][fF][iI]

    if [[ ! -d /boot/[eE][fF][iI] ]]; then
        echo "/boot/[eE][fF][iI] not found (original test)"
    else
        echo "/boot/[eE][fF][iI] found (original test)"
    fi

    if [ ! -d /boot/[eE][fF][iI] ]; then
        echo "/boot/[eE][fF][iI] not found (modified test)"
    else
        echo "/boot/[eE][fF][iI] found (modified test)"
    fi

Script output:

    drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 512 Jan  1  1970 /boot/efi
    /boot/[eE][fF][iI] not found (original test)
    /boot/[eE][fF][iI] found (modified test)

#### 2. `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` is used before initalization

`310_include_uefi_tools.sh` requires a correctly set
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` variable, but this is only set afterwards in
`320_include_uefi_env.sh`. Renaming `310_include_uefi_tools.sh` to
`330_include_uefi_tools.sh` fixed that problem for me.

Thanks for the testing with EFI. When I wrote

> master branch

I was speaking about the problem of rear not working on systems without
EFI, and no statement about systems with EFI was intended.

> Word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the words
> between the \[\[ and \]\];

Indeed, see my recent comment
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/commit/9bb07357ac7892ad7d82c5438e76e57a44d21113\#commitcomment-24177948](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/commit/9bb07357ac7892ad7d82c5438e76e57a44d21113#commitcomment-24177948)
on 9bb07357ac7892ad7d82c5438e76e57a44d21113 (which introduced this
problem).

> USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is used before initalization

I also wondered why the variable is being set in 320\_xxx and being used
in 310\_xxx .

I use simpler code in 310\_include\_uefi\_tools.sh to fix

and I did some general cleanup there.  
Currently I don't have an UEFI test system running so that  
I could not test it myself.  
@pcahyna @OliverO2 please test if the current  
GitHub master code works for you.

@gozora  
please have a look if 310\_include\_uefi\_tools.sh looks better now  
(but I do not intend to do a complete overhaul of that script).

@jsmeix  
I'll test later today. Looks like it will probably work but the problem
with `$USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` being used before initialization in
`320_include_uefi_env.sh` remains. I'd suggest

-   renaming `310_include_uefi_tools.sh` to `330_include_uefi_tools.sh`
    and
-   relying on the UEFI presence checks already done in
    `320_include_uefi_env.sh` replacing the two `if` statements at the
    top of in `330_include_uefi_tools.sh` with this test:

<!-- -->

    is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return

@jsmeix OK. As I only have a limited amount of time available, I'll wait
with testing until both known problems are addressed. I could also
provide a PR with a complete UEFI-tested fix if that's what you'd
prefer.

@jsmeix with this commit you unfortunately broke it for the non-UEFI

and nothing more.

@OliverO2  
I would very much appreciate it if you coud do a further  
pull request with a complete UEFI-tested fix.  
Many thanks in advance for it!  
And no rush - we all have only limited amount of time available.

@jsmeix I see. My point was that before your commit the master branch
did not suffer from issue \#1478 anymore and so this pull request was
actually not needed. See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1477\#issuecomment-328169575](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1477#issuecomment-328169575)
(Arguably, this was purely coincidental and \#1478 had not been fixed
properly.) Anyway, we now need again to fix it.
