Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / 2017-12-20

    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
    OS\_VERSION=7.1

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine):  
    PPC64

-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot?  
    Petitboot (IBM Power8 system)

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I was unable to boot rescue image on PPC64 system without adding  
    REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="lzma".  
    Once ISO was ready I simply created a bootable DVD  
    which worked without any problem and  
    was also able to boot from USB by simply  
    'dd if=rear-rescue.iso of=/dev/sdz bs=512k'.  
    Using unetbootin to create bootable USB work just fine  
    for x86 systems as well as citrix xen VMs.  
    After booting following issues were noticed:

Issue 1:  
This system is configure to use bonded interface  
however the bond numbering is not sequential,  
Only bond3 is present, bond0 to bond2 are not created.

Issue 2 (minor):  
MAC addresses for slave interfaces stored in  
/etc/mac-addresses same as in output of 'ip addr show'  
however these values are not consistent with the values  
present in /proc/net/bonding/bond3.  
Remapping two devices with identical MAC  
doesn't seem to cause any issues.

-   Work-around, if any:

Issue 1:  
Replaced following line in  
/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices

<pre>
echo "modprobe bonding **max_bonds=${#bonding_interfaces[@]}** miimon=100 mode=$bonding_mode use_carrier=0" >>$network_devices_setup_script
</pre>

with

<pre>
echo "modprobe bonding **max_bonds=4** miimon=100 mode=$bonding_mode use_carrier=0" >>$network_devices_setup_script
</pre>

It seems that 310\_network\_devices should possibly  
be updated to account for non-sequential bond names.

Issue 2:  
Ran 'rear -v -d -S mkrescue' and modified /etc/mac-addresses  
before creating iso. Tested without updating /etc/mac-addresses  
and remapping two interfaces with identical MACs doesn't cause any
problem.

The usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
in the ReaR release 2.3 from December 2017  
was meanwhile (i.e. in our ReaR upstream GitHub master code here)  
completely overhauled by @rmetrich

See his initial  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/02937854b6ea2060a978d69355581ba93adb9e7e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/02937854b6ea2060a978d69355581ba93adb9e7e)  
plus some more subsequent fixes and enhancements like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1719](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1719)

I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we at ReaR upstream fix bugs.  
Bugs in released ReaR versions are not fixed by us (by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with  
reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got ReaR.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

If the issue also happens with current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
please provide us a complete ReaR debug log file of "rear -D mkrescue"  
so that we can have a look how it behaves in your particular
environment  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If it works with current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
we would really appreciate an explicit positive feedback.  
It helps us a lot to have an explicit feedback  
when even "special things" actually work with ReaR.

Regarding how to get debug information from the setup scripts  
that run during ReaR recovery system startup phase  
in this particular case how to get debug information from  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

In general regarding debugging issues with the startup scripts  
that are run initially in the ReaR recovery system:

The basic idea behind is to not let those startup scripts  
run automatically and mostly silently but manually  
one after the other with 'set -x' bash debugging mode.

Add 'debug' to the ReaR kernel command line  
when booting the ReaR recovery/rescue system.

In the ReaR recovery/rescue system boot menue select  
the topmost enty of the form "Recover HOSTNAME"  
and press the \[Tab\] key to edit the boot command line  
and append the word ' debug' at its end and boot that.

You may found yourself stopped at a blank screen.  
In this case press \[Enter\] which runs the very first of the  
startup scripts (/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00functions.sh).  
There is some bug that the initial message is not always  
printed so you may need to type the very first \[Enter\] blindly.

The further startup scripts are run one by one  
each one after pressing \[Enter\].

In 'debug' mode the startup scripts are run with 'set -x'  
so that this way you can better see what actually goes on  
in each of the startup scripts.

Tested with upstream code and issue is fixed.

Thank you!

@tpatel80  
thank you for your prompt feedback!

@rmetrich  
thanks again for you greatly overhauled networking setup scripts in
ReaR!

@jsmeix You are all welcome!  
Sorry, I don't have time to do more stuff for now for ReaR...

@rmetrich  
no worries - your current stuff "just works".  
Have a nice (and hopefully relaxed) weekend!
