Hi,  
When rear start, there is an error in file
/usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh line 18.

    rear mkrescue -v
    /usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh: line 18: : No such file or directory

see issue \#330 - this case can be closed?

No,  
Because the error "No such file or directory" is still present with
latest git version.  
The error is in line 18 of sesam-functions.sh : `done <"$SM_INI"`
because Bash try to open the file found by the grep command, if the file
doesn't exist, this error appears. Rear should test the existence of the
file before the while loop.

in the github
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh)  
there is a test to avoid this I believe:
`[[ -z "$SM_INI" ]] && return`  
could you double check?

Sorry, I didn't see this commit (i have pulled the repositories just
before the commit of the test...).  
I close the issue ;)
