-   rear version: 2.00 git
-   OS version: Arch Linux
-   rear configuration files: NETFS USB
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? UEFI
-   Brief description of the issue: Recovery on larger drive causes 1
    out of 3 partitions to be reduced in size.

Source:

    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda2        20G  2.1G   18G  11% /
    /dev/sda3       9.3G   17M  9.3G   1% /home
    /dev/sda1      1022M   44M  979M   5% /boot

### Destination

`/dev/nvme0n1`, `256GB`, unit B: `256060514304B`

### Steps to recover

    # rear recover
    ...
    1) View disk layout (disklayout.conf)
    ...
    5) Continue recovery
    ...
    #? 5
    Partition home on /dev/nvme0n1: size reduced to fit on disk.

### Diskrestore.sh layout

#### unit compact

    mkpart boot EFIBOOT 2M 1.07G
    mkpart root root 1.07G 173.9G
    mkpart home home 173.9G 256.0G

#### unit B

    mkpart boot EFIBOOT 2097152B 1075838975B
    mkpart root root 1075843072B 173924794047B
    mkpart home home 173924794368B 256060497407B

home partition after = 256 - 173.9 = 82G

    Disk size = 256060514304B
    Home end  = 256060497407B
    Result    =       +16897B

It seems that there is no size reduction at al, only an [incorrectly
displayed size reduction warning message in
100\_include\_partition\_code.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8d088e6516868c992e68c2358f29202e7a9d19a6/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh#L157).

This is the code that triggers the "size reduced to fit on disk"
message:

    ...
    let start=2097152 # start after cylinder 4096*512 (for grub2 - see issue #492)
    let end=0
    ...
    while read part disk size pstart name flags partition junk; do
        ...
        end=$(( start + size ))
        ...
        if [[ "$device_size" ]] && (( end > $device_size ))

Frankly and simply put:  
Since a longer time I have the dim feeling the whole  
partitioning calculation code needs some "cleanup".

But currently I fail to understand how the  
partitioning calculation code works, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269\#issuecomment-290032733](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269#issuecomment-290032733)  
and subsequent comments.  
I need much more time to thoroughly look at it  
but currentyl I do not have that time for ReaR.  
Perhaps at the eariest in May I have again  
more time to work on ReaR.

And I never really used or tested the disk migration mode.

In general I think disk migration is a bottomless (snake)-pit.

I think we should not even try to do things right like migrate  
a system on a single 150 GiB traditional spinning harddisk  
onto two SSDs each with 100 GiB.

But I think what must work with ReaR is to migrate  
a system on a single disk onto a single bigger disk.

I think what may work with ReaR is to migrate  
a system on several disks onto same-or-bigger disks like  
a 100 GiB /dev/sda onto a new 100 GiB /dev/sda and  
a 200 GiB /dev/sdb onto a new 300 GiB /dev/sdb

But this case could become tricky e.g. for things like  
a 100 GiB /dev/sda onto a new 200 GiB /dev/sda and  
a 200 GiB /dev/sdb onto a new 200 GiB /dev/sdb  
or even  
a 100 GiB /dev/sda onto a new 300 GiB /dev/sda and  
a 200 GiB /dev/sdb onto a new 200 GiB /dev/sdb

Hopefully I find some time during May  
to have a closer look what the partitioning code  
actually does - but no promises...

@ProBackup-nl  
I found no time to check the details  
but I guess this issue here is related to  
wrong partitioning calculation results on bigger disks  
that meanwhile should (hopefully) be fixed  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332)
merged.

Now 'bc' is used for partitioning calculations  
so that now 'bc' is a mandatory tool for ReaR  
('bc' is in REQUIRED\_PROGS in default.conf).

I close this issue because I assume it is fixed  
by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332)  
If not, please reopen it.

@jsmeix There is not likely a math issue here, because the system hasn't
got `mawk` on board:  
`which: no mawk in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl)`
only the unaffected GNU awk is running on the source OS:

    # ls -l /usr/bin/awk
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Nov  6  2016 /usr/bin/awk -> gawk
