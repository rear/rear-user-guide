-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-an-Recover 2.6-git.4108.0f2f4a02.master / 2020-08-07

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.


    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM
    ##EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "$EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" '/dev/drbd0' 'drbd' )
    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" drbdadm drbd8-utils )

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I have an Ubuntu 18.04 server that has drbd device /dev/drbd0.  
When performing a ReaR recovery it fails to execute drbdadm stating

    execvp() failed to exec drbdadm-84: No such file or directory

I have attempted to include drdbadm in the /etc/rear/local.conf and  
still have the issue where drbdadm will not execute.

    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM
    #EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "$EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" '/dev/drbd0' 'drbd' )
    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" drbdadm drbd8-utils )

    LogPrint "Creating DRBD resource r0"
    if ! drbdadm role r0 &>/dev/null ; then
       drbdadm -- --force create-md r0
    fi
     
            if ! drbdadm role r0 &>/dev/null ; then
               drbdadm up r0
               drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary r0
            fi
    component_created "/dev/drbd0" "drbd"
    else
        LogPrint "Skipping /dev/drbd0 (drbd) as it has already been created."
    fi

-   Workaround, if any:

To workaround the issue I exclude the /dev/drdb0 and drdb  
from the recreate by modifying the /etc/rear/local.conf

    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM
    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "$EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" '/dev/drbd0' 'drbd' )
    #PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" drbdadm drbd8-utils )

I never used DRBD nor do I use Ubuntu so I cannot reproduce things
myself.

From what I see in the ReaR scripts

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -i 'DRBD' | grep PROGS

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/250_drbd_layout.sh:
    grep -q '^drbd ' $DISKLAYOUT_FILE && REQUIRED_PROGS+=( drbdadm ) || true

    usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/290_include_drbd.sh:
        REQUIRED_PROGS+=( drbdadm drbdsetup drbdmeta )

it seems all what gets included for DRBD by default in the ReaR recovery
system  
are the programs `drbdadm` `drbdsetup` `drbdmeta`  
but none of the DRBD versioned binaries like `drbdadm-84`.  
(I found
[https://bugs.gentoo.org/698304](https://bugs.gentoo.org/698304) that
tells about DRBD versioned binaries.)

So I think what is missing is to also get the DRBD versioned binaries  
like `drbdadm-83` and `drbdadm-84` included in the ReaR recovery
system  
so that DRBD setup during "rear recover" could succeed.

@b2blaycock  
I don't know what `drbd8-utils` is.  
I guess this is not a program but a software package name  
but `PROGS` does not work for software packages,  
see its description in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1226](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1226)

    # Program files (as found in PATH) to include in the rescue/recovery system:
    # These progs are optional, if they are missing, nothing happens
    PROGS=( )
    #
    # Required programs in the rescue/recovery system:
    # Same as above, but if they are missing, we abort.
    REQUIRED_PROGS=(

and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1375](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1375)

    # To get non-mandatory programs into the recovery system, use the PROGS array.
    # To get mandatory programs into the recovery system, use the REQUIRED_PROGS array.

so something like the following in /etc/rear/local.conf may help

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( drbdadm-84 drbdsetup-84 )

I don't know if there is also a `drbdmeta-84` program.

@b2blaycock Are you able to verify the advise @jsmeix proposed? If it
seems successful why not preparing a PR for the same? Thanks.
