For testing purposes it would be very convenient if Rear could be made
to work from an expanded directory without the need to install it. This
is not hard to support if we make the Rear shell script look inside the
location of its own script and use that as the base directory.

For this it is important that the structure of the source code mimics
the structure in /usr/share/rear, except for the /etc directory. This
requires \#5 to be implemented first.

This is part of the work required for the test infrastructure, so that
we do not have to create packages or modify a test system in order to do
automated testing.

This also affects \#8 because Rear packaging workflows are no longer
important if we can run it from within a source-tree.

yes, this would be nice!
