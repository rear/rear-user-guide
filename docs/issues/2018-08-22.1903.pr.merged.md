@gdha

The `is_disk_a_pv()` looks strange to me.... From my point of view, it
does exactly the opposite of what is written into the comments. By
looking into the code it should return 0 if the disk is a PV (when disk
is known as a PV in LAYOUT FILE) and return 1 when not exist or not a
lvmdev.

    # Returns 1 if the device is an LVM physical volume
    # Returns 0 otherwise or if the device doesn't exists
    is_disk_a_pv() {
        disk=$1
        if grep -q "^lvmdev .* ${disk} " $LAYOUT_FILE ; then
            return 0
        else
            return 1
        fi
    }

I see something different then what you showing above?  
Was this function modified lately, but not yet pushed into the master
branch perhaps?

@gdha, my mistake... I wasn't looking at master branch (I also need
vacation...)

So, this mean is\_disk\_a\_pv() previously return 0 when disk is a PV
and 1 if not.  
It was not what was written in the comments (opposite) but looked more
logic in my mind  
`is_disk_a_pv` return 0 means disk is a PV....

This explain why, we now have a problem and have to reverse the
logic....

But I just think that may be we should keep `620_install_grub2.sh` with
the old logic and rewrite `is_disk_a_pv` to return 0 if it is a PV and 1
if not ...  
What do you think ?

@schabrolles @rmetrich it seems the code is only used at:

    /usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:is_disk_a_pv() {
    ./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/620_install_grub2.sh:    is_disk_a_pv "$disk" && continue
    ./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/610_install_grub.sh:        if is_disk_a_pv "$disk" ; then

so it would be easy to make a decision here, right?

@schabrolles Maybe I shouldn't have changed the code. For sure there is
some oddity here.

@schabrolles @rmetrich Perhaps go back to the original return codes as
now it has been reversed and breaking recoveries

@gdha Maybe we should keep c260234 but restore the old `is_disk_a_pv()`
function.  
We should also correct the comments to reflect how the function really
behaves (return 0 when is a pv and 1 when it's not) in order to avoid a
future mistake.

    # Returns 0 if the device is an LVM physical volume
    # Returns 1 otherwise or if the device doesn't exists
    is_disk_a_pv() {
        disk=$1
        if grep -q "^lvmdev .* ${disk} " $LAYOUT_FILE ; then
            return 0
        else
            return 1
        fi
    }

@schabrolles @rmetrich After reading the content of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1897](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1897)
we might break it again for lvmdev uuid. Therefore, I'm not in favour of
going back to the original code.

Perhaphs, it is better to keep the function as it is now and write some
good comments in the 2 scripts were it is used?

@schabrolles @rmetrich If there are no objections I would like to merge
it somewhere during the course of next Monday?

I do not like that one particular `is_specific_type` function has
inverse logic  
(i.e. returns 1 = `bash false` if something is of that specific type)  
compared to our other `is_...` functions (that would return 0 =
`bash true`).

Accordingly I would like to align the `is_disk_a_pv` function  
with our other `is_...` functions and let it return 0 if disk is a PV  
and also fix where the `is_disk_a_pv` function is called.

I fear if I do not align the `is_disk_a_pv` function with our other
`is_...` functions  
we (or our successors after some years) will be hit by this
inconsistency.

@jsmeix The reason of the inversion is in the function itself:

    is_disk_a_pv() {
        disk=$1

        # Using awk, select the 'lvmdev' line for which $disk is the device (column 3),
        # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1897
        # If exit == 1, then there is such line (so $disk is a PV),
        # otherwise exit with default value '0', which falls through to 'return 0' below.
        awk "\$1 == \"lvmdev\" && \$3 == \"${disk}\" { exit 1 }" "$LAYOUT_FILE" >/dev/null || return 1
        return 0
    }

The awk exits with 1 when it hits a PV - I wanted to avoid rethinking
this **awk**ward statement.  
The function was re-written by @rmetrich

@gdha  
I know about that `awk`-ward code because I also approved  
that changes in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1897](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1897)
;-)

Offhandedly I think the following would result the normal logic

<pre>
is_disk_a_pv() {
    disk=$1
    # Using awk, select the 'lvmdev' line for which $disk is the device (column 3),
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1897
    # If awk exit == 1, then there is such line so $disk is a PV
    # and then we let this function return 0
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1903#issuecomment-420943026
    # otherwise continue and return 1
    awk "\$1 == \"lvmdev\" && \$3 == \"${disk}\" { exit 1 }" "$LAYOUT_FILE" >/dev/null || return 0
    return 1
}
</pre>

Or do I perhaps misunderstand some special `awk`-ward behaviour?

E.g. what happens when `awk` exits with exit code 2 because of a fatal
error  
or what happens when `awk` exits with exit code 1 because of a normal
error?

I think currently the is\_disk\_a\_pv function also results that $disk
is a PV  
in case of any error in `awk`.

@rmetrich  
could you explain why you did not use what seems to be more
straightforward:

<pre>
awk "\$1 == \"lvmdev\" && \$3 == \"${disk}\" { exit 0 }" "$LAYOUT_FILE" >/dev/null && return 0
return 1
</pre>

Probably I misunderstand something here because  
I am really not an expert in using `awk`-ward tools ;-)

Oops, sorry for introducing this powerful `awk` line :-)  
The awk command will `exit 1` if the disk is a PV (`lvmdev`). If no such
line is ever hit, then awk will `exit 0` which is normal return code for
commands.  
If you exited prematurely with `exit 0` in case of PV, how would you let
awk exit with 1 as normal return code? That's just not possible.

@rmetrich  
many thanks for your promt explanation - it helps me a lot.

Is that awk line also sufficiently fail safe to let the  
is\_disk\_a\_pv function result "the right thing"  
even in case of errors in awk?
