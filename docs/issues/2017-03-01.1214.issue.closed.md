[\#1214 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1214) `closed`: Add support for Arch Linux systemd-boot f.k.a. gummiboot (UEFI boot)
=======================================================================================================================================

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `discuss / RFC`

[systemd-boot](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/)
(f.k.a. [gummiboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummiboot_(software)))
is a simple UEFI boot manager which executes configured EFI images.
[systemd-boot](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/)
is included with the systemd, which is installed on an **Arch Linux**
system by default.

Change in Relax-and-Recover:

-   remove Syslinux dependency at
    [/usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340\_find\_mbr\_bin.sh:22](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh#L22)

Detection on x86-64 systems:

-   file exists: `/boot/loader/loader.conf` (optional, systemd-boot can
    even boot without this file)
-   file exists: `/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi`
-   file exists: `/boot/EFI/Boot/BOOTX64.EFI`
-   at least 1 file matching `/boot/loader/entries/*.conf`
-   `/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi` is identical to
    `/boot/EFI/Boot/BOOTX64.EFI` (md5sum)

Mkrescue command needs to copy at least these files to the new recovery
partition to reach a recovery prompt:

-   `/boot/initramfs-linux.img`
-   `/boot/intel-ucode.img`
-   `/boot/vmlinuz-linux`

Optional copy:

-   `/boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img`

For each recovery menu line create a corresponding .conf file at
*recoveryESP*/loader/entries/.

Create *recoveryESP*/loader/loader.conf file, with contents like:

-   `timeout 999999` (0 will not show a menu)
-   `editor   1`

@gozora Some hints on whether this "feature request" fits
Relax-and-Recover, and how/where to plug this in, are welcome. I would
guess next to Lilo and Grub.

@ProBackup-nl  
what is the reason behind why ReaR should also support  
systemd-boot/gummiboot?

Is it that systemd-boot/gummiboot is used as bootloader  
on the original system and during "rear recover" ReaR  
must reinstall the systemd-boot/gummiboot bootloader  
in the recreated system (i.e. via chroot into /mnt/local/)?

Or is it that systemd-boot/gummiboot should be used as  
bootloader of ReaR's own recovery system?

In the latter case I wonder why ReaR should support  
two bootloaders for its own recovery system because  
that would mean we need someone who implements it  
and then - even more important - who continuously  
maintains this functionality (i.e. updates and bugfixes).  
Would you @ProBackup-nl do that?

From my point of view the only reason why to use another  
bootloader for ReaR's own recovery system would be  
when the current syslinux is actually insufficient.

Furthermore in general regarding what to use as future  
bootloader for ReaR's own recovery system see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764)

@jsmeix  
The latter is my request: systemd-boot/gummiboot should be used as
bootloader of ReaR's own recovery system.

When ReaR would support systemd-boot/gummiboot then no extra 4.61 MiB of
syslinux-6.03-6 software installation is needed for Arch Linux systems,
because [a default Arch Linux installation already contains
systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot).

@ProBackup-nl so what about non-UEFI systems? I think your suggestion is
worth following after we get rid of supporting BIOS booting.

OTOH I think that we also should consider GRUB as the "universal" boot
loader for the ReaR rescue system as it probably supports most if not
all of our platforms.

With regard to detection, IMHO the only way to go is to check the output
of `efibootmgr` and follow the breadcrumb trail from there:

    $ sudo efibootmgr -v
    BootCurrent: 0000
    Timeout: 5 seconds
    BootOrder: 0000
    Boot0000* ubuntu    HD(1,GPT,ef2a7e35-5378-4d76-8d7c-024c8f67de08,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi)

Once you do that you will know for sure how this system was booted.
Everything else is just blind guessing. That it IMHO actually a big
advantage of UEFI in general, that we can actually ask the UEFI BIOS
about how it boots the computer.

While I wholeheartedly support the beauty of systemd and its holistic
approach to Linux, ReaR must keep supporting older systems. Therefore we
either split the relevant code paths in ReaR into a legacy and a systemd
path or we stick with the legacy stuff till nobody needs it any more.

If your goal is reducing the size of the rescue system then firmware is
indeed a good start, if you are willing to compromise on hardware
support during recovery. Otherwise please note that most backup software
adds 50-300MB to the rescue image size when included. And that is still
the primary use case for ReaR: Supplementing backup software with true
bare metal disaster recovery. Optimizing the rescue image size for the
included backup methods (tar, rsync ...) will therefore only help a part
of our users and even that depends on the other things that they choose
to include.

@schlomo Regarding "non-UEFI systems"? They will still use the
mechanisms that are currently in ReaR.

There are even more UEFI booted situations:

    # efibootmgr -v
    No BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery

With my little knowledge of ReaR I would start inserting code into
[rear/usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340\_find\_mbr\_bin.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2c12a52b3322f833c81cae2a8bc5baa799c3187d/usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh).

For the suggestion to split the relevant code paths in ReaR into a
legacy and a systemd path, at which file would you start the split?

Not including `rsync` is a bad example to reduce space for someone that
is willing to use RBME. I hope that RBME will not add 300MB :-)

I can say that e.g. SLES11 SP4 uses elilo once installed on UEFI.

An example: having set the EFI boot menu using `efibootmgr`, after the
first reboot the EFI boot menu can be completely vanished:

    # efibootmgr -v
    No BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery

I will also add some minor improvements, including labelling the GPT
partitions so `parted ... print `will show partitions with information
that gives more clues what the purpose of each partition is:

    Number  Start    End       Size      File system  Name      Flags
     1      4.00MiB  100MiB    96.0MiB   fat16        EFIBOOT   boot, esp
     2      100MiB   14906MiB  14806MiB  ext2         REARDATA

Instead of:

    Number  Start    End       Size      File system  Name  Flags
     1      4.00MiB  100MiB    96.0MiB   fat16              legacy_boot

Still stuck at the kernel panic. The current Arch Linux kernel is build
like:

    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=m
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT=16 #number
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=16384 #size in kb

Where `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=m` makes the RAM drive a module. Though I yet
can't find which file name the module carries. What are the chances that
`CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=m` makes  
it impossible to pass an `initrd` image since `populate_rootfs()` in
`init/initramfs.c` omits  
code for checking whether the image is an initrd or not?

initramfs unpacking failed: junk in compressed archive
------------------------------------------------------

This error is caused by the the lz4 initramfs compression I added in
\#1218. When switching back to "**fast**" initramfs compression, the
systemd-boot (menu) boot to Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git succeeds.

EFISTUB boot loader
===================

Now systemd-boot boot loader is implemented at
[100\_create\_efiboot](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c4754a35dc70fae8ad913f991ff8ea0051fefbf5/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh)
it is time to work on the EFISTUB boot loader using the UEFI boot menu.
That is the boot loader menu that is integrated into the UEFI firmware.

Mmm, there already is
[.../finalize/Linux-i386/230\_run\_efibootmgr.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2c12a52b3322f833c81cae2a8bc5baa799c3187d/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/230_run_efibootmgr.sh).

Why isn't that script executed upon `rear mkrescue`?

My guess, because the script is in the folder `Linux-i386` instead of
`GNU/Linux`.

Can't this script be moved to `default`?

@ProBackup-nl  
in general regarding why some scripts are sourced or not  
see the SourceStage function in  
lib/framework-functions.sh

I.e. something like .../stage\_name/default/123\_foo.sh  
gets always souced for stage 'stage\_name'  
but .../stage\_name/Linux-i386/456\_bar.sh  
is only souced when one of those zillions of variables  
that are tested in the SourceStage function is "Linux-i386".

Caution with moving a script to 'default' because then  
this script is sourced in any case.  
I would recommend to better set one of those zillions  
of variables right for Arch Linux so that  
finalize/Linux-i386/230\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
gets sourced.

How to set those variables right for Arch Linux see  
the SetOSVendorAndVersion function in  
lib/config-functions.sh  
There is already a (*archlinux*) case but I assume  
this needs some enhancements to actually work well.

Regarding what stages are sourced for a workflow,  
see the WORKFLOW\_workflow\_name functions  
in the lib/workflow\_name-workflow.sh scriprts,  
e.g. for the 'recover" workflow  
the WORKFLOW\_recover function  
in lib/recover-workflow.sh

When my head is clearer I will try again to have a look at why

Does this `-d -D` debug logging snippet means that
/finalize/Linux-i386/230\_run\_efibootmgr.sh gets executed?

    ++ [[ ! -d /root/rear/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/230_run_efibootmgr.sh ]]
    ++ [[ -x /root/rear/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/230_run_efibootmgr.sh ]]
    ++ echo /root/rear/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/230_run_efibootmgr.sh

No, I don't think that finalize/Linux-i386/230\_run\_efibootmgr.sh gets
sourced/executed here. It is a check whether the file is not a directory
and is executable.

I don't see a 'finalize' stage running on `mkrescue`. Maybe 'finalize'
only executes on `mkbackup`.

The stages I see at `mkrescue` are in order of occurence:

1.  init
2.  prep
3.  layout/save
4.  rescue
5.  build
6.  pack
7.  output

@ProBackup-nl Use the `-s` option with the workflow to see which scripts
will be executed in which order.

[usr/share/rear/lib/recover-workflow.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/d15591e65461dfa43df6b7dbf23015d8e5598648/usr/share/rear/lib/recover-workflow.sh#L16)

        SourceStage "layout/prepare"
        SourceStage "layout/recreate"

        SourceStage "restore"

        SourceStage "finalize"
        SourceStage "wrapup"
    }

Aha, finalize is only used for the `recover` command, not for
`mkrescue`. Now I think I know that I can't move that file, and need to
duplicate most of it's code for creating an EFISTUB booted recovery
medium.

It wasn't clear to me, that there is no *finalize* phase available in
`mkrescue`.

@ProBackup-nl According your last comment is this PR obsolete, or does
it need some rework?

@gdha Here I lost track. First it took me a week to create the changes,
and afterwords another week (mostly fumbling with git to get the changes
uploaded) to re-create and upload the changes a second time. I am
passing the on this PR due to "lost interest".

Based on the above comments we close this issue until the need
re-arises.
