-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system.  
    The behaviour in the recovery system was simulated and tested via

<pre>
# touch /etc/rear-release

# usr/sbin/rear help

# usr/sbin/rear -v help

# usr/sbin/rear -s help

# rm /etc/rear-release
</pre>

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Now `rear -s dump` and `rear -s help` work and  
    the help workflow is supported in the running recovery system.

Tested that all workflows i.e. all `usr/share/rear/lib/*-workflow.sh`  
now support to be run in simulation mode via

<pre>
# for w in $( ls -1 usr/share/rear/lib/*-workflow.sh | cut -d '/' -f5 | cut -d '-' -f1 ) ; do read -p "running 'rear -s $w' " ; usr/sbin/rear -s $w ; echo ========================= ; done
</pre>
