-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I am using REAR with NetBackup 8.1.2.

If I restore BMR backups with "ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES" selection, I can only
restore full backups, Differential backups are not restored OK because
NetBackup restores all the data of the server from the date and time
answered in the REAR process question to the past: mix policies and do
not take in account the relation between the differentials and full
backups, etc. Basically, NetBackup restores all the data about the
server he finds. The server boots OK but the restore is not consistent.

If I restore Standard or TIR (True Image Restore) backups with
"ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES" selection the data restored it seems perfect but
the server does not boot OK, the server boots in the Emergency Mode and
with the dracut prompt (see the screens attached).

If I restore Standard or TIR (True Image Restore) backups selecting/mark
all the folders of the server but not with "ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES" option
and full and differential backups, the data restored is perfect and the
server boots OK. The problem is I cannot use the "ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES"
option and this is not operative.

I do not know what is the difference for REAR or NetBackup between use
the "ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES" option or mark all the folders of the servers
but it seems this is the key.

The ideal scenario for me it would be NetBackup backup type standard,
BMR or TIR and the "ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES" selection.

I have tried everything... Mainly in the "bprestore" command in the
"400\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh” but I had not luck... I have tried in the
command the parameters TIR (-T), end time date (-e), start time date
(-s), policy (-p), etc.

I run out of ideas... I do not know what I can do more...

Many thanks.

@cge77  
not that it actually helps you with this particular issue  
but in general see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads in particular (excerpt)

    ... Usually only basic support for the various backup tools
    is implemented in ReaR (i.e. plain making a backup
    during "rear mkbackup" and plain restore during "rear recover").
    It is very different to what extent support for each individual
    backup tool is implemented in ReaR because support for each
    individual backup tool is implemented separated from each other.
    Therefore for some particular backup tools the current support
    in ReaR could be even only "very basic" ...

I guess what you ask for here

    NetBackup ... restore ... differentials and fulls backups
    with NetBackup backup types standard, BMR
    or True Image Restore and "ALL_LOCAL_DRIVES" selection

is perhaps not (yet) supported by the NetBackup code in ReaR.

In general regarding issues with third party backup tools:  
Usually there is nothing at all what we at ReaR upstream  
could do in case of issues with third-party backup tools  
because usually we do not have such software  
(in particular not when it is proprietary software  
according to
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBackup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBackup))  
so that we can neither test nor reproduce anything.  
Therefore for issues with third party backup tools  
you shoud also ask for help and support where  
you got your particular third party backup tool.

Hi jsmeix.

Thanks for the fast response.

Yes, I know and understand the support for third party tools as
NetBackup is limited here. I exposed my case here because I understand
some people is treating the integration of REAR and NetBackup and it is
possible they have encountered the same or similar problems.

In general, I see the integration of REAR and NetBackup is complex. As
you said, the basic functionalities work but if you want to do something
more advanced and professional, is difficult.

For example, you can restore the last full backup of a server perfectly
if the last backup of your server is a backup of all the data of the
server, if the last full backup of your server is a backup only of the
"/var" folder, REAR and NetBackup only will restore the "/var" folder.
Other topic is one of I mentioned in my first post, in many occasions
the restore does not take in account the relation between the
differentials and full backups and restore all the data about the server
he finds. Gives the impression you have to configure all in a determined
way to restore the server consistent.

Well, I continue with the fight :)

Thanks and regards.

Hi.

I am still in the fight :)

The data restore is OK but the server only boots with the rescue boot.
If I try a normal boot the server shows the message
"/dev/mapper/vg00-root does not exist" and the dracut shell. I am
investigating if it is possible to do any action in the rescue boot to
fix the normal boot of the server. Any help is appreciated :D

Thanks and regards.

Hi.

I got it :) We are able to restore BMR full and differential incremental
backups. The key is the "bprestore" command has to be as follows:

    bprestore_args="-B -H -L $TMP_DIR/bplog.restore -8 -R $TMP_DIR/nbu_change_file -t 0 -w 0 -e ${edate} -p <policy_name> -T -C ${NBU_CLIENT_SOURCE} -D ${NBU_CLIENT_NAME} -f $TMP_DIR/restore_fs_list"

The most important parameters of the "bprestore" command are:

`-e ${edate}`: date and time of the backup we want to restore. The
parameter “-e” means "end date and time of the backup".

`-p`: policy name of the backup we want to restore. This parameter is
useful to specify and control only we restore backups of this policy. It
is essential because without this parameter NetBackup restores other
policies that backup the server to restore.

`-T`: restore a BMR backup. This parameter controls the relation between
the differential incremental backups and the full backups. As the
parameter "-p", the parameter "-T" is a control parameter to avoid
NetBackup restores all the data about the server he finds, without this
parameter, NetBackup do not take in account the relation between the
differential incremental backups and the full backups.

With this parameters, REAR and NetBackup restore full and differential
incremental backups in a consistent way.

One important topic, the NetBackup backups has to be BMR backups. The
backup data selection we use is "ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES".

I wanted to share with the community in case someone is fighting with
the integration of NetBackup and REAR and can help :D

Thanks and regards.

Hi again.

One essential topic I forgot comment in the last post. If the servers
does not boot in the Normal Mode, boot the server in the Rescue Mode and
execute this command:

    dracut --regenerate-all -f && grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

And then, boot the server in Normal Mode and the server is recovered. My
opinion is REAR and NetBackup touch the boot configurations as MBR,
GRUB, boot, kernels, etc; and we have to use the "dracut" command to fix
these configurations.

I have used Red Hat to do the tests.

Thanks and regards.

@cge77  
can you post or attach your whole ReaR script here  
that contains your modified "bprestore" command  
so that I (as non NetBackup user) have at least a chance  
to understand what you are talking about.  
Thank you in advance!

Hi Jsmeix.

Yes, sure.

The script I edited is the
"/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/400\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh".
Basically, is the original script but with the first "bprestore" command
modified with these parameters: "-p &lt;nbu\_backup\_policy\_name&gt;
-T".

    # 400_restore_with_nbu.sh
    # restore files with NBU

    LogPrint "NetBackup: restoring / into $TARGET_FS_ROOT"

    echo "change / to $TARGET_FS_ROOT" > $TMP_DIR/nbu_change_file

    # Do not use ARGS here because that is readonly in the rear main script.
    # $TMP_DIR/restore_fs_list was made by 300_create_nbu_restore_fs_list.sh
    if [ ${#NBU_ENDTIME[@]} -gt 0 ] ; then
        edate="${NBU_ENDTIME[@]}"
        bprestore_args="-B -H -L $TMP_DIR/bplog.restore -8 -R $TMP_DIR/nbu_change_file -t 0 -w 0 -e ${edate} **-p <nbu_backup_policy_name> -T** -C ${NBU_CLIENT_SOURCE} -D ${NBU_CLIENT_NAME} -f $TMP_DIR/restore_fs_list"
    else
        bprestore_args="-B -H -L $TMP_DIR/bplog.restore -8 -R $TMP_DIR/nbu_change_file -t 0 -w 0 -C ${NBU_CLIENT_SOURCE} -D ${NBU_CLIENT_NAME} -f $TMP_DIR/restore_fs_list"
    fi

    LogPrint "RUN: /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bprestore $bprestore_args"
    LogPrint "Restore progress: see $TMP_DIR/bplog.restore"
    LANG=C /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bprestore $bprestore_args
    rc=$?
    if (( $rc > 1 )) ; then
        Error "bprestore failed (return code = $rc)"
    fi

With these 2 parameters and the parameter "-e ${edate}" you get the
next:

`-e ${edate}`: date and time of the backup we want to restore. The
parameter “-e” means "end date and time of the backup".

`-p`: policy name of the backup we want to restore. This parameter is
useful to specify and control only we restore backups of this policy. It
is essential because without this parameter NetBackup restores other
policies that backup the server to restore.

`-T`: restore a BMR backup. This parameter controls the relation between
the differential incremental backups and the full backups. As the
parameter "-p", the parameter "-T" is a control parameter to avoid
NetBackup restores all the data about the server he finds, without this
parameter, NetBackup do not take in account the relation between the
differential incremental backups and the full backups.

With these parameters, REAR and NetBackup restore full and differential
incremental backups in a consistent way.

Other important topics are:

-   The NetBackup backups must be BMR backups.

-   If after the recovery, the servers does not boot in the Normal Mode,
    boot the server in the Rescue Mode and execute this command:

<!-- -->

    dracut --regenerate-all -f && grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

And then, boot the server in Normal Mode and the server is recovered. My
opinion is REAR and NetBackup touch the boot configurations as MBR,
GRUB, boot, kernels, etc; and we have to use the "dracut" command to fix
these configurations. I have used Red Hat to do the tests.

This is all. With this, you have fully integrated REAR with NetBackup at
less for Red Hat.

Thanks and regards.

P.D.: you have also touch other configuration files as, for example, the
"/etc/rear/local.conf" to load the NetBackup Client in the REAR ISO or
create a new script for the ISO to start the NetBackup PBX service, but
these are standard actions, it is easy to find in Internet how to do it.
