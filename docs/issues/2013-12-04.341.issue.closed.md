Hi

I've found an interesting issue while updating the Debian package on a
couple of our system that used the package from OBS.

Although the source suggests (packaging/debian) that local.conf should
be considered as config file and thus not be overwritten - it still
happens.

Is it a problem with OBS or with the packaging?

I noticed that already a few years back and was not able to tell the
reason  
because I don't know enough about how DEB packages function internally.
Can  
you please post this onto the mailing list, maybe now we have someone
with  
more DEB packaging know-how.

Thanks, done:
[http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2013-December/002829.html](http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2013-December/002829.html)  
Would great if someone comes up with an idea :-)

Currently my "workaround" that I've found is placing local.conf in an
alternate location that doesn't get touched by a rear package update and
running rear with the option for using that directory for
configurations.  
(i.e. `rear -c /etc/rear.local mkbackup`)

Btw. What about site.conf? If that is not part of the package then just
use  
it. It is meant for that purpose.

Yes, that one is not part of the package, thanks for heads-up! üëç

Nonetheless, fixing this behavour would make things more consistent.

the following page might shows us how to fix this?

‚ÄãThanks but both links don't tell us why OBS-built DEBs lack the
conffiles.  
I tried adding it to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-1.15](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-1.15)
but  
it did not help (BTW, rear-1.15 builds had been lacking previously??).

According to
[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build\_Service\_Debian\_builds](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Debian_builds)
OBS  
supports two modes for DEB building: DSC based and with debian.\* files.
ATM  
it looks like we mix both ways. I think that we should switch to
DSC-based  
building as that will for sure support also conffiles.

Regards,  
Schlomo‚Äã

perhaps we could use a `preinst` script to assist in making a backup
copy of \`local.conf\`\`?

Hi (informational to this bug)

    # cat rear/packaging/debian/conffiles 
    /etc/rear/local.conf
    /etc/rear/templates/RESULT_mailbody.txt
    /etc/rear/templates/rear.help
    /etc/rear/templates/EFI_readme.txt
    /etc/rear/templates/RESULT_usage_USB.txt
    /etc/rear/templates/PXE_pxelinux.cfg
    /etc/rear/templates/RESULT_usage_PXE.txt
    /etc/rear/templates/RESULT_usage_ISO.txt
    /etc/rear/templates/ISO_isolinux.cfg

looks ok for me in actual repo (but I have no much debian package
experience yet).  
Sadly the build package still didn't know about these files...

    # dpkg-query -W -f='${Version}\t${binary:Package}\n${Conffiles}\n' "rear"
    1.16.1-1    rear

I searched a little for a nice compare package ... I think logrotate has
there easy content to add also for rear:

debian/logrotate.install:

    logrotate               usr/sbin/
    debian/logrotate.conf   etc/

and... like rpm spec ?: logrotate.spec:

    [...]
    %install
    rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT
    make PREFIX=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT MANDIR=%{_mandir} install
    mkdir -p $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%{_sysconfdir}/logrotate.d
    mkdir -p $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%{_sysconfdir}/cron.daily

    install -p -m 644 examples/logrotate-default $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%{_sysconfdir}/logrotate.conf
    install -p -m 755 examples/logrotate.cron $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%{_sysconfdir}/cron.daily/logrotate

ah, its much easier ... a program call was missing ;) =&gt;
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/474](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/474)

    # dpkg -i /usr/src/rear_1.16.1-1_all.deb 
    (Reading database ... 75201 files and directories currently installed.)
    Preparing to replace rear 1.16.1-1 (using /usr/src/rear_1.16.1-1_all.deb) ...
    Unpacking replacement rear ...

    Configuration file `/etc/rear/local.conf'
     ==> File on system created by you or by a script.
     ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
       What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
        Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
        N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
          D     : show the differences between the versions
          Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
     The default action is to keep your current version.
    *** local.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?
