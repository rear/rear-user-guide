@gozora  
while working on this I checked all `dd` comands in ReaR  
and found one remaining `dd` command without a `bs` option  
that I do not sufficiently understand to fix it myself in  
backup/BLOCKCLONE/default/500\_start\_clone.sh (excerpt):

    # BLOCKCLONE progs could be handled here
    case "$(basename ${BLOCKCLONE_PROG})" in
        (ntfsclone)
            ...
        ;;
        (dd)
            dd $BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS if=$BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV \
            of=$backuparchive
        ;;

where I think `bs=1M` could be added to also speed up things here like

        (dd)
            dd $BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS if=$BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV of=$backuparchive bs=1M
        ;;

Hello @jsmeix,

You can add `bs` option there, no problem with that.

@gozora  
I also found analogous code in
restore/BLOCKCLONE/default/400\_restore\_clone.sh  
where I also added `bs=1M`.

But there is a possible issue when e.g.  
`BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPTS="bs=4k"` is set by the user, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc)

if I did things right.

@jsmeix yes it is fine, since `dd` picks last option specified,
`BLOCKCLONE_PROG_OPT` will be able to override hard-coded value and user
will have the final word.
