@gdha  
could you please have a look if my current documentation  
for multiple backups looks o.k. for you - in particular if  
you think users can understand what I wrote in  
doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc  
Many thanks in advance!

I think the current state is good enough to be merged.  
Further adaptions and enhancements can be done  
via separated pull requests.
