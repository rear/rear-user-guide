@jsmeix  
Thanks for your fast reply.  
The mentioned patch in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)
is still not part of rear 2.7 ?

Cheers.

EDIT:  
Ah, I see... It will be added to 2.8. Cool. Thanks

@will-code-for-pizza  
I assume you could make it work for your use case  
with some setting(s) of those config variables

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB

Could you provide feedback what exact setting(s)  
made it work for you?

It is important for us at ReaR upstream to get such feedback  
so we know how far things in ReaR also work for other users.
