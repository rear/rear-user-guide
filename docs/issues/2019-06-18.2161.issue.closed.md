sudo zypper in ./rear-2.4-1.git.3250.bf91ae91.master.x86\_64.rpm  
::  
Problem: nothing provides genisoimage needed by
rear-2.4-1.git.3250.bf91ae91.master.x86\_64  
Solution 1: do not install rear-2.4-1.git.3250.bf91ae91.master.x86\_64  
Solution 2: break rear-2.4-1.git.3250.bf91ae91.master.x86\_64 by
ignoring some of its dependencies

This does not look like an issue in ReaR itself.  
ReaR just works for me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system.  
For me `rpm -q --requires rear` does not show `genisoimage`.

FWIW: Rear 2.4 is outdated, meanwhile ReaR 2.5 was released.

Sorry, this bug is in
[https://github.com/gozora/rear](https://github.com/gozora/rear) fork,
not in "upstream" rear, closing

@roseswe  
I don't think it can be called a `bug` whatever @gozora may like to
have  
in his own particular fork of ReaR for his own experiments with it.  
But it is likely a (possibly even severe) security `bug` when you try
to  
"just install" software from arbitrary foreign repositories onto your
system  
(except it is a well isolated test system).
