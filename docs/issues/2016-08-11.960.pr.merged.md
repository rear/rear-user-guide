Changed how rescue/GNU/Linux/31\_network\_devices.sh  
behaves when DHCP should be used for recovery system  
networking setup: Now in this case it does no longer generate
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
(before it generated one which does only 'return').

Added support for manual recovery system networking setup  
via NETWORKING\_SETUP\_COMMANDS, see default.conf.  
This functionality is intended to be helpful as some kind of  
"last resort" when the default automated network devices setup  
does not at all work in some special cases.  
I tested it on my SLES12-SP2-beta5 test system with

<pre>
NETWORKING_SETUP_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 10.160.64.54/16 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 10.160.255.254' )
</pre>

and for me it works.

@gdha  
please have a look in particular at this change in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31\_network\_devices.sh  
Before it was:

<pre>
# Skip netscript if noip is configured on the command line:
cat &lt;&lt;EOT &gt;&gt; $netscript
if [[ -e /proc/cmdline ]] ; then
    if grep -q 'noip' /proc/cmdline ; then
        return
    fi
fi
EOT
# Add a line at the top of netscript to skip if dhclient will be used:
cat - &lt;&lt;EOT &gt; $netscript
# if USE_DHCLIENT=y then use DHCP instead and skip 60-network-devices.sh
[[ ! -z "\$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "\$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return
...
EOT
</pre>

Therin the &gt; $netscript was plain wrong because  
it made the above &gt;&gt; $netscript useless.  
I fixed that but that is not my actual question here.

Now it is

<pre>
# When DHCP is used via 58-start-dhclient.sh do not mess up the existing networking setup
# here by possibly conflicting network devices setup via 60-network-devices.sh:
if test $USE_DHCLIENT -a -z $USE_STATIC_NETWORKING ; then
    Log "No network devices setup via 60-network-devices.sh because that happens via DHCP in 58-start-dhclient.sh."
    # To be on the safe side remove network_devices_setup_script if it somehow already exists:
    rm $v -f $network_devices_setup_script >&2
    return
fi
</pre>

This changes the behaviour becaus now it evaluates  
the USE\_DHCLIENT and USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING  
variables during "rear mkbackup" and not during booting  
in the recovery system.

But I think now it is still correct and much simpler  
because I cannot imagine how the values of the  
USE\_DHCLIENT and USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING  
variables could be changed between "rear mkbackup"  
and booting in the recovery system.

I know that after the recovery system has booted  
(i.e. after one has logged in ther as root) one  
can change /etc/rear/local.conf but then  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
was already run so that changes of the  
USE\_DHCLIENT and USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING  
variables in the recovery system have no effect on  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

Ah!  
your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/819\#issuecomment-224315823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/819#issuecomment-224315823)  
shows a real behavioural difference / regression  
because with my change there is no longer a  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
in case of DHCP.

Therefore I will change my change so that even in case of DHCP  
the /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh is  
generated as usual so that it is available in the recovery system.

@gdha  
many thanks for pointing out that regression to me!

UEFI starts to be pretty boring, so here I am messing a bit with
networking :-) (hope nobody minds).  
My first stop was *58-start-dhclient.sh* and I was a bit surprised here.

I have three basic questions (most probably for @gdha):

1.  Did I understood it well, that once original system have DHCP
    enabled on **at least** one interface, rear recover will start
    $DHCLIENT\_BIN and stop processing with remaining network
    configuration?
2.  Is it desired behavior to try to start $DHCLIENT\_BIN on first
    interface only?  
    e.g. since I had eth0 connected to DHCP (network 10.0.2.0) and eth1
    to static setup (network 192.168.0.0) all was "fine", (eth0 was
    started with DHCP and eth1 left down)  
    but as soon as I "switch cables" and connected eth0 to network
    192.168.0.0 and eth1 to (10.0.2.0 - DHCP network) none of the
    interfaces went up :-( (network addresses are here only for
    illustration)
3.  do you have some documents/issues/comments/anything describing how
    you intended to setup network in rear recover phase?

I personally don't mind setting up network manually (I've used recovery
solution where I needed to load firmware to NIC prior driver loading not
talking about pure happiness when I was able to successfully finish PXE
boot without kernel panic or hang, so for me ReaR is real RELAX and
RECOVER :-)), but I've understood that your policy is to bring rear
recover to point where everything is ready.

@gozora  
I guess you mean since you fixed basically all UEFI issues  
in Relax-and-Recover UEFI starts to be pretty boring  
but you like to avoid to get over-relaxed so that now  
you intend to fix basically all networking issues ;-)  
I have great plans for you:  
After you had fixed basically all networking issues  
you could fix all systemd issues which nowadays  
include all udev issues ;-)

Seriously:  
I have to do some major changes here  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960\#issuecomment-239239792](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960#issuecomment-239239792)  
that I (hopefully) commit today...

@jsmeix actually working on ReaR gave a the reason to study UEFI and
boot loaders in more detail (there is nothing like a good motivation).
And yes, couple days ago I've started to dig into systemd, so I hope
this knowledge will become useful one day.

When talking about network automatic configuration, I'd like to know
what is ReaR policy:

-   would you like to have network configured exactly same way as on
    original system when in recovery mode (including all potentional
    networks / bonds / taps / tuns ...)
-   or having minimal network configuration that is sufficient for
    restore

?

Thanks for that link!

I still need to test it...

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960\#issuecomment-239414330](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960#issuecomment-239414330)  
what network config should be set up in the recovery system:

Personally I would prefer to do only a simple  
minimal network setup that is sufficient for restore.

But I fear enterprise users love to have complicated  
network setups where there is no such thing as a  
simple network setup that is sufficient for restore.

Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/951\#issuecomment-238651910](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/951#issuecomment-238651910)

<pre>
Unfortunately in our env we do not have DHCP assigned
IP addresses and we MUST use VLAN tagging.
</pre>

and I also remember a SUSE customer where there  
was no simple network setup that is sufficient for restore  
because he can only access his server where his backup is  
after a complicated networking setup.

Because I think it is hopeless to try to make the  
network setup automatism in Relax-and-Recover  
"just work" for any kind of complicated networking setup,  
I implemented here the new support for the  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
so that users can - if needed - specify whatever they need  
in their particular case to set up networking in the recovery system.

Well, VLAN is definitely a must have. I was rather talking about luxury
things like bonding that could be dropped in theory (during recovery
phase).  
Ok, so if we would have network in state where we car run **rear
recover** and it would work, everybody is happy. Hope I get it right ...

My current fixes and the new support for the  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
work perfectly well for me according to my test.

When I have only

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

nothing changed for me - i.e. I get only networking setup  
via DHCP via 58-start-dhclient.sh and 60-network-devices.sh  
skips with 'return'.

When I have only

<pre>
NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 10.160.4.255/16 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 10.160.255.254' 'return' )
</pre>

I get networking setup only with that commands.

When I have (same as before but without the 'return'):

<pre>
NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 10.160.4.255/16 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 10.160.255.254' )
</pre>

I get networking setup via the  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
plus the other commands in in 60-network-devices.sh - i.e. I  
get two IP addresses for 'eth0'.

When I have

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 10.160.4.255/16 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 10.160.255.254' 'return' )
</pre>

I get first networking setup via DHCP via 58-start-dhclient.sh and  
additionally via the NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
in 60-network-devices.sh - i.e. I get two IP addresses for 'eth0'.

When I have

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 10.160.4.255/16 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 10.160.255.254' 'USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="yes"' )
</pre>

I get first networking setup via DHCP via 58-start-dhclient.sh and  
then via the NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
plus the other commands in in 60-network-devices.sh - i.e. I get  
three IP addresses for 'eth0'.

Not that it makes much sense to have many IP addresses  
but I only liked to test if it works as intended.

I think I will merge it soon if there is no furious objection...

I merged it because I like it so much now ;-)

I would very much apprerciate feedback if the new  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
is really helpful to get problems with recovery system  
networking setup more easily fixed - or at least to get  
more easily a quick and dirty workaround in case of  
issues with recovery system networking setup.
