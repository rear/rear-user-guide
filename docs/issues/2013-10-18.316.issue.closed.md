hi,

currently testing backup / restore on Centos6 and RHEL 6 with latest
rear release (1.15) It seems a recovered system wont boot if selinux
still active. It complains about missing liblkid and fails to mount the
root system.

As it stands the issue is caused by selinux after recovery as described
here:

[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=451503](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=451503)

booting the recovered system with selinux=0 in grub works fine :)

It also helps to have SElinux set to PERMISSIVE after the first boot
with selinux=0, afterwards boot up the system and set it back to
enforced, then the regular boot works again with selinux enabled after
recovery.

Did you redefine `BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE=1` somehow (in
`/etc/rear/local.conf`)? By default rear will disable selinux during
backup, and creates the trigger file `/selinux.autorelabel`, so SELinux
relabels the file systems at the first reboot (after recovery).  
However, it is possible to keep SELinux enabled at backup time, but then
the `tar` command must be aware of selinux (this is done automatically).
Check for selinux in the `rear.log` file (of mkbackup and recover) to be
sure.

Ah here we go, no, i did not redefine the setting but the regular file
backup came from a third party tool! That explains it all. Just wanted
to stick something like this around in the bugtracker so people catching
the same issue know how to deal with it :) Thanks!

Was your backup tool already integrated within Rear? That is one of the
purposes of integrating the (commercial) backup programs. We can do it
for you (via sponsoring or consultancy) or you can give it a try...

Hi @sepsesam and welcome!

I talked to people from your company at every conference I had a chance
- about 5 to 6 years ago. I was trying to convince your company to
sponsor REAR a little bit to get SEP SESAM integrated into it...

It seems to me that now you did the opposite, integrating REAR into your
backup client. Is this correct? If so, it would be nice of you to link
to our homepage on your documentation Wiki... We would be happy to list
SESAM as a tool that ships REAR and point to your documentation page in
return.

If you want to talk about deeper integration strategies or how to
simplify the configuration for your users (I read the wiki, it does not
look simple to me), please don't hesitate to talk to us on the mailing
list or privately.

Another question: Do you offer commercial support for your fork of REAR?

Regards,  
Schlomo

basically we ship a slightly modified version of the REAR client with  
the SEP Sesam Backup Client. The modifications have been done to  
add some more components shipped within the generated REAR iso image,  
like the sesam backup client itself. We have written a wrapper around  
rear which allows the SEP Sesam users to backup the disaster ISO image  
via SEP Sesam and have it scheduled the way they like using the sesam  
graphical frontend. It is not rear sending the data to the SEP Sesam  
Server but the Sesam Server requesting the data from the client. While  
the file backup is done entirely by the Sesam client itself.

This way it allows our customers to use all the functions of a  
sesam server (backup to disk, tape, dedublication, migration of  
the savesets) without big changes to REAR itself.

How the users may use the REAR shipped with our sesam client beyond  
that is up to them (Usb media, pxe boot).

We have now put the Link to your Homepage on the top of the page
(before  
it was at the end of the page). Of course we will mention REAR as  
seperate project wherever we can!

As said, at the moment the fork only contains small changes, however,  
we do QA for the REAR version we ship to our customers for the  
distributions we suppport and make sure to give them best possible  
supoport for this version. Of course we will report bugfixes and  
everything we encounter back to you guys via our github repository :-)

@sepsesam is there any chance rear will ever contain a proper sepsesam
integration? Perhaps for rear-1.18 (for rear-1.17 as we froze the
feature list to get it all stable before we release it end of this
month)
