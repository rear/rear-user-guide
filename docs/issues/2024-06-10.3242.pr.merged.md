#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? with both NFS and SSHFS schemes

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Currently there is no proper support for IPv6 addresses in
`OUTPUT_URL`/`BACKUP_URL` properties:

-   `OUTPUT_URL=nfs://2001:db8:ca2:6::101/root/REAR` is not recognized
    (and should not be)
-   `OUTPUT_URL=nfs://[2001:db8:ca2:6::101]/root/REAR` fails because of
    bash substitutions occurring in various places
-   `OUTPUT_URL="nfs://\[2001:db8:ca2:6::101\]/root/REAR"` works but is
    somehow cumbersome (double quotes + square brackets quoting).

This patch makes the following (proper) scheme work with both NFS and
SSHFS:

    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://[2001:db8:ca2:6::101]/root/REAR
    OUTPUT_URL=sshfs://[2001:db8:ca2:6::101]/root/REAR

For this to occur, a lot of bash quoting had to be fixed.

@rmetrich  
awesome "convict labour"!  
Thank you so much for it!

As far as I see on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3242/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3242/files)  
missing bash quoting (at a zillion of places)  
was the only change that you needed to do?  
Or did I overlook some other changes that were needed  
to get IPv6 address support in OUTPUT\_URL/BACKUP\_URL?

Regardless if missing bash quoting was the only change  
this issue seems to a very good example why proper  
bash variable quoting is actually needed nowadays.

Let's wait and see when things like `[...]`  
will become regular characters in system file names  
or device node names and so on - then we need to add  
missing bash quoting at many more zillions of places.

Yes all this mess was due to quoting. So I did a pass on everything that
was closely related.

Provided it is OK I would like to merge it rather soon

I reviewed CI results: the Fedora 40 / Rawhide errors are known and
unrelated. There was a fail on CentOS Stream 9 due to this:

    WARNING: tar ended with return code 1 and below output (last 5 lines):
                                    ---snip---

                                  or may not be a perfect copy of the system. Relax-and-Recover
                                  will continue, however it is highly advisable to verify the
                                  backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system.

This is a harmless issue unrelated to the PR and rerun fixed it. The
check for warnings in the test should probably be less zealous.

Differential ShellCheck says:  
ℹ️ No Fixes!

which indicates that we should probably increase the strictness of the
syntax checks. This change is definitely a fix of the shell syntax that
ShellCheck is able to recognize.

@rmetrich  
take your time to fix the one mistake.  
I will not merge it today.  
I will wait until you finished.

If you find the time I would much appeciate it  
when you could add quoting where @pcahyna mentioned it  
because now we have the detailed review of @pcahyna  
which would be lost when this pull request was merged  
without the additional quoting as mentioned by @pcahyna

@pcahyna  
as always your precise and accurate review is so helpful  
in particular for our users who are hit by less bugs  
and also for us who need to fix less bugs.  
Thank you so much for it!

As far as I know our Differential ShellCheck  
only ckecks the syntax of the actual changes.

In this case I agree to try to change the level  
of our Differential ShellCheck syntax checks  
to let it report also quoting problems.

Since my

    or device node names and so on - then we need to add
    missing bash quoting at many more zillions of places.

I understand that proper quoting basically everywhere  
is needed to avoid that bash expansion - in particular  
bash pathname expansion - changes string values in  
unintended ways.

BUT:  
Proper quoting of all string values everywhere  
requires to no longer use strings for multiple values  
in one (string) variable as in

    for word in $string ; do
        CODE THAT USES $word
    done

but to always use bash arrays for multiple values  
in one (array) variable.  
And this would be a huge cleanup effort.

@jsmeix

> ... And this would be a huge cleanup effort.

Fortunately the check is differential, so it would not complain about
existing code. But, when changing existing code which uses this idiom,
one would need to do the cleanup anyway to avoid ShellCheck warnings on
the changed lines, so some cleanup would be needed from time to time
indeed.

@pcahyna  
and such small "by the way" cleanup parts step by step  
as code is touched is the intended benefit to move our  
code step by step towards porper quoting.

Let's just wait and see what happens when e.g. the line

    mount_url "$BACKUP_URL" "$BUILD_DIR/outputfs" $BACKUP_OPTIONS

is touched again and Differential ShellCheck complains  
about the unquoted `$BACKUP_OPTIONS` ;-)  
I had a look at that thingy right now and that single piece  
looks rather - well - I don't find proper words... ;-)

@rmetrich to be clear, I certainly don't want to request fixing quoting
in more and more places if the changes you already did are sufficient
for your purpose. That would be a huge effort. I merely suggested to
take the opportunity to add more quoting to lines that you already
touched, for consistency.

@rmetrich thanks you for the new changes, I reviewed all of them and
marked all comments that they address as resolved. Do you plan to
address the rest (see the unresolved comments)? Some of them are in
network protocols (CIFS, DAV) that would IMO be affected by IPv6 address
problems just as NFS was. Other issues are not related and changes would
be merely for consistency with other changes.

@pcahyna  
thank you for the two issues for the remaining missing quotings.

Because - as far as I know - no ReaR user was hit by it  
(i.e. no ReaR user reported an issue here to us)  
I think fixing the two issues is not required for ReaR 3.0  
but it should be fixed (as time permits) for ReaR 3.1.

With the additional time we may even find a way how to  
setup automated CI tests for the affected use cases.

I am in particular interested to learn how I could setup  
automated CI tests for various SUSE specific standard systems,  
cf. what I had manually tested for SLES12 and SLES15 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6\#sles](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6#sles)  
But this is something for after ReaR 3.0 was released.

@pcahyna  
if you agree I set the milestone to "ReaR v3.1"  
for those two issues.

Yes, I need to make the current test more generic though first, so that
it is easier to add variations of it without having to copy it as a
whole and modify it.

OTOH, for testing these bugs it may be helpful to add tests that are not
full end-to-end tests (backup & recovery), but just backup or mkrescue
tests, as the bugs will show up already at backup time. Such tests are
much simpler and will not need to reuse the current Anton's and Lukas's
backup&recover script. Of course this is not 100%, as the wrong quoting
may be fixed in "mkbackup" scripts but left in "recover" scripts, and
such a bug would be especially nasty from the user's POV.

Do you want full backup & recovery tests, or just mkbackup tests? The
latter are much easier. Do you want a CI test here (on GitHub, to be
triggered on every PR), or internal to SUSE? Our experience with Anton
has been that the difficult part of public testing is finding a public
infrastructure that has the features that you need. E.g. GitHub actions
do not support rebooting the machine being tested. Testing Farm does,
but you have only CentOS (Stream) and Fedora systems available in TF.
Perhaps the support for other distros will appear eventually (I know
there is already some support for Ubuntu and Debian, but not for VMs
yet). Or maybe SUSE sponsors a different public infrastructure for such
purposes?

Sure, go ahead.

Because I would like to automate what I had  
manually tested for SLES12 and SLES15 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6\#sles](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6#sles)  
I would need full "rear mkbackup" plus "rear recover" tests.

Regarding missing support for  
"rebooting the machine being tested":

My immediate offhanded and totally untested idea is  
to use 'kexec' to boot the rear recovery system, cf.  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and after "rear recover" use 'kexec' again  
to boot the recreated system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2186](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2186)

Because 'kexec' should leave the disk as is,  
it should be possible to store what we like on disk  
in the old system before 'kexec' and have that  
available in the new system after 'kexec'.  
So when we use 'kexec' to boot the recreated system  
we could add some testing scripts that are run  
at the end when the recreated system started up.

Regarding "finding a public infrastructure"  
that can run SLES12 or SLES15:

My wishful thinking is that I could provide  
a manually "ready-to-use" prepaded '\*.qcow2' image  
that can be booted by some public infrastructure  
in some QEMU/KVM virtual machine.

Cf. my

(excerpt):

    In particular I would prefer - if possible - using
    fixed OS versions for our CI tests.
    For example - if possible - by using fixed OS images
    of stable OS versions that we keep in our 'rear' space
    at GitHub under our control: First and foremost
    the stable enterprise Linux distributions RHEL and SLES

Not sure whether this will work, depends on the reason why reboot is not
possible - many test harnesses do not like to be killed and started
again - the test script needs to run uninterrupted from the start of the
test till the end. (The test harness we use in Testing Farm does not
suffer from this limitation, we can kill the script, even the whole
machine, and start it again, test will continue from the beginning.)

This would work, but you need to find an infrastructure that allows
running VMs - as the test machines are usually VMs themselves, this
requires nested virtualization working and enough resources. It looks
like in GitHub Actions this is supported now but only on larger runners
(not default):
[https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-23-hardware-accelerated-android-virtualization-on-actions-windows-and-linux-larger-hosted-runners/](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-23-hardware-accelerated-android-virtualization-on-actions-windows-and-linux-larger-hosted-runners/)

We can try if Testing Farm VMs support that.

@pcahyna  
thank you for the background information.  
Now I can a little bit better imagine  
what the root of the various problems is.  
Unsurprisingly RFC 1925 item 6a comes to mind ;-)

Yes, I think that an infrastructure that allows  
to run VMs directly (e.g. by providing a '\*.qcow2' image)  
could be the most simple and straightforward way.

As time permits I will ask at (open)SUSE  
if we perhaps already have such an infrastructure.  
E.g. currently I know basically nothing about openQA  
[http://open.qa/](http://open.qa/)  
which is what (open)SUSE uses for testing.

Fedora is also using OpenQA (
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenQA](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenQA)
), but it does not seem to solve our problems: does not look like a test
infrastructure that will provide VMs to you, but rather a test system
that you would use on an infrastructure that you already have. But I am
not sure here. Also, the description does not look like it is
particularly suitable:

> openQA is an automated test system designed around operating
> system-level testing. Its key feature is that it interacts with the

While this kind of simulated interactive testing could be somewhat
useful for ReaR, thanks to good unattended / automatic capabilities of
ReaR it is not at all the main problem to solve when starting to develop
a backup / recovery test (it is rather the interaction of the test with
rebooting the test VM itself which is the main problem).

I was more thinking about possibly "misusing" openQA  
but I it would not surprise me if openQA does not provide  
what I would like to have - nevertheless I will ask,  
perhaps someone at SUSE knows an infrastructure  
as I would like to have.

But I would like to postpone that advanced CI testing  
to after the ReaR 3.0 release (as time permits).

@jsmeix yes, certainly try asking around if there is an established way
to test on SUSE distros on public infrastructure (just like Testing Farm
is for Fedora-derived distros). Agree to keep it until after 3.0. I will
also investigate about support for spawning your VMs inside Testing Farm
VMs.
