"We don't know what the first disk will be, so we cannot be sure the
MBR"  
" is written to the correct disk(s). That's why we make all disks
bootable."

This issue is stated in the files:

rear / usr / share / rear / finalize / Linux-i386 /
21\_install\_grub.sh  
rear / usr / share / rear / finalize / Linux-i386 /
22\_install\_grub2.sh

A possible solution:  
How about using the partition UUID to discover which disk need the MBR
written to?

If the disk was replaced (or via cloning) the the UUID of the disk will
be different as well.

I have been experimenting here with vmware and I have seen that between
the original and restored disk are no differences regarding the UUID. So
after a restore, the disk which should contain the MBR is known. Just
insert UUID's into the file "/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader" and use
that after restore to find the right disk.

The `/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader` file contains the type of
bootloader (GRUB, GRUB2) keyword. I would not put too much effort to
make only one disk bootable.
