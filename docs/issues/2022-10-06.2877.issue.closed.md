The section "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
reads (excerpts)

    Preferably during development of new scripts
    or when scripts are much overhauled
    and while testing new code use 'set -ue'
    to die from unset variables and unhandled errors
    and use 'set -o pipefail' to better notice
    failures in a pipeline.
    ...
    Using 'set -eu -o pipefail' also in general
    during runtime on the user's system
    is currently not recommended because
    it is a double-edged sword which can
    cause more problems in practice
    (i.e. problems for ReaR users)
    than it intends to solve in theory.

BUT  
there is no easy to use way how to do that in practice  
i.e. how to run scripts with 'set -eu -o pipefail'  
only when testing them during development  
but not in general.

Therefore I am thinking about to add a test option '-t'  
for example like `rear -t <script_file_patterns>`  
to run matching scripts with hardcoded `set -eu -o pipefail`  
perhaps also `rear -t <script_file_patterns> -T <set_options>`  
to run matching scripts with specified `set <set_options>`  
by the Source() function in lib/framework-functions.sh  
in the same way as it is currently implemented there  
for the DEBUGSCRIPTS mode setting.
