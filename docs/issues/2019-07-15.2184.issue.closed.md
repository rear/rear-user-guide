Current ReaR master code.

Using `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` in etc/rear/local.conf  
does not enforce to have any dhclient program  
in the ReaR recovery system so that without a dhclient program  
on the original system `rear mkrescue` "just works" but results a  
partially useless ReaR recovery system where DHCP does not work.

I will fix and enhance prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh
accordingly.

The bug is when there is no dhclient program installed it results  
this /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/etc/rear/rescue.conf lines

    USE_DHCLIENT=yes
    DHCLIENT_BIN=
    DHCLIENT6_BIN=

while when there is a dhclient program installed it results  
/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/etc/rear/rescue.conf lines like

    USE_DHCLIENT=yes
    DHCLIENT_BIN=dhclient
    DHCLIENT6_BIN=dhclient6

so an additional test in prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh  
to Error out when DHCLIENT\_BIN and DHCLIENT6\_BIN are empty  
and USE\_DHCLIENT is set should be all what is needed here.
