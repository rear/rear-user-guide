-   How was this pull request tested?

I used a test system with a separated ext2 filesystem on /tmp  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2239\#issuecomment-538647867](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2239#issuecomment-538647867)

With `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )`  
I still got in disklayout.conf the ext2 filesystem on /tmp  
which is the intended behaviour.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Enhanced AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH in default.conf  
from only `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media )`  
to `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )`  
plus explanatory comment in default.conf  
how AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH works.
