On RHEL9 UEFI system + TPM2 with LUKS encrypted root partition on LVM:

    # lsblk

The `/dev/vda3` partition is also bound to the TPM2 (which leads to
having a 2nd key slot):

    # cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vda3
    [...]

      0: luks2

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The current code doesn't deal properly with multiple key slots nor
extracts the Hash that was used at LUKS creation properly. With current
code, when multiple key slots are found or PBKDF algorithm is "pbkdf2"
(instead of default "argon2id"), the disk layout file contains 2 lines
for *crypt* parameters, causing havoc during recovery because of having
new UUIDs being generated due to malformed 2nd line, e.g.:

    crypt /dev/mapper/luks-157c516f-a8a8-48f2-9b79-082ea905d73b /dev/vda3 type=luks2 cipher=aes-xts-plain64 key_size=512 hash=sha256
    sha256 uuid=157c516f-a8a8-48f2-9b79-082ea905d73b

This new code tries to do better:

-   it searches for the Hash in Keyslots section only (and falls back to
    Digests section if not found)

-   it warns the admin if multiple keyslots are in use (e.g. because of
    multiple passphrases or Clevis binding)

-   it handles the PBKDF algorithm

-   it makes sure that the *crypt* parameters are always on one line,
    e.g.

        crypt /dev/mapper/luks-157c516f-a8a8-48f2-9b79-082ea905d73b /dev/vda3 type=luks2 cipher=aes-xts-plain64 key_size=512 hash=sha256 uuid=157c516f-a8a8-48f2-9b79-082ea905d73b

@rmetrich  
thank you for your continuous improvements for ReaR,  
in particular your improvements for special cases  
could make bigger differences for business users  
who often use ReaR in special environments.

@rmetrich  
could you have a look at my remaining point  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3430\#discussion\_r1998775809](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3430#discussion_r1998775809)  
as time permits - perhaps it is already sufficiently fail-safe  
and I am just overcautious by only looking at the code  
(I did not test anything here).
