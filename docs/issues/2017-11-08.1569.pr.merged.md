Currently, some bootloader configurations do not honor the
$KERNEL\_CMDLINE configuration variable. This PR aims to fix the
situation.

Background: I am trying to integrate support for TCG Opal-encrypted
disks in ReaR. To do so, ReaR has to honor a setting like
`KERNEL_CMDLINE="$KERNEL_CMDLINE libata.allow_tpm=1"` on rescue systems.

I've tried to fix all affected spots in ReaR, but did not dare to touch
the section beginning at line 175 in
`usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh`:

    # We generate a ReaR syslinux.cfg based on existing ReaR syslinux.cfg files.
    Log "Creating /rear/syslinux.cfg"
    {
        syslinux_write <<EOF
    label rear
        say Relax-and-Recover - Recover $HOSTNAME from $time
        menu hide
        kernel $HOSTNAME-$time

    EOF

I just did not do sufficient research do discover the motivation behind
all the different syslinux configurations in that file.

Also, I am aware that duplicate code for bootloader configuration exists
and probably more stuff from
`usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh` could be used across ReaR.
It is not my intention to re-structure all that code as I do not have
the resources to test such extensive changes.

@gozora  
I dare to assign it to you because I see "bootloader"  
and the code change contains "EFI" and even "ebiso" ;-)

It seems there is also a cleanup in  
output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh
