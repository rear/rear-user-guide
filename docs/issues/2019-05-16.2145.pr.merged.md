This PR adds support for packit
[https://github.com/packit-service/packit](https://github.com/packit-service/packit),
which syncs upstream releases into downstream automatically. See docu on
packit side
[https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/README.md).

@gdha  
I dared to assign it to you  
plus review request also from @schlomo  
because I know nothing at all about such kind of things.

@phracek  
totally offhandedly (I did not yet read any documentation) your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2145/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2145/files)  
looks as if that does not sync ReaR upstream `releases`  
(the current ReaR upstream release is ReaR 2.5)  
but if it syncs the current ReaR upstream master code.

Basically, some notes about `packit`.  
What you can do with packit. First of all, and I would say the main
packit task is to update Fedora package with the latest upstream
releases. You may not care about Fedora packaging stuff, packit will do
it itself. The command for this propose is called
`packit propose-update`. We are planning to announce packit in
[https://fedoramagazine.org/](https://fedoramagazine.org/) soon.

@gdha  
thank you for the background information.  
Of course I am fine with improvements for Fedora builds.

My question
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2145\#issuecomment-493007991](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2145#issuecomment-493007991)  
is mainly about building a released ReaR version versus building our  
current (possibly unstable work-in-progress) upstream master code.
