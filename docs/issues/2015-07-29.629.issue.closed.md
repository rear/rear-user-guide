@k0da (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/627](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/627))
found the following issue:

"BuildArch noarch" contradicts arch specific bootloader RPM requirement.

Currently rear.spec contains (excerpt):

<pre>
BuildArch: noarch
...
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Requires: syslinux
%endif
%ifarch ppc ppc64
Requires: yaboot
%endif
</pre>

This cannot work because when it is built for "noarch" none of the
%ifarch matches which means neither syslinux nor yaboot will be required
by the resulting \*.rpm package.

In general I think rear should not be built as "noarch".

I think rear should be built as a regular architecture dependent
package.

Reasoning:

In fact rear is not "noarch" because it only works on those
architectures that are explicitly supported by rear.

Of course the rear bash scripts can be installed on any architecture
just as any binaries can be installed on any architecture.

But I think the meaning of architecture dependent packages is on what
architectures they will work.

I think instead of "noarch" in the spec file only those architectures
that are actually supported by rear should be explicitly listed.

Additionally this would avoid that the rear bash scripts can be "just
installed" on architectures that are actually not supported by rear
(e.g. IBM z Systems).

@jsmeix good point and convincing for me. The RPM that we build for a
specific platform should indeed be optimized for that platform. Since a
rear RPM should be different when built for PPC or for x86\_64 it should
not be noarch. IMHO a requirement for noarch would be that the RPM is
really the same on all architectures.

Theoretically one could split the ReaR RPM into rear, rear-lib, rear-doc
etc. subpackages where only the rear package would be architecture
dependant. Or where rear-lib would be architecture dependant and only
contain the relevant paths (there was once a request for that). Or ...

But I actually think that this would be really overkill :-)

Will you provide a pull request?

Please no package split (of course unless you like to get into more
trouble ;-)

Split packages always cause issues when users install only some parts or
mix up parts that do not match together (yes of course theoretically
with sufficient RPM dependencies all that can be defined perfectly well
- provided someone actualy implements it ;-)

On Fedora it seems there are different opinions when a package is
"noarch", see  
[https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-packaging/2006-July/msg00121.html](https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-packaging/2006-July/msg00121.html)  
and the follow up mails.

The Fedora Packaging Guidelines contain  
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines\#Architecture\_Support](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Architecture_Support)

<pre>
 Requires
When your package needs the problematic dependency at runtime but not at build time then you only need to keep it from entering the package repositories for that architecture. There is a relatively simple workaround for this:
BuildArch: noarch
# List the arches that the dependent package builds on below
ExclusiveArch: %{ix86} %{arm} x86_64 noarch
</pre>

I don't know if

<pre>
BuildArch: noarch
ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64 noarch 
</pre>

is allowed and/or works on openSUSE.

I will ask how to do it correctly in the openSUSE Build Service  
and provide a pull request when I know how to do it.

I like the phrase from
[https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-packaging/2006-July/msg00130.html](https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-packaging/2006-July/msg00130.html):

    The only vaguely valid case is combining BuildArch noarch and ExcludeArch,
    which is like saying "by nature, the package contents are arch-independent, 
    but we know that there is a problem on the N excluded arches".

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2015-07-30 13:10](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/629#issuecomment-126317970):

But the same mail
[https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-packaging/2006-July/msg00130.html](https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-packaging/2006-July/msg00130.html)
also states:

<pre>
Instead of combining BuildArch noarch and ExclusiveArch, just drop
BuildArch noarch and create arch-specific packages. Especially if there
is a dependency on other arch-specific packages.
</pre>

Currently I would prefer

<pre>
ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Requires: syslinux
%endif
%ifarch ppc ppc64
Requires: yaboot
%endif
</pre>

I don't like ExcludeArch because that will silently and automatically
result non-working RPM packages when a strange new architecture gets
enabled (like ARM or whatever).

Experienced users who like to try out if a current rear also works on a
new architecture can enforce to install any RPM on their own or get the
current rear files directly from GitHub.

From my point of view a ready-to-use RPM package implicitly tells an
end-user that it is know to work which means one should not provide RPM
packages for architectures that have never been tested.

What about using recommends?

syslinux is required on x86 because it is not standard bootloader, but
the one used for isos.

For grub2, yaboot or whatever. This could be dropped. Since those are
default bootlaoders and could be used for ISO boot as well.

Recommends is a DEB concept (so far). We already had several times the  
discussion if our RPMs should require more or less packages. Different  
people have different use cases and opinions and nobody bothered to
create  
for example a rear-usb-backup subpackage that would pull in everything  
needed for bootable USB drvives...

I cannot decide here what bootloader packages should be required or
recommended because I do not have sufficient knowledge to make such
decisions.

RPM recommends also work on openSUSE (I don't remember since what exact
openSUSE version) - I use them often in my printing packages (probably
even more often than explicit requirements).

My primary concern here is how to get it solved in general that rear
"needs" (requires or recommends) architecture dependent packages.

For example if yaboot is by default installed on ppc ppc64 and also used
there to make the bootable ISO image it could be simplified to only

<pre>
ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Requires: syslinux
%endif
</pre>

In the end this should tell the end-user that rear is known to work only
on %ix86 x86\_64 ppc ppc64 and on %ix86 x86\_64 syslinux is explicitly
required (in addition to the default installed bootloader grub) to make
the bootable ISO image.

Would this work? Then it looks good to me.

I need a bit of time to test it...

The actual change was easy.

Now it is only

<pre>
ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Requires: syslinux
%endif
</pre>

Only for testing I also tried

<pre>
ExclusiveArch: %ix86 ppc ppc64
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Requires: syslinux
%endif
%ifarch ppc ppc64
Requires: yaboot
%endif
</pre>

and this does no longer build it on x86\_64 (as expected) and on ppc
there was the requirement for yaboot (but not elsewhere).  
Accordingly everything seems to "just work" as expected.

For the fun:

I had the obviously bad idea to "just by the way" also clean up the
incomplete and outdated changelog entries with one generic entry that is
always valid and that one was the real hard part - see my Git commit
comments ;-)

Right now I noticed that in openSUSE Build Service there exists also the
architectures ppc64p7 and ppc64le.

I assume when rear is supported on ppc and ppc64 then it is perhaps also
supported on architectures like ppc64p7 and ppc64le?

@k0da  
could you confirm whether or not rear is also supported on architectures
like ppc64p7 and ppc64le?

If rear is also supported on ppc64p7 and ppc64le the spec file should be
enhanced to

<pre>
ExclusiveArch:  %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64 ppc64le ppc64p7
</pre>

well, ppc64p7 is something Fedora invented. OBS supports this but we
have none SUSE distro built for it.

ppc64le definetely. Both openSUSE Tumbleweed and SLES12 have support for
ppc64 little endian

I need feedback from Fedora users whether or not rear is also supported
on ppc64p7.

For the record:

ppc64le also works on RHEL7 according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/663\#issuecomment-145797975](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/663#issuecomment-145797975)

ppc64le is added to rear.spec via

I think it is currently sufficiently solved.  
Therefore I close it.
