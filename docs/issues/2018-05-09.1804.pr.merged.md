##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    tested on POWER with sles11sp4

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Having multipathd daemon started when not needed could bring some
    side-effect on some linux distribution (like sles11sp4).  
    This could happen if you recover a system that previously used
    mutlipathed (with BOOT\_ON\_SAN=y)  
    The purpose of the PR is to unload dm-multipath module (when user
    confirm that multipath is not needed) and only start multipath
    deamon if needed.

I also print more useful info about the multpathed device discovered.  
WWID and Size could really help the user to confirm the mapping
proposed:

    Setting up multipathing
    Activating multipath
    multipath activated
    Starting multipath daemon
    multipathd started
    Listing multipath device found
    mpathc (3600507680c82004cf8000000000008d5) dm-5 IBM,2145 size=10G
    mpathb (3600507680c82004cf8000000000008d4) dm-3 IBM,2145 size=10G
    mpatha (3600507680c82004cf8000000000000d8) dm-0 IBM,2145 size=50G
    Comparing disks
    Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration
    Using /dev/mapper/mpathc (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/mapper/mpathc
    Using /dev/mapper/mpatha (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/mapper/mpatha
    Current disk mapping table (source -> target):
        /dev/mapper/mpathc /dev/mapper/mpathc
        /dev/mapper/mpatha /dev/mapper/mpatha
