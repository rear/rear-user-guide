##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): None

-   How was this pull request tested? RHEL 8.5 VM with a serial console

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Changes `usr/share/rear/lib/serial-functions.sh`.

Without this change `console=tty0` would be added whenever the last  
device returned by `get_serial_console_devices` was not classified  
as a real serial device even though the previous ones were.

Thus, the `cmdline` on a machine with `ttyS[0-3]` where only `ttyS0`  
is real was changed to

    console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0

In such case, only kernel messages would appear on `ttyS0` \[1\].

@rear/contributors  
I am not a serial console user (in particular not on my homeoffice
laptop ;-)  
so I would appreciate a review by one of you as time permits  
ideally by someonw who is a serial console user.

I am curious (I have never dived into the console code) why does ReaR
discover console devices and constructs the `console=` kernel parameters
itself. Wouldn't it be better to simply copy all the `console=` kernel
arguments from the running system? One could assume that if they were
good enough for the running system, they will be good enough also for
the rescue system (I suppose one will typically use the same console
setup for interacting with the rescue system as one usually uses for
administration of the running system).

Because I am not a serial console user I can only tell  
what I see from plain looking at the code pieces where I look at  
but I can not tell how all code in ReaR actually works in the end.

As far as I see the kernel commad line the recovery system is initially
set via  
rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
which only uses what there is in COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS  
so via COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS+=( console )  
plus likely also USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE="no" to skip the automatisms  
it should be possible for the user to copy all console= kernel
arguments  
from his running system.

I don't know why 'console' is not by default in
COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS.  
I think this is because serial console support is implemented on its
own  
based on USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE  
which is set to "yes" in
prep/GNU/Linux/200\_include\_serial\_console.sh  
when there is at least one real serial device found  
plus the other SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_... config variables.

It seems this change causes a minor regression in some cases:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)

As far as I see it (as not a serial console user)  
the change here is right (it fixes wrong working code)  
but that wrong working code had "by accident" resulted  
that `console=tty0` was appended to the kernel commandline  
which had made things work for my use case "by accident", cf.

Meanwhile I think the proposal from @pcahyna  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749\#issuecomment-1025517957](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749#issuecomment-1025517957)

    simply copy all the console= kernel arguments from the running system

is the right way for an automated serial console setup.

In particular because the primary use case for ReaR  
is to recreate a system same as it was before  
so the default assumption is that the replacement system  
is in the same environment as the original system was  
(i.e. same networking environment, same attached devices  
like disks, (VGA) monitors, keyboards, serial consoles, ...)  
so using the 'console' kernel settings from the original system  
should be the right default behaviour for the recovery system.

In general:  
Whether or not there is a 'console' setting for the  
recovery system bootloader and the recovery system kernel  
should not depend on whether or not there is a serial device.  
Instead it should depend on whether or not a serial console  
is actually used on the original system.

I think in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749\#issuecomment-1025517957](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749#issuecomment-1025517957)  
"ReaR discover console devices" is not exactly right.  
I think - as far as I understand the code in  
prep/GNU/Linux/200\_include\_serial\_console.sh

    # If possible auto-enable serial console when not specified:
    if [[ -z "$USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE" ]] ; then
        local devnode speed=""
        for devnode in $( get_serial_console_devices ) ; do
            # Enable serial console when there is at least one real serial device:
            if speed=$( get_serial_device_speed $devnode ) ; then
                USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="yes"
                break
            fi
        done
    fi

currently ReaR does not discover console devices  
(i.e. serial device nodes that are used as serial consoles)  
but it discovers serial device nodes that are real serial devices  
(regardless for what those real serial devices are used).  
So (as far as I understand it) the current code could  
auto-enable serial console for real serial devices  
that are not used as serial consoles.  
This could auto-enable output of boot messages and so on  
via serial devices that are not used as serial consoles  
which is plain wrong (perhaps even insecure or harmful).

There are two ways that I know of to get the device that `/dev/console`
actually points to:

1.  Parse `/sys/class/tty/console/active` and get the last entry. \[1\]
2.  Parse `/proc/consoles` and select a device with the `C` flag. \[2\]

Some useful info about the `console` kernel cmdline option can also be
found here \[3\].

Also, both methods can be used to list all devices that are used as
(serial) console devices at that moment.

My 2 cents: To me it looks like it depends on the kernel and its command
line only. E.g. the last console parameters in the kernel command line
is used for `/dev/console` and if no console parameters are available
`/dev/tty0` is automatically used by the kernel.

So if one requires a specific setup this should either be configured in
the kernel command line or with means of different CONSOLE variables in
the ReaR configuration. From a first look an auto detection does not
seem to add a benefit here.

Regarding the proposal from @pcahyna  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749\#issuecomment-1025517957](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749#issuecomment-1025517957)

    Wouldn't it be better to simply copy
    all the console= kernel arguments
    from the running system?

We have COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS  
but currently the code in  
rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
works only for one (the first one) kernel parameter  
for a particular kernel option name (like 'console').

So with `COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS+=( console )`  
when on the original system /proc/cmdline contains

    ... console=ttyS0,9600 ... console=tty0 ...

only `console=ttyS0,9600` gets added  
to KERNEL\_CMDLINE for the recovery system.

"rear -D mkrescue" log messages for this case (excepts):

    ++ LogPrint 'Adding console=ttyS0,9600 to KERNEL_CMDLINE'
    ...
    ++ Log 'Current kernel option [console=tty0] supperseeded by [console=ttyS0,9600] in your rear configuration: (KERNEL_CMDLINE)'

The COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS description in default.conf  
does not match what the implementation does, in particular

    If the key-value kernel parameter is already set
    in KERNEL_CMDLINE variable it will always superseed
    the one detected on the current system

is wrong because actually if such a kernel parameter key  
is already specified in the KERNEL\_CMDLINE variable  
the already specified setting will supersede the one  
detected on the current system (i.e. only the key matters,  
not the key-value) which makes sense because when some

    KERNEL_CMDLINE="option=value"

is specified a `option=different_value` in /proc/cmdline  
should be superseded by what is specified in KERNEL\_CMDLINE.

As far as I could simulate it with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2844](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2844)

    COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS+=( console )

seems to work - i.e. when /proc/cmdline contains e.g.

    ... console=ttyS0,9600 ... console=tty0 ...

then KERNEL\_CMDLINE will become

    ... console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0
