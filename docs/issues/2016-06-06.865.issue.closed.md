hi guys,

sorry if this is again discussing EFI / UEFI situation. Some of our
customers run systems  
on UEFI/EFI hardware, currently im not in the situation to have the
right hardware to test,  
(what will change) so i went on with a vmware virtual machine in EFI
mode with SLES12  
installed. I just need some input here no real bugs found so far.

How is the general workflow here? I expected a EFI bootable ISO Image to
be created, however  
the mkrescue with REAR version 1.18 created a image only bootable in
legacy BIOS. Is there  
a configuration value which changes that? I miss to see the whole point
on what is necessary and possible with version 1.18 on hardware or
virtual machines with EFI/UEFI boot, especially with SLES12 based
installations.

In short:  
To create a EFI bootable ISO image on SLE12 you need the

<pre>
ebiso
</pre>

software plus that entry in /etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso
</pre>

See the comments in the file

<pre>
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf
</pre>

which are a bit outdated because nowadays you do not need  
a rear "development snapshot" because rear 1.18 is o.k.

yes  
i just stumbled about the HANA-UEFI example, sorry! I will give it a try
:)  
In special, i is mostly SAP HANA customers having this demand currently
:)

Regardless that the rear 1.18 release should be o.k.  
there are noteworthy enhancements in the current  
rear Github master regarding create a EFI bootable  
ISO image with ebiso.

In particular the pull request \#816 from gozora/master  
Now we determine EFI virtual disk size automatically  
which greately simplifies and cleanups the code  
creating an UEFI bootable iso image.  
It was triggered by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810)

hi, thanks but currently i have to go with 1.18 here. I set the
following local.conf for a  
STOCK SLES12SP1 default installation on VMWARE with Boot mode EFI

ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso  
REQUIRED\_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED\_PROGS\[@\]}" snapper chattr lsattr )  
COPY\_AS\_IS=( "${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]}"
/usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper
/etc/snapper/config-templates/default )  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( '/var/tmp/*' '/srv/*' '/var/lib/pgsql/*'
'/var/spool/*' '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' '/var/opt/*' '/tmp/*'
'/var/lib/named/*' '/var/log/*' '/boot/grub2/i386/*'
'/var/lib/mariadb/*' '/home/*' '/var/lib/mailman/*' '/opt/*'
'/usr/local/*' '/boot/grub2/x86\_64/*' )  
EXCLUDE\_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE\_RECREATE\[@\]}" 'fs:/var/tmp' 'fs:/srv'
'fs:/var/lib/pgsql' 'fs:/var/spool' 'fs:/var/lib/libvirt/images'
'fs:/var/opt' 'fs:/tmp' 'fs:/.snapshots' 'fs:/var/lib/named'
'fs:/var/log' 'fs:/boot/grub2/i386' 'fs:/var/lib/mariadb' 'fs:/home'
'fs:/var/crash' 'fs:/var/lib/mailman' 'fs:/opt' 'fs:/usr/local'
'fs:/boot/grub2/x86\_64' )

still the iso image is not bootable from the EFI bios. Logfile looks ok,
it used ebiso:

++ /usr/bin/ebiso -v -o
/var/opt/sesam/var/lib/rear/var/lib/rear/output/rear-rear-test.iso -b
isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size
4 -boot-info-table -R -J -volid RELAXRECOVER -v -iso-level 3 .

@abbbi something went wrong there. Those options are not valid for
[ebiso](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/wiki/Usage). Maybe something
changed in SLES12 and rear did not recognized that this is EFI based
system?

There is set of checks in
`/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/25_populate_efibootimg.sh` which
must pass so rear can consider OS EFI based. If all of these checked
pass, variable `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` is set to 1.  
Can you check what is value of this variable when you run rear on your
system?

@abbbi one more thing that could actually cause the problem.  
Do you have ebiso installed on your system?

hi,

the USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER was set to 0, also it complained about the
SYSFS file structure, i could make it work with the following options
set:

USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1  
SYSFS\_DIR\_EFI\_VARS=/sys/firmware/efi/vars  
ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso  
REQUIRED\_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED\_PROGS\[@\]}" snapper chattr lsattr )  
COPY\_AS\_IS=( "${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]}"
/usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper
/etc/snapper/config-templates/default )  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( '/var/tmp/*' '/srv/*' '/var/lib/pgsql/*'
'/var/spool/*' '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' '/var/opt/*' '/tmp/*'
'/var/lib/named/*' '/var/log/*' '/boot/grub2/i386/*'
'/var/lib/mariadb/*' '/home/*' '/var/lib/mailman/*' '/opt/*'
'/usr/local/*' '/boot/grub2/x86\_64/*' )  
EXCLUDE\_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE\_RECREATE\[@\]}" 'fs:/var/tmp' 'fs:/srv'
'fs:/var/lib/pgsql' 'fs:/var/spool' 'fs:/var/lib/libvirt/images'
'fs:/var/opt' 'fs:/tmp' 'fs:/.snapshots' 'fs:/var/lib/named'
'fs:/var/log' 'fs:/boot/grub2/i386' 'fs:/var/lib/mariadb' 'fs:/home'
'fs:/var/crash' 'fs:/var/lib/mailman' 'fs:/opt' 'fs:/usr/local'
'fs:/boot/grub2/x86\_64' )  
~

and was also able boot the REAR iso image (at least with the SAFEBOOT
option, in the regular one it couldnt find initrd/kernel)

@abbbi attention regarding "EXCLUDE\_RECREATE" !

In short:  
With rear &gt;= 1.17 do no longer use EXCLUDE\_RECREATE  
in /etc/rear/local.conf for btrfs subvolumes.

Excluding btrfs subvolumes via EXCLUDE\_RECREATE was  
only needed in our SLE12-specific RPM package "rear116"  
(with SLE12-specific adaptions for btrfs support)  
but it leads to falsely excluded btrfs subvolumes from  
the backup (and restore) for all newer rear versions  
(i.e. since rear 1.17), see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821)  
in particular see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821\#issuecomment-215071027](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821#issuecomment-215071027)

The SLE\* btrfs example config files are fixed in the current  
rear Github master, see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/824](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/824)

@abbbi  
regarding USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER and SYSFS\_DIR\_EFI\_VARS:

Normally this should be set automatically in the  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/32\_include\_uefi\_env.sh  
script (note my "FIXME:" therein) - at least in the  
current rear GitHub master.

I would really appreciate it if you could at least test  
if the current rear GitHub master works better for you.

Can you test the current rear GitHub master?

@jsmeix : Thanks for all your input.

I have tested it with the actual git and it detects UEFI correctly if
local.conf is set to:

OUTPUT=ISO  
ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso

rear-test:~/rear-git \# ./usr/sbin/rear mkrescue -v -D  
\[..\]  
Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1)

The first boo toption (no Secure boot) is however broken, i will create
another issue for that.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/865\#issuecomment-224240310](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/865#issuecomment-224240310)
I consider the issue sufficiently solved.

Regarding the non-working "no Secure boot" of the  
recovery system there is

@gozora  
many thanks for your help here!
