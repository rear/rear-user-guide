-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    BIOS - VirtualBox Network boot PXE

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    After boot from network and do the root login the system doesn't
    have the correct keyboard layout, doesn't get automatically the ip
    with dhclient and other failures.  
    Also tryed with Centos7 and ReaR 1.17.2 and happens the same error.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    I have found and error when sysinit.service is starting , but
    deleting the line StandartInput=tty or adding TTYPath=/dev/tty
    inside the sysinit.service works correctly in boths testings.

@didacog  
FYI because this one contains "DRLM\_MANAGED=y"

Regarding the actual issue

<pre>
deleting the line StandartInput=tty
or adding TTYPath=/dev/tty
inside the sysinit.service works correctly
</pre>

According to  
git log -p --follow
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service  
the "StandardInput=tty" line in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service  
was set via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/dc49c6801a1536bbd02b58a54a4e09b15ba258fc](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/dc49c6801a1536bbd02b58a54a4e09b15ba258fc)

As far as I see  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service  
is a static file that is used "as is" in the ReaR recovery system  
so that it is currently the only possible way to adapt it as needed  
when things therein do not work.

@jsmeix  
Yes the issue was opened by @proura (DRLM Team) because we have this
issue, is not only a DRLM problem I guess, should be a problem for, at
least, any PXE use case.

Maybe adding TTYPath=/dev/tty to the sysinit.service will keep backward
compatibility and doesn't broke anything.

If you are agree, we can send a pull request for it if needed.

PD: for you to know of all DRLM team members for future issues and/or
contributions to ReaR.

I have been using PXE boot method during the last couple of months on a
daily basis, and never had this issue. Strange. I'll test it out myself.

@proura @didacog I've tested both methods:

    deleting the line StandartInput=tty or adding TTYPath=/dev/tty inside the sysinit.service works correctly in both testing.

and I'm sorry to say both methods seem to **fail** within a centos 7 vm.

Perhaps a stupid question (I am not at all a systemd expert):  
Is  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service  
only used in case of PXE boot  
or isn't that in general used to run etc/scripts/system-setup  
during ReaR recovery system startup?

If  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service  
is always used during ReaR recovery system startup,  
then it always also worked for me  
(I never used PXE boot - I always boot from the ISO)  
so that perhaps something special is different on  
Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 (jessie) why it does not  
work there?

@gdha I have now tried in Centos7 VM and works fine for me. I write my
steps below versions info.

-   1.  rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):

RESCUE localhost:~ \# /usr/sbin/rear -V  
Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):

RESCUE localhost:~ \# cat /etc/rear/os.conf

**Step by step solution:**

RESCUE localhost:~ \# systemctl start sysinit.service  
Job for sysinit.service **failed** because the control process exited
with error code. See "systemctl status sysinit.service" and "journalctl
-xe" for details.

@gdha  
I've also tested the steps @proura said with centOS7 VM with rear-2.0.  
Removing StandardInput=tty works, if not, fails trying to start
system-setup from sysinit.service.

@proura @didacog it might behave different with libvirt then with
virtualbox? Very weird. Will try it tomorrow on vb

Could be VBox or maybe something working different with our GRUB2 based
NetBoot. We will do more tests to find the root cause, that seems has
different results depending on the environment.

At least now we know that is working for you and maybe is something in
our env that is causing this issue with tty stdin. :)

@gdha we've tested different things and seems that is VBox and nothing
about our GRUB2 netboot. We'll wait for your tests on VBox to confirm
this.

@proura  
and what do you see when you do

<pre>
See "systemctl status sysinit.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
</pre>

?

We need the reason why sysinit.service fails.

Only a blind shot in the dark:  
In  
[https://alan-mushi.github.io/2014/10/26/execute-an-interactive-script-at-boot-with-systemd.html](https://alan-mushi.github.io/2014/10/26/execute-an-interactive-script-at-boot-with-systemd.html)  
I found

<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Simple interactive dialog window
After=getty@tty2.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dialog-hello.sh
StandardInput=tty
TTYPath=/dev/tty2
TTYReset=yes
TTYVHangup=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
</pre>

therein I noted the "After=<getty@tty2.service>"  
which leads to my blind guess that sysinit.service might fail  
because whatever precondition(s) is/are not (yet) fulfilled  
at the time when sysinit.service is run?

In particular because since udev one can no longer rely on  
"things to be just there" because since udev device nodes  
appear at arbitrary time (i.e. with arbitrary delays), cf.

@jsmeix I will take a look arround you guess, the outputs of systemctl
status sysinit.service and journalctl -xn are the next ones:

@gdha @didacog I have tried to run the same example in KVM and it works
perfectly, so the problem is something related to VirtualBox
environment.

@proura are you using VirtualBox in combination with vagrant? I've
noticed the weirdest things may happen

@gdha no, not in this case.

I have found something new about what happens.

If the option StandardInput is set to "tty" and there are not specified
the TTYPath it defaults to /dev/console. /dev/console and /dev/tty0
should be the same so if I do "echo hello &gt; /dev/console" it will
show "hello" into my actual console, as same as "echo hello &gt;
/dev/tty0"

But what happens if i try to do this in rescue mode in to my VirtualBox
VM that has not serial ports activate?

    RESCUE rear-deb8:~ # echo hello > /etc/console
    -bash: echo: write error: Input/output error

Because of this error the sysinit.service does not start. Without serial
ports in rescue mode the /dev/console is not the same as /dev/tty0. I
have enabled one serial port on my VM VirtualBox Settings and all runs
Ok!

Then I come to my KVM VM, that works perfectly, and I deleted the serial
port that is enabled by default and I get the same error. ( @gdha can
you try booting from PXE in a VM without serial ports, maybe you will
reproduce the error )

So something wrong happens if a serial-less machine is trying to get
into rescue mode.

@proura in KVM I deleted the Serial Port (in my recover vm), and the
recover worked fine. I interrupted the automatic boot and could still
write to /dev/console, /dev/tty0 and /dev/tty1. Reboot was also ok.

Only FYI in general regarding serial ports see the  
probably related USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE setting  
and the scripts which use that and do some  
"automagic things", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/937](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/937)

Perhaps when there is no serial port one must explicitly  
specify the right USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE value  
(perhaps even together with KERNEL\_CMDLINE)  
to get things right?

Hi @gdha @jsmeix,

@proura found the problem, I'd mistakenly hardcoded the kernel options
in our PXE file when I pushed this part of code for DRLM 2.0 release.  
I remember that I'd tested the serial console output with my Minnowboard
(console=ttyS0,115200n8) to ensure that our new netboot also was working
ok for serial console and, later, I merged the kernel options of my last
tests to the code.  
It just was working for us and we did not detect any issues with that,
until we started to test automatic recovery.  
Nothing is wrong with our GRUB2 configuration or the rescue sysinit
service,  
it was just my fault :-P

Well, I think that this issue can be closed and should never had been
opened if I'd reviewed my code at time of preparing the DRLM 2.0
release.

I'm sorry for all of you for the waste of your time on this... :-(

Regards,

@proura @didacog Glad the problem has been found - don't worry now we
very sure our code is robust for that particular part (at least:)

@didacog  
no need to be sorry. Mistakes happen.  
We work together to get them solved.  
And at least for me it was no waste of time  
because with each interesting issue I can  
learn something.
