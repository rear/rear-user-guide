-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.00 git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Arch rolling
    4.11.9-1
-   UEFI boot, systemd-bootloader (f.k.a. gummiboot)
-   Brief description of the issue: recover has USB keyboard failure
    (absent), I added kernel parameter `boot_debug=2` in the
    (systemd-bootloader) boot menu, now the Recover boot process waits
    for "enter" key press.

What I have understood is that [boot\_debug level 2 does output lots of
extra debugging
information](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/i386/ch05s03.html.en).
Whereas boot\_debug level 3 will run shells at various points.

I only needed extra information, so choose for `boot_debug=2`.

### Expected

Only extra output on screen.

### Reality

What happens is that the boot process stops early, waiting for keyboard
input.

    [ OK ] Started udev Kernel Device Manager.
            Starting Initialize Rescue System...
    ---> DEBUG MODE ENABLED, starting shell on tty9 <---

    * * * Configuring Rescue System * * *
    Press ENTER to run 00-functions.sh [ OK ] Started Relax-and-Recover boot script.
    [ OK ] Started udev Coldplug all Devices.

### Fix suggestion

Do not require keyboard input at boot\_debug level <strike>2</strike>
below 3.

Note: identical behaviour (asking for Press ENTER) occurs with
`boot_debug=1`  
And without boot\_debug, Rear-Recover boots till I see the ReaR
`localhost login:` prompt.

@ProBackup-nl You will find the reason in the script
`./skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup`:

    function debug() {
        read -r </proc/cmdline
        case "$REPLY" in
            (*debug*) return 0 ;;
            (*) return 1;;
        esac
    }

which means all entries with **debug** on the kernel command line will
end up in the *debug function*.

At least for me it seems to work much better with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1259](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1259)

My point here, is that the created recovery medium, responds differently
then what users might expect from boot behaviour of Linux distributions.
From both the [Debian boot parameter
documentation](https://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/ia64/ch05s03.html.en)
and [Ubuntu boot parameters
documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/i386/ch05s03.html):

> Setting this boot parameter to 2 will cause the installer's boot
> process to be verbosely logged. Setting it to 3 makes debug shells
> available at strategic points in the boot process. (Exit the shells to

>
> BOOT\_DEBUG=0
>
>     This is the default.
>
> BOOT\_DEBUG=1
>
>     More verbose than usual.
>
> BOOT\_DEBUG=2
>
>     Lots of debugging information.
>
> BOOT\_DEBUG=3
>
>     Shells are run at various points in the boot process to allow detailed debugging. Exit the shell to continue the boot. 

At boot\_debug level 0, 1 and 2, I wouldn't expect keyboard entry.  
For boot\_debug level 3, I do expect keyboard entry.

When one is diagnosing a keyboard issue, I would set `boot_debug=2` and
don't expect breakpoints to be set.

@ProBackup-nl Pull request \#1259 of @jsmeix will fix this. Just wait
until it is merged (tomorrow)

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1259](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1259)  
merged, this issue should be fixed.

@ProBackup-nl  
regarding that you wrote  
"boot\_debug level 3 will run shells at various points"  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1259](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1259)
merged  
you can now also specify on which tty ReaR will  
run its debug mode shell or skip that to avoid conflicts  
with other stuff that runs shells on whatever ttys.
