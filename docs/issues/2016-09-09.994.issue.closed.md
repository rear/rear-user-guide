Hello,  
I was looking through the documentation but couldn’t find info on these
questions..  
For the local.conf file:

1.  Can the “BACKUP\_URL=” if set to BACKUP=NETFS use HTTP?
2.  For “BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=” Is it possible to include only the
    filesytems to be backed up and exclude everything else?

Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git  
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.7 (Santiago)

Current local.conf  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/dbar  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/dbar  
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="xxxxxx"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/media'
'/var/tmp' '/var/crash')  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=

Thanks,  
John

@John-Leone The man page should explain most of it. If something is
unclear after reading the man page then come back to this issue and tell
us about it. If the docs are not clear please tell us what is confusing
you?

Thank you..  
Found what I was looking for in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf.  
I will test BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( ) & SSHFS and let you know if I have
questions.

According to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/994\#issuecomment-247429237](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/994#issuecomment-247429237)
"Found what I was looking for"  
I close it - at least for now.

@John-Leone  
I think you can still post comments here even when it is closed  
or you can re-open it if needed.  
But when you have subsequent separated issues better submit  
each of them as a new separated GitHub issue.
