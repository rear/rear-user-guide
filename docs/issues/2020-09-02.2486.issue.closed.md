Hello Support,

Is there a way I could re-create the root disk partitions using a rear
backup on a VM running in Azure?

I am able to create a "raw" backup using REAR of the VM. I can also
mount the root disk to another system. Can I delete the "/boot" and "/"
partitions in rescue mode and re-create them to my needs using the rear
backup in some way?

Regards,  
Niranjan

@IT-Guy-1973 Did you use BLOCKCLONE and dd
([https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc))
technique to create the raw image? I cannot give a correct answer as the
input is not fully clear to me.

Hello @gdha ,

Sorry for the late response and my vague question. Here is the problem I
have:

Cloud providers like Azure and AWS do not support booting from an ISO.
Therefore I cannot use the ".iso" file that is created when I do a REAR
backup to recover a VM is Azure or AWS. Is there another method in REAR
where I could recover a VM using REAR in a cloud environment?

Thank you,  
Regards,  
Niranjan

@IT-Guy-1973  
see the section "RESCUE IMAGE CONFIGURATION" in "man rear" e.g. online
at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
what different kinds of `OUTPUT` media ReaR can make.

I don't know wherefrom a VM in Azure or AWS can boot.  
I use neither Azure nor AWS.  
I use only KVM/QEMU VMs that can boot from ISO (via virtual CDROM).

Perhaps a VM in Azure or AWS can boot via PXE (i.e. `OUTPUT=PXE`)?

For a generic workaround how to boot the ReaR recovery system see the
section  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@IT-Guy-1973 If you mount a snapshot disk to another VM you can do what
you like with it - including restoring / and /boot from another rear
backup. I do think a grub2 mkconfig will be necessary to get this
snapshot disk bootable. It is worth a try I would say.

Feedback is most welcome!
