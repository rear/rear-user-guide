Sometimes in case of emergency. we have to do a fast restore to a
different system, with less drives

if Original system has:  
/dev/sda1  
/dev/sdb1  
both of say 16 GB

is there an easy way on restore to bring sdb1 into say /dev/sda3  
if the new system drive is 146gb

Hi @Hardcore-fs,

"Easy" is relative, because what is easy basically depends on personal
skills ...  
But in general, yes ReaR can move content from one partition to another
during `rear recover` workflow.

yep i did it manually....  
but it took two attempts to find the right menu to get out and the right
stage in the process.  
I would be real nice if there was a 'squash' function,  
In the end I think i only had to change a few numbers & change sdb1-&gt;
sda3

@Hardcore-fs  
a side note FYI:

In general regarding system migration with ReaR see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2339\#issuecomment-598067616](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2339#issuecomment-598067616)  
and follow the links therein in particular see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html)  
and also follow the links therein.

Migrating an original system that was on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1  
both of 16 GB onto replacement hardware with a single /dev/sda3  
that has 146 GB could be more or less straightforward by adapting  
the matching entries in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
as long as only filesystems on plain partitions are used.

But things get tricky when filesystems on higher level strorage
objects  
like LVM logical volumes are used because there is no automatism  
in ReaR that adapts (size) vaules of higher level strorage objects  
so you need to do all that manually.

What could help here - provided you know your replacement hardware  
in advance - is to prepare a disklayout.conf in advance that fits the  
replacement hardware and copy that into the ReaR recovery system  
before you launch "rear recover".  
You could automate the "copy that into the ReaR recovery system" part  
by using `RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL` see its description in default.conf  
and for a special case issue you may have a look at
