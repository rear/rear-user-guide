This is my very first non-expert attempt to deal with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512)

I tried to implement what @OliverO2 suggested in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512\#issuecomment-331638066](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512#issuecomment-331638066)

The new config variable SSH\_FILES is intentionally  
not yet documented in default.conf because currently  
anything can change here.

FWIW:  
At least for my minimal use case - I only use  
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="rear"  
things still work for me.

Without SSH\_FILES set I get now by default in the  
recovery system (from a SLES12 original system):

<pre>
# find /tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/ | grep 'ssh/'       
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/moduli
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_config
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
/tmp/rear.gCCTXDuhnUTeiFD/rootfs/root/.ssh/known_hosts
</pre>

and this is what I have on the original SLES12 system:

<pre>
# find /etc/ssh /root/.ssh
/etc/ssh
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
/etc/ssh/moduli
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
/etc/ssh/ldap.conf
/etc/ssh/ssh_config
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
/root/.ssh
/root/.ssh/known_hosts
</pre>

The crucial point is that with empty SSH\_FILES  
the SSH key files in the recovery system  
were re-generated anew (i.e. they are  
not the ones from the original system).  
In contrast with SSH\_FILES="yes" the SSH key files  
in the recovery system are the ones from the original system.

@OliverO2  
could you have again a look if it is better now.

For me plain  
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="rear"  
without any additional SSH\_\* config variable settings still works.  
Now with the more secure defaults I get those

<pre>
WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
...
Offending ECDSA key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts:123
</pre>

and

<pre>
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre>

as expected when I do 'ssh' to the recovery system.

Using  
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="rear"  
SSH\_FILES="yes"  
results for me the backward compatible behaviour  
where 'ssh' to the recovery system "just works".

@gdha  
now I made clear in default.conf that with SSH\_FILES=no  
there is no SSH setup in particular no sshd in the recovery system.

But I don't know in what file I could make clear right now  
that the default behavior will change with these new variables.  
Of course I will emphasize this clearly in the release notes  
of ReaR v2.3 when we make those release notes.

@OliverO2  
a general security question when generating SSH host keys:  
Currently I run as usual commands with $v

<pre>
ssh-keygen $v ...
</pre>

which results in the log file things like

<pre>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in /tmp/rear.YI2aUkgvEOG9pUj/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.
Your public key has been saved in /tmp/rear.YI2aUkgvEOG9pUj/rootfs/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:7XXBiLFmOrg/L39G0SvabGA+7xL2t7mEGAPnaLZKqZw root@e205
The key's randomart image is:

</pre>

Does that somehow contain confidential information  
which appears now in a possibly not very securely  
stored ReaR log file?

E.g. in build/default/501\_check\_ssh\_keys.sh there is

<pre>
... ssh-keygen -q ...
</pre>

but without a comment why that '-q' is there.

I.e. I like to merge it when it is at least a reasonable

@OliverO2  
many thanks in advance for having a look!

I have another question regarding our current  
checking for unprotected SSH key files:

By default /root/.ssh/authorized\_key gets included in the  
recovery system but build/default/501\_check\_ssh\_keys.sh  
does not check if /root/.ssh/authorized\_key is protected  
nor does it check any keys in /etc/ssh - it only checks  
some identity files in /root/.ssh/ - is that o.k.?

No, this is all public information. `ssh-keygen` generates a private key
(which must be kept secret) and a public key (which can be, well, widely
published). The information in the log file (fingerprint, ASCII art) is
all about the public host key. It could be published on a website, where
it would allow ssh users to convince themselves that the host they are
connecting to via ssh is actually the right one (and not a fake).

> E.g. in build/default/501\_check\_ssh\_keys.sh there is

The `-q` is there because this `ssh-keygen` invocation is actually a
no-op, just used to check if the key is unprotected. So it is used like
a shell test expression `[ -f /path/to/file ]`. See the adjacent
comment:

    # We therefore try to change the passphrase from empty to empty and if that succeeds then it is unprotected

As the output of `ssh-keygen -q ...` is suppressed anyway the `-q` could
even be removed, I guess (but check first in case it uses `/dev/tty`
directly).

An `authorized_keys` file contains public keys only. Public keys cannot
be protected.

`authorized_keys` files copied to a rescue system would allow access to
the rescue system in the same way that they allow access to the original
system. So if the original system trusts certain accounts on certain
hosts, the rescue system would do the same. If the original system's
trust relationships were safe, so will be the rescue system's. It's all
OK.

After performing some tests, I have these observations and suggestions:

1.  The `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE` example from `default.conf` seems incorrect
    (quoted globbing patterns, keys in `/root/.ssh/` are named `id_*`,
    not `*key*`)
    -   Correction:
        `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( "${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]}" /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* /root/.ssh/id_* )`
2.  `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE` does not prevent keys from being re-generated.
    For details, see below.
3.  `SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS="no"` does not prevent unprotected
    **host keys** from being copied. If
    `SSH_FILES=( /etc/ssh /root/.ssh )` is used,
    `build/default/501_check_ssh_keys.sh` will still check for
    unprotected user keys in `/root/.ssh`, but not the (always
    unprotected) host keys in `/etc/ssh`.

**Regarding observation number 2:**

What doesn't work currently is

-   having a rescue medium completely free of SSH keys, and
-   having the RSA host key pair `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key*` generated
    during rescue system boot.

The reason is that `build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh`

1.  always re-regenerates host keys existing on the original system
    (rendering `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE` ineffective here), and
2.  will generate an RSA host key even if no keys existed on the
    original system.

To solve this problem, I added a variable to the configuration:

    SSH_GENERATE_PRIVATE_KEYS="no"

and this line in `build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh`:

    is_false "$SSH_GENERATE_PRIVATE_KEYS" && return

just before this comment:

    # Generate new SSH host key in the recovery system when no SSH host key file
    # had been copied into the the recovery system in rescue/default/500_ssh.sh

With this correction, everything worked as expected. The missing RSA key
was generated during the rescue system boot and an SSH login was
successful.

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your careful and helpful review.  
I do appreciate that very much.

I already know about issue number 2 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530\#issuecomment-336513903](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530#issuecomment-336513903)

My reasoning was that whenever SSH\_FILES is not a 'false' value  
then sshd is meant to be run and then the needed keys must be
generated  
because without the needed keys a running sshd does not make sense  
and then also SSH\_FILES not 'false' would not make sense.

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530\#issuecomment-336513903](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530#issuecomment-336513903)  
I know a use-case where SSH\_FILES is not 'false' even without  
any of the needed sshd keys in the recovery system.

Regarding issue number 3 in

I am thinking about to enhance the SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS  
functionality from a plain boolean setting into a possible array where  
the user can specify where ReaR will search for unproteded keys  
(similar how SSH\_FILES already works).

True, but since that time you have added the feature to generate an RSA
host key at boot time. Now we don't need any host keys on the recsue
medium and sshd still works.

I'd advise against further complicating configuration options:

-   Since private **host keys** are never protected and their names are
    standardized, the best option in my view would be to remove them if
    SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS is false.
-   I wouldn't even generate new host keys for the rescue medium as this
    can be done more securely at boot time.
-   I'd give the user basically three simple options, which are
    1.  have an entirely secret-free rescue medium (no user keys, no
        host keys, not even newly generated keys), or
    2.  have a rescue medium which contains only protected secrets (so
        no unprotected user keys, no host keys here), or
    3.  have a rescue medium which contains secrets.

Having a rescue medium with (some) unprotected keys actually means
having an insecure rescue medium. The difference will just be the type
of possible attacks. The question is: Can we really expect users to
acquire all the knowledge needed to decide whether it is safe to allow
certain types of attacks?

Hope this helps to clarify things. Have a great weekend!

@OliverO2  
regardless that you "advise against further complicating"  
I found a use case where I needed to enhance the  
SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS  
functionality from a plain boolean setting into a string  
or an array where the user can specify where ReaR  
will search for unprotected keys.

For my testing I had done

<pre>
# cp -a /etc/ssh /etc/ssh.save
</pre>

and I got all keys in /etc/ssh.save in the recovery system  
regardless of  
SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS='no'.

Now with an array like

<pre>
SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS=( '/etc/ssh*/ssh_host_*' '/root/.ssh/id_*' )
</pre>

and also simpler with a string

<pre>
SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS='/etc/ssh*/ssh_host_* /root/.ssh/id_*'
</pre>

I can get all those unprotected keys removed.

Currently this enhanced SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS  
functionality is not officially documented in default.conf.

I wonder why ReaR would copy `/etc/ssh.save` at all? I haven't yet
looked into this but I was under the impression that ReaR is normally
pretty selective when deciding what to copy onto the rescue medium.
Otherwise ReaR could in theory copy lots of secrets from `/etc`
directories belonging to software it doesn't even know about.

Anyway, I'll take a look at your latest commits and I'll test things as
soon as I can. Might take until the end of this week, though, but
hopefully I'm quicker than that.

Thanks again for tackling the issues!

ReaR does tons of inexplicable stuff simply because  
it is not explained by meaningful comments in the code.

In such cases all I can do is to keep inexplicable code as is  
because I have no chance to understand it with reasonable effort  
where "reasonable effort" primarily means "within a reasonable  
amount of time" (I will not reverse-engineer inexplicable code).

Often all I can do to move forward is to delete inexplicable code  
and replace it with my own code according to how I understand  
what is meant that the code should do so that I can maintain it  
in the future.  
Of course there is the risk that I might destroy whatever  
sophisticated support for whatever obscure special cases  
but then I could easily re-add such support to code that  
I can maintain (if bugs ever appear because of that because  
usually such special cases are long obsolete nowadays).

In this particular case run

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh | less
</pre>

and look for '/etc/ssh\*' which is there since ever.  
In my current code it is

<pre>
copy_as_is_ssh_files=( /etc/ssh* ...
</pre>

which I used as is from its former form

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/ssh* ...
</pre>

that is there since the beginning of the Git history.  
The first entry in Git history is

<pre>
# assume that we have openssh with configs in /etc/ssh
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/ssh* ...
</pre>

where the comment may or may not contradict the implementation.  
If the comment means "assume that we have openssh with configs in
/etc/ssh/" the implementation contradicts the comment.  
If the comment means "assume that we have openssh with configs in  
/etc/ssh\*" the implementation matches the comment.  
Because I cannot prove "with reasonable effort" (cf. above)  
that the latter case is false, I must assume there could be systems  
where directories like /etc/ssh.conf or /etc/ssh.d are used  
so that /etc/ssh\* would be the right thing.

About the `/etc/ssh*` I can only suspect that back then we had old
systems that put all the SSH configs and keys in `/etc/` instead of
`/etc/ssh/` so that this catches all possibilities. However, I don't
remember the details of those past days and I can imagine that all
systems where ReaR is now supported use a sub directory.

FYI  
how it looks on my SLES10 SP4 test system where I keep  
the SLES10 SP4 default installation unchanged:

The [OpenSSH Release Notes](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html)
state for version 3.1/3.1p1 (2004-04-09):

> /etc/ssh/ now default directory for keys and configuration files

So maybe it's reasonable to drop support for OpenSSH &lt; 3.1 and refer
the user to use `COPY_AS_IS` for files outside of `/etc/ssh`?

I still wonder about

<pre>
/etc/openssh* /etc/centrifydc/ssh*
</pre>

in copy\_as\_is\_ssh\_files  
On none of my machines I have either of them  
so that I cannot say anything about them.

/etc/openssh\* and /etc/centrifydc/ssh\* were added recently via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5b2aca92c69a4f38556d2c6bc51c920e54cbd0ec](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5b2aca92c69a4f38556d2c6bc51c920e54cbd0ec)

The original change for centrify was \#836 on request of a user, about
the openssh path I also don't remember.

@schlomo  
thanks for the information about the reason  
why /etc/centrifydc/ssh\* was added.

I think in our new "sufficiently secure by default" implementation  
both /etc/openssh\* and /etc/centrifydc/ssh\* should be removed  
again to ensure we are really "sufficiently secure by default".

If the user needs something in addition to our default  
it is described in default.conf at the SSH\_\* variables  
how he can do that i.e. via COPY\_AS\_IS and if needed  
additionally via COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE.

(Right now I noticed another inconsistency in that  
description in default.conf ...)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538)
merged there is now  
only support for OpenSSH 3.1 and later with its default directory  
/etc/ssh/ for keys and config files and its default sshd config file  
/etc/ssh/sshd\_config for the SSH setup of the recovery system.  
I removed support for non-standard directories  
like /etc/openssh or non-standard sshd config files  
like /etc/sshd\_config or /etc/openssh/sshd\_config.  
I documented in the SSH\_\* section in default.conf  
how to manually set up ReaR with a secure shell  
software other than OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1.
