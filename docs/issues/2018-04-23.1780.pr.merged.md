-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I cannot test the 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case because  
    I do not have a system with a GPT BIOS boot partition.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    When in the 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case no known non-EFI bootloader is
    found  
    continue guessing the used bootloader by inspecting the first bytes
    on the next disk  
    because otherwise the default code below would falsely guess that
    'EFI' is used  
    cf.

Right now I found out that I can test the 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case  
because I do have a system with a GPT BIOS boot partition!

It is what YaST sets up by default as SLE15 when it runs on a BIOS
machine  
(in my case a virtual QEMU/KVM virtual machine).  
I get GPT partitioning with BIOS so that a GPT BIOS boot partition is
set up:

<pre>
 # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 20480MiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: 
Number  Start     End       Size      File system     Name  Flags
 1      1.00MiB   9.00MiB   8.00MiB                         bios_grub
 2      9.00MiB   18431MiB  18422MiB  ext4                  legacy_boot
 3      18431MiB  20480MiB  2049MiB   linux-swap(v1)        swap

# dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=4 2>/dev/null | strings
ZRr=
`|f
\|f1
GRUB 
Geom
Hard Disk

Hah!IdontNeedEFI
</pre>

This means in particular that the 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case will be  
the common case when SLE15 is installed on a BIOS machine.

On SUSE systems one gets (from
layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh)

<pre>
Using sysconfig bootloader 'grub2'
</pre>

which is the right thing (we use GRUB2 on SLE15 not GRUB).

When I disable for a test the sysconfig bootloader detection  
in layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh I get:

<pre>
Using guessed bootloader 'GRUB' (found in first bytes on GPT BIOS boot partition /dev/sda)
</pre>

which indicates the code works as intended.

That results 'GRUB' in var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader  
which likely goes wrong on SLES15 because actually GRUB2 is used  
but that does not matter for SUSE systems because  
at SUSE there is the right value in /etc/sysconfig/bootloader

<pre>
LOADER_TYPE="grub2"
</pre>

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780\#issuecomment-383563712](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780#issuecomment-383563712)  
shows that the LogPrint message in the 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case is not
right

<pre>
Using guessed bootloader 'GRUB' (found in first bytes on GPT BIOS boot partition /dev/sda)
</pre>

because /dev/sda is the disk but not the GPT BIOS boot partition  
so that I fixed that and the new LogPrint message in the
'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case is

<pre>
Using guessed bootloader 'GRUB' (found in first bytes on /dev/sda with GPT BIOS boot partition)
</pre>

@gdha  
because things work well for my tests  
I would like to merge it today if you do not object.

Out of curiosity I tried "rear recover" for the special test case in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780\#issuecomment-383563712](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780#issuecomment-383563712)  
that results 'GRUB' in var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader.

Fortunately that even works on my SLES15 system  
and during "rear recover" I get

<pre>
Skip installing GRUB Legacy boot loader because GRUB 2 is installed (grub-probe or grub2-probe exist).
Installing GRUB 2 boot loader
</pre>

and the recreated system "just boots" and works for me.
