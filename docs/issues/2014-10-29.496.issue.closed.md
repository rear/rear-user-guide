hi,

trying to recover a SLES12 instance gives me the following while
executing rear recover:

RESCUE linux-60x9:~ \# rear recover  
Relax-and-Recover 1.16.1-git201410271553 / 2014-10-27  
Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-linux-60x9.log  
ERROR: The LSB package is not installed.  
Currently there is no support to detect the OS and VERSION without LSB
support.  
Please either install the LSB package (that supplies the 'lsb\_release'
command)  
or improve Relax-and-Recover to handle this situation better.

it seems the lsb\_release package is not included in the generated iso
image, it however  
exists on the system which created the backup. Grepping the logfile
which was created  
in debug mode does not give me any hints about lsb\_release.

Should lsb\_release not be part of the iso image?

hi,

on a closer look this issue is related to the situation that REAR in
this case is not installed into its default path. The rear installation
resides in /var/opt/sesam/var/lib/rear/, however, os.conf is created  
beneath this directory while the recovery ISO image expects it in
/etc/rear/.

Hi,

that is exactly the reason why I encourage vendors like SEP to not
fork  
ReaR but to participate in the ReaR development so that upstream ReaR
does  
what you need. I strongly believe that you will achieve more and
better  
results with much less effort. And you will save a lot of maintenance  
effort if thinking long term.

Maybe you let us know what we the ReaR project should do to enable you
to  
use the ReaR project instead of forking it?

And you can pin the "supporting open source projects" medal to your
chest  
(or hang it on your office wall) :-)

Kind Regards,  
Schlomo

hi,

basically the only thing we do is:

1.  we ship REAR with local.conf that sets BACKUP=SESAM
2.  we ship REAR in an non-default installation path

there are no more changes other than that in the version that is
included by our backup client.  
It seems at least point 2) does have some troubles with the latest git
version, we will investigate.

Why do you need to ship ReaR with a non-default installation path?
Which  
benefit do you get from this?

As sesam does install itself to /opt;/var/opt we also want to install
the REAR version shipped with sesam into this path.

I see. What about not shipping ReaR but using ReaR from the OS repos?
And  
spending the same effort instead on helping the ReaR project to
provide  
updated ReaR versions through the OS repos?

We do support client systems which make it more or less impossible to
introduce new packages in the OS repos (debian stable for example).
Also, i dont know how SLES or RHEL behave in this regard to their update
repositories. It is simpler for our customers to get it working out of
the box if the REAR client is installed within the sesam rpm package. I
know that this is sub-optimal, but i dont see another good way at the
moment. For a long term solution, of course it would be better to have
the latest REAR package available in the OS repos.

@abbbi Adding `lsb_release` to the rear ISO image would blow up the size
of the ISO image and we do not want that. You already discovered the the
`os.conf` was found under `/var/opt/sesam/var/lib/rear/etc/rear`?? and
rear itself expects it under `/etc/rear`  
Did you know that the `/etc/rear/rescue.conf` file defines the PATH
where rear looks for its own internal paths, but it maybe a chicken and
egg problem as the SESAM rear fork does not look beneath `/etc/rear`  
What can we do about it? SEP Sesam is not very co-operative with us, so
I would open a support call with them.
