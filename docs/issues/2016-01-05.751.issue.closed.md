Is it possible to change the system recovery source to new one (ie:
file///share --&gt; nfs://xxx/yy, when we boot the rescue image.

The answer was already mentioned in issue \#750 - before running
`rear recover` edit the `local.conf` file and change the `BACKUP_URL`
variable.

Or, as mentioned in \#750, use Bash code in `local.conf` to decide the
content of `BACKUP_URL` while ReaR runs. E.g. something like this:

    if [[ "$WORKFLOW" == "recover" ]] ; then
        BACKUP_URL=nfs://server/path
    else
       BACKUP_URL=file:///local/dir
    fi

To make the ISO image generated for local restore also usable in NFS
recover condition, you need to add the 'mount.nfs' 'umount.nfs' to PROGS
variable. Then boot the restore system with "Recover <hostname>"
menuentry and proceed the restore manually. For example:

    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/
    PROGS=("${PROGS[@]}" 'mount.nfs' 'umount.nfs')

As these two files will not be included in the boot image under the
'file' schema.

I'm also trying Schlomo's method hoping that it can automate the whole
procedure.

Hi,

With Schlomo's suggestion, it works like a charm. Here are my rear
settings:

    # cat /etc/rear/local.conf | grep -v ^#

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS

    PROGS=("${PROGS[@]}" 'mount.nfs' 'umount.nfs')
    if [[ "$WORKFLOW" == "recover" ]] ; then
        BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.56.1/storage
    else
        BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/
    fi

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="hello123"
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/media' '/var/tmp' '/var/crash')
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=no

Thanks,  
Kakuki
