This commit implements block device cloning using `dd` and `ntfsclone`.

Documentation is work in progress. Current documentation draft can be
found [here](https://gozora.sk/bc.html). I'll add documentation to
upstream ReaR code soon.  
(sorry lot of work lately :-( )

Would you mind if I create separate section (12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc) in
*doc/user-guide* ?

I would even recommend to use separated documentation files  
for separated backup methods - in particular in this case  
because BLOCKCLONE is totally different than other  
backup methods.

Thanks @jsmeix ,

That's exactly what I thought.  
I'll add one simple example to *04-scenarios.adoc* with reference to
*12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc*, for more details.

@gozora  
right now I found

<pre>
if [[ "$BLOCKCLONE_STRICT_PARTITIONING" =~ ^[yY1] ]]
</pre>

It possible I would recommend to use the existing  
is\_true and is\_false functions, see  
"Relax-and-Recover functions" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@gozora  
I found

<pre>
case "$label" in
    "msdos")
</pre>

Better use paired parenthesis for case patterns  
so that editor commands (like '%' in 'vi') that  
check for matching opening and closing parenthesis  
work everywhere in the code, see  
"Paired parenthesis" in

@gozora  
it seems I am a bit slow on the uptake - could  
you explain me how the change\_default is menat  
to be used - I read the comment but I do not understand  
how setting $1 to a user input plus evaluating that  
cold be useful functionality?

Hello @jsmeix,  
I was looking for simmilar functionality as C's "pass by reference."
Hence to change value of parameter passed to function.  
I'm currently off my PC and typing on my phone is a bit pain. I'll try
to explain it better tomorow.

Hello @jsmeix,

*change\_default* function was meant as a simplification for dialog,
where user is prompted for for either restore destination or destination
for disk where partitions should be created:

A small extract from code:

    echo -n "Restore $archive_name to device: [$BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV] "
    change_default BLOCKCLONE_SOURCE_DEV

In this case value of BLOCKCLONE\_SOURCE\_DEV is loaded from \*.conf
file and is used as default. So user just hits *enter* this value is
used.  
If user however enters some string, value in BLOCKCLONE\_SOURCE\_DEV
will be replaced by user choice.

Hope I've explained it better this time.

@gozora Thanks for the new feature - tomorrow will do a new validation
round to see whether it does not break something in other flows.
