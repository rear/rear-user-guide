mpathconf is present in Fedora based distribution. It helps to make the
first configuration of multipath.  
It can be used to properly setup the multipath configuration during
recovery when you migration from non-multipath system to multipath. (see
\#1311, \#1314)

Having a good `multipath.conf` since the very beginning (start of
recovery) is important because this file can determine the name of the
multipath device.

with an empty multipath.conf :
`/dev/mapper/3600507680c82004cf8000000000000d8`  
with a multipath.conf with friendly name (setup with mpathconf) :
`/dev/mapper/mpatha`

The issue is :  
During migration, the recovery process will use THIS name to modify some
key file on the target OS.  
(lilo.conf, yaboot.conf etc ...). It is why it is important to get the
good name from the beginning.

This patch propose to

-   add `mpathconf` tool in the recovery image if it exists.
-   use `mpathconf` (if available) to properly setup the multipath
    during device discovery.

@schabrolles  
does the

<pre>
# load mudules and start multipath discovery
</pre>

comment also need to be moved outside the if statement?

@gdha, @jsmeix I've updated with your comments ...

I also removed "friendly\_names" for SLES11 because there is no binding
files which guaranty the association between "names" and "wwid"...

@gdha , @jsmeix I finally find a way to use friendly\_names with SUSE by
forcing the binding file location in `multipath.conf`.

tested on sles11, sles12, rhel6 and rhel7

When there are no objections  
I will merge it soon...
