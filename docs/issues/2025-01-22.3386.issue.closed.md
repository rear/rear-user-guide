During my very first testing of "rear recover" in PORTABLE mode because
of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3379\#issuecomment-2607222152](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3379#issuecomment-2607222152)  
I noticed that - at least for me - "rear recover" fails with

    RESCUE localhost:~ # rear -D recover
    ...
    ERROR: Stale NFS mount point /nfs detected - please fix it first!
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 100_check_stale_nfs_mounts.sh:
      2025-01-22 16:18:30.619467024 Entering debugscript mode via 'set -x'.
      2025-01-22 16:18:30.630197156 Trustworthy sourcing '/usr/share/rear/init/default/100_check_stale_nfs_mounts.sh'
      /usr/share/rear/init/default/100_check_stale_nfs_mounts.sh: line 26: timeout: command not found

I had done before

    RESCUE localhost:~ # mount -t nfs -o nolock 192.168.178.66:/nfs/localhost.portable /nfs

to mount my NFS share where my localhost-portable.tar.gz is  
to do then

    RESCUE localhost:~ # tar -xvf /nfs/localhost-portable.tar.gz

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/17-Portable-Mode.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/17-Portable-Mode.adoc)

My workaround to avoid the false 'ERROR: Stale NFS mount point'  
because of 'timeout: command not found' was

    RESCUE localhost:~ # ln -s /bin/true /bin/timeout

after that "rear recover" in PORTABLE mode  
seemed to have "just worked" for me.

So either 'timeout' gets added to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
or init/default/100\_check\_stale\_nfs\_mounts.sh  
gets enhanced to skip testing for stale NFS mounts  
when there is no 'timeout' command.

I think it is better to skip testing for stale NFS mounts  
when there is no 'timeout' command because otherwise  
it would also falsely error out when there is  
no 'timeout' command on the original system  
because the 'init' stage is always run.

@jsmeix Wow, nice catch as I thought `timeout` was already part of one
of our PROGS variables long time ago. Seems I made a wrong assumption
when I found lots of timeout usages, but these seems to be variable
timeout.  
I prefer that 'timeout' gets added to REQUIRED\_PROGS.

Choose what you think is best.

Adding 'timeout' to REQUIRED\_PROGS has the advantage  
that we do not need workarounds in our code.

But adding 'timeout' to REQUIRED\_PROGS alone  
results that rear falsely fails with that error here  
on systems where no 'timeout' command exists  
when some NFS share is mounted

    # mv /usr/bin/timeout /usr/bin/timeout.away

    # mount -t nfs -o nolock 192.168.178.66:/nfs/localhost.portable /nfs

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Running 'init' stage ======================
    Running workflow mkrescue on the normal/original system
    ERROR: Stale NFS mount point /nfs detected - please fix it first!
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 100_check_stale_nfs_mounts.sh:
      2025-01-23 10:32:12.152329207 Entering debugscript mode via 'set -x'.
      2025-01-23 10:32:12.157029159 Trustworthy sourcing '/root/rear.github.master-jsmeix-source-wrapper/usr/share/rear/init/default/100_check_stale_nfs_mounts.sh'
      /root/rear.github.master-jsmeix-source-wrapper/usr/share/rear/init/default/100_check_stale_nfs_mounts.sh: line 26: timeout: command not found

where the error message "Stale NFS mount point /nfs detected"  
is plain wrong because my NFS mount point /nfs is not stale  
so nothing needs to be fixed there.

In contrast where rear should actually fail:

    # umount /nfs

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Running 'init' stage ======================
    Running workflow mkrescue on the normal/original system
    ERROR: Cannot find required programs: timeout
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 950_check_missing_programs.sh:

So adding 'timeout' to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
additionally requires to run  
init/default/100\_check\_stale\_nfs\_mounts.sh  
after  
init/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
to let rear fail properly when 'timeout' is missing.

I believe `timeout` is part of the `coreutils` package on RH, SLES,
Debian and Ubuntu. Therefore, I wondering why was it missing on your
distribution? Did `timeout` moved to another package within SLES
somehow?

I think you overlooked my

    # mv /usr/bin/timeout /usr/bin/timeout.away

in my above test. I did that intentionally  
to test how it behaves if no 'timeout' command exists.

Yes, on my SLES15-SP6 test system 'timeout'  
is part of the coreutils package:

    # rpm -qf /usr/bin/timeout
    coreutils-8.32-150400.9.3.1.x86_64

In my above test my main point is not  
whether or not a 'timeout' command exists.  
My point is that 100\_check\_stale\_nfs\_mounts.sh shows  
a wrong error message if no 'timeout' command exists  
so adding 'timeout' to REQUIRED\_PROGS alone is  
not a proper fix.

I checked on SLES11-SP4 (the oldest system I have available)  
Also there 'timeout' is part of the coreutils package.

Perhaps it is sufficiently safe to blindly assume  
that a 'timeout' command always exists  
so adding 'timeout' to REQUIRED\_PROGS alone  
could be sufficient in practice?

Meanwhile I think it is sufficiently safe  
to blindly assume that a 'timeout' command always exists  
so adding 'timeout' to REQUIRED\_PROGS is sufficient in practice:
