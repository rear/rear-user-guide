-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Booting the ReaR rescue media (ISO output put onto USB flash drive) on a
laptop has a long delay at the following point of the boot process:

> running 58-start-dhclient.sh...  
> Attempting to start the DHCP client daemon

It stays at this message for about a minute, and then arrives at the
login prompt.

After that everything seems normal. `ifconfig` shows the ethernet, wifi,
and `lo` devices. The ethernet device has an IP if the network cable is
plugged in.

The same rescue ISO boots much more quickly in a VM without such a
delay.

I tried booting the laptop with and without an ethernet cable plugged
in, and it made no difference.

I also tried with the WiFi disabled via the keyboard hotkey and again it
made no difference in boot time except that the following message also
printed on the boot screen:

> RTNETLINK answers: Operation not possible due to RF-kill

Is there any diagnostic or log to check in the booted recovery
environment?

@adatum  
when you boot the ReaR recovery system in its bootloader menue  
you can add the kernel command line parameter ' debug'.

This way the recovery system startup scripts are run one by one  
(you need to press Enter to run each one) with the bash 'set -x' option
set  
so that you get the commands of each script printed on the terminal.

This should help to find out in which script the delay  
happens at or after which command.

The recovery system setup scripts are in etc/scripts/system-setup.d

The main networking setup script is  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
that is generated during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh)

See the usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh
script  
for details how networking setup happens in the recovery system.

With the ReaR recovery system booted with the `debug` kernel parameter,
I could see the delay at each of these commands:

    dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf /var/run/dhclient.eno1.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1

and

    dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.wlp2s0 -pf /var/run/dhclient.wlp2s0.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf wlp2s0

After the delays, it's fine. `ps aux | grep dhclient` shows both
running, and the system gets an IP if a network connection is up.

I know basically nothing about dhclient internals so I cannot provide
actual furher help  
but I can provide some generic hint how to further debug the actual
cause of the delay:

Add whatever debugging commands you need  
to your recovery system startup script  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh)  
e.g. adding the '-v' option to the dhclient command for verbose
logging  
may already show why there is the delay while dhclient runs.

I added `-v` to the two `dhclient` commands in
`/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setupd.d/58-start-dhclient.sh`
on the host system. Then I re-created the rescue media. But when I boot
into the recovery system (including with the `debug` kernel parameter)
the command does not have the `-v` when it runs.

Did I miss something?
