This issue is a generalization of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125\#discussion\_r1447059187](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125#discussion_r1447059187)

We should remove all words like

-   just
-   simple
-   easy

from all texts everywhere  
step by step whenever we are working  
on a particular part of a text.

"All texts" include documentation  
and messages that are shown to the user  
but also comments in the code.

Those words are never helpful for a user  
or a developer who likes to understand the code.

Those words hurt a desperate user who reads documentation  
(or a perhaps even more desperate user who reads the code)  
because those words humiliate the user because they basically  
tell him he is somewhat stupid when he has issues with things  
that are just simple and easy for others.

It is in particular humiliating and patronizing  
when the developers tell their users  
that things are just simple and easy.

Users who read documentation are often desperate  
because reading documentation is often the last thing  
one does when (easy) things (simply) do not (just) work.

Cf.

    Words like "just", "simple", "easy" are inappropriate
    for disaster recovery.

    ... rephrase it so that it does no longer look
    as if Relax-and-Recover has the ability to think

i.e. don't make a program look as if it has human skills

    "It seems prudent" sounds smart-alecky.
    Simpler and more neutral wording could be ...

i.e. don't be patronizing

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125\#discussion\_r1447039623](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125#discussion_r1447039623)

    Leave out "most" (why a superlative judgement here?)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125\#discussion\_r1447045801](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125#discussion_r1447045801)

    I wonder why "inadvertently" is needed here.
    Why judgement about why that filesystem is mounted?
    Perhaps it is mounted intentionally?

i.e. don't implicitly judge or teach the user
