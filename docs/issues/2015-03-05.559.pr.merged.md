neither somehow truncated nor does it have multiple blanks so that  
now the findmnt output is just like the traditional "mount" output  
(except that mount outputs the mount options in parenthesis).  
Removed not neeed " | tr -s '\[:blank:\]' ' ' " for findmnt and mount  
because their output fields are separated by a single space.  
Should fix
