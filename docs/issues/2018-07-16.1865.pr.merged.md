##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1857](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1857)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested by me on my SLES12 QEMU/KVM test system.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    With those enhancements in
    layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
    things look as in  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1857\#issuecomment-404209341](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1857#issuecomment-404209341)

Furthermore I added a output\_not\_recreated\_devices function that
shows  
the currently unmapped disks and dependant devices that will not be
recreated  
to the user so that the user knows in advance what will not be
recreated  
with the current mapping so that he can change the mapping as he needs  
and in this case things look like:

<pre>
Current disk mapping table (source => target):
  /dev/sdb => /dev/sdb
Currently unmapped disks and dependant devices will not be recreated
(unless identical disk mapping and proceeding without manual configuration):
  /dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 /dev/md0 /dev/md1 /dev/md2 swap:/dev/md0 fs:/ fs:/home
UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 275
Confirm or edit the disk mapping
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration
3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
5) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
</pre>

What is currently not yet cleaned up is the inconsistency in the ReaR
code  
how currently is tested whether or not migration mode is active, cf.

@rear/contributors  
because this pull request implements an additional choice  
I think it cannot cause regressions for existing functionality  
so that I would like to merge it soon today unless you object now.  
Of course if issues with the current implementation appear I will fix
them.

The cleanup of the current inconsistency in the ReaR code  
how currently is tested whether or not migration mode is active  
will be done later by a separated pull request as time permits.
