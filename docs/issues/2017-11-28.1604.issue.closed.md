-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Any with XFS
    and external log marked for restore.
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): N/A
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BOTH
-   Brief description of the issue: ReaR ignores XFS external log during
    recovery and creates it as internal.
-   Work-around, if any: NONE (apart not using XFS external log for
    disks backed up by ReaR)
