In lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
there is now a new function descendants\_pids()  
that outputs PIDs of all descendant processes of a parent process PID  
where the output lists latest descendants PIDs first and the initial
parent PID last  
(i.e. great-grandchildren PIDs, grandchildren PIDs, children PIDs,
parent PID)  
so that the output ordering is already the right ordering to cleanly
terminate  
a sub-tree of processes below a parent process and finally the parent
process  
and this termination functionality is used in the DoExitTasks()
function  
to do a clean termination of descendant processes that should fix

Now the code looks o.k. to me and works well for me,  
e.g. for Ctrl+C during archive operation

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
...

If there are no serious objections I will merge it later today  
because I think it is at least a good step in the right direction.

I set a fallback value when the shell variable COLUMNS is not defined  
(e.g. in noninteractive bash)

@pcahyna  
I could not test my change so I would much appreciate it  
if you could verify if things behave now more fail safe.
