Hello,

Another problem related to the custom definition of the lvm filter and
preferred\_names discovered.  
The problem comes from the colon in md device name (because md array was
built with --name option) like

    #pvs
      /dev/disk/by-id/md-name-hostname:NA3scs                        vgNA3scs   lvm2 a--     5.00g    4.00g

leading to the

    #rear -v -D  savelayout
    Relax-and-Recover 1.15-git201310211300 / 2013-10-21
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-hostname.log
    Creating disk layout
    ERROR: BUG BUG BUG!  Empty string passed to get_device_name
    === Issue report ===
    Please report this unexpected issue at: https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
    Also include the relevant bits from /var/log/rear/rear-hostname.log

    HINT: If you can reproduce the issue, try using the -d or -D option !
    ====================
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-hostname.log for details

Hopefully relevant (and slightly censored) part of the logfile is here:
[https://gist.github.com/pavoldomin/0242b6d92fc45294996d](https://gist.github.com/pavoldomin/0242b6d92fc45294996d)

Worth adding, that this grep than returns two entries on this particular
server:

    #grep '^md-name-hostname' /var/lib/rear/recovery/diskbyid_mappings
    md-name-hostname:NA3ora
    md-name-hostname:NA3scs md35

As expected, if we add `/dev/md*` to the `filter` as well as
`preferred_names` definition in `lvm.conf`, the problem ceases.

perhaps we need to rewrite
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/22_lvm_layout.sh` a bit to avoid
working with `:`

@pavoldomin due to lack of time will push this issue back to milestone
v1.17

as it a request from one customer only (so far) we classified as looking
for sponsoring.

As after one year no-one showed interest in this missing feature we
classified it as 'wont fix'
