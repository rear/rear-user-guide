@jsmeix  
Attached the result of `egrep -i "bootloader|grub" rear-testupd.log` as
separate file.  
I couldn't find any entries causing the problem on first sight.  
Please let me know what to search for if you have further ideas.

I assing it to me because it is about openSUSE 13.1  
regardless that I am not at all an expert in bootloader issues  
i.e. do not expect too much from me here.

@GCChelp  
first and foremost I like to understand  
why you use GRUB legacy and not GRUB2?

On my openSUSE 13.1 test system  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/870\#issuecomment-225876504](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/870#issuecomment-225876504)
)  
I get by default GRUB 2 used as bootloader  
and with that it "just works" for me.

Therefore I like to understand the reasoning behind  
why you use GRUB legacy on your system.

@jsmeix  
We use GRUB legacy for legacy reasons...  
Have been running openSUSE on this workstations from something like 11.2
on, updating them as required. Now, everything is updated to 13.1, only
the bootloader stayed where it was.

I am not an expert in bootloader issues, too. That's why I always
postpone the possible project to update GRUB legacy to GRUB 2...

@GCChelp  
many thanks for your background information.  
It helps me a lot to understand how it can happen  
that an old bootloader is used on a new system:

By updating only the files of the system from older ones  
(i.e. by updateing the installed RPM packages)  
instead of installing the whole system anew from scratch.

This means in general that rear should be prepared  
to detact if an old (even outdated) bootloader is still in use.

But there is the general problem to reliably detect the actually  
used bootloader, cf. "Disaster recovery does not just work" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I will dig into it how rear detects what bootloader is used...

@GCChelp  
In your

your  
"result of egrep -i 'bootloader|grub' rear-testupd.log"  
contains:

<pre>
+++ cat /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader
++ BOOTLOADER=GRUB
</pre>

i.e. it has correctly detected that GRUB (not GRUB2) is used  
but later it does contradictingly

<pre>
++ Print 'Installing GRUB2 boot loader'
++ echo -e 'Installing GRUB2 boot loader'
++ grub_name=grub2
</pre>

FYI: On my openSUSE 13.1 test system  
after "rear -d -D mkbackup" I have in  
var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader

<pre>
GRUB2

I fully agree!

I am willing to provide further details or do some tests in our
environment.  
Just let me know what you suggest.

With probability one (cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost\_surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely)
)  
I found the root cause:

Your "result of egrep -i 'bootloader|grub' rear-testupd.log"  
contains:

<pre>
+ source /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21_install_grub.sh
++ ((  USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER  ))
++ [[ GRUB = \G\R\U\B ]]
+++ type -p grub-probe
+++ type -p grub2-probe
++ [[ -n /sbin/grub2-probe ]]
++ ((  USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER  ))
2016-06-27 12:20:57.496977540 Including finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh
+ source /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh
++ ((  USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER  ))
+++ type -p grub-probe
+++ type -p grub2-probe
++ [[ -n /sbin/grub2-probe ]]
++ LogPrint 'Installing GRUB2 boot loader'
</pre>

I.e. it runs finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh  
but that gives up because of a wrong test and  
lets finalize/Linux-i386/22\_install\_grub2.sh do the job  
which means it tries to install GRUB2.

The wrong test in finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh is

<pre>
# check the BOOTLOADER variable (read by 01_prepare_checks.sh script)
if [[ "$BOOTLOADER" = "GRUB" ]]; then
    if [[ $(type -p grub-probe) || $(type -p grub2-probe) ]]; then
        # grub2 script should handle this instead
        return
    fi
fi
</pre>

In finalize/Linux-i386/22\_install\_grub2.sh there is the same test:

<pre>
# Only for GRUB2 - GRUB Legacy will be handled by its own script
[[ $(type -p grub-probe) || $(type -p grub2-probe) ]] || return
</pre>

Currently I do not understand how that tests are meant to work.  
As usual no comments that tell the reasoning behind  
so that I could undrerstand the intent behind that code,  
cf. "Code should be easy to understand" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@GCChelp  
when you are logged in as root in the recovery system  
you can change whatever you want in the recovery system  
before you run "rear recover".

In this case please change  
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh  
and  
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/22\_install\_grub2.sh  
before you run "rear recover"  
to enforce that 21\_install\_grub.sh does its job  
and that 22\_install\_grub2.sh does not do anything.

For example (untested) remove the test from 21\_install\_grub.sh  
and in 22\_install\_grub2.sh add a plain "return" at the beginning  
so that 22\_install\_grub2.sh does nothing.

Then try if afterwards "rear recover" installs GRUB  
(and not GRUB2).

"git blame" indicates the above mentioned test in 21\_install\_grub.sh  
is from "Jesper Sander Lindgren" via commit 3f8b22f3  
and the matching test in 22\_install\_grub2.sh  
is from @gdha via commit 079de45b

@gdha  
could you explain how the

<pre>
[[ $(type -p grub-probe) || $(type -p grub2-probe) ]]
</pre>

tests in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895\#issuecomment-229344628](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895#issuecomment-229344628)
are meant to work?

From my current point of view the test looks like an  
overcomplicated indirection (RFC 1925 item 6a).

I would have expected something straightforward  
and simple (KISS) like in 21\_install\_grub.sh

<pre>
# do not do anything for GRUB 2 here because
# GRUB 2 is installed via 22_install_grub2.sh
test "GRUB2" = "$BOOTLOADER" && return
</pre>

and accordingly in 22\_install\_grub2.sh

<pre>
# do not do anything for GRUB (i.e. GRUB Legacy) here
# because GRUB Legacy is installed via 21_install_grub.sh
test "GRUB" = "$BOOTLOADER" && return
</pre>

Ha!  
Commit 3f8b22f shows that the test was KISS before.  
But currently I have no idea why it was complicated.  
There must have been a reason but who knows it?

The 21_install_grub.sh checked for GRUB2 which is
not part of the first 2048 bytes of a disk - only GRUB

I am afraid - I still do not understand it - I mean how does

<pre>
if [[ "$BOOTLOADER" = "GRUB2" ]]; then
</pre>

check the first 2048 bytes of a disk?

On my openSUSE 13.1 I have  
"$BOOTLOADER" = "GRUB2"  
and accordingly I think it should work to test for it.

@jsmeix I believe
`[[ $(type -p grub-probe) || $(type -p grub2-probe) ]]` was meant as a
test to verify if grub legacy or grub2 is present on the system. It
looks indeed a bit strange, feel free to modify towards you think how it
should be.

The whole logic when what bootloader install script  
is actually installing its specific bootloader  
confuses me.

In  
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/tree/perfer\_to\_run\_GRUB\_install\_script\_as\_specified\_issue895](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/tree/perfer_to_run_GRUB_install_script_as_specified_issue895)  
I tried to overhaul finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh  
but I fear I introduced regressions.

I need to test it.

For now  
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/tree/perfer\_to\_run\_GRUB\_install\_script\_as\_specified\_issue895](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/tree/perfer_to_run_GRUB_install_script_as_specified_issue895)  
is only there FYI so that you can have a look.

@gdha  
could you check my comments in  
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/blob/perfer\_to\_run\_GRUB\_install\_script\_as\_specified\_issue895/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/blob/perfer_to_run_GRUB_install_script_as_specified_issue895/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21_install_grub.sh)  
whether or not my reasoning makes sense?

In particular I have now in finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh

<pre>
# If the BOOTLOADER variable (read by finalize/default/01_prepare_checks.sh)
# is not "GRUB" (which means GRUB Legacy) skip this script (which is only for GRUB Legacy)
# because finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh is for installing GRUB 2
# and finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_elilo.sh is for installing elilo:
test "GRUB" = "$BOOTLOADER" || return
</pre>

But I wonder what is the intended way what "rear recover"  
should do if no BOOTLOADER value exists?

Is then "NOBOOTLOADER=1" the right default?

Or should perhaps "rear recover" install GRUB 2  
as fallback if no BOOTLOADER value exists?

for a test on your openSUSE 13.1 system with GRUB Legacy.

I assume it will not yet work for you because I did not  
remove the test for

<pre>
type -p grub-probe || type -p grub2-probe
</pre>

but I show now that message

<pre>

I assume you will get that message

Interestingly on my openSUSE 13.1 system I have by default  
both GRUB Legacy and GRUB 2 RPMs installed:

<pre>
# cat /etc/os-release
NAME=openSUSE
VERSION="13.1 (Bottle)"
VERSION_ID="13.1"

This means the test for

You are right, I got

@GCChelp  
because you do not use GRUB 2 on your system  
I assume you no not need /usr/sbin/grub2-probe  
on your system so that you could move it away with

<pre>
# mv /usr/sbin/grub2-probe /usr/sbin/grub2-probe.away
</pre>

as a dirty hack to make "rear recover" work on  
your particular system - at least for now because  
I need more time to find out about the reason behind  
why that special code is there not to simply trust when  
the value in /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader is "GRUB"  
(i.e. I like to avoid regressions on whatever other Linux  
distributions if I simply remove that code).

@jsmeix Your script version of 21\_install\_grub.sh looks ok to me. We
can give it a try (+1)  
The **NOBOOTLOADER** variable is meant as a kind of being desperate of
not knowing what to do when there is no bootloader found. It was (and
still is) up the the user to decide then. What else can we do? Make some
suggestions, but I wouldn't make a decision on his behalf as some will
like it, where others will be angry...

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/900](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/900)
I merged  
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/tree/perfer\_to\_run\_GRUB\_install\_script\_as\_specified\_issue895](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/tree/perfer_to_run_GRUB_install_script_as_specified_issue895)

It is still not fully reliably installing the right bootloader:  
When GRUB 2 is installed in addition to GRUB Legacy  
it still prefers to install GRUB 2 as bootloader  
even if the BOOTLOADER variable tells "GRUB"  
(which means GRUB Legacy).

I.e. further work is needed...

An idea how to further improve it:

If GRUB 2 and GRUB Legacy are installed and  
the BOOTLOADER variable tells "GRUB",  
then install GRUB Legacy as bootloader.

In contrast if GRUB Legacy is not installed then  
do not install GRUB Legacy as bootloader  
in finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh  
even if the BOOTLOADER variable tells "GRUB".  
In this case hope for the best that then GRUB 2 is installed.  
In finalize/Linux-i386/22\_install\_grub2.sh do the following:  
If GRUB 2 is installed then install GRUB 2 as bootloader  
even if the BOOTLOADER variable tells "GRUB".

@jsmeix  
It seems that openSUSE 13.1 installed both, GRUB legacy *and* GRUB 2 by
default.

Concerning the dirty hack, I found another workaround:  
If I simply deinstall all GRUB 2 rpms, the machine still is able to boot
and rear is finally working.  
I could even perform my first successful rear recover with this setup!
:-)

Regarding the BOOTLOADER variable and the file
/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader : Where does this value come from? How
is it determined and defined?

@GCChelp  
regarding  
"openSUSE 13.1 installed both, GRUB legacy and GRUB 2 by default":  
Yes, see my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895\#issuecomment-229660412](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895#issuecomment-229660412)

Regarding  
"deinstall all GRUB 2 ... successful rear recover":  
Many thanks for the positive feedback!

Regarding  
"BOOTLOADER ... Where does this value come from?":  
This is what I need to learn and understand as a precondition  
to further improve that the actually right bootloader gets installed  
during "rear recover".

Because of this I like to keep this issue open because  
in general it is not really solved regardless that for this  
special case here a workaround (deinstall GRUB 2) exists.

I had the same error in openSUSE 42.1:  
You need to edit
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh

You need to change the bootloader settings part like this and it will
work:

...

\#skip if another bootloader was installed  
if \[\[ -z "$NOBOOTLOADER" \]\] ; then  
return  
fi

\#for UEFI systems with grub legacy with should use efibootmgr instead  
\[\[ ! -z "$USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER" \]\] && return \# not empty means
UEFI booting  
\*\*  
\#check the BOOTLOADER variable (read by 01\_prepare\_checks.sh script)

if \[\[ "$BOOTLOADER" = "GRUB" || "$BOOTLOADER" = "GRUB2" \]\]; then  
\# grub2 script should handle this instead  
return  
fi

\#Only for GRUB Legacy - GRUB2 will be handled by its own script  
if \[\[ -z "$(type -p grub)" \]\]; then  
return  
fi  
...

@stoxxys  
please provide a GitHub pull request with your changes  
so that I can reliably see your exact changes  
(a GitHub pull request provides a nice diff)  
or at least provide a "diff -u" output preferably

@stoxxys  
what "grub\*" RPM packages have you installed on  
your openSUSE Leap 42.1 system?

On my openSUSE Leap 42.1 system I have only grub2\*  
packages

<pre>
# cat /etc/os-release 
NAME="openSUSE Leap"
VERSION="42.1"
VERSION_ID="42.1"
PRETTY_NAME="openSUSE Leap 42.1 (x86_64)"
...
# rpm -qa | grep -i grub
grub2-i386-pc-2.02~beta2-76.1.x86_64
grub2-2.02~beta2-76.1.x86_64
grub2-x86_64-efi-2.02~beta2-76.1.x86_64
grub2-branding-openSUSE-42.1-6.2.noarch
grub2-snapper-plugin-2.02~beta2-76.1.noarch
</pre>

and for me "rear recover" just works there.

your /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh

is not the current rear master, in particular ist is not  
my latest version from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/900](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/900)

Please report issues with older rear versions as separated  
issues and do not mix up your issues into other issues.

In general in case of issues preferably try to reproduce them  
with newest rear master code.

In general regarding how to test with  
the currently newest rear GitHub master code:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
# cd rear
# vi etc/rear/local.conf
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
and finally test whether "rear -d -D recover" works
</pre>

Do you consider this issue fixed in the next Rear release?
