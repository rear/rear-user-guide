Hello,

due to some special security requirements at our site we are forced to
encrypt all backups on external media. I've wrote a quick and dirty
patch that changes the tar commands in
backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh and
restore/NETFS/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh so that the tarball is des3
encrypted using openssl.

Do you think this could be a possible enhancement for rear? Please let
me know where I can upload the patch.

Best regards,  
Hannes

Thanks for the patch - I had a quick look and you encrypt/decrypt within
the whole `BACKUP=NETFS` workflow, but only check the keys with
`OUTPUT=USB`? I think `OUTPUT=ISO` should also be included. Perhaps, it
would make sense to move the
`rear/verify/USB/NETFS/default/60_check_encryption_key.sh` to
`rear/verify/NETFS/default/60_check_encryption_key.sh`?

@HannesGIT It is easier to make a pull request rather than work with
patches. The benefits are myriad:

-   Pull requests can be discussed (and even commented per line if need
    be)
-   Pull requests can be updated (when the branch is changed, committed
    and pushed)
-   Pull requests are merged more easily directly, including any recent
    changes

Working with git requires some deeper understanding, but you can also
modify files through Github itself and a pull-request is automatically
made for you. So if you are fixing a single file, or modifying
documentation, you don't even have to use the git command line)
