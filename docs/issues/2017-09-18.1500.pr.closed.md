**Note:** This is not about logging into the rescue system via SSH
(incoming access). It is about accessing *other systems* from a running
rescue system via SSH private keys stored on the rescue medium (outgoing
access).

#### Problem

The 'root' account on the original system may contain SSH private key
files without passphrase protection. Such unprotected private key files
are typically used to access other systems during unattended operations
(e.g. automatic backup to a network server). This kind of access can be
useful during restore, too.

Security then depends entirely on keeping such private keys secret,
which might be compromised if unprotected private key files leak onto an
unencrypted rescue medium. Anyone with physical access to the rescue
medium would be allowed unauthenticated access to each account on the
network authorizing one of those private keys.

#### Solution

Avoid leaking SSH private key files onto the rescue medium in
unprotected form:

This PR enables ReaR to copy the SSH client configuration for 'root'
with the option of passphrase-protecting otherwise unprotected private
keys. The user can choose between

-   copying previously unprotected private keys with added
    passphrase-protection,
-   copying previously unprotected private keys as-is (with a proper
    warning),
-   not copying unprotected private keys at all.

Private key files which already contain a passphrase are assumed to be
sufficiently secure and are copied as-is.

The PR also aims to optimize usability during 'rear recover' by asking
the user just once for any required SSH passphrase (using ssh-agent).

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.

@schlomo @jsmeix  
Lots of thanks to both of you for reviews and suggestions.

Before investing any further effort in `UserInput` let me just address
the latest comments. Hopefully, we can really keep `rear mkrescue`
non-interactive without compromising security. I might have a viable
idea, so just stay tuned.

there is a new confidential mode (via '-C')  
for the UserInput function that does not log  
possibly confidential data.

@OliverO2  
in general no confidential stuff should be copied  
into the ReaR recovery system unless the user  
specifically configured ReaR to do so, cf.

the UserInput function supports now the 'read' options  
'-r' for raw input and  
'-s' to not echo input from a terminal on that terminal  
plus a better description how to use the confidential UserInput mode  
in particular an example how to let the user enter a password  
that is (hopefully - unless I forgot something) now really quiet

<pre>
{ password="$( UserInput -I PASSWORD -C -r -s -p 'Enter the pasword' )" ; } 2>/dev/null
</pre>

where also in debugscripts mode nothing appears in the log,  
at least as it seems for me:  
I (mis)use for such tests
init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
because that is an 'init' script that is always and early run.

@schlomo

Sorry, it seems we have reached a point where I am not going to pursue
this PR any further. Let me just clarify:

1.  We seem to have completely different philosophies regarding how to
    deal with security vulnerabilities and how to avoid them:

    -   While ReaR normally cherry-picks every bit that should go into
        the recovery system, you now argue that the potentially
        vulnerable `/root/.ssh` directory contents should go there
        completely by default.
    -   I think it's not safe to assume that administrators, when
        changing stuff in `/root/.ssh`, are fully aware of the
        consequences in conjunction with ReaR or that they even think
        about this once ReaR was set up.
    -   I think it's not safe to assume that administrators have other
        protection measures in place. Secrets allowing complete access
        to sensitive information will end up on unencrypted USB sticks
        ready for anyone to pick up - an attacker's paradise.
    -   So I argue that secrets and other potentially vulnerable
        configuration files should not be transferred by default.
        Administrators should decide individually after assessing their
        specific situation (and probably after thorough consultation
        with security experts).
    -   I simply don't have the time and the necessary in-depth
        qualification to assess the security implications of every
        conceivable ssh configuration option, so I'd rather not seduce
        anyone by providing risky options. I like to play safe and stick
        to a reasonable minimum with (hopefully) well known
        consequences.

2.  In my view, we are losing focus and wasting time. Examples (all in
    `500_ssh.sh` unless otherwise stated):

    -   I had changed the introductory `if` into
        `has_binary ssh || has_binary sshd || return` on your request.
        This was unrelated to the PR's objective, changed indentation
        everywhere, and the situation got worse after merging a
        conflicting commit into master.
    -   Issues are being discussed which are unrelated to the code
        actually changed by this PR:
        -   `CLONE_USERS`
        -   splitting it up into prep and build stage (the file
            contained code writing to `$ROOTFS_DIR` before)
    -   Issues are being discussed which are of too little value to
        spend time on *now*, for example:
        -   When there is `ISO_RECOVER_MODE`, `PXE_RECOVER_MODE` and
            `LANG_RECOVER`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEYS_RECOVER_PASSPHRASE` (named
            after the phase where it is used) should be just OK.
        -   The `strings` call in `005_ssh_agent_start.sh` might not be
            strictly required, but makes sense when you don't want to
            research `grep`'s implementation details (it's meant to be a
            text-line-based tool) and the extra call doesn't hurt at
            all.
        -   Using `cat` instead of `$(< file)`, escpecially when it's
            meant to deliver an empty string if the file doesn't exist,
            just works. It was just an example in a comment, after all.
            And opinions on whether `$(< file)` is actually immediately
            understood by non-bash-experts looking at the configuration
            seems questionable.
    -   I don't say that these things couldn't be discussed but
        extensive discussions of questionable value are not what I'd
        call contributor-friendly. I just value my time more than what I
        think we're getting out of it. And while I'm happy to improve
        some other details on-the-fly, I did not intend to do a complete
        overhaul of `500_ssh.sh`.

So if you have very specific ideas of what the code should look like,
that's absolutely fine. I'd say just take my ideas and research from
this PR and implement it the way you like.

And finally, thanks to you, to the other contributors for creating ReaR,
and especially to @jsmeix for being so helpful.
