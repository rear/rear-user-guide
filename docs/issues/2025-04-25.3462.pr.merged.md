-   How was this pull request tested?

On my test VM with LVM and  
'use\_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Running 'layout/save' stage ======================
    Creating disk layout
    Overwriting existing disk layout file /root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
    Recreating LVM needs 'use_lvmlockd = 0' (there is 'use_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf)
    ...

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/save/GNU/Linux/220\_lvm\_layout.sh  
show LogPrintError message to inform the user  
when 'use\_lvmlockd = 1' was found in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf  
but recreating LVM things needs 'use\_lvmlockd = 0'

This is a a quick first attempt to implement  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3461#issuecomment-2830111347>

Currently it only checks the hardcoded file /etc/lvm/lvm.conf  
if there is a 'use\_lvmlockd = 1' line (ignoring whitespace) in it.  
I am not an LVM expert so I don't know if there are other ways  
how using lvmlockd could be specified.

@jsmeix if only the root VG is included do we error out as well?

@gdha  
on my test system which I used for  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3461>  
I have only one single VG "system" as in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6#sles-12-sp-5-with-default-lvm-and-btrfs-structure>

With 'use\_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf  
diskrestore.sh fails (because "lvm pvcreate" fails)  
so "rear recover" errors out as in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3461#issue-3017020804>

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
provided there are no severe objections.

Via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3462/commits/045e28ed9d2755fce2d83e1396d25210a7b01ead>  
I added the same also to  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110\_include\_lvm\_code.sh  
to have the user informed also during "rear recover".

How it looks during "rear recover" on my test VM:

    RESCUE localhost:~ # rear -D recover
    ...
    Running 'layout/prepare' stage ======================
    Recreating LVM needs 'use_lvmlockd = 0' (there is 'use_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf)
    Comparing disks
    ...

and then "rear recover" fails as in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3461#issue-3017020804>

After manual editing /etc/lvm/lvm.conf in the ReaR recovery system  
to `use_lvmlockd = 0` a subsequent run of "rear recover" works.

I wonder if it would be better to error out  
during "rear recover" in its early 'layout/prepare' stage  
when there is 'use\_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf  
in the ReaR recovery system because - as far as I see -  
LVM recreating cannot work with 'use\_lvmlockd = 1'  
because there is no lvmlockd in the ReaR recovery system  
so it should be more user-friedly to error out with

    Recreating LVM needs 'use_lvmlockd = 0' (there is 'use_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf)

instead of proceeding and let later diskrestore.sh fail.

I implemented to error out during "rear recover"  
when there is 'use\_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf

How that looks during "rear recover" on my test VM:

    RESCUE localhost:~ # rear -D recover
    ...
    Running 'layout/prepare' stage ======================
    ERROR: Recreating LVM requires 'use_lvmlockd = 0' (there is 'use_lvmlockd = 1' in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf)
    ...

After manual editing /etc/lvm/lvm.conf in the ReaR recovery system  
to `use_lvmlockd = 0` a subsequent run of "rear recover" works.
