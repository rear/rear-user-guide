Due to performance reasons I want the kernel and initrd information to
be pulled via http instead of tftp.  
There is currently no option to tell rear that the kernel and initrd is
a http target.  
A typical produced config looks like this:

    [...]
    MENU title Relax-and-Recover v2.6
    display CLIENT/CLIENT.message
    say ----------------------------------------------------------
    [...]
    ENDTEXT
        kernel CLIENT/CLIENT.kernel
        append initrd=CLIENT/CLIENT.initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw  selinux=0
    say ----------------------------------------------------------
    [...]

Manually adding the necessary http information works pretty fine:

    kernel http://pxe-over-http-srv:7777/CLIENT/CLIENT.kernel
    append initrd=http://pxe-over-http-srv:7777/CLIENT/CLIENT.initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw  selinux=0

I created an pull request for that including the code that works fine
for me.
