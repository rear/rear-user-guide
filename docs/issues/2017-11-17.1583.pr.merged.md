Enhanced  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
so that recovery system startup can run unattended  
when only a single MAC has changed:  
If there is only one old MAC and only one new MAC  
then automatically map the old MAC to the new one, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1399\#issuecomment-344656970](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1399#issuecomment-344656970)

When there are more MACs the user can already predefine  
in /etc/rear/mappings/mac what mapping should be done  
during recovery system startup and a predefined mapping  
is already done automatically without a user dialog.

@gdha @gozora @schabrolles  
could you have a look if it also works as well for you  
as it works for me (on my SLES12 test system).

@jsmeix From my point of view you can merge it - saw no issues so far -
but we better test it as soon as possible.  
It will not solve my issue with
[https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/36](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/36)
but the sooner I can do my test runs the better I would say

And - by the way - I did some cleanup of 55-migrate-network-devices.sh
