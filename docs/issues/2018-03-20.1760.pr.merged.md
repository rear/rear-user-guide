##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested with ReaR 2.3 under RHEL7.4 on a HP DL360 Gen9 with SPP
    2017.10 installed.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This change is required because in HP's SPP (Service Pack for
    Proliant) the hpacucli/hpssacli is now (recognised with Version
    3.10) called "ssacli" and the installation directory's name has been
    renamed as well.

@hpannenb  
many thanks for your valuable contribution to ReaR.

We (i.e. the ReaR upstream maintainers) depend  
on users who use non-standard functionality in ReaR  
(like HP Service Pack for Proliant software in this case)  
to adapt and enhance ReaR for their specific use-cases  
where we cannot reproduce things.
