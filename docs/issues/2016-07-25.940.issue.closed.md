At Debian 8 they removed some stuff from the syslinux package and
createt "isolinux" and "extlinux". At Open SuSE Build service you should
add those packages as dependency for ReaR under Debian 8.

I do neither use Debian nor do I know how to make  
packages for Debian so that I cannot help here.

But it seems you use Debian and therefore I ask you  
to contribute what is missing for your purpose.

Give me maintainer access to the rear project at OBS and I'll fix it in
10 seconds.

@heinlein-support  
with great pleasure I added you right now  
as maintainer to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/users/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/users/Archiving:Backup:Rear)

I very much appreciate you contribution to Relax-and-Recover!

@heinlein-support  
I don't know for sure but I think that packaging errors  
usually need to be fixed in the rear source files in the  
packaging/ directory:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/packaging](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/packaging)

I.e. I think you might need to fix it via a GitHub pull request  
and perhaps not by changing files in the openSUSE build  
service?

@heinlein-support could you please be so kind to prepare a small pull
request with the fix?

@heinlein-support I still have no clue what was changed - will close it
- if needed you can re-open it again with some input I can understand -
thanks

Well, upstream Debian, the packaging has a dependency on isolinux and it
builds fine.  
I don't know how Open SuSE Build service works but I think you should
rely on Debian's packaging which I did and support.  
Let me know if you can re-use that.

I assume this issue is fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1599](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1599)  
at least the "isolinux" part...
