Hi Gratien.  
Is s390x still unsuported? I tried run tests on s390x and it fails
because of 'Unknown bootloader'.

    # rear -v mkbackup
    Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-ibm-z-37.log
    Using backup archive '/tmp/rear.A7rTQmnaKkRkQdq/tmp/isofs/backup/backup.tar.gz'
    mkdir: created directory '/root/reartest'
    Creating disk layout
    ERROR: 
    ====================
    BUG in /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh:
    'Unknown bootloader () - ask for sponsoring to get this fixed'
    --------------------
    Please report this issue at https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
    and include the relevant parts from /var/log/rear/rear-ibm-z-37.log
    preferably with full debug information via 'rear -d -D mkbackup'
    ====================
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-ibm-z-37.log for details
    Terminated

    # rpm -q rear
    rear-2.00-1.el7.s390x

When I checked script 450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh, I saw that there
is no grubby support which s390x needs.

@tcerna Hi Tereca - unfortunately I do not have access to s390x hardware
to get support added into ReaR. I'm looking for a sponsor who can do
this for us, or someone who is willing to buy consultancy to get this
implemented.

@schabrolles Hey Sebastien, s390x is this an architecture that you cover
as well?

@gdha, not in my team ... If needed I could ask if somebody could find
some time to work on that.

The `grubby` bootloader might be now supported  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142)
is merged  
because `grubby` is mentioned in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-s390/305\_include\_s390\_tools.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-s390/305_include_s390_tools.sh)

@tcerna  
could you test if `grubby` now works for you, cf.
