Cf.

We have several places in the code where hardcoded `/tmp` is used.  
Normally `$TMP_DIR` should be used instead.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2462](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2462)
merged  
this issue should be fixed  
as far as I found possible places in the code with

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep '/tmp' | grep -v ': *#'

and

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'TMPDIR'
