-   Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git (installed via apt)

-   Debian 10

-   BareMetal

-   x86\_64

-   UEFI + GRUB

-   Root on mdadm, NVME disk attached, rear on USB flash drive:

-   During bootup, "rear udev" is called. this stalls the boot process
    for about a minute, then it beeps 16 times (15 short + 1 long) and
    boot proceeds

-   Workaround: uninstalling rear. removing/reinstalling does not help

If I call "rear udev" in the shell, I get the same delay (1 minute)
during which "Cannot include keyboard mappings (no keymaps default
directory '')" appears. Then the beeps.

Maybe inserting a keyboard mapping will help? If yes, how can I do that?

@gaia  
I am neither a Debian user  
nor do I know about packaging for Debian  
so that I can neither reproduce your issue  
nor can I verify how it could happen that on Debian

    During bootup, "rear udev" is called

which should certainly not happen - at least never ever by default -  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838)

To avoid that the rear udev workflow is run during boot  
it should help to remove its udev rule file,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838\#issuecomment-219708975](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838#issuecomment-219708975)

Nothing like that should happen on RPM-based systems because  
there is no ReaR udev rule file in ReaR RPM packages,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838\#issuecomment-219724335](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838#issuecomment-219724335)

In contrast from what I see at  
[https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/rear/filelist](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/rear/filelist)

    File list of package rear in sid of architecture amd64
    ...
    /lib/udev/rules.d/60-rear.rules

it seems on Debian systems a ReaR udev rule file  
might still get installed which is likely plain wrong.  
But I do not know what that `60-rear.rules` file contains.  
Perhaps its content is same as our upstream `62-rear-usb.rules`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules)  
or perhaps that `60-rear.rules` file is something Debian specific?

@gdha  
do you know a bit about packaging for Debian?  
If yes, could you have a look whether or not perhaps for Debian  
a udev rule file might get installed by default that causes  
that during boot "rear udev" is called?

I fail to make sense of our `packaging/debian` files in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/packaging/debian](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/packaging/debian)

E.g. to me `rear_1.13.0.orig.tar.gz` in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/debian/rear.dsc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/debian/rear.dsc)  
that is also on the openSUSE build service  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.5/rear.dsc?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.5/rear.dsc?expand=1)  
does not look right, I would expect some `2.5` version number?

@frediz Was checking
[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rear](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rear)
- seems still be at 2.4 - any chance to get 2.5 in there? We would
appreciate it a lot!

@gaia sorry that we miss-used your case.  
I need time to check the 'udev' rule again - it was added in 2012 I
think by @dagwieers and @jhoekx

@gdha Hey, Debian Buster was released beginning of July and package
upload was frozen till that.  
So now that the new Debian stable is released, I'll have a look at
updating 2.5 in Debian unstable.

Thank you for updating it, @frediz

@jsmeix, contents of /lib/udev/rules.d/60-rear.rules

Our upstream etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules)  
should be moved to a documentation directory  
or removed and replaced by documentation text  
so that it can never again happen that it (or any other udev rule)  
gets installed accidentally by default on user systems.

Basically same as we did for ReaR 2.5 with our /etc/cron.d/rear file,  
cf.

@jsmeix I believe "USB udev integration to trigger mkrescue on inserting
USB device" was the motivation for this udev rule (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blame/master/doc/user-guide/01-introduction.adoc\#L105](https://github.com/rear/rear/blame/master/doc/user-guide/01-introduction.adoc#L105)),
however, it was added 7 years ago. It might be that is an obsolete
feature at this moment.

@gdha  
because of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)  
I think the "USB udev integration to trigger mkrescue on inserting USB
device"  
functionality is not possible nowadays because it cannot work reliably.

I think only few users use it and those who use it have probably  
just luck that it works in their particular case (e.g. because the  
default `UDEV_WORKFLOW=mkrescue` completes sufficiently fast).

But by default there must not be such a functionality activated  
i.e. a functionality that only works by luck.

So I think our etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules content  
could be preserved to provide some backward compatibility  
but only in a documentation file where it is also documented  
that running "rear mkrescue" via the default `UDEV_WORKFLOW=mkrescue`  
may work with some luck but e.g. `UDEV_WORKFLOW=mkbackup`  
will fail "almost surely" cf.

@gdha  
I guess this is nothing that needs to be fixed inside the ReaR code  
but perhaps outside in the Debian packaging scripts  
so I think it can be postponed to ReaR 2.7
