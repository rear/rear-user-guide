-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**  
    Technically the impact is zero (only false alarm)  
    but to the user the impact is 'normal' because false alarm confuses
    the user.  
    I think essentially false alarm is like a WARNING message, cf.  
    [https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my SLES12 KVM system.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now also exclude all regular files in /dev/  
(device nodes get already excluded by 'find -type f')  
because sometimes it could happen that there are  
regular files in /dev/ in ROOTFS\_DIR  
which won't get copied into the recovery system  
so that those regular files in /dev/ are missing  
when etc/scripts/system-setup tries to verify their md5sums,  
for example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1883\#issuecomment-409875733](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1883#issuecomment-409875733)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891\#issue-347952166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891#issue-347952166)  
that both read (excerpts):

<pre>
md5sum: ./dev/.SRC-Semaphore: No such file or directory
./dev/.SRC-Semaphore: FAILED open or read
md5sum: WARNING: 1 listed file could not be read
</pre>

where /dev/.SRC-Semaphore seems to be related to  
IBM Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT), see  
[http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV35736](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV35736)

Additionally /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules is always
excluded  
to avoid false alarm because it seems it can be modified  
even before the md5sum verification runs, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1883\#issuecomment-409875733](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1883#issuecomment-409875733)  
that reads (excerpt):

<pre>
./etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules: FAILED
md5sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match
</pre>

Nice WARNING messages from md5sum ;-)

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections from you I would like to "just merge" it
tomorrow  
because things work well for me and I cannot imagine regressions  
(of course the one who makes a change can never imagine regressions ;-)
