-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

I simulated that proc/cmdline contains

    console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0

and then `COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS+=( console )`  
results

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Adding console=ttyS0,9600 to KERNEL_CMDLINE
    Adding console=tty0 to KERNEL_CMDLINE

for me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Overhauled rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
in particular to make it possible  
to add several kernel options by this script  
with same kernel option keyword like

    console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0

@rear/contributors @pcahyna  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
provided there are no objections.

Hello @jsmeix , what is the intended interaction with
`cmdline_add_console` (called from
rescue/GNU/Linux/400\_use\_serial\_console.sh )? It seems to strip all
console parameters and add its own, so if it gets invoked, this change
will have no effect on the console used. Am I right?

In this pull request there is no intended interaction  
with anything related to ReaR's current way of setting  
the 'console' kernel command line options.

The only intent of this pull request is to enhance  
the generic COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS functionality  
to make it possible to add several kernel options  
with same kernel option keyword like

    console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0

which is only used here as example for a kernel option  
that can appear more than once on the kernel command line.

After this pull request is merged - i.e. when

    COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS+=( console )

works as it should, then I will have a look at  
how we could simplify ReaR's current way of  
setting 'console' kernel command line options.  
My plan is to follow your proposal, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749\#issuecomment-1196650631](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749#issuecomment-1196650631)  
i.e. basically have in default.conf

    COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS=( 'console' 'net.ifnames' 'biosdevname' )

and then removal of ReaR's current default way  
of discovering "possibly console" devices and  
constructing 'console' kernel options on its own.

Hello @jsmeix , thanks for the explanation. I was asking because your
description of testing the change may suggest that the code is now
getting the console parameters right in the presence of a serial console
(although it does not actually say so).

@pcahyna  
if it is OK for you I would like to merge it soon.

Thanks, I think this is a step in the right direction.
