Contrary to its name, the OS\_MASTER\_VERSION variable was already used
for this purpose for some versions, e.g. RHEL 7. This fixes version
comparison on RHEL 10 and newer.

A side note:

The openSUSE Tumbleweed rolling release where  
OS\_MASTER\_VERSION = OS\_VERSION = YYYYMMDD (date)  
shows another reason why using version values  
is almost always plain wrong, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1972786350](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1972786350)

Because for openSUSE Tumbleweed  
OS\_MASTER\_VERSION and OS\_VERSION  
are continuously changing values (every few days)  
correct testing for such continuously changing values  
would be a laborious task with continuous maintenance  
efforts to keep the tests up-to-date.

In contrast testing "the real thing"  
works by design correctly.
