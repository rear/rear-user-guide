Hi, will it come and if so when, will the .rpm for SUSE sle 15 SP4 be
made available?

Or is it possible to use the .rpm from SP3?

Best regards.  
Andrea

@andreacosta83  
what RPM packages are you talking about?

Is it about officially by SUSE supported SUSE Linux Enterprise  
RPM packages from SUSE, then see the section  
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Or is it about voluntary openSUSE Build Service (OBS) RPM packages  
e.g. at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear)  
which is not built for any SLE version  
or at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
which is built for many Linux distributions and versions.

In particular it is built for SLE15 up to SLE15 SP3  
but not for SP4 regardless that SLE15 SP4 is selected  
on the OBS page where one can select what distributions  
a package should be built for (that selection is only visible  
for users who are logged in with admin permissions for the  
Archiving:Backup:Rear project).  
I will try to find out what is wrong there in OBS why it is  
not built for SLE15 SP4 regardless that is it selected.

But normally it does not matter if ReaR is built  
for SLE15 SP3 or SLE15 SP4 because ReaR is only bash scripts  
which are same for all Linux distributions and versions.

What could cause trouble are RPM package install dependencies  
so it could be impossible to install a RPM package  
that was built for one Linux distribution version  
on another Linux distribution version.

But for SLE15 SP3 versus SLE15 SP4 it is rather unlikely  
that RPM package install dependencies will cause trouble.  
When you can "just install" a ReaR RPM package that was  
built for SLE15 SP3 on SLE15 SP4 you get the exact same  
ReaR scripts installed as if you installed a ReaR package  
that was built for SLE15 SP4 so an installable ReaR package  
that was built for SLE15 SP3 will work same on SLE15 SP4  
as a ReaR package that was built for SLE15 SP4.

FYI  
because it is somewhat related as an addendum  
you may have a look at the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Got it!

For SLE15 SP4 and openSUSE Leap 15.4 things were changed  
(compared to SLE15 SP3 and openSUSE Leap 15.3)  
how RPM packages are built in the openSUSE Build Service (OBS).

Up to SLE15 SP3 and openSUSE Leap 15.3 both were separated  
regarding how RPM package are built so in OBS there are two  
separated things called "SLE\_15\_SP3" and "openSUSE\_Leap\_15.3"  
where ReaR RPM packages are built for.

Accordingly there is  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE\_15\_SP3/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_15_SP3/)  
which contains in particular  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE\_15\_SP3/x86\_64/rear-2.7-1.x86\_64.rpm](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_15_SP3/x86_64/rear-2.7-1.x86_64.rpm)  
with a size of 734140 bytes.

And there is  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE\_Leap\_15.3/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/)  
which contains in particular  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE\_Leap\_15.3/x86\_64/rear-2.7-1.x86\_64.rpm](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/x86_64/rear-2.7-1.x86_64.rpm)  
with a size of 734144 bytes.

So two slightly different binary RPM packages  
that contain two times the same software.

For SLE15 SP4 and openSUSE Leap 15.4 packages where Leap  
inherits the package from SLE are built exactly same  
so in OBS there is only one generic thing called "15.4"  
where ReaR RPM packages are built for and there is only one  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/)  
which contains in particular  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/x86\_64/rear-2.7-1.x86\_64.rpm](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/x86_64/rear-2.7-1.x86_64.rpm)  
with a size of 734172 bytes.

By the way:  
I noticed that for "15.4" the architecture "ppc64l" was  
not enabled to build ReaR RPM packages for that architecture.  
I enabled it now because RPM package install dependencies  
are different for different architectures so that now  
in particular ReaR 2.7 as RPM package for SLE15 SP4  
for the "ppc64l" architecture is now available at  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/ppc64le/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/ppc64le/)

> @andreacosta83  
> what RPM packages are you talking about?

@jsmeix Sorry you're right, I didn't specify: I always fetched the RPMs
from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/)  
depending on the distro version used, where SLE\_15\_SP4 is not
currently present.

So, summarizing, I can fetch and install from SLE\_15\_SP3 and I
shouldn't have problems (if not for the dependencies) or you advise me
to fetch and install the .rpm from the generic folder called "15.4"  
(at URL:
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.4/)
) ?

For SLE15 SP4 the common folder for "15.4" software  
is the right one - as far as I understand how OBS works ;-)

In the end the SUSE or openSUSE version does not matter  
as long as you can "just install" a ReaR RPM package because  
all RPM packages for one same ReaR version contain the same  
ReaR bash scripts so you get the same software installed.
