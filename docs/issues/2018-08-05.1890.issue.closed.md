I don't use Oracle Linux Server so that I cannot reproduce anything
here  
but it seems the
`/sbin/modprobe.ksplice-orig: No such file or directory`  
error is exactly the same as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/605](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/605)  
which should have been fixed since a long time via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f17948ff3760df36bea53a828274e2726e514c8b](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f17948ff3760df36bea53a828274e2726e514c8b)  
and we still have /sbin/modprobe.ksplice-orig in COPY\_AS\_IS  
and oinstall in CLONE\_GROUPS in our ReaR GitHub master code in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf)

@perlvan check the `dmesg` output after booting up with the rescue image
for information about LAN interfaces, and also try `ip a` command to see
what you really have.  
Or, try to add the following line to the `local.conf` file:

    KERNEL_CMDLINE="$KERNEL_CMDLINE net.ifnames=0"

I tried adding modprobe.ksplice-orig to COPY\_AS\_IS.. Now i can see the
interfaces came up and able to ping the tftp server. But when i try to
run the "rear recover" it is failing with below errors...

In current ReaR GitHub master code line 208 of
lib/\_input-output-functions.sh is

<pre>
# the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR file descriptors are saved as fd6 fd7 and fd8
</pre>

so line numbers of older versions of scripts don't help us much.

@perlvan  
could you try out using our current ReaR GitHub master code  
so that you and we use at least the same code  
which makes debugging easier for us.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).

Apologies my host which i'm testing is behind firewall and can't
download or upload the packages from Git.. Between I'm able to copy
System files and backup files ( backup.tar.gz) file directly to
/mnt/local with the network interafaces up..  
It's just that "rear recover" doesn't work, which complains about
"rpcbind" and portmap..

So, here are the steps i followed..  
I have mounted nfs manually and copied the backup and system files to
/mnt/local..  
Now how to make the system bootup with the restored files in
/mnt/local..?

@perlvan the `rpcbind` is missing because you used `OUTPUT=PXE`  
You might consider to add the following lines to `/etc/rear/local.conf`:

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" showmount mount.nfs umount.nfs )
    MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" nfs )
    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT="systemctl start rpcbind.target || rpcbind &"

@perlvan is your question sufficient answered?
