My networks are statically configured, but I also happen, sometimes, to
have `dhclient` running. Script `21_include_dhclient.sh` notices the
`dhclient` and sets `USE_DHCLIENT=y`. Then, when booting from an ISO,
`60-network-devices.sh` and `62-routing.sh` do nothing.

Should there be some way to tell `rear` to ignore the presence of
`dhclient` and go ahead and use the static network config?

Background: various IBM tools sneakily start `dhclient` to set up a
network interface on usb0 between the server and the baseboard
management controller, for configuring the BIOS, etc.. This interface
isn't required when recovering.

you could interrupt the boot process and add parameters to the rear
prompt:  
`rear noip` or `rear dhcp` or `rear ip=xx nm=xx gw=xx netdev=yy`

When you add `noip` you can run `60-network-devices.sh` and
`62-routing.sh` by hand.

I can already run `60-network-devices.sh` and `62-routing.sh` by hand
once `58-start-dhclient.sh` fails, so that doesn't really help. I was
hoping for something that could be arranged at configuration-time rather
than restore-time.

Would you accept a patch to add a new configuration option, say
`USE_STATIC_NETWORKING`, that would cause `60-network-devices.sh` and
`62-routing.sh` to run regardless of the setting of `USE_DHCLIENT`?

Sure we accept patches. Make sure it is well tested and afterwards you
can prepare a pull request. Thanks!
