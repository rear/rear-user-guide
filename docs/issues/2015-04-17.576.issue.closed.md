Hi ,

I am trying to recover Rhel 6.2 on System x3850 X5 / x3950 X5 . But i am
getting the error "An error occured during layout recreation" . I did
checked the logs it is not complaining about any insufficient space .
Infact i am testing same server back up and recovery .

Could you copy/paste the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` and I
suspect that rear (for some unknown reason so far) cannot handle one of
the options of the `/mnt/local/boot/efi` mount options...  
You could try to mount it manually after the error just to be sure that
the file system creation was successful?

@chelikani Are you able to mount the `/mnt/local/boot/efi` by hand in
recovery mode? We have to be sure that the `mkfs.vfat` was successful.
Try it without any special options like
`mount  /dev/sda1  /mnt/local/boot/efi`
