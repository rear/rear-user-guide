Hi,

Syslinux seems to be pretty much abandoned: last official binary from
Oct 2014, last testing binary from Mar 2016, last commit Feb 2019.

Rear supports OUTPUT=PXE, which I like that very much because it allows
me to prepare a complete backup environment und to use it by simply
booting the system from the network.

But OUTPUT=PXE heavily depends on Syslinux and seems to have no future,
especially with all the UEFI stuff coming up.

What is the preferred way to replace OUTPUT=PXE to produce a network
bootable backup environment? Is there any replacement yet?

I read nice things about [iPXE](https://ipxe.org) (hint, hint :-).</div>

@robertdahlem the `OUTPUT=PXE` mode actually only creates a pxelinux
configuration. You can also use `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` to get the same kernel
and initrd without that to use in your own PXE boot environment.

I agree with you that pxelinux is dated and that ReaR could benefit from
better support for modern PXE booting, but - to be honest - this is
something that will have to be developed by people who make use of it,
either as a contribution or as [professional
support](https://relax-and-recover.org/support/#professional-support)
engagement. That would be the only way to ensure that it actually works,
because there would be sufficient testing done.
