-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    "rear recovery" ran fine, all the partitions, logical volumes and
    filesystems were recreated. Then, 630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh was called
    (successfully). But once the recovery process was over, the virtual
    machine failed to boot (got stuck at GRUB) with the following error
    message:

<!-- -->

    error: disk 'lvmid/CLwYPh-8mlg-4knU-TdNb-DJse-YmZV-sQiZWg/3vjNwK-yySJ-irSt-VY0p-v2YQ-NGw4-ktRQ7f' not found

After investigation, it turned out that 2 (identical) EFI files on the
system still contained the UUID for the disks of the old system:

    ./boot/grub2/x86_64-efi/core.efi
    ./boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/grubx64.efi

To recreate (or adapt) these files, you should call a script called
"shim-install" (that takes your grub.cfg as input).

-   Workaround, if any:  
    I've created a new SUSE-specific script
    (finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/640\_install\_shims.sh) to call
    shim-install (inside a chroot on the recovered system). With it, the
    recovered system boots fine. I'll do a pull request to contribute
    it.

@petroniusniger  
thank you for your explanatory description of the problem and  
in particular thank you for your analysis what the root cause is.

I also experienced booting issues on a SLES12-SP4 system with UEFI  
(a KVM/QEMU virtual machine with OVMF/TianoCore UEFI firmware for
QEMU)  
where rebooting a recreated system failed.  
But I could always work around it by going into the OVMF/TianoCore
firmware  
boot menue and there directly selecting my harddisk to boot from  
(instead of the default entry wherefrom booting failed).

I look forward to your pull request!

@gozora  
because I know not much about UEFI and even less about secure boot  
I would appreciate it if you could have a look here.

Perhaps calling shim-install (in chroot on TARGET\_FS\_ROOT)  
is not only needed on (open)SUSE systems but in general  
also on other Linux distributions?

@gdha  
I dared to add this to the ReaR v2.5 milestone  
because the issue looks severe enough to be  
really useful when it is fixed in the next ReaR release.

But if you object I won't mind to postpone it to ReaR 2.6  
because we do not have any other issue reports except this one,  
in particular nothing about SLES12 or SLES15 up to now.  
I guess everybody tries to avoid secure boot ( like me ;-)

FYI regarding `shim-install`:

On my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system I have

    # type -a shim-install 
    shim-install is /usr/sbin/shim-install

    # rpm -qf /usr/sbin/shim-install
    shim-14-lp150.8.5.1.x86_64

    # man shim-install
    No manual entry for shim-install

    # /usr/sbin/shim-install --help
    Usage: shim-install [OPTION] [INSTALL_DEVICE]
    Install Secure Boot Loaders on your drive.
    --directory=DIR use images from DIR.
    --grub-probe=FILE use FILE as grub-probe.
    --removable the installation device is removable.
    --no-nvram don't update the NVRAM variable.
    --bootloader-id=ID the ID of bootloader.
    --efi-directory=DIR use DIR as the EFI System Partition root.
    --config-file=FILE use FILE as config file, default is /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.
    --clean remove all installed files and configs.
    --suse-enable-tpm install grub.efi with TPM support.
    INSTALL_DEVICE must be system device filename.

and how it is called during installation by YaST  
(long line shown wrapped here):

    # grep shim-install /var/log/YaST2/*
    /var/log/YaST2/y2log-1:
     2018-09-13 09:52:55 <1> linux-4la7(3837) [Ruby] lib/cheetah.rb:158
     Executing "/usr/sbin/shim-install --config-file\=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg".

On my SLES12-SP4 system it is the same (except the shim RPM version):

    # type -a shim-install 
    shim-install is /usr/sbin/shim-install

    # rpm -qf /usr/sbin/shim-install
    shim-0.9-23.14.x86_64

    # man shim-install
    No manual entry for shim-install

    # shim-install --help
    Usage: shim-install [OPTION] [INSTALL_DEVICE]
    Install Secure Boot Loaders on your drive.
    --directory=DIR use images from DIR.
    --grub-probe=FILE use FILE as grub-probe.
    --removable the installation device is removable.
    --no-nvram don't update the NVRAM variable.
    --bootloader-id=ID the ID of bootloader.
    --efi-directory=DIR use DIR as the EFI System Partition root.

My main concern is how to determine whether or not it is needed  
to call shim-install (in chroot on TARGET\_FS\_ROOT).

In other words:  
My main concern is how to determine whether or not  
secure boot was actually used on the original system?

I fear when we call shim-install in the recreated system  
but secure boot was not used on the original system  
we may introduce secure boot on the recreated system.

We have various variables that deal with UEFI in default.conf:

    BOOTLOADER
    USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER
    UEFI_BOOTLOADER
    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER
    EFI_STUB
    OUTPUT_EFISTUB_SYSTEMD_BOOTLOADER
    EFI_STUB_EFIBOOTMGR_ARGS

but it is not clear to me how each one actually is meant to be used,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942\#issuecomment-438220832](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942#issuecomment-438220832)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942\#issuecomment-438215291](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942#issuecomment-438215291)

On first glance SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER looks right  
to determine whether or not it is needed to call shim-install  
but according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942\#issuecomment-438220832](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942#issuecomment-438220832)  
SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER currently belongs only  
to the ReaR recovery system - or I misunderstand something...

Quick reply to some of the points raised by @jsmeix above:

-   in the case of my test system, secure boot was **not** used before,
    and I have no reason to believe that calling "shim-install" has
    enabled it
-   I learned about the need to call "shim-install" by reading the YaST2
    logs after I used it to re-install the bootloader "manually" in
    order to recover my then unbootable VM
-   I've not made any test (yet) with secure boot enabled

@petroniusniger  
no need to worry about details right now - just submit a pull request  
so that we can have a first look at what helped in your case.

As said in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116\#issuecomment-482470708](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116#issuecomment-482470708)  
I don't know much about UEFI and even less about secure boot  
so I cannot tell if `shim-install` is perhaps even always needed  
on (open)SUSE systems with UEFI firmware.  
I only know from `shim-install --help` that its usage is to

    Install Secure Boot Loaders on your drive

so that I concluded it is only needed when secure boot is used.  
Via Googling I found up to now  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI)  
that mentiones `shim` only in relation to secure boot and also in  
[https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book.opensuse.reference/cha.grub2.html](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book.opensuse.reference/cha.grub2.html)

    If you are using UEFI Secure Boot and your system
    is not reaching GRUB 2 correctly anymore, you may need
    to additionally reinstall Shim and regenerate the UEFI boot table.
    To do so, use:
      shim-install --config-file=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg

indicates that `shim-install` is only needed when secure boot is used.

In contrast to what I wrote above in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116\#issuecomment-482472370](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116#issuecomment-482472370)  
I changed it now to the ReaR v2.6 milestone because  
I need more time to sufficiently understand what goes on behind.

With

this issue should be fixed.
