-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Impossible to test because it is unknown what that script should do.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Remove

Furthermore this script reads

    # Added by udev workflow

but it does its stuff in any case for USB  
regardless of the workflow  
so this script looks utterly broken.

According to

    git log --follow -p usr/share/rear/build/USB/default/800_enforce_usb_output.sh

this script originated (as 80\_enforce\_usb\_output.sh) in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4ec9ed4aa58787f42ad2946d68358d1de3417a60](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4ec9ed4aa58787f42ad2946d68358d1de3417a60)  
which only tells

    Make sure OUTPUT=USB is enforced in udev workflow during recover

but it neither explains WHY that is needed  
nor does it implement what it tells  
because the script is run in any case for OUTPUT=USB  
regardless whether or not the udev workflow is used.

So as far as I understand it:  
This script is run in any case for OUTPUT=USB  
and then (i.e. when there is OUTPUT=USB in local.conf)  
it "enforces" OUTPUT=USB in ROOTFS\_DIR/.../local.conf  
but how could OUTPUT in ROOTFS\_DIR/.../local.conf  
differ from OUTPUT in local.conf?

@jsmeix this is to be used by the udev workflow, triggered from
etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules . Shouldn't the whole udev workflow
be removed, if we can't test it?

FYI  
regarding the udev workflow have a look at  
(what I "just found" right now by searching  
some of my older archived mails)  
for example things like

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)  
"udev workflow cannot work as it is currently implemented"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838)  
"USB gets suspended"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2180](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2180)  
"during boot 'rear udev' is called, causing delay during boot"

From my personal point of view  
the udev workflow and all what belongs to it  
should be removed the sooner the better, cf.

RHEL has never been using the udev workflow (the udev rules have not
been shipped in our RPM).

Also SUSE has never supported the udev workflow.

In particular there is no '62-rear-usb.rules' file shipped

-   neither in a SUSE "rear..." RPM package for SLE-HA, cf.  
    "... rear116 / rear1172a / rear118a / rear23a / rear27a"  
    in
    [https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
-   nor in an "official" openSUSE "rear" RPM package  
    (i.e. what `osc search rear | grep '^openSUSE:'` lists)

@rear/contributors in particular @schlomo @gdha  
please also have a look here (as time permits).

If you do not object I would like to merge it  
next Monday (18 Dec. 2023) afternoon.

@schlomo  
thank you for having a look here!

I agree that it would be better to first inform the user.

But here I don't see how I could properly inform the user.  
I mean if I "just called" Error() in that script  
it would error out in any case because that script  
runs unconditioned.

I also don't know under which conditions that script  
should be run because I do not understand for what reason  
it is there at all.  
I mean that I do not yet understand what it is that made you  
"understood that we run $BACKUP and $OUTPUT and  
even $OUTPUT/$BACKUP files in every stage".

It is neither about that $BACKUP and $OUTPUT and  
even $OUTPUT/$BACKUP scripts are run in every stage  
nor about "multiple $OUTPUT methods".

It is about WHY build/USB/default/800\_enforce\_usb\_output.sh  
exists at all because - as I explained above - I don't see  
any reason why it needs to do what it does because  
I don't see how OUTPUT in ROOTFS\_DIR/.../local.conf  
could differ from OUTPUT in local.conf ?  
I.e. as far as I see OUTPUT is same in both.

@jsmeix I was referring to `SourceStage()`:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/e0609c751b260f959f9caa82056ecfad0c1840cb/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh\#L110-L114](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/e0609c751b260f959f9caa82056ecfad0c1840cb/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh#L110-L114)

Fun fact, this script `build/USB/default/800_enforce_usb_output.sh`
would be included for both `BACKUP=USB` and for `OUTPUT=USB`.

I did some more thinking about this issue and I would like to propose a
different approach:

Insert an `Error` at line 8 or so of the script to error out with a
deprecation warning and a link to this issue and a request to provide
more context for the use case.

It would hit only if this script would do something.

I know, breaking stuff is bad but it seems to me that this is the only
way how we can force feedback from users of this code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If, OTOH, everybody else wants to just remove it, then please go ahead.
Worst case, somebody will come and complain why we broke ReaR and why it
took them 3 days to figure out why.

BACKUP=USB is not supported and  
not listed in "man rear" or in default.conf  
and for a test with BACKUP=USB I get

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
    ...
    ERROR: The BACKUP method 'USB' is not supported (no /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/restore/USB directory)
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 035_valid_backup_methods.sh:

so in practice build/USB/default/800\_enforce\_usb\_output.sh  
will not be run for BACKUP=USB  
so it should be only run for OUTPUT=USB
