Hello, @phracek @gdha , why this change? It reverts (partially) the
change in 8a545d608b7c4baf408ca1033458cd8a0ace5fdd and risks
reintroducing bug \#465. The point is, when the directory is not empty,
you should not remove it, because it can contain valuable data, like
previous backups or backups from other machines.  
I also don't see how it fixes \#781 (support for S/390), since I suspect
the nonempty directory is a consequence of not having support for S/390,
not the cause.

More general question, the function `cleanup_build_area_and_end_program`
and the `AddExitTask` in 100\_mount\_output\_path.sh seem to have the
same purpose. Why do we have both?

Similar question applies to

    [[ -d $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$NETFS_PREFIX ]] && rm -rf $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$NETFS_PREFIX
    [[ -d $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$RSYNC_PREFIX ]] && rm -rf $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$RSYNC_PREFIX

in usr/share/rear/output/default/980\_umount\_output\_dir.sh although
this part has not been touched by this change nor by 8a545d6. (I am
asking because there seem to be way too many places where we rm -rf
potentially valuable data.)

I also found that `rm` has a useful `--one-file-system` option. As ReaR
does not support RHEL 5 anymore, we could start using it, unless there
are some supported SLES versions that lack it (Debian 8 and Ubuntu 16.04
and RHEL 6 have it:
[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/rm.1.html](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/rm.1.html)).

@pcahyna  
in general ReaR has grown according to what was needed in practice  
by various different contributors over the time.  
So we do have lots of duplicated convoluted, obfuscated, outdated,  
quick-and-dirty, and whatever else kind of "bad code" places.  
I tried to clean up several of them (those places where I was mostly
hit)  
as good as I could (with my limited overall knowledge of the whole
picture).  
So when you are hit by whatever kind of "bad code" place  
feel free and be brave and merciless and try to clean up the mess.  
Usually things won't get worse when you do it with some reasonable
care.  
Miracles are not expected (i.e. you may make mistakes - that's
normal).  
But please add meaningful and explanatory comments to your cleaned up
code  
to enable others to fix and enhance your code properly if needed later,
cf.

@jsmeix thanks for your encouragement, but I first wanted to learn the
intent of the current code (in this case, duplication of output
directory removal) before attemtoting any cleanup :-)
