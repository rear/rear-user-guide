Installed REAR & integrated it with NSR :  
While creating mkrescue image "its saying no Networker ISO backups found
". But ISO image has been created with 136MB size. Is this image valid
and can be tested or am i missing something here ?

OS Version :Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.7 (Santiago)  
REAR rpm used : rear-2.3-1.el6.x86\_64.rpm  
Networker client : lgtoclnt-7.6.4.1-1.x86\_64

@nirmal21s: Either do not care since the ISO will be created or use the
actual snapshot of ReaR from github instead. The reason are missing
changes in the file
/usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh
for V2.3 which did not deal with the NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE. In this script
ReaR checks the existance of the ISO on the Legato Server but I suppose
You are using the NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=YES where it should skip this check.
( cf. issue \#1737 )

@nirmal21s

I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we at ReaR upstream fix bugs.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

If it works with current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
we would really appreciate an explicit positive feedback.
