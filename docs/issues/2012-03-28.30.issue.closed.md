Original report
---------------

RedHat Enterprise 5.5. Rear 1.11 on HP ProLiant BL460c G7 with Smart
Array P410i Controller. `rear mkrescue` works fine.  
I have boot from rear.iso without errors. When I start the recovery
process, I get the error:

    Error reading controller configuration: config.txt or hpacucli-commands.sh missing from '/var/lib/rear/recovery/hpacucli/Slot_0'
    Please configure controller 0 manually and press anny key...

Can you help me to solve the problem?

Does the */var/lib/rear/recovery/hpacucli/* directory exist in your ISO,
it does not in your rar?

You could also try `USE_LAYOUT=y` in *local.conf* or one of the
snapshots (where this is the default) to see if the issue has been fixed
there.

I have attached the inventory of Slot\_0 from the iso-file. The
hpacucli-commands.sh is empty.

This should be tested with the layout code active.

    USE_LAYOUT=y

Try Rear 1.12 or one of the snapshot releases.

Please reopen if still an issue in snapshots.
