Triggered by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155)  
I am wondering  
why "rear recover" regenerates  
the original's system initrd in any case?

In particular why I am wondering see in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152\#issuecomment-1941510047](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152#issuecomment-1941510047)

    Cannot create initrd (found no mkinitrd in the recreated system).
    ...
    Nevertheless the recreated system boots well for me
    as expected because I recreated on 100% compatible
    replacement "hardware" (on a same VM) so the same initrd
    from the original system should still work.

and see in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155\#issue-2138456399](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155#issue-2138456399)

    Additionally improved the user messages
    (in particular the warning messages)
    to make it more clear that the point is
    to decide if the recreated system will boot
    with the initrd 'as is' from the backup restore.

The default use case of "rear recover" is to recreate  
on "Fully compatible replacement hardware"  
(where "hardware" could be also virtual hardware), cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Fully\_compatible\_replacement\_hardware\_is\_needed](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Fully_compatible_replacement_hardware_is_needed)

On "fully compatible replacement hardware"  
the initrd 'as is' from the original system  
together with the kernel 'as is' from the original system  
(that both together are restored 'as is' from the backup)  
must still work  
(otherwise it is no "fully compatible replacement hardware").

So for the default use case of "rear recover"  
there is no need to regenerate the initrd.

But regenerating the initrd needs relatively long time  
so "rear recover" is slower than actually needed  
AND  
regenerating the original's system initrd  
during "rear recover" may generate the new initrd  
with (possibly subtle but severe) differences  
compared to the original's system initrd  
so regenerating the initrd in any case  
may do more harm than good in practice  
for the default use case of "rear recover".

I would check with SW RAID, I suspect some details of the recreated
array may differ from the original (like UUIDs) and regenerating the
initrd may be needed for picking up this.

This may be the case also for other IDs in the system config files that
may change, if the files are embedded in the ramdisk. We have a script
running at the end that updates the IDs in known config files.

@pcahyna  
thank you for the reasons why regenerating the initrd  
could be needed in any case to be more on the safe side  
against (possibly subtle but severe) differences  
between the original system and the recreated system.

just as side note, i also experiencing this mostly on systems with
multipath setups.  
Im using qemu to simulate a multipath san environment and noted in my
automated tests that initrd is allways recreated, even if system
recovery is done into is started with equal qemu options.
