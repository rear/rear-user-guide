I was trying to install ldap on the server and something happened and I
can not boot the server any more, I get the following error. Can you
provide some advice how to fix this?

telinit: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote
application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy
blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection
was broken.  
init: rcS post-stop process (47) terminated with status 1

Unfortunately I can not boot the server and so I have no way of editing
anything on the server. Any other suggestions?

If you are using ISO for booting.

1.  Mount ISO on some other (possibly Linux) machine
2.  [Edit](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/07/how-to-view-modify-and-recreate-initrd-img)
    initrd.cgz (check if /etc/passwd /etc/nsswitch.conf are present if
    not add them)
3.  Re-create ISO with new initrd.cgz
4.  Try to boot with new ISO

I am running on a linux machine with redhat 6.6 and I do not think I am
using ISO for booting

Hmm, maybe i've just misunderstood. Can you explain one more time in
more detail what is your problem, and how does ReaR fit into it?

@satelitexp Sorry - I do not see in your description what it has to do
with ReaR? Perhaps contact your RedHat representative instead as it
seems to be an software issue.

Well, then I have to agree with @gdha, that this issue have nothing to
do with ReaR and you should contact your OS vendor.
