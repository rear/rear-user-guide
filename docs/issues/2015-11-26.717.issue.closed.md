Currently, the config allows us to specify the volume on beforehand but
not the jobid.  
(this is possible too in bootstrap.txt of bextract)

It would be good if we could specify the JobId too in the configuration
file, so an almost-automatic disaster recovery CD can be built.

@HazCod Dag and Jeroen wrote the Bacula integration, but they are not
active currently within the rear project. So, no clue who could assist
you with the feature request?

@HazCod Could you explain with an example?

@gdha As far as I know, when booting the recovery CD for bacula, you
need to select the jobid. If we could include that in our config too,
users could just insert the CD and it would recover automatically.  
( no user-driven decisions needed )

Jobids here are ids of the backup jobs done by bacula, e.g.:  
001 today at 12:00  
002 today at 13:00  
003 todat at 14:00

So if I want to generate a disaster recovery ISO for the latest backup,
I would just fill in the last known JobId (003) in the config file and
generate the ISO.

@HazCod sounds indeed interesting to keep. Are you able to prepare a
pull request for this?

Not at the moment as i'm currently not using rear in my situation, I'm
afraid

I neither use Bacula nor Bareos but according to what I read in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/997](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/997)  
there is meanwhile support for a variable  
named BAREOS\_RESTORE\_JOB  
which seems to be support for a Bareos job ID.

According to  
[https://www.bareos.org/en/](https://www.bareos.org/en/)  
"Bareos is a ... fork of the backup project from bacula.org"  
which indicates that support for a Bacula job ID  
could be implemented in a similar way.

But
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/717\#issuecomment-186216176](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/717#issuecomment-186216176)  
indicates that at least for now this will not be implemented  
so that I close this issue now.

If needed it could be reopened but preferably  
a new issue based on a current rear version  
should be submitted.
