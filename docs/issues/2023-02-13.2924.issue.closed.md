Dear @frilogg, please install ReaR version 2.7, e.g. from
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RHEL\_7/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RHEL_7/)
and try again

In the rescue system you'll have to type `rear recover`, of course:

Hi @schlomo , thank you for feedback, but .. had hoped to figure it out
with this version. I have used rear for many of my customers, and some
of the problem is that they "only" want to use the version that is with
the official redhat repo. I also noticed that with redhat 9.1 version
2.6 is default also.. So for this cause no good quick tips or you notice
anything from the logs provided ?

Well, line 11 of your log says:

`/etc/rear/local.conf: line 17: export: `=/home/rear': not a valid
identifier\`

(don't understand why you would export something in a ReaR config anyway
as everything is one large shell script)

Besides that you didn't provide anything about the actual problem which
is during recovery, right?

Hi and good morning @schlomo , this was corrected but I still had the
problem.

I followed your advice and installed Rear 2.7., so thats the version Im
on now.  
When trying to create a backup now it exit after few seconds. When I do
lsblk -p this is not mounted. Please advice.

The reason we want to export and use another tmpdir or else it would not
be enough space on device. I ran now export TMPDIR=/home/rear - and now
the backup is created. In rear 2.4 we could have this string in the
local.conf but it seems that its not working anymore?!

Sorry @frilogg, we need to somewhat change the mode of our conversation
here:

1.  please use correct markdown to make it simpler to read
2.  please provide much more context, log files, screenshot etc. and not
    just a fragment.

With the information you shared I don't even know what to look at.

If you do this for a customer then maybe a commercial support option
might be better suited for you where one of us will join you in a remote
screen sharing session to look at your situation.

About your `TMPDIR` question, in 2.7 we changed that to be more
standards compliant and the best place to find out about ReaR variabled
is always `default.conf`, where you can find everything about `TMPDIR`:

    # TMPDIR
    #
    # Relax-and-Recover needs a (temporary) working area where it builds in particular
    # the rescue/recovery system ISO image (and perhaps even stores the backup archive).
    # The directory name of the working area is created in /usr/sbin/rear by calling
    #   mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    # which usually results /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX or $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    # the latter when the canonical Linux/Unix environment variable TMPDIR
    # is set in the environment where /usr/sbin/rear is called.
    # To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover call
    #   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
    # before calling 'rear' (/prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist).
    # This is useful for example when there is not sufficient free space
    # in /var/tmp or $TMPDIR for the ISO image or even the backup archive.
    # TMPDIR cannot be set to a default value here unconditionally but only
    # if it is not set before calling the program, otherwise /usr/sbin/rear
    # would not work in compliance with the Linux/Unix standards regarding TMPDIR
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968
    # The default is /var/tmp instead of the more usual /tmp (the system default),
    # because /tmp is not intended for such large amounts of data that ReaR usually
    # produces when creating the image (see file-hierarchy(7)). In particular,
    # /tmp can be a tmpfs, and thus restricted by the available RAM/swap.
    export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}"
    ####

As it is exported there you don't need to (and shouldn't) export it
again

@frilogg Concerning your customers who want to use the official rear
version delivered with their disribution - they have the right to submit
an incident at RH and RH support will pick it up and try to help them or
provide a fix (which will be merged in our master repo). RH and Suse are
activily committing enhancemants and bug fixes in our ReaR master repo.

Only as a side note FYI  
(I know it does not actually help):

Sigh!  
Just the usual user experience when booting via UEFI fails.  
In general, not limited to ReaR, it always behaves is way:  
Not any (error) message, neither from the UEFI firmware  
nor from the bootloader - so there is nothing helpful.  
I have no idea how to debug such UEFI booting issues.

@jsmeix this error was gone when I exported the TMPDIR, so the backup
ran. When I did not have this I could not make a complete backup at all.
And it is this backup that I am trying to restore. You still want me to
add this?

@frilogg  
but then your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/10755054/rear27-solx8ht.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/10755054/rear27-solx8ht.log)

To get a clean state without possibly broken  
leftovers from what you did with ReaR 2.4  
I suggest to completely redo things  
with ReaR 2.7 from scratch i.e.:

First redo "rear -D format" for your USB disk  
and save its debug log file - perhaps we need it.  
Note that since ReaR 2.7 "rear format" behaves different,  
see our release notes about "rear format":  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L297](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L297)

Then run "rear -D mkbackup" again and also  
save its debug log file - perhaps we need it.  
This will create the ReaR recovery system plus  
its bootloader things and the backup.tar.gz  
anew from scratch on your USB disk.

Then try to boot this new ReaR recovery system  
from your USB disk and report here whether or not  
that works for you with ReaR 2.7 - i.e. only  
whether or not the ReaR recovery system boots and  
if you can log in there as 'root' (no password needed).

Provided this works you can try to recreate your system  
by calling "rear -D recover" from inside the running  
ReaR recovery system.

When you run "rear recover" on some hardware or VM  
it will completely overwrite what there already is  
on the harddisk(s) or virtual disk(s) on that hardware or VM  
so never try out "rear recover" on your original system  
where you had run "rear mkbackup" before,  
see the initial sections in

Hi @jsmeix , I have now created the usb again with  
`rear format -D `

But I still get the same error when running  
` rear -D mkbackup`

Highly appreciate some more feedback @jsmeix or @schlomo as the backup
media itself is not creating with Rear 2.7.

Done some more research and with a help from a colleague we made
following changes to

> /usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350\_check\_usb\_disk.sh

`# Check if the ReaR USB device is not accidentally mounted on other than $BUILD_DIR location: vBUILD_DIR=$BUILD_DIR BUILD_DIR=$(echo $BUILD_DIR | sed -r 's/\/var//g') if res=( $( grep -v $BUILD_DIR /proc/mounts | grep "^$REAL_USB_DEVICE" ) ) ; then     Error "USB or disk device '$REAL_USB_DEVICE' is already mounted on '${res[1]}'" fi BUILD_DIR=$vBUILD_DIR`

This made the script go pass the error

> ERROR: USB or disk device '/dev/sda3' is already mounted on

The backup starting to create but stops and "freeze" when trying to
finish.

Any suggestion to this error when its freezing?

@frilogg  
sorry - no idea - and currently no time for it (too many other
things).  
I will have to test things myself (but I use openSUSE Leap 15.4)  
to get a better understanding what actually is going on  
before I can make some reasonable comment here.

@schlomo and @jsmeix

I have now got it to work but I had to do the following

1.  Make the changes to the script 350\_check\_usb\_disk.sh , and
    hopefully this can be something you can use.

2.  Install kernel-devel

3.  Use another TMPDIR location as this got to small for /var/tmp - and
    created exclude for this folder.

4.  Define use of theese seeings  
    BOOTLOADER="GRUB2-EFI"  
    USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1

5.  Then use secure boot at startup. No secure is not working. I have
    also tried checking bios settings if there are any settings that
    could have impact here but secure boot is actually off, and also
    settings regarding uefi paths is off.

Its working for now, but if I get the time I will try doing more
research but the workaround in the 350 script worked.

@frilogg  
thank you for your feedback that  
for now you could make it work for your case  
and what you did to make it work for your case.

I will have a look when time permits.
