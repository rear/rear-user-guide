-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): RHEL7.6

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    /etc/rear/os.conf:
    OS_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer
    OS_VERSION=7

    /etc/rear/local.conf:
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///var/lib/rear/output/
    BACKUP=NBU
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NBU=( "/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/*" "/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpjava*" /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/xbp /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/private /usr/openv/lib/java /usr/openv/lib/shared/vddk /usr/openv/netbackup/baremetal )
    export TMPDIR=/var/tmp

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): n/a

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): n/a

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): n/a (I guess you want this template to read
    'local disk', not 'lokal disk' :-))

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    While running `rear mkrescue -v`, it reports the following

<!-- -->

    <snip>
    There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries
    /usr/openv/lib/plugins/libauthpam_t.so requires additional libraries
            libvrtsat_t.so => not found
    ReaR recovery system in '/var/tmp/rear.NMVYmoi2gx7hvX0/rootfs' needs additional libraries, check /var/log/rear/rear-hostname.log for details
    </snip>

-   Workaround, if any:

Currently we're checking if setting `NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the
following will solve the issue:

    NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/openv/lib:/usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/"

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files): n/a

I do not use NBU (Symantec/Veritas NetBackup)  
because I do not have any kind of proprietary software  
like third-party backup tools.

Perhaps  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907\#issuecomment-422281884](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907#issuecomment-422281884)  
could help here as a workaround?

Perhaps this issue here has the same root cause as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1974)  
that is fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980)

How to try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
where
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980)
is merged:

Basically "git clone" our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
into a separated directory and then configure and run ReaR  
from within that directory like:

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear.github.master

    # cd rear.github.master

    # vi etc/rear/local.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

Hi!  
Sorry for not getting back to you earlier.  
My customer reported that adding the following to the configuration
fixed the situation.

    NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/openv/lib:/usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/"

Maybe you can integrate this?! Or shall I provide the merge request?

@rmetrich  
I dared to assign this issue to you because  
you had worked on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1974)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2105\#issuecomment-483165617](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2105#issuecomment-483165617)  
is about to change default.conf  
from

    NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/openv/lib"

to

    NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/openv/lib:/usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/"

The question (that I cannot answer) is whether or not  
adding `/usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/` to NBU\_LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
by default could have unwanted side-effects (a.k.a. regressions)
elsewhere.

@jsmeix Thanks for pulling in the right person.

I do not see any issue with this change.

Created PR for this. Let me know if you need anything additionally
changed/done, etc.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2122](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2122)
merged  
I consider this issue to be fixed.

@ofalk  
thank you for your pull request with the fix!

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2377d694d7a8f2fc4232dbfa539006a499ea9cbb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2377d694d7a8f2fc4232dbfa539006a499ea9cbb)  
I added a comment to default.conf that tells why
/usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/  
is needed in NBU\_LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH

Awesome - thanks for the prompt replies and merge!  
@jsmeix No problem - that was low hanging fruit!

@ofalk do you know if there was there any reason to add the trailing
slash? (Other entries do not have it, so I would prefer to be
consistent.)

@pcahyna I don't think there was any special reason to use trailing
slash - I think it was just the preference of my customer back then and
I used it as it is, given they had tested it that way.

@ofalk thanks, I have another customer who tested it with the slash
removed, so I will submit a PR to remove it for consistency.
