I found an issue with our current '-c' and '-C' options:

The 'automatic/auto\_recover' and 'unattended' modes  
currently call only

    rear $rear_debug_options recover

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L155](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L155)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L192](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L192)

So '-c' and '-C' are ignored / not possible  
with our current 'automatic/auto\_recover' and 'unattended' modes  
which is a bug that needs to be fixed.

My current offhanded idea how to fix that generically  
is to store the whole 'rear \[options\] workflow' command line  
of each last called workflow in the ReaR recovery system.

Because only "rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackup" create  
a ReaR recovery system only those workflows can store  
their command line in the ReaR recovery system.

So some "rear special\_option mkbackuponly" cannot  
store its command line in the ReaR recovery system.

FYI, we copy the directory specified by `-c` (and stored as
`CONFIG_DIR`) into the rescue system as `/etc/rear` so that there would
be no point to remember and use `-c` for `rear recover`:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ea900c4ec9589c7acb3d90c01f75ad7781fbdd8c/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh\#L165](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ea900c4ec9589c7acb3d90c01f75ad7781fbdd8c/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh#L165)

It seems like primarily `-C` remains a problem and I totally agree with
the goal that automated recovery should also work for `-C` users. My
suggestion would be to use `CONFIG_APPEND_FILES_PATHS` in order to set
`CONFIG_APPEND_FILES` in `rescue.conf` to again load the same files that
**had been loaded successfully** and do that during the `rescue` stage.
That way this will only happen for ReaR runs that actually generate a
rescue image and not for others.

I can code that up quickly if we agree on the concept.

@schlomo  
please be patient.  
There is zero time pressure here.  
Basically nobody uses '-c' or '-C' plus  
'automatic/auto\_recover' or 'unattended'  
because the current state is since it was introduced  
and I cannot remember any user report about it.  
Since a very long time I didn't use any of '-c' or '-C'  
or 'automatic/auto\_recover' or 'unattended'.

I need time to understand how '-c' and '-C' behave  
when used with different values for different workflows, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2936\#issuecomment-1434304552](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2936#issuecomment-1434304552)  
which is in particular how '-C' is primarily meant to be used, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

Then I can make educated statements in this area  
and agree or disagree on your proposal.

It is not about quick coding.  
We have already way too much quickly implemented code in ReaR  
for limited purpose that poorly integrates with the rest of ReaR  
(e.g. the whole OUTPUT=USB functionality is an endless annoyance).

The primary use case for '-C' as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
is to specify things in

    /etc/rear/local.conf
    /etc/rear/basic_system.conf
    /etc/rear/home_backup.conf
    /etc/rear/opt_backup.conf

then run on the original system

    # rear mkrescue
    # rear -C basic_system mkbackuponly
    # rear -C home_backup mkbackuponly
    # rear -C opt_backup mkbackuponly

and to recreate that on replacement hardware  
run there in the ReaR recovery system

    # rear -C basic_system recover
    # rear -C home_backup restoreonly
    # rear -C opt_backup restoreonly

Currently I have no idea how to automatically  
run those commands in the ReaR recovery system  
i.e. how to automatically find out  
while on the original system plain

    # rear mkrescue

is run (which is the only comand that creates  
or that can modify the ReaR recovery system)  
that later for disaster recovery  
in the ReaR recovery system something like

    # rear -C basic_system recover && rear -C home_backup restoreonly && rear -C opt_backup restoreonly

should be run.

@schlomo  
I think why your proposal  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2942\#issuecomment-1439021298](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2942#issuecomment-1439021298)  
cannot work in general is that according to your

    again load the same files that had been loaded successfully

it seems you implicitly assume there is always  
a single recovery command (usually 'rear recover')  
to recreate a system so it would be sufficient to  
source (actually there is no such thing as 'load' a config file)  
a single sequence of config files during recovery.

I have an idea how to make a sequence of recovery commands  
possible with 'automatic/auto\_recover' and 'unattended' modes  
but that won't happen automatically but must be setup manually  
by the user.

My reasoning is:  
The (experienced) user who set up the "mkbackup" procedure  
knows what sequence of recovery commands (with right options)  
are needed to recreate things properly so he can manually  
specify the right sequence of recovery commands.  
Then even an unexperienced user can do the recovery.

Mainly for my own information:

How to wait for several simultaneously running background jobs  
and show some info what happened to them:

    # ( sleep 1 ; echo 1 started ; sleep 9 ; echo 1 succeeded ) & \
      ( sleep 2 ; echo 2 started ; sleep 6 ; echo 2 failed ; exit 2 ) & \
      ( sleep 3 ; echo 3 started ; sleep 3 ; echo 3 failed ; exit 3 ) & \
      while jobs % &>/dev/null ; \
      do echo waiting for a job to finish ; \
         wait -n && echo a job succeeded || echo a job failed with $? ; \
      done ; \
      echo all finished

    [1] 27123
    [2] 27124
    [3] 27125
    waiting for a job to finish
    1 started
    2 started
    3 started
    3 failed
    [3]+  Exit 3                  ( sleep 3; echo 3 started; sleep 3; echo 3 failed; exit 3 )
    a job failed with 3
    waiting for a job to finish
    2 failed
    [2]+  Exit 2                  ( sleep 2; echo 2 started; sleep 6; echo 2 failed; exit 2 )
    a job failed with 2
    waiting for a job to finish
    1 succeeded
    [1]+  Done                    ( sleep 1; echo 1 started; sleep 9; echo 1 succeeded )
    a job succeeded
    all finished

So the above shown recovery command

    # rear -C basic_system recover && \
      rear -C home_backup restoreonly && \
      rear -C opt_backup restoreonly

could be run with the two 'restoreonly' workflows in parallel like

    # if rear -C basic_system recover ; \
      then rear -C home_backup restoreonly & \
           rear -C opt_backup restoreonly & \
           wait ; \
      fi

where the plain wait for the background jobs  
could be generically enhanced to show some info  
what happened to the background jobs like

    # if rear -C basic_system recover ; \
      then rear -C home_backup restoreonly & \
           rear -C opt_backup restoreonly & \
           while jobs % &>/dev/null ; \
           do echo Waiting for a restoreonly workflow to finish ; \
              wait -n || echo ERROR: A restoreonly workflow failed with $? ; \
           done ; \
      fi
