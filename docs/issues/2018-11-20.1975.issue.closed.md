-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): **2.4 master**

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): **RHEL7**

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /non-standard-dir/lib64/* )
    #PROGS+=( /lib/udev/rename_device )

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When adding programs into the Rescue ISO using `COPY_AS_IS` (typically
done when using NetBackup in real life) and the directories specified
contain files with same names as standard libraries (but likely at
different version), the corresponding standard libraries are not
included, causing some binaries that are added anyway to not be
usable.  
The related code is
`/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh`.  
However, if a program is specified using PROG, then the required system
libraries will be included anyway, because there is additional code
running in
`/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh`.

Reproducer
----------

Create a non standard path and copy "libglib" into it:

    # mkdir -p /non-standard-dir/lib64
    # cp /lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0 /non-standard-dir/lib64/

    # rear -dD mkrescue
    ...
    There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries
    /usr/lib/udev/rename_device requires additional libraries
        libglib-2.0.so.0 => not found
    /usr/lib/udev/udev-kvm-check requires additional libraries
        libglib-2.0.so.0 => not found
    ...

    # find /tmp/rear.* -name "libglib*"
    /tmp/rear.gg4yN2RSDWWhD1M/rootfs/non-standard-dir/lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0

We can see from there that `libglib-2.0.so.0` was not included, even
though it's a must for `/usr/lib/udev/rename_device`.

I'm currently investigating this.

@rmetrich  
again many thanks for your continuous and careful testing  
that reveals such hidden bugs that only happen in special cases!

@rmetrich  
I wonder about your reproducer:  
I think one cannot "just change" the actual libraries files  
without also adapting the dynamic linker configuration  
i.e. adapt dynamic linker config files like /etc/ld.so.conf  
and finally run `ldconfig` - or do I misunderstand it?

That's just an example. In real life, this happens when doing relaxed
COPY\_AS\_IS such as the one done for ... NetBackup ... :
`/usr/openv/lib` which contains unrelated libraries and probably
unneeded ones.

@rmetrich  
your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1976](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1976)
explains it all.  
It is a generic bug in ReaR.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1976](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1976)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

@rmetrich  
many thanks for your analysis what the root cause was and your fix!

I found a simple reproducer that emphasizes  
this generic bug (before the fix here) even more.

I only added to my etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/sbin/postfix /doesnotexist/usr/lib/postfix/libpostfix-global.so )
</pre>

and "rear -D mkrescue" failed with

<pre>
Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.8eGP5wvyks7HAf1/rootfs contains a usable system
There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries
/bin/postfix requires additional libraries (fatal error)
        libpostfix-global.so => not found
ReaR recovery system in '/tmp/rear.8eGP5wvyks7HAf1/rootfs' needs additional libraries, check /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-g243.log for details
ERROR: ReaR recovery system in '/tmp/rear.8eGP5wvyks7HAf1/rootfs' not usable (required libraries are missing)
</pre>

For me `ldd /usr/sbin/postfix` shows in particular

<pre>
libpostfix-global.so => /usr/lib/postfix/libpostfix-global.so
</pre>

but copying `/usr/lib/postfix/libpostfix-global.so` is skipped  
in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh because  
the copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file contains

<pre>
tar: /doesnotexist/usr/lib/postfix/libpostfix-global.so: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
</pre>

cf. the comment in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh about  
"make it work fail-safe even in case of non-existent files in the
COPY\_AS\_IS array"

I.e. even files that failed to copy may have matched before this fix
here.

Good point!
