is there a way to split the backup for USB where i would like the ReaR
bootable image to store on a flash stick and the archive image on
another external USB drive. The reason is that 8GB USB flash drive
cannot hold both boot image and archive image on the same stick.

thanks

Boon

i noticed that UEFI booting from an USB is not supported. Is there a
workaround to make it UEFI booting?

-   OUTPUT=USB (do not forget to format the usb device) - not sure you
    can split it; however, I never tried it so perhaps it does work if
    you define another BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/<device>
-   UEFI and usb: see issue \#603 - started with the preps, but it is
    not finished (vacation and lack of time)

hello.. what is the difference between...  
USB\_DEVICE="/dev/sdb1" and BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1?

tried with 2 entries of BACKUP\_URL

BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/sdc1  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/sdd1

it would just use /dev/sdd1 as default and not use sdc1

when you define OUTPUT=USB then you need to define USB\_DEVICE also.
This will set OUTPUT\_URL and BACKUP\_URL to the same location of the
USB\_DEVICE setting. As I said before this piece of code was written by
@dagwieers and @jhoekx so I think they could answer this much better
then myself.

@pomusa what you need to do is:

-   rear format /dev/sdc
-   use /dev/sdd as a mounted linux file system (ext3 for example) -
    e.g. /mnt/usbdisk
-   define in `/etc/rear/local.conf`:

<!-- -->

      OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
      BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/usbdisk

-   rear -v mkbackup  
    this should produce a bootable USB disk on device /dev/sdc and the
    tar archive on /dev/sdd.
-   in recover mode you need first mount /dev/sdd on /mnt/usbdisk before
    starting `rear -v recover`

Closing because it is "fixed".
