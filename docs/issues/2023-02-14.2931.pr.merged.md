Thanks! There is still some problem with building openSUSE tumbleweed
RPMs, but that's separate. The problem is not specific to ReaR, as it is
related to GPG verification of packages:

    openSUSE Tumbleweed - x86_64 - OSS              965 kB/s | 988  B     00:00    
    GPG key at file:///usr/share/distribution-gpg-keys/opensuse/RPM-GPG-KEY-openSUSE (0x3DBDC284) is already installed
    The GPG keys listed for the "openSUSE Tumbleweed - x86_64 - OSS" repository are already installed but they are not correct for this package.
    Check that the correct key URLs are configured for this repository..

Only a blind guess  
(I constantly fail to understand how GPG works):

Perhaps this could be the reason behind:
