Do not yet merge it.  
I need to test it first...

I cannot do a re-numbering with reasonable effort  
because currently ReaR works too fragile because  
it runs the various backup-method specific scripts  
somehow intermixed with the generic scripts.

Therefore re-numbering of generic scripts results  
a different sequence how the generic scripts are run  
intermixed with the backup-method specific scripts.

For example when I use "BACKUP=NETFS"  
a "rear -s mkbackup" before and after my current  
re-numbering results (diff output):

<pre>
-Source prep/default/00_remove_workflow_conf.sh
-Source prep/default/02_translate_url.sh
-Source prep/default/03_translate_tape.sh
-Source prep/default/04_check_output_scheme.sh
+Source prep/default/02_remove_workflow_conf.sh
+Source prep/default/03_translate_url.sh
+Source prep/default/04_translate_tape.sh
 Source prep/NETFS/default/05_check_NETFS_requirements.sh
-Source prep/default/05_check_keep_old_output_copy_var.sh
+Source prep/default/05_check_output_scheme.sh
+Source prep/default/06_check_keep_old_output_copy_var.sh
...
+Source backup/default/98_post_backup_script.sh
 Source backup/NETFS/default/98_umount_NETFS_dir.sh
-Source backup/default/99_post_backup_script.sh
</pre>

I.e. before it was:

<pre>
Source prep/default/03_translate_tape.sh
Source prep/default/04_check_output_scheme.sh
Source prep/NETFS/default/05_check_NETFS_requirements.sh
Source prep/default/05_check_keep_old_output_copy_var.sh
Source prep/NETFS/default/06_mount_NETFS_path.sh
...
Source backup/NETFS/default/97_remove_lock.sh
Source backup/NETFS/default/98_umount_NETFS_dir.sh
Source backup/default/99_post_backup_script.sh
</pre>

and after re-numbering it gets:

<pre>
Source prep/default/04_translate_tape.sh
Source prep/NETFS/default/05_check_NETFS_requirements.sh
Source prep/default/05_check_output_scheme.sh
Source prep/default/06_check_keep_old_output_copy_var.sh
Source prep/NETFS/default/06_mount_NETFS_path.sh
...
Source backup/NETFS/default/97_remove_lock.sh
Source backup/default/98_post_backup_script.sh
Source backup/NETFS/default/98_umount_NETFS_dir.sh
</pre>

I would have to verify and adapt for each backup method  
also the backup-method specific scripts to keep the same  
sequence how the generic scripts are run intermixed  
with the backup-method specific scripts.

Perhaps at a later time when the issue becomes more pressing  
we should do a general re-numbering probably with 3-digit  
numbers 010\_ ... 990\_ to clean it up completely.

But for now I keep it as is to avoid regressions.

Actually renumbering everything from 501 to 599 sounds like a nice idea.
Should be possible to do without breaking anything and gives lots of
space before and after. Or somehow map 01..99 to 100..900 evenly.

I am thinking about a dumb adding of a trailing '0'  
to all current numbers, i.e. this mapping  
00 -&gt; 000  
01 -&gt; 010  
02 -&gt; 020  
...  
99 -&gt; 990  
which is mathematically a dilatation by the constant  
factor 10 that preserves topology/neighbourhood.

With the first step the old numbers 01 and 99  
become 010 and 990 and those are already  
no longer at the edges of the range 000..999.

The only old number that is still at the edge  
is 00 which becomes 000 and that one needs  
an actual re-numbering (i.e. movement) a bit away  
from the edge but not more than where the old 01  
is now (i.e. 010) so that a second step the actual  
re-numbering could be this mapping:  
000 -&gt; 005

At the end the topology/neighbourhood did not change.

I think even the symlinks can be easier adapted this way  
because their target usually only canges from NM\_\* to NM0\_\*  
and only if the target is 00\_\* it needs to be changed to 005\_\*  
(i.e. I can adapt the symlinks in a dumb mechanical way)

This way it looks sufficiently easy and fail-safe.  
I think I will do it right now, but via a new pull request.

Furthermore because in very most cases only a trailing '0'  
is added it is easier to also adapt all texts where the old  
script names are used in a dumb mechanical way:  
"NM\_foo\_bar.sh" -&gt; "NM0\_foo\_bar.sh"  
"00\_blah.sh" -&gt; "005\_blah.sh"
