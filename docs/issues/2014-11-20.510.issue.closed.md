What's the trick for excluding files from being picked up by the NETFS
tar backup process? I've tried multiple variations using the
EXCLUDE\_BACKUP and COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE variables within my
local.conf. For example, what would I add to my local.conf if I wanted
to exclude the /apps/data01 directory from the tar backup?

Thanks

You could use the following, e.g.:

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/var/lib/kvm/images/*'  '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' )
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]} '/var/lib/kvm/images/*'  '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' )

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( ${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]} /exports  )
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( ${AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH[@]} /mnt*  /var/lib/kvm/images  )

@bbeaver was the above an answer on your question? If yes, could we
