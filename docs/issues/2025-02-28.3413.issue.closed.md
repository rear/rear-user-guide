### ReaR version

v2.6 (and higher)

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

The recovery image on RHEL 9 fails to start-up the sshd daemon for 2
reasons;

-   /usr/share/empty.sshd is missing
-   the /etc/ssh/ssh\_host\_ed25519\_key is missing

We must enhance script `/etc/scripts/run-sshd`

### Platform

Linux x64

### OS version

RHEL 9.5

### Backup

NETFS

### Storage layout

n/a

It worked as expected. We could login via a Putty session over the
network on an EL9 system now.

There were two issues, none of them is as general as "On EL9 sshd will
not start anymore". The first one is that the rescue image lacks an
ed25519 host key for ssh if one does not want ssh keys embedded in the
image. This leads to ssh connections failing in an environment when the
use of other keys has been disabled (which is not typical).  
The second and more serious issue is that after an upgrade to EL 9 (or
an upgrade of Fedora), the sshd user has the old `$HOME` left (the
upgrade does not update the value), but the empty directory used for
sshd privilege separation is different (and hardcoded in the sshd
binary). Since the only source of information about the directory is the
sshd user account and ReaR uses that to embed the directory in the
image, the directory will be missing and sshd won't start. This does not
happen in a fresh install. This was introduced by this Fedora change:
[https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/openssh/pull-request/14](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/openssh/pull-request/14).  
I adjusted the bug title accordingly.  
By the way, I suspect that Debian has the same problem. I don't see
anything in the scripts of the .deb openssh package to adjust the sshd
user on upgrade:
