My setup has 10 partitions  
ReaR produces a false order in initrd.cgz: part 10 (which is a logical
one of course) is placed as second in the list:  
todo /dev/sda1 part  
todo /dev/sda10 part  
todo /dev/sda2 part  
todo /dev/sda3 part  
todo /dev/sda4 part  
todo /dev/sda5 part  
todo /dev/sda6 part  
todo /dev/sda7 part  
todo /dev/sda8 part  
todo /dev/sda9 part

While recovering an parted error occurs, because a logical must not
follow a primary partition directly.

Consequences:

-   parted wipes the partittion first (which should not be nessessary as
    geometry didn't change)
-   parted stops with above error
-   luckily one can edit this from the ReaR recovery menu, but it should
    not happen

BTW: is it possible to correct this in initrd.cgz of the ISO or does
this break the ISO?

My ReaR version is

Relax-and-Recover 1.13.0-git201207200104 / 2012-07-20

Previous 1.13 version had the same problem.

if you could add a debug output to gist.github.com then that would be
very useful for us.

What exactly do you need?  
This is the relevant part of disklayout.conf in detail:

I think we will be able to reproduce this. Never tested with that many
partitions.
