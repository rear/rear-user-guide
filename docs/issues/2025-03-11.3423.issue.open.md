### ReaR version

Relax-and-Recover 2.9 / 2025-01-31

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

It seems like we should get rid of the separate boot entries for secure
boot and regular.

I'm wondering if this is related to us fixing the automated secure boot
detection, and if the separate boot entries are still required.

Booting from the "non Secure Boot" entry works totally fine and
`mokutil --sb-state` also shows secure boot to be enabled. Which is why
I'm wondering if we should remove the dual boot entries.

### Platform

Linux x64

### OS version

Ubuntu 24.04

### Backup

NETFS

### Storage layout

*No response*

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

my `site.conf` is super simple:

    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://pvm/rear-backup
    BACKUP_URL=$OUTPUT_URL
    BACKUP=NETFS

### Workaround, if any

Use the seemingly wrong non-secure-boot boot entry

### Additional information

*No response*

BTW, when I switch to BIOS boot then this ISO doesn't even boot because
of a ISOLINUX error:

But maybe this is the case of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2471\#issuecomment-671320189](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2471#issuecomment-671320189)
and not really a problem as we don't support BIOS booting a recovery
image created on an UEFI machine.

[https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38178](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/38178)
sugests that `initrdefi` was a temporary solution that has been
deprecated, and that GRUB2 in Ubuntu 24.04 doesn't support that any
more.

Given that both GRUB2 boot entries seem to be **identical** and use the
exactly same `$grub2_kernel` except for the `efi` suffix, maybe we can
find out if we still need to support that `efi` suffix for our currently
supported distros?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001)
seems to be related to the introduction of the `linuxefi` commands, but
on this Ubuntu 24.04 I got here there is no `linuxefi.mod` at all.

@schlomo  
only a side note FYI:

Since a long time it is known that those two entries  
behave somewhat unpredictable / misleading / problematic  
in this or that cases so the usual way in practice is to  
"just try out which one works in your particular environment".

In general:  
I am not at all a sufficient UEFI expert so normally  
I can neither actually help with debugging UEFI related issues  
nor can I fix UEFI related issues (except exceptions).  
What I could do via basically blind trial and error  
would be to make things somehow work for my specific system  
but this would be certainly not a proper solution for ReaR.  
Fortunately things work so far for me with SLE15, cf.
