For me it was not very intuitive what does OUTPUT and BACKUP variables
mean. I was confused a bit by these names when I was reading
documentation for the first time. At start I didn't know why there are
two destinations for backup and after reading documentation it sometimes
confuses me which one is which.

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git

possible solutions:  
Rename variable(s) (especially OUTPUT) to something more clear or
explain it in the documentation somewhere near the start.

@scr4bble OUTPUT is for the rescue image location. BACKUP for
backup/archive. Which piece of the documentation was not clear to you?

@scr4bble  
regarding "Rename variable(s)":

No, we cannot do that  
without causing backward incompatible regressions  
or without endlessly maintainig complicated mappings  
between the old variable names and the new one  
which also adds nothing else but confusion when  
two different names have same meaning.

At least I will not actively maintain such overcomplications.

From my point of view the right solution is to  
provide good documentation that makes it  
obvious how things are meant.

Addendum:  
The only reason why I would rename a variable is  
when its old name is plain wrong which means  
that its old name is totally misleading.

I think the main problem was that I didn't understand that data are
treated separately from the image while making backup of the system. It
sounds practical, but for me it was not clear at the start.  
Maybe it could be explained in the description after this sentence:
"Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup." ... something
like "backup can be outside image", so user would know that by "backup"
is not meant the image.  
OUTPUT evokes in me output of backup tool - the backup itself... maybe
if user understood this difference from description he wouldn't get so
confused by names.

I wasn't the only one who gets confused so I wrote it here. Maybe others
can share their point of view too. Or if this was not obvious only for
me you can close this issue :)

I agree that it seems often (or only sometimes?)  
users mix up the backup and restore of the files  
with what Relax-and-Recover does because  
I noticed questions on the "Relax-and-Recover users list"  
that indicate it is not clear how Relax-and-Recover  
versus backup and restore of the files are related.

For example see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-June/003354.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-June/003354.html)  
and  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-June/003366.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-June/003366.html)

Accordingly I think it should be more clearly  
documented how Relax-and-Recover versus  
backup and restore of the files are related.

Hi, sorry for duplicate issue \#933. I didn't know about this one.

I would like to remark that we had rear testday and most of participants
told that names OUTPUT is confusing and we mixed terms OUTPUT and
BACKUP.

Closing because "won't fix".
