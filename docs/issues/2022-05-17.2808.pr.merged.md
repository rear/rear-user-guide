-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In default.conf add dev/watchdog\* to COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
because /dev/watchdog /dev/watchdog\* functionality  
is not wanted in the ReaR rescue/recovery system  
because we do not want any automated reboot  
while disaster recovery happens via "rear recover".  
Furthermore having dev/watchdog\* during "rear mkrescue"  
may even trigger a system "crash" that is caused by  
TrendMicro ds\_am module touching dev/watchdog  
in ReaR's build area (/var/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs).

@jsmeix Be careful, by adding this device to COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE it is
also excluded from the tar archive (with BACKUP=NETFS). We need to
recreate this device after recovery. Perhaps, with an extra small
script?

FYI - TrendMicro is working on a hotfix to prevent crashes with their

@gdha  
I don't find code that things in COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
are also excluded from the tar archive (with BACKUP=NETFS):

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE' | egrep -v 'COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_|COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE\+=| *#'

    usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh:Log "Files being excluded: ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]}"
    usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh:for excluded_file in "${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]}" ; do
    usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh:    Error "Failed to copy files and directories in COPY_AS_IS minus COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE"
    usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh:Log "Finished copying files and directories in COPY_AS_IS minus COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE"

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( $VAR_DIR/output/\* dev/.udev dev/shm dev/shm/\* dev/oracleasm dev/mapper )

As far as I see build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
is the only place where COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE is evaluated  
therein in this code (excerpts):

    local copy_as_is_exclude_file="$TMP_DIR/copy-as-is-exclude"
    ...
    for excluded_file in "${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]}" ; do
        echo "$excluded_file"
    done >$copy_as_is_exclude_file
    ...
    if ! tar -v -X $copy_as_is_exclude_file -P -C / -c ${COPY_AS_IS[*]} 2>$copy_as_is_filelist_file | tar $v -C $ROOTFS_DIR/ -x 1>/dev/null ; then
        Error "Failed to copy files and directories in COPY_AS_IS minus COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE"
    fi

where `copy_as_is_exclude_file` only appears in  
build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
and the file name `copy-as-is-exclude` also only appears in  
build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh

So I see no relation between COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
and what is in the backup.

I think if there was a relation between COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
and what is in the backup it could be a severe bug  
(unexpectedly suppressed files from the backup)  
because COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE should only belong to  
what gets excluded from the ReaR recovery system.

Sorry, I still don't understand how the issue arises and how does this
PR fix it. What is the process triggering the crash? From the
description of the issue it looks like there is a process opening the
device file and not closing it, but how is ReaR doing it? In
`usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh` seems to copy files
using `tar -c ... | tar -x`, and `tar` does not open device files (I
checked). If there is a process opening device special files, it can
lead to other problems (IIRC tapes can get rewound if you open and close
the corresponding device, for example.)

(The issue and comment mentions TrendMicro ds\_am module, sorry for my
ignorance, I don't know what it is and why is it related.)

The `tar` command archives the complete /dev to the rescue image, which
is sufficient to trigger TrendMicro ds\_am module to trigger the crash.
TrendMicro acknowledged that this is a bug and they are working on a
fix.

I made this PR only based on what I read on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798)

In particular I do not understand what "crash" means therein.  
As far as I understand what I read about /dev/watchdog  
an automated reboot happens when there is no write  
to /dev/watchdog for a certain time.  
So I guess there was no actual "crash" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798)  
but just the automated reboot happened all of a sudden  
which looks to the user as if the system had crashed.

Regarding "TrendMicro ds\_am module touch dev/watchdog  
under the /tmp/rear.XXXX directory":  
On my homeoffice laptop after a "rear mkrescue" (yesterday)  
without the change in this PR I have

    # ls -l /var/tmp/rear.IuB8N948ZgRegGv/rootfs/dev/watchdog*
    crw------- 1 root root  10, 130 May 17 08:45 /var/tmp/rear.IuB8N948ZgRegGv/rootfs/dev/watchdog
    crw------- 1 root root 248,   0 May 17 08:45 /var/tmp/rear.IuB8N948ZgRegGv/rootfs/dev/watchdog0

which are the same device major and minor numbers  
as on my original system

    # ls -l /dev/watchdog*
    crw------- 1 root root  10, 130 May 18 09:55 /dev/watchdog
    crw------- 1 root root 248,   0 May 18 09:55 /dev/watchdog0

so /dev/watchdog\* in /var/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs  
are device nodes that behave same as the original ones.  
Accordingly when some strange software writes to  
a /dev/watchdog\* in /var/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs  
and leaves it as is (i.e. no further writes)  
the automated watchdog reboot happens.  
At least that is how I imagine what actually happens.  
But I am not at all a watchdog expert - I learned about  
its existence via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798)

A side note only for the "fun" of it:  
It seems the TrendMicro cyber security software  
sometimes messes around too much with kernel stuff  
so the only way out for the kernel is to give up like  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3100321](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3100321)  
and it seems things don't always improve when several  
security software things are running concurrently like

I think the crucial question here is:  
Are /dev/watchdog\* of any use inside the recovery system or not.

The watchdog devices are not required during recovery. However, we have
to make sure that these devices are recovered (by the backup) or
recreated somehow.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-05-19 13:59](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2808#issuecomment-1131728955):

I think nowadays /dev/ is only a mountpoint  
(i.e. /dev/ itself is initially an empty directory)  
and it is the special filesystem that is mounted at /dev/  
which lets "somehow magically" device nodes appear therein  
(e.g. via devtmpfs mounted at /dev/ together with udev).

So there should be no need to specially care about  
the device nodes in the rebooted recreated system  
(neither in the backup nor to recreate them by ReaR).

All what is needed is that the recreated system will mount  
"the right thing" at /dev/ same as on the original system.  
I think there is nothing what ReaR has to actively do  
ruring "rear recover" to make that happen.  
Only restoring all basic system files from the backup  
(in particular kernel, udev, init/systemd, and so on)  
should be sufficient so that after reboot the recreated  
system will again mount "the right thing" at /dev/.

But I am not an expert regarding populating /dev/  
so I may misunderstand things.

@jsmeix I don't know if the device will automatically be recreated or
not. Not without testing it out. However, these were production systems
which cannot be scraped to test it out. On the other hand, a missing
device can easlily be recreated by hand.

For me another question is, do we want to make changes that do not fix
any issue in ReaR (nor in the OS or backup tool that ReaR is intended to
integrate with), but in a 3rd party tool that has nothing to do with
ReaR? I can see the value for users, but on the other hand such
workarounds clutter and complicate the code. (Fortunately this change is
simple and also well documented, so I am inclined to say yes, but I am
not entirely sure it is a good idea in general.)

Perhaps we better make some proper documentation around it as it is
indeed not a flaw in ReaR. ReaR only suffers by it.

@pcahyna  
yes, we do want to make changes in ReaR  
that do not fix any issue in ReaR itself  
but that avoid bugs in whatever non-ReaR stuff,  
see the section "Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-05-20 07:12](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2808#issuecomment-1132556033):

Now the question is whether or not  
the change in this pull request is a dirty hack.

My current point of view is:

In general /dev/watchdog\* inside the recovery system  
does not make sense so it should be excluded in general.

The issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2798)  
was only the reason to think about whether or not  
/dev/watchdog\* should be in the recovery system.

So the change in this pull request is not a dirty hack  
and I made my comments in the code accordingly  
(i.e. first the generic reason then the special case  
that it avoids a crash under special circumstances).

I would not have done this pull request if I thought that  
in general /dev/watchdog\* should be in the recovery system  
because then I would not exclude it from the recovery system  
in default.conf but leave it to the specific users  
of the buggy TrendMicro cyber security software  
to deal with it specifically on their own via

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( dev/watchdog\* )

in their etc/rear/local.conf

if you regard the change in this pull request as a dirty hack

What I could currently imagine why /dev/watchdog\*  
could be even useful in the recovery system  
is a use case of some kind of unattended "rear recover"  
where a user has also some additional special things  
set up in his recovery system to let it automatically reboot  
when his recovery system "hangs up" or becomes unresponsive.  
Because ReaR does not provide any watchdog functionality  
such a use case would again be some "third-party issue"  
(here some additional third party watchdog functionality).  
I think even then excluding /dev/watchdog\* in default.conf  
should be still OK because we cannot make default.conf  
to be right for every possible additional special things.

I overestimated this pull request to be a "blocker"  
(i.e. that we won't release ReaR 2.7 without a solution for it).

Actually it cannot be a blocker when an issue is caused  
by some special (and not often used) third-party software,  
in particular not when a solution exists how affected users can  
avoid that the bug in their third-party software affects ReaR.

In general it is not ReaR's job to avoid (or work around)  
that a bug in third-party software may cause "bad things".

I tested it myself:  
The only difference in /var/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/dev is  
that dev/watchdog and dev/watchdog0 are no longer there.
