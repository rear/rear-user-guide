### Requesting support or just a question

Just trying to get rear 2,6 to work on Ubuntu 22.04 before I upgrade it.
Ran this cmd to format the disk. rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdb ad it
mounts ok when I plug it in. So then I umount it before I run the rear
cmd. I've tried a few different local.conf files with the same result.

### Platform

The usr/share/rear/rescue/default/020\_create\_skeleton\_dirs.sh  
script was added by  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c61b7a01481d4dda29c3354a253262441ea65bd1>  
via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3380>  
because of  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3375>

But according to

    # git log | egrep -i ' release|c61b7a01481d4dda29c3354a253262441ea65bd1'
    ...
        ReaR 2.9 release
    ...
    commit c61b7a01481d4dda29c3354a253262441ea65bd1
        ReaR 2.8 release

<https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c61b7a01481d4dda29c3354a253262441ea65bd1>  
happened directly after the "ReaR 2.8 release"  
so ReaR 2.6 cannot have that  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/020\_create\_skeleton\_dirs.sh  
script, cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/rescue/default>  
there is no '020\_create\_skeleton\_dirs.sh' in ReaR 2.6.

FYI how things changed:  
Up to ReaR 2.7  
/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run was a directory  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run>  
but in ReaR 2.8 there was a  
"change /var/run to be a symlink to /run"  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.8/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run>  
to fix certain (even severe) issues, see  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b838a352136811900511a209d06c809ce552e636>  
but this caused  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3375>  
because of a known limitation in RPM  
(all was perfectly well in ReaR - that root cause is in RPM!)  
so to avoid that RPM issue in ReaR 2.9  
/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run was removed by  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3380/files>  
so in ReaR 2.9 there is no longer a sub-directory 'run' in  
/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var>

@hcowley  
accordingly it seems this issue here is not a bug in ReaR  
but what is broken is your ReaR installation because  
it seems what you actually have is a mix-up of  
older ReaR 2.6 and newer ReaR 2.9 things.

So I suggest to first and foremost get a clean ReaR installation.

For example see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Testing_current_ReaR_upstream_GitHub_master_code>  
how you can try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
without conflicts with your already installed ReaR version.

In general we at ReaR upstream do not support older ReaR versions.  
We at ReaR upstream do not plain reject issues with older ReaR
versions  
(e.g. we may answer easy to solve questions also for older ReaR
versions)  
but we do not spend much time on issues with older ReaR versions
because  
we do not (and cannot) fix issues in released ReaR versions.  
Issues in released ReaR versions are not fixed by us (by ReaR
upstream).  
Issues in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR
upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with  
reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got ReaR.

In particular regarding Ubuntu / Debian  
and Linux distributions which are based on them:

I am neither a Ubuntu user nor a Debian user nor a Linux Mint user.  
Currently we at ReaR upstream do not have an active  
maintainer for Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint.  
So ReaR support for Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint  
can be only as good as voluntary contributors  
who use those Linux distributions contribute  
which is much appreciated!

In particular regarding Ubuntu:  
It seems Canonical is not sufficiently interested in ReaR  
in contrast to Red Hat and SUSE who pay developers  
(like me from SUSE and e.g. @pcahyna and @lzaoral from Red Hat)  
to contribute to upstream ReaR because Red Hat and SUSE  
support ReaR in their enterprise Linux distributions.

Hi,

Thanks you so much.  
Been struggling for awhile with this.  
It's my fault I originally did a git clone of the latest but then I
tried to do a make and it said there was nothing to make and after a few
weeks of trying various options I gave up and installed rear via apt-get
install and did know it was the much older 2.6 version.

I thought I had removed the latest version but obviously not
correctly.  
I did the git clone again and moved the folder and all the options like
excludes are working now after I really struggled with those as well.  
I will have to find out how I remove everything now and go back to just
one git clone install usig the latest version as that's what I really
set out to do..  
The backup is working ow but failing near the end with out of space on
the  
/tmp/rear-efi.XXXXX//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz  
I see lots of comments on that so I 'll try and work my way through
those first.  
I really am very happy with your brilliant explanation. Keep up the good
work.

Thanks again for all your help I really appreciate the detailed outline
of the issue.  
I spent ages trawling through that debug log before I contacted you and
I see the issue in the log now and really wonder how I missed it
before.  
You cannot beat an experts view !!  
Thanks a lot.  
Thanks and regards,  
Hugh

@hcowley

when you call

    # sudo /usr/sbin/rear -v -D mkrescue

the ReaR which is installed via apt-get  
into system directories like '/usr/' (with leading '/')  
will be run.

Normally when you do a "git clone"  
the files are in some separated directory  
and to run ReaR from such a "git clone" you need to  
launch usr/sbin/rear (no leading '/') from within  
that separated directory whereto ReaR was "git cloned", cf.

    Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/"

in
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Testing_current_ReaR_upstream_GitHub_master_code>

Regarding

    out of space on the /tmp/rear-efi.XXXXX//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz

In ReaR 2.9 see  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh

    local efi_label="REAR-EFI"
    local efi_part="/dev/disk/by-label/$efi_label"
    ...
    efi_mpt=$( mktemp -d $TMPDIR/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX ) ...
    ...
    mount $efi_part $efi_mpt ...

so /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-EFI gets mounted  
at the mountpoint directory /tmp/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX

/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-EFI is for OUTPUT=USB  
the EFI system partition (ESP) on your USB disk  
so it is this ESP which is too small.

See the description of USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

In ReaR 2.9 there is by default

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="1024"

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1260>  
while in ReaR 2.6 it was

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="400"

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L841>

See the description of USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf in ReaR 2.9  
why the ESP on a USB disk is now 1 GiB.

Depending on how big your initrd.cgz becomes  
you may need more than 1 GiB for the ESP on your USB disk  
i.e. you may need to format your USB disk again  
with an appropriate setting of USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE  
in your etc/rear/local.conf  
when its ESP is too small.  
All data on your USB disk will be lost  
when you format your USB disk again.
