-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    If I install the rear package it also includes a cronjob in
    /etc/cron.d/rear. I don't think this should be part of the package
    because without any additional configuration this daily cronjob will
    fail daily. I was searching through the repo where this cronjob is
    included but I could not find it. I would have submitted a pull
    request otherwise. Apologies for not finding it.
-   Workaround, if any:  
    Remove /etc/cron.d/rear manually or as part of the installtion
    process with ansible
-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Hello, @GitarPlayer! The package sources for CentOS Stream 8 / RHEL 8
are available here:
[https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/rear/-/tree/c8s/](https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/rear/-/tree/c8s/)

I suggest to report this problem on the official issue tracker instead:
[https://issues.redhat.com](https://issues.redhat.com)

I also think that having this cron job was a bad idea, but I don't think
it is a good idea to remove it at a so late stage in the RHEL 8
lifecycle. RHEL 9 does not have the cron job anymore (it is installed
into a documentation directory as an example and you have to copy to
/etc/cron.d and modify it). See the deprecation notice in the RHEL 8
release notes.
