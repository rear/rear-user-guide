Perfect!

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779)  
I enhanced the "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case  
so that now it also detects other non-EFI bootloaders  
(in particular also GRUB2).

The basic logic of the code for the "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case is still
wrong  
because currently it goes as the following pseudo code:

<pre>
if "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case
then try to find a non-EFI bootloader
        return if a non-EFI bootloader was found
endif
try to find any bootloader
return if any bootloader was found
error exit no bootloader found
</pre>

The problem is when in the "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case  
no non-EFI bootloader was found it proceeds with  
finding any bootloader where the "EFI" sub-string  
in "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" matches so that we are back  
at the initial problem of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752)

The solution is not (cf. below) to have no separated "Hah!IdontNeedEFI"
special case  
but to exclude known misleading strings when trying to find any
bootloader  
like

<pre>
# Check for known bootloaders
# but exclude known misleading strings like "Hah!IdontNeedEFI":
     for known_bootloader in GRUB2-EFI EFI GRUB2 GRUB ELILO LILO ; do
         if grep -v 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' $bootloader_area_strings_file | grep -q -i "$known_bootloader" ; then
</pre>

I will do a pull request...

It does not help to only exclude 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' because  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752\#issue-303856221](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752#issue-303856221)
there is

<pre>
#-> cat /tmp/rear.V9AKAEZDKjqVbWE/tmp/bootloader_area_strings
ZRr=
`|f
\|f1
GRUB
Geom
Hard Disk
Read
 Error
EFI PART
Hah!IdontNeedEFI"s8<
</pre>

so that `grep -v 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI'` still leaves the `EFI PART` line  
which again results that `EFI` is falsely guessed.

I think the sloution is  
when in the 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' case no known non-EFI bootloader is found
then  
continue guessing the used bootloader by inspecting the first bytes on
the next disk  
and I implememted that via

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780)
merged  
this issue should be (hopefully) fully fixed.
