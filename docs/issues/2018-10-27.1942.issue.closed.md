This script fails because arch linux loads uefi from /boot and not from
/boot/efi

@gozora  
could you have a look here how to enhance it because  
it seems Arch Linux uses /boot and not /boot/efi

@jsmeix I'll take a look as a time permits ...

@johnny-cash there is several ways ho Arch can deal with UEFI, can you
please describe yours in more detail ?  
It would also help if you'd not ignore our issue template ...

@gdha  
I also assigned you here because

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/630_run_efibootmgr.sh
</pre>

shows that 630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh was intitially from you  
and  
I assigned me because I think 630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh needs to be  
generally overhauled like I did it for 620\_install\_grub2.sh  
in particular I think 'finalize' stage scripts should usually not error
out,  
see my comment in 620\_install\_grub2.sh

At a very first glance I think I can use the UEFI\_BOOTLOADER value  
to get the right directory where the ESP is mounted  
cf. the code in rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
... more tomorrow ...

@johnny-cash  
in your ReaR log file (and on your terminal when you run ReaR in verbose
mode)  
you got a message like

<pre>
Using '/boot/loader.efi' as UEFI bootloader file
</pre>

What exactly did you get?

Best provide us a whole rear debug log file,  
see what we need at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

I currently see two problems here:

1.  Arch gives you freedom during installation to set up your UEFI
    partition (esp) wherever you like. As an example I've managed to
    setup my Arch as follows:

<!-- -->

    /dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)
    /dev/sda1 on /boot/hello type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro)

Hence heaving esp in */boot/hello* ...

This is good for Arch users but can quite easily become nightmare for
us, since we can't rely on "standard" filesystem layout when determining
which EFI files to copy.

1.  You can setup Arch not to use GRUB2 (or any other boot loader) and
    nicely tell UEFI "Hey UEFI, don't bother with grubx64.efi and
    friends but rather boot vmliuz directly!". (a.k.a. EFISTUB) Such
    setup which is recommended directly by [Arch
    wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition#Mount_the_partition),
    and which I guess is reason of @johnny-cash trouble, will most
    probably avoid ReaR to create recovery system as you are not bound
    to have any boot loader helper utilities (GRUB, elilo, ...)
    installed.  
    And even if you'd install them, and you'd convince ReaR to ignore
    all the hard coded *boot/efi* references, ReaR would incorrectly
    install GRUB on finalize stage, instead using EFISTUB ...

In upcoming days (if time permits) I'll try to find some reasonable way
to implement EFISTUB into ReaR.

@rear/contributors I'm doing small research.  
Can you please look for string "*EFI*" in kernels of your testing
systems and paste results to this thread together with kernel version
and distro? It doesn't really matter if your OS is setup for LEGACY or
UEFI boot ...

Something like:

    arch-efi:(/root)(root)# cat /etc/os-release; uname -r && strings /boot/vmlinuz-linux | grep EFI

To my big surprise I just successfully recovered Arch Linux with EFISTUB
without changing a bit in actual ReaR code.(OK, OK, I've used @jsmeix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1945](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1945),
BTW I'd like to once write such code unblinded ;-)).  
When using EFISTUB, ReaR incorrectly sets *USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=0*,
by :

    + source /usr/share/rear/prep/default/320_include_uefi_env.sh
    ...
    +++ find /boot -maxdepth 1 -iname efi -type d
    ++ test ''
    ++ return 0

and continues ... As a side effect of such wrong evaluation, ReaR
recovery ISO can't automatically boot, however recovery system can be
booted manually using UEFI shell (with EFISTUB we have kernel that can
be booted directly without helper tools or boot loaders).  
After `rear recover` finishes, I've got

    For this system
    Arch/ on Linux-i386 (based on /i386)
    there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system
    or the code that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.
    Please contribute appropriate code to the Relax-and-Recover project,
    see http://relax-and-recover.org/development/
    Take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize,
    for example see the scripts
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/210_install_grub.sh
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/220_install_grub2.sh

    ---------------------------------------------------
    |  IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL A BOOT LOADER MANUALLY,  |
    |  THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BOOT.     |
    ---------------------------------------------------

    You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login'
    to change into the recovered system.
    You should at least mount /proc in the recovered system
    e.g. via 'mount -t proc none /mnt/local/proc'
    before you change into the recovered system
    and manually install a boot loader therein.

    Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.
    Exiting rear recover (PID 434) and its descendant processes
    Running exit tasks

message, but again, since system boots with EFISTUB manual boot in EFI
shell did the trick, and system is up and running ...

When I've did another test with *USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=y* enforced in
*/etc/rear/local.conf*,  
`rear mkrescue` failed with:

    ERROR: Cannot autodetect what to use as UEFI_BOOTLOADER, you have to manually specify it in /etc/rear/local.conf
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh:

The problem here simply is that, there is nothing that could be used as
*UEFI\_BOOTLOADER*, bacause EFISTUB ...

Now I'm not sure if I want to fix something that is actually working :-)

@gozora  
I think it should be possible (with reasonable effort) to enhance  
the existing USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER and UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
config variables to also support EFISTUB cleanly in the code.  
Not necessarily automatically out of the box but at least manually  
e.g. via something like

<pre>
USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1
UEFI_BOOTLOADER="EFISTUB"
</pre>

plus additional conditions in the code that "officially skip" what is
not needed  
in case of EFISTUB (and perhaps even set `NOBOOTLOADER=''` to avoid  
the non helpful warning that one needs to manually install a boot
loader)  
instead of now where the code blindly and accidentally lets things  
somehow work even for EFISTUB.

This way EFISTUB could be generically supported by ReaR  
without a requirement of systemd-boot - except in practice  
systemd-boot is always used on systems that boot via EFISTUB.

@jsmeix  
In general I agree.

The reason for using systemd-boot as boot loader, is plain and simple
automatic start of boot menu of ReaR recovery system. Without
systemd-boot we would need to somehow tell server what kernel + initrd +
options to boot. This means that we would either need to somehow mess up
with `efibootmgr` or instruct user around EFI shell, maybe by
documenting it (and I don't like any of these options).

From what I've checked so far, *systemd-bootx64.efi* is standard part of
Systemd hence available on Linux distributions using Systemd. So we
would not need to install any additional software.

These is my very early idea (which might change over time) how thing
could work. I'd need to continue with research on this topic. I keep you
posted.

Thanks to mention that 'systemd-boot' actually is `systemd-bootx64.efi`

[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/)

On my SLES15-like openSUSE Leap 15.0 system I have it

# rpm -qf /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi
systemd-234-lp150.20.6.1.x86_64

For the fun of it:  
When you "don't like non of these options" you like them all ;-)

@jsmeix  
Sorry for my previous inconsistencies. I'm pretty new in this EFISTUB
thingy and I'm still exploring its possibilities and ways how we could
use them in ReaR.  
The fact that it looks to be widely available across distros, together
with fact that kernels are nowadays build with EFISTUB support, could
simplify ReaR booting code a lot in the future (at least for systems
booting with UEFI).

Comment updated, thanks for pointing it out ;-).

@gozora  
I look forward to your first EFISTUB support in ReaR!

Booting the kernel directly by the UEFI firmware without  
a traditional bootloader in between looks right to me  
in particular because it avoids RFC 1925 item 6a:  
"It is always possible to add another level of indirection."

But booting via EFISTUB could only simplify the ReaR booloader  
setup code provided the original system is booted this way.

Because ReaR intends to recreate a system as far as possible as it was
before  
"rear recover" would have to recreate a system that boots via UEFI  
with GRUB2 in between when the original system booted this way.

I assume there are use cases where GRUB2 in between is useful  
even on UEFI hardware and EFISTUB support in the kernel.  
I guess GRUB2 in between provides features that plain UEFI doesn't.

@jsmeix

> I look forward to your first EFISTUB support in ReaR!

Unfortunately I'm quite short on time last few weeks, I'll try to start
my work on EFISTUB support next week ...

Automatically detecting EFISTUB would be similar precarious task as
finding right UEFI boot loader, hence I'll most probably let user
manually specify *UEFI\_BOOTLOADER="EFISTUB"* at lest for early stages.

@gozora  
no rush - take your time!

Yes, first and foremost the user must be able to specify what he wants  
so that he has the final power to command what ReaR does.  
Then as fallback if nothing was specified a best effort attempt  
to guess how the system was booted can be done,

I've put together some very basic
[code](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB) for
EFISTUB support in ReaR, it currently works only for *OUTPUT=ISO* and
restore (`rear recover`) part does not work at all.  
I've finally decided not to use *UEFI\_BOOTLOADER="EFISTUB"*, since it
don't feel right and can become quite confusing, since EFISTUB doesn't
really use traditional Linux boot loader.

New variable *EFI\_STUB* in *global.conf*.was introduced and will imply
*USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1* and
*UEFI\_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"* with
message in log file in case that user will try to set these variables.

When using *EFISTUB=y*, *UEFI\_BOOTLOADER* have meaning only for
creation process of ReaR recovery system where it is used to display
boot menu in same way like Syslinux, Grub or Elilo did.

@gozora  
great to have some very basic EFISTUB support in ReaR!  
Now there is an entry point where things can be further enhanced as
needed.

I do not understand what you wrote  
`it ... works ... for ... restore` and  
`rear recover part does not work at all`  
because 'restore' is usually a part of "rear recover" (when 'restore'  
means the 'restore' of the backup during "rear recover").

Some initial review of your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB)  
by plain looking at the code:

I think in usr/share/rear/pack/GNU/Linux/500\_check\_EFISTUB.sh  
the 'StopIfError' is not needed and could be simplified to plain
'Error'  
because the 'if' condition had already tested that this is the error
case  
(I wonder why there is `$( ... )` command substitution in the 'if'
condition).  
Because 'Error' exits the whole ReaR I think it could be simplified  
to a single `COMMAND || Error` line for example like

<pre>
grep -q -i "EFI stub" $KERNEL_FILE || Error "$KERNEL_FILE is not compiled with EFISTUB support"
LogPrint "Using $KERNEL_FILE with EFISTUB support"
</pre>

or similar.

In usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
the hardcoded

<pre>
UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"
</pre>

should have at least a test that this file exists  
as it is done elsewhere in that script like

<pre>
if is_true $EFI_STUB; then
    # Add checks here
    UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"
    test -f "$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" && return
    Error "EFISTUB requires $UEFI_BOOTLOADER"
fi
</pre>

because otherwise it could bindly proceed with a UEFI\_BOOTLOADER
value  
that cannot work and then things may fail later at an unexpected place

Hello @jsmeix,

Thanks for your inputs ...

Let me simplify this ;-), it works currently only to create ReaR
recovery system and backup (`rear mkbackup/mkrescue`).

For hardcoded:
`UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"` there
will be checks for file existence, as you can see in comment:

    if is_true $EFI_STUB; then
        # Add checks here
       ...

I was mostly interested about general opinion on introducing $EFI\_STUB
configuration variable and its functionality when it is internally
overriding variables that can be normally set by user (UEFI\_BOOTLOADER
and USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER).  
I'm not sure if we have some other code in ReaR that behaves like
this.  
I personally as user, don't like situations where I configure some
settings and they are overridden by application for whatever reason
without even simple explanation why ...

@gozora  
using separated config variables for separated things is "the right
thing".

In particular I prefer to Keep Separated Issues Separated (KSIS)  
to avoid RFC 1925 item (5)
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925)  
as a precondition to Keep It Simple and Straightforward (KISS).

We have other cases in ReaR where some config variable sets another  
config variable if the other config variable was not explicitly
specified  
e.g. "If you do not specify OUTPUT\_URL variable then by default  
it will be aligned to what was defined by variable BACKUP\_URL" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

I saw your 'Add checks here' comment but misunderstood it  
as if it meant that some automated search for `systemd-bootx64.efi`  
could be added later here (something like the other automated  
search code in rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh).

Yes I know about situations like this, but what I'm planning to do, is
to override UEFI\_BOOTLOADER and USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER even if they
are explicitly set by user in local.conf or site.conf.

Looking over your branch and reading through this issue I have a few
thoughts/questions:

-   Can we somehow separate between the "rescue media boot method" and
    "recovered system boot method" topics? They don't have to be same
    same and IMHO they should not be coupled.
-   Everything that modifies the rescue media should IMHO show up when
    you do a `rear dump`. Easiest way to achieve that (and to make it
    obvious to the user) is to prefix such variables with `OUTPUT_`
    because then they are shown by `rear dump` with the other output
    related stuff.
-   Before setting a variable to the full path of `systemd-bootx64.efi`
    it might be prudent to check that this file actually exists (or
    maybe I missed the check).
-   Changing the boot loader of the recovered system is a heavy change
    and part of a migration. IMHO a variable to control that should
    start with `MIGRATE_` or something like this. Probably it would be
    good to add a section to the output of `rear dump` that will print
    all variables starting from `MIGRAT` so that users can much easier
    see migration-related settings.
-   IMHO the *only correct* way of finding (and not guessing) the [EFI
    System
    Partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition) is
    1.  find the first GPT partition with a GUID of
        `C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B` (or MBR partition with a
        type of `0xEF`)
    2.  find where this partition is mounted in the system
-   Maybe we should have the `dump` workflow also run
    `SourceStage "prep"` initially so that the `dump` output will
    actually reflect the calculated variables and not only show the
    static configuration.

Just for my understanding: Is EFISTUB the default UEFI boot loader in
Arch? Does Arch with grub2 on UEFI work already (the find-the-ESP
problem should be the same there, no?)?

If the core problem of this issue is "support EFISTUB booting on Arch"
then we should maybe rename it so.

@gozora  
what the user commands is sacrosanct, cf. "WHAT A MESS!" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733\#issuecomment-367680598](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733#issuecomment-367680598)

In current default.conf there is

<pre>
USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=
...
UEFI_BOOTLOADER=""
...
SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=""
</pre>

so by default none of those config variables have an actual value.  
In this default case you can set their value to whatever looks right  
when EFI\_STUB has a true value because when a config value has  
no real value it means ReaR can do and does automated things.

But when a config variable has a real value this is a command  
from the user and then ReaR has to obey where "obey" also means  
ReaR has to error out if the user commanded something impossible.

Accordingly if the user specified

<pre>
EFI_STUB=true
UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/mysystemd/myboot/myefi/mysystemd-bootx64.efi"
</pre>

and '/usr/lib/mysystemd/myboot/myefi/mysystemd-bootx64.efi' exists  
(on Arch Linux things can be anything anywhere) ReaR has to obey  
but otherwise (when that file does not exist) ReaR has to error out.

Accordingly I suggest in
rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
code like

<pre>
for dummy in "once" ; do
    if test -f "$SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER" ; then
        UEFI_BOOTLOADER="$SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER"
    fi

    ...
    test -f "$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" && continue

    if is_true $EFI_STUB; then
        UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"
        test -f "$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" && return
        Error "EFISTUB requires $UEFI_BOOTLOADER"
    fi
</pre>

I do not know how SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER and EFI\_STUB  
could be related to each other - perhaps additional checks are needed?

Furthermore in prep/default/320\_include\_uefi\_env.sh an additional
check  
is needed at the beginning to error out if USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is
false  
but EFI\_STUB is true like

<pre>
# by default the variable USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER is empty which means ReaR will decide (this script)
# except when the variable USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER has an explicit 'false' value set:
if is_false $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER ; then
    # we forced the variable to zero (in local.conf) so we do not want UEFI stuff
    # except EFI_STUB is true which conflicts here:
    is_true $EFI_STUB && Error "EFI_STUB true conflicts with USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER false"
    Log "We do not want UEFI capabilities in ReaR (USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=0)"
    return
fi
</pre>

and you can (and should) explain special interdependencies

@schlomo  
thanks to mention

separate between the "rescue media boot method"
and "recovered system boot method"
</pre>

because I fear I already confused both methods here.  
I usually confuse them because their config variable names  
do not make it obvious whereto they belong but we cannot  
change config variable names...

There are no properly and meaningful prefixed  
config variables to distinguish between things that belong to  
the ReaR recovery system (e.g. SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER)  
versus things for the original system (e.g. GRUB\_RESCUE)  
versus things for the recreated system (e.g. BOOTLOADER)  
versus things that belong both to the ReaR recovery system  
and to the recreated system (e.g. UEFI\_BOOTLOADER).

Hello @schlomo

The thing is, that with EFISTUB we don't need to look for esp, nor doing
all the guess work for boot loaders (\*.efi) detection.

It is hard to say what is actual default on Arch :-). According almighty
[Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_boot_process):

**Under UEFI**  
...

1.  Firmware launches the EFI application.

-   This could be a boot loader or the Arch kernel itself using EFISTUB.
-   It could be some other EFI application such as a UEFI shell or a
    boot manager like systemd-boot or rEFInd.

> Does Arch with grub2 on UEFI work already (the find-the-ESP problem

The main "problem" is that Arch allows you to setup system booting
whatever you like. The possibilities are endless and I think ReaR can't
cover them all. So if you setup Arch with Grub on UEFI with esp on
*/boot/efi* everything should work just fine.

What about adding the correct kernel & kernel command line to the UEFI
boot menu via `efibootmgr`? Don't we need to know where to find the ESP
for that?

No, we could either use `efibootmgr -v` where all the boot options
should be visible (AFAIK they are in unicode, so some additional work
would be required), or check */proc/cmdline*

IMHO checking command line of the currently running kernel is not
enough. There could be also other boot entries, e.g. to start a previous

No, I mean that there could be other boot configurations. On SLES, RHEL,
Debian for example you will find another boot configuration for the
previous kernel (in case the new kernel won't boot) and also additional
"safe mode" boot configurations. We should restore them if they exist.

For something like this, we could either dump whole EFI boot entries
related configuration and restore it after `rear recover`, or introduce
some new configuration variable where user could specify `efibootmgr`
command to create entries after `rear recover` is done ...

But for neither of these cases we need to know location of *esp*.

Regarding additional special boot options for the bootloader  
of the recreated system you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828\#issuecomment-399050741](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-399050741)  
which looks related to things like  
"another boot configuration for the previous kernel"

My point therein is

<pre>
Because on a by "rear recover" recreated system
there is no such thing as a meaningful previous boot
(because "rear recover" recreates a system by reinstalling it
completely from scratch) so that there is no meaningful use-case
to remember any information from a possible previous boot.
</pre>

In general regarding other boot configurations on SLES and RHEL:  
As far as I know at least on SLES only GRUB is used as bootloader  
(there is no EFISTUB support on SLES as far as I know)  
so that the GRUB config files get restored from the backup  
during "rear recover" that should result the same GRUB configuration  
as it was on the original system.

so that the code `grep -w ' on / '` does no longer match its comment.  
What is the reason that the `-w` option is now needed in addition  
to the explicitly specified spaces as separators in `' on / '`?  
Such a reason should be explained in the comment so that others  
know why the code must be this way (and do not attempt to simplify it  
into something that does no longer work in this or that special cases).

(b)  
In usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
there is (excerpt)

<pre>
# Use 260_populate_efistub.sh instead.
# There much of Grub/Elilo code here exclude it in menaningfull way.
is_true $EFI_STUB || return 0
</pre>

which skips 250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh when EFI\_STUB is not used  
but the comment indicates the opposite that
250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
should be skipped when EFI\_STUB is used - or what do I misunderstand
here?

(c)  
In usr/share/rear/pack/GNU/Linux/500\_check\_EFISTUB.sh

<pre>
! is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER && Error "..."
</pre>

is there a reason why not using

<pre>
is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || Error "..."
</pre>

which would be simpler from my personal point of view (which is  
a matter of taste how I personally read code)?

(d)  
In usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh
(excerpts):

<pre>
    # ... we will use systemd-bootx64.efi (if not overridden in local.conf / site.conf).
    ...
    # This looks to be the best guess for finding our boot loader.
    UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"
</pre>

this way '/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi' is used
hardcoded  
so that the user cannot override what to use.  
Therefore I would suggest something like

<pre>
    # ... we will use systemd-bootx64.efi (if not overridden in local.conf / site.conf).
    ...
    # If not specified by the user use /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi
    test -f "$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" || UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi"
</pre>

User can override UEFI\_BOOTLOADER by code already present in
850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh

    for dummy in "once" ; do
        if test -f "$SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER" ; then
          UEFI_BOOTLOADER="$SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER"
        fi

        # When the user has specified UEFI_BOOTLOADER in /etc/rear/local.conf use it if exists and is a regular file.
        # Double quotes are mandatory here because 'test -f' without any (possibly empty) argument results true:
        test -f "$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" && continue <== Here it UEFI_BOOTLOADER is set at this stage, further loop execution will stop ...

Hello @jsmeix,

About your comment:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942\#issuecomment-439820498](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942#issuecomment-439820498)

First and foremost, thanks for carefully checking my code!

Points a), b) and c) were corrected.

For point a) your are 100% right!  
I've mistakenly changed the code to use -w because change in
[940\_grub2\_rescue.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB#diff-7f052550597fa70483fe418e92ef6f8c):

    -    root_uuid=$(mount | grep -w 'on /' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs blkid -s UUID -o value)
    +    root_uuid=$(get_root_disk_UUID)

but I did not noticed code is using `'on /' ` instead of `' on / ' `.

Thanks for pointing this out!

I'm somehow not OK with using UEFI\_BOOTLOADER together with EFISTUB.  
It don't feel right as EFISTUB doesn't really use a boot loader (only
for auto-magic boot of ReaR rescue system).  
I've created another
[branch](https://github.com/gozora/rear/compare/gozora:master...EFISTUB_experiment)
where I'm experimenting a bit.  
I'm thinking about throwing error when user manually sets
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER and use new variable (something like
REAR\_RESCUE\_EFISTUB\_BOOT\_LOADER\_LOCATION, or maybe something
shorter :-)), to distinguish between booting UEFI with Grub/Elilo and
EFISTUB.

👍 for quality.

Would it be possible to use variables starting with `OUTPUT_` to
configure and describe everything related to the operation of the ReaR

I wished we had  
OUTPUT\_BOOT\* variables for booting the recovery system

TARGET\_BOOT\* variables for booting the recreated system

Probably empty OUTPUT\_BOOT\* variables could inherit  
the values from matching TARGET\_BOOT\* variables  
and vice versa for user convenience.

EFISTUB is a great simplification of Linux boot process. Where we don't
need to guess, search or build boot loaders on running system (set
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER during `rear mkbackup/mkrescue`) neither we need to
install boot loaders during `rear recover`.  
All we need to know for successful boot is location of kernel file (that
must be compiled with EFISTUB support) and options that should be passed
to kernel (initrd, kernel options as we know them from Grub/Elilo).  
I'm planning to write code that will be capable of some auto-magic
detection of these options or allow user to set them manually.

But I think the user should have a config variable where he could  
enforce or forbid ReaR to set up EFISTUB booting.

Assume ReaR determines the kernel is compiled with EFISTUB support  
and ReaR does not find a GRUB config, does that mean to set up  
EFISTUB booting for the recovery system and the recreated system  
in any case and there is no way for the user to get something else?

EFISTUB has to be activated manually (EFI\_STUB=y), because I currently
don't know 100% reliable way for detecting EFISTUB (boot loaders might
or might not be installed, but not used).  
I'm planning to create documentation on this topic though ...

Just goofing around with [EFISTUB

With enabled settings in *local.conf*

    ...
    EFI_STUB=y

    EFI_STUB_EFIBOOTMGR_ARGS="initrd=initrd-4.4.21-69-default root=/dev/mapper/system-root"

ReaR was capable to migrate SLES12 SP2 from Grub to EFISTUB nearly out
of the box :-).  
Another site effect of EFISTUB is that it might send *ebiso* into
retirement ...

@gozora  
awesome!

Could you explan what "nearly out of the box" exactly means?  
I.e. did you need to do other manual stuff (except specifying the right
config variables)?

FYI  
regarding "migrate from Grub to EFISTUB"  
we have the related more general issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437)  
so that "migrate from Grub to EFISTUB" could be  
a first example where ReaR migrates the bootloader.

@gozora  
because I cannot add coments to your  
[https://github.com/gozora/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB](https://github.com/gozora/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB)  
I post them here:

In usr/share/rear/finalize/default/050\_prepare\_checks.sh you set

    is_true $EFI_STUB && NOBOOTLOADER=""

I wonder if 050\_prepare\_checks.sh is the right place for that.  
Usually `NOBOOTLOADER=""` is only set at the end of a script  
that actually successfully had installed a bootloader.  
Accordingly I think `NOBOOTLOADER=""` should happen  
only after EFISTUP setup was actually done successfully.

In general you use always the test `is_true $EFI_STUB`.  
I did not carefully check the details in your code - I think it is o.k.

In general be careful with using `is_true` and `is_false`  
because both are not logical inverse, see the comments  
in lib/global-functions.sh (excerpt)

    '! is_true' is not the same as 'is_false'
    and '! is_false' is not the same as 'is_true'

Simply put - also imagine what happens in case of  
`EFI_STUB=''` or `EFI_STUB=' '` or `EFI_STUB='fubar'`  
(then both `is_true $EFI_STUB` and `is_false $EFI_STUB` return
'false')  
even then some reasonable default/fallback behaviour should happen  
alternatively you may perhaps add a test in the 'init' stage that errors
out  
when both `is_true $EFI_STUB` and `is_false $EFI_STUB` return 'false'?

Hello @jsmeix,

I'm planning to fully explain this in documentation that I'll prepare
once I'm OK with EFISTUB code.

But in general I had SLES12SP2 with Grub installed booting using UEFI.  
Once of the requirements for EFISTUB will be that your KERNEL\_FILE MUST
be located on VFAT partition.  
Since this requirement was not met, I had to copy KERNEL\_FILE and
initrd to /boot/efi (VFAT filesystem) and tell ReaR where EFISTUB
capable kernel is located
(`KERNEL_FILE="/boot/efi/vmlinuz-4.4.21-69-default"`).  
After `rear recover` was over, ReaR recreated initrd what was located on
original location (in */boot*) so I had to copy it again to /boot/efi,
because initrd in */boot/efi* is the real initrd that is booted by
EFISTUB.

This could be avoided if I would simply migrate */boot* from ext3 to
vfat ....

I'll send you reply to your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942\#issuecomment-446135800](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1942#issuecomment-446135800)

I've moved "reset" of NOBOOTLOADER variable directly into
[script](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/98fb9f61932239b3fc38e3ab9fcd5a355ec461ad#diff-56139131511534f2e446dbae527b8711)

Thanks for your inputs.

Soon I'll start writing some small documentation on [EFISTUB
code](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:EFISTUB?expand=1)
describing supported/tested setup and possible behavior during migration
to EFISTUB.
