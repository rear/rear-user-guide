    */var/tmp* directory is excluded from backup
-   Work-around, if any: Keep directory by using exclude pattern
    */var/tmp/\** instead of */var/tmp*

This problem originates from `mkinitrd` (dracut) behavior which uses
*/var/tmp* as default value for --tmpdir. If *tmpdir* is missing during
finalize phase, initrd recreation fails with following message:

    2017-08-25 07:22:48.921465572 Running mkinitrd...
    mktemp: failed to create directory via template '/var/tmp/dracut.XXXXXX': No such file or directory

    Failed to create initrd for kernel version '3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64'.

To fix this, I'd go for following simple code in
*finalize/Fedora/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh* (maybe
*SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh* suffer by similar behavior
...)

    if [ ! -d /var/tmp ]; then
      mkdir /var/tmp

@gozora good catch. We have scripts for that sort of thing:

    $ git ls-files "*create*missing*"
    usr/share/rear/restore/SESAM/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/SUSE_LINUX/910_create_missing_directories.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh

Maybe you can add `/var/tmp` to one of them?

@gozora  
many thanks for finding and fixing all those smaller  
but annoying issues.

FYI:  
I think a system without a /var/tmp/ directory  
can be considered to be broken nowadays  
so that strictly speaking it is the admin's task  
to make a backup that contains all required stuff.  
I am not a FHS expert but I think the directories listed in  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem\_Hierarchy\_Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)  
could be expected to "just exist".

@jsmeix I think that this is a corner case or grey area: Typical backup
software assumes that the restore always happens on top of a system that
was installed the traditional way, so that for the backup software it is
safe to assume that those directories are present. From the perspective
of the backup software there is therefore no need to include such
directories in a full backup.

Bottom line is, I think it is the duty of ReaR to make sure that these
special directories really do exist.

@schlomo  
many thanks for your explanation!  
With that I changed my mind and state now that  
"rear recover" shoud create a system with the  
"usual directory structure" (whatever that actually means).

I think it would be not correct if "rear recover" just creates  
the usual (or some minimal) FHS directory structure from scratch  
because that may not match what there was on the original system.

Therefore I think during "rear mkrescue" the "usual directory
structure"  
of the original system should be saved into a ReaR config file,  
e.g. var/lib/rear/layout/directorylayout.conf  
from which "rear recover" could recreate it.

I think the problem would be special permission settings  
like ACLs and such stuff.

Can perhaps 'tar' be used to backup only a directory structure  
without the files? Then we might use 'tar' for that?

Or something like 'cp -a' only for directories without files?

@jsmeix I don't think that we need to create a generic solution. We
already store and recreate the mount points as lots of backup tools omit
them. I would keep things simple and add common directories that users
report as missing to `MOUNTPOINTS_TO_RESTORE` in `default.conf`.

@gozora after looking at the code again I realized that there is an even
simpler solution:

1.  Add `var/tmp` to `MOUNTPOINTS_TO_RESTORE` in `default.conf`
2.  Add `var/tmp` to the `chmod 1777` call already present here

That way we will treat `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` the same.

Could we then - by the way - also  
rename MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE  
into DIRECTORIES\_TO\_CREATE  
so that its name tells what it actually is  
and then it matches better to the script name  
that does it 900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh

Currently MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE is used only in  
conf/default.conf  
restore/default/900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh  
verify/TSM/default/400\_verify\_tsm.sh

I could do that next week it you agree.

@gozora  
just wait - I will prepare a pull request right now...  
(that can be rejected if not wanted)...

Thanks guys, I also think that we should rename the variable. And we
should probably update the TSM script to add its list of TSM excluded
mountpoints to that list instead of replacing it.

@jsmeix I'm on hold ;-)

If we have **DIRECTORIES\_TO\_CREATE** how will we treat their
permissions during creation?  
Or maybe another corner case (which would make my patch invalid btw.),
what if /var/tmp was symlink to /tmp on original system?

@gozora @schlomo  
have a look at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1457](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1457)  
what you think about it.  
I think it is much more generic and cleaner now.

@gozora  
regarding permissions or symlinks:  
There is nothing new compared to how MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE  
worked before - i.e. no support for permissions or symlinks  
except permissions from the mountpoint\_permissions file as before.  
Support also such advanced stuff was a reason behind my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1455\#issuecomment-324917669](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1455#issuecomment-324917669)  
which we might implement in the future if really needed  
(a.k.a. if users really request it) but for now I agree with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1455\#issuecomment-324921139](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1455#issuecomment-324921139)  
and I also would like to keep things simple (at least for now).

On the other hand:  
Currently DIRECTORIES\_TO\_CREATE is not really documented  
in default.conf (same as MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE was  
not really documented in default.conf before).  
I think I could easily enhance DIRECTORIES\_TO\_CREATE  
to a bash array of entries of the form

<pre>
DIRECTORIES_TO_CREATE=( '/var/tmp 1777 root root' 'sys 555 root root' ...)
</pre>

where each array member is a string of words of the form

<pre>
[/]path/to/directory permission userid groupid
</pre>

which would support traditional permissions but no ACLs  
and no symlinks.

Sorry, I am against storing multi-word strings in a Bash array (wrong
tool for the job). Let's discuss the details of that topic in \#1457
instead to keep it all there.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1459](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1459)
merged  
the whole "directories to be (re)-created" functionality  
got overhauled and enhanced.

Of course if new issues appear now, I will fix them.
