-   Type: **Minor Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**  
    Only avoid a "false positive" check message.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3021](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3021)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my Fedora 40 system

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
for each 'not found' shared object  
(i.e. a shared object that was 'not found' by 'ldd')  
check whether or not the shared object  
may exist nevertheless in the recovery system  
and if yes, we may sufficiently safely assume  
things are OK in the ReaR recovery system  
so we do not report it as missing to the user  
(for debugging we have all in the log), see

How it looks with this changes on my Fedora 40 system:

    [root@linux rear.github.master]# usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Testing each binary with 'ldd' and look for 'not found' libraries within the recovery system
    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so requires libraries were 'ldd' shows 'not found'
    libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so was not found by 'ldd' but exists as /var/tmp/rear.gJXDcJNvfEo9wJr/rootfs/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so

With latest changes how it looks in non-verbose mode

    [root@linux rear.github.master]# usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    [root@linux rear.github.master]# echo $?
    0

i.e. no message because there is no error  
and in verbose mode

    [root@linux rear.github.master]# usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue
    ...
    Testing that the recovery system in /var/tmp/rear.py2WKaUvGlU7Ekg/rootfs contains a usable system
    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so requires libraries were 'ldd' shows 'not found'
    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so requires libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so which was not found by 'ldd' but exists as /var/tmp/rear.py2WKaUvGlU7Ekg/rootfs/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so

i.e. all relevant messages to not omit something  
from the user in verbose mode i.e. 'verbose' means 'verbose' ;-)

@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections I would like  
to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

@jsmeix sorry for being late, but I don't understand the "were" in
messages. I think you meant "where".

Regarding "tested by me on my Fedora 40 system", the CI runs can also
help, despite erroring out after end (the output from mkbackup is
available).

CI runs on another version show:

@jsmeix and thanks for the improvement!

@pcahyna  
thank you for your exact review.  
Yes "were" is a typo that should be "where".  
I will just fix that right now.

I didn't notice it in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3250\#issuecomment-2168043239](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3250#issuecomment-2168043239)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3250\#issuecomment-2168077072](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3250#issuecomment-2168077072)

As a side note for the fun of it:  
I read rather fast so my brain doesn't notice typos  
as long as it can deduce what is meant.  
For me the text with typo

    requires libraries were 'ldd' shows 'not found'

appears in my brain exactly same as the text

    requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found'

i.e. I directly understand that 'were' as 'where'  
without anything that indicates something is wrong.  
In contrast my wife reads slower and she notices  
almost every typo.  
In practice I cannot read slower and when I try  
it doesn't help, and my wife cannot read faster.
