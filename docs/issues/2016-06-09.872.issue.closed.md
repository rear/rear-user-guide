Current rear GitHub master.

Excerpt from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/870\#issue-159368065](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/870#issue-159368065)

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP=NETFS

BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
prevents the creation of the live rescue system
on the USB device, because the backup options
are used there as well.
</pre>

I think this is a generic bug that is caused by mixing up  
separated things.

It looks like some kind of (mis)use of one same  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS  
for what should be probably better separated  
into separated config variables like  
NFS\_MOUNT\_OPTIONS  
or something like that.

@gdha  
what do you think?

Should I try to split up BACKUP\_OPTIONS into  
several separated config variables?

To avoid backward incompatible regressions  
my plan is to not change the current usage  
of BACKUP\_OPTIONS as a general variable  
but to add some more specific variables as needed  
and when such a specific variable is set then use  
only the specific value  
(and ignore the BACKUP\_OPTIONS value).

In short:  
If set use the new specific value  
otherwise  
fall back using the BACKUP\_OPTIONS value.

@jsmeix To be honest I would avoid making too much variables. If it is
possible we can clear the variable in the USB prep phase if needed (just
check on `nfs` key and remove it).

@jsmeix if we decide to change to name then `BACKUP_URL_OPTIONS` seems
more related to the `BACKUP_URL`, no?

I do not intend to change anything for  
the current BACKUP\_OPTIONS variable.

I will have a look if it is possible to implement some exceptional  
case handling for BACKUP\_OPTIONS when the recovery system  
is on USB.

I will prepare a pull request so that then we can better discuss  
with something real about what kind of changes I have in mind.

In general I prefer to keep separated things separated  
which means in general I prefer to have as many variables  
as there are separated things.

Many variables does not mean that the user  
must know about them or even explicitly set them.

Many variables also does not mean that there cannot be  
more globally meant variables plus more specifically  
meant variables.

For example there could be a more globally meant variable  
SOMETHING  
plus corresponding more specifically meant variables like  
SOMETHING\_SPECIAL\_THIS  
SOMETHING\_SPECIAL\_THAT  
or things like that.

There should be reasonable default/fallback behaviour  
for each variable when it is not explicitly set so that "usually"  
the user should not need to care about them.

But when there are "unusual" cases it should be possible  
for the user to adjust all and every detail exactly as he needs.

Of course this results the question what "usual"  
versus "unusual" cases are.

When all and every detail can be specified as needed  
the question what the default case is  
is no longer very important.

How to reproduce the issue:

On my SLES12-SP1 x86\_64  
KVM/QEMU virtual test machine  
with two virtual disks

<pre>
# parted -l
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 21.5GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 
Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system     Flags
 1      1049kB  1571MB  1570MB  primary  linux-swap(v1)  type=82
 2      1571MB  21.5GB  19.9GB  primary  ext4            boot, type=83
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 2147MB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 
Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
 1      1049kB  2147MB  2146MB  primary  ext2         type=83
</pre>

with etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdb1
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

"rear mkbackup" fails as follows:

<pre>

In usr/share/rear/prep/default/02\_translate\_url.sh I found:

<pre>
### Make sure we have OUTPUT_* from BACKUP_*, for compat with versions that
### not separated the two.
if [[ -z "$OUTPUT_OPTIONS" ]] ; then
    if [[ -z "$OUTPUT_URL" && -z "$OUTPUT_MOUNTCMD" ]] ; then
        ### There can be cases where it's intentionally empty.
        OUTPUT_OPTIONS=$BACKUP_OPTIONS
    fi
fi
</pre>

which results that in  
usr/share/rear/output/default/10\_mount\_output\_path.sh

<pre>
mount_url $OUTPUT_URL $BUILD_DIR/outputfs $OUTPUT_OPTIONS
</pre>

evaluates to

<pre>
mount_url nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs /tmp/rear.FnsF7EvkWh8K68K/outputfs nfsvers=3,nolock
</pre>

which works but also to

<pre>
mount_url usb:///dev/sdb1 /tmp/rear.FnsF7EvkWh8K68K/outputfs nfsvers=3,nolock
</pre>

which fails with

<pre>
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,
</pre>

I.e. in current rear versions there is OUTPUT\_\*  
separated from BACKUP\_\* and for backward compatibility  
OUTPUT\_\* inherits from BACKUP\_\*

Therefore in this case it helps to set a non-empty dummy

<pre>
OUTPUT_OPTIONS="nodiratime"
</pre>

to get BACKUP\_OPTIONS separated from OUTPUT\_OPTIONS  
which results

<pre>
mount_url nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs /tmp/rear.euHSfSw80xVx5zL/outputfs nfsvers=3,nolock
</pre>

that works as intended and

<pre>
mount_url usb:///dev/sdb1 /tmp/rear.euHSfSw80xVx5zL/outputfs nodiratime
</pre>

that also works as intended.

Of course this is only a workaround but I need more time  
to better understand all the complicated interdependencies  
of the variables.

I like to avoid a quick and dirty hack in the mount\_url()  
function in usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh for  
the (usb) case (like just removing the "$options" there).

I really wished there were well separated variables  
for each separated use case...
