-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    LSB Version: 1.4  
    Distributor ID: Arch  
    Description: Arch Linux  
    Release: rolling  
    Codename: n/a
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    n/a
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    UEFI
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    USB flash memory sticks and possibly SSD in USB adapters don't
    supply alignment information to the Linux kernel. As a result the
    USB medium partitioning more often far from an optimal alignment
    then that these devices are optimally aligned.
-   Work-around, if any:  
    Manual edit
    usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh  
    and change the parted command to something like  
    `parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE mkpart primary ~~2~~4Mib "$((~~2~~4 + ${USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE}))"Mib ...`  
    for the <s>2097152 byte</s>4MiB optimal alignment as derived by
    `flashbench` for a "Sandisk Cruzer Force 16GB" USB stick.

This issue also applicable for the optimal sector and node size, where
an adaptation in the command `mkfs …` will likely improve performance
and reduce wear for thumb drives.

Alignment according to physical block size  
is a very good thing!

2097152 bytes (i.e. 2 MiB) looks unexpected small to me.  
As far as I know usual flash storage operates with  
a physical block size of 4 MiB or 8 MiB - nowadays  
perhaps even 16 MiB on huge flash storages,  
cf. my last comment on  
[https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/23](https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/23)

Because during "rear format" we can do what we want  
(in contrast to "rear recover" where we must by default  
recreate the system exactly as it was before)  
I suggest to simply align at 8 MiB during "rear format"  
in any case.  
Who cares nowadays about a few unused MiB  
at the beginning of a mass storage device?

<pre>
how to partition a low-end flash device
(“low-end”, as of 2011/2012).
For such devices, you should
use 4MiB-aligned partitions (2)
...
(2)
Cheap flash drives will be with us
for a long time to come, and, for them,
1MiB alignment is not enough.
Use at least 4MiB-aligned partitions.
For details, see Arnd Bergman’s article,
http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/
and its many comments.

FYI:  
Regarding why during "rear recover"  
we must try to recreate the partitioning  
exactly as it was before see

Something like

<pre>
parted ... mkpart primary 8Mib "$((8 + ${USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE}))"Mib ...
</pre>

cannot work well because if e.g. USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE is 7 MiB  
it still results bad alignment for the ReaR data partition.  
We need "more intelligent" code that rounds  
the user-specified values to 8 MiB chunks, cf.

Indeed 2 MiB was too small. Right now I suspect the Sandisk Cruzer Fit
16GB to have 4 MiB physical blocks. I am still struggling with correctly
interpreting `flashbench` output. I do agree that rounding user input to
"block size" is necessary.

And this wish also request for some **variable** that allows inserting
**additional parameters** for the **mkfs** command at
usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh.

As an example how I modified that file after running Linaro's flashbench
on the Sandisk Cruzer Fit:

    -mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM -L REAR-000 ${RAW_USB_DEVICE}${ParNr} >&2 || Error "Failed to create $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM filesystem on '${RAW_USB_DEVICE}${ParNr}'"
    +mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM -L REAR-000 -b 4096 -E stride=8,stripe-width=256 -O sparse_super,^has_journal ${RAW_USB_DEVICE}${ParNr} >&2 || Error "Failed to create $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM filesystem on '${RAW_USB_DEVICE}${ParNr}'"

@ProBackup-nl: Have you replicated the flashbench findings on other
devices of varying size and source to confirm the applicability of those
results for other units?

@FGrose Yes, I have verified using `flashbench` that the above values
are **not applicable to other USB flash drives**. The above code is just
an **example**.

I need something like:  
`+mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM -L REAR-000 ${USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PARAMS} ${RAW_USB_DEVICE}${ParNr} >&2 || Error "Failed to create $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM fil...`

@jsmeix "more intelligent" code that rounds to chunks has been
implemented in pull request \#1217

@ProBackup-nl  
many thanks for your contribution!

@FGrose  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1217](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1217)  
by default USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_PARAMS  
is empty.  
The basic idea behind such variables is to give the user  
some means of "final power" so that the user can specify  
if needed what ReaR will actually do, cf.  
"too much secretly working 'magic automatisms' in ReaR" in
