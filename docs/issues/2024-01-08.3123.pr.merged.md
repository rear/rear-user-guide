-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal** / **Critical**

Normally (i.e. by default) the ReaR recovery system  
does not contain secrets but when it contains secrets  
and when GRUB\_RESCUE=Y is used then it is critical  
that only root is allowed to access the initrd.

@schlomo  
Wow!  
Regardless how long I worked with ReaR there is always  
something important that I did not yet notice,  
like output/default/010\_set\_umask.sh  
Thank you for pointing that out!

No worries @jsmeix, I also didn't know about that. I thought to myself
"umask might be a good idea" and simply searched for `umask` in the code
to see if there is something with it already.

Meanwhile I think this current (untested) proposed fix  
is highly questionable because it does 'chmod 0600'  
for the initrd in ReaR's $TMP\_DIR which is not  
the final initrd that is located in the  
world-readable '/boot/' directory for GRUB\_RESCUE=Y.  
Perhaps things somehow work via 'cp -p' or similar  
but in general I think it would be better (i.e. more fail-safe)  
to set the intended permissions for the final initrd file  
for GRUB\_RESCUE=Y and perhaps also for other methods.

Yes, I think ReaR should be careful to not mess up things somewhere
else. So for example I see value in protecting the final boot files on
the *local* filesystem, but I wouldn't want to touch stuff on remote
filesystems mounted via NFS or CIFS. I'd rather assume that appropriate
measures are in place on the other server.

Yes, I also won't care about non-built-in storage  
like removable (USB) disks or similar things  
i.e. storage where others could get physical access  
so that the user who runs "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
must care on his own how to protect such storage.

Regarding the ReaR ISO on the local filesystem:  
With

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///other

I get after "rear mkrescue":

    # ls -l var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso
    -rw------- 1 root root 96038912 Jan  9 11:41 var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso

    # ls -ld var/lib/rear/output
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan  9 11:41 var/lib/rear/output

    # ls -ld var/lib/rear
    drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jan  9 11:39 var/lib/rear

and (because of BACKUP\_URL=file:///other)

    # find /other -type f -name '*.iso' -ls
    376836 93884 -rw------- 1 root root 96038912 Jan 9 11:41 /other/linux-h9wr/rear-linux-h9wr.iso

I get the same restrictive permissions  
when I change output/default/010\_set\_umask.sh to only

    DebugPrint "umask is $( umask )"

which results for me

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    umask is 0022
    Making ISO image
    Wrote ISO image: /root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso (92M)

Currently I fail to see how and where that restrictive permissions  
are set in ReaR for the \*.iso files.

Interestingly the current fix  
results restrictive permissions for  
the final initrd that is located in the  
world-readable '/boot/' directory for GRUB\_RESCUE=Y.

With

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.122.1/nfs
    GRUB_RESCUE=Y

Without the current fix:

    ...
    ... -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 68010481 Jan  9 14:41 /boot/rear-initrd.cgz

In contrast with the current fix:

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue

Without this fix here  
but with an early `umask 0077` in  
init/default/001\_verify\_config\_arrays.sh  
(there only for now for my test)  
and with disabled output/default/010\_set\_umask.sh  
I also get restrictive permissions for  
the final initrd that is located in the  
world-readable '/boot/' directory for GRUB\_RESCUE=Y

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...

    # find /boot -name '*initrd*' -ls
    ...
    ... -rw------- 1 root root 68003492 Jan  9 15:24 /boot/rear-initrd.cgz

Furthermore I also get restrictive permissions  
for many ReaR files in var/ in particular

I understand now why this fix here works for GRUB\_RESCUE=Y

In output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh there is

    local initrd_file=$TMP_DIR/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME
    ...
    local boot_dir="/boot"
    ...
    local boot_initrd_name="rear-$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME"
    ...
    local boot_initrd_file="$boot_dir/$boot_initrd_name"
    .
    .
    .
    cp -af $v $initrd_file $boot_initrd_file || BugError "..."

so this fix here works because $TMP\_DIR/$REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME  
is copied via 'cp -a' so in particular permissions are preserved.

I would care about this, because someone could access the USB in the
time window when it is mounted. Fortunately I believe we mount it under
$TMP\_DIR, which is not world-accessible, right? But there could be some
script that "helpfully" automounts the rescue medium under `/media` or
something.

Regarding `"helpfully" automounts the rescue medium`:

When I plug in my ReaR USB disk I get automatically  
this (on openSUSE Leap 15.5):

    # mount | grep sdb
    /dev/sdb3 on /run/media/johannes/REAR-000 type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,errors=remount-ro,uhelper=udisks2)

    # ls -l /run/media/johannes/REAR-000
    drwx------ 3 root root ... boot
    drwxr-x--- 2 root root ... linux-h9wr
    drwx------ 2 root root ... lost+found
    drwx------ 3 root root ... rear

so no non-root user can access things therein  
and because of

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    ERROR: USB or disk device '/dev/sdb3' is already mounted on '/run/media/johannes/REAR-000'

I must unmount that before I can use it for ReaR.

After unmount  
with

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

I get

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
    ...
    Using build area: /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ
    ...
    Creating tar archive '/var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs/rear/linux-h9wr/20240109.1634/backup.tar.gz'
    ...

    # ls -ld /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ
    drwx------ 4 root root 4096 Jan  9 16:35 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ

    # grep '+ mount ' var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log
    +++ mount -v -o rw,noatime /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs
    +++ mount -v -o rw,noatime /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs
    +++ mount -v -o rw,noatime /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs

so as far as I see normally ReaR mounts below $BUILD\_DIR  
but that depends on how e.g. mount\_url() is called  
where $2 is the mountpoint  
that is I my case

    # grep '+ mount_url ' var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log
    ++ mount_url usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs
    ++ mount_url usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs
    ++ mount_url usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /var/tmp/rear.VPPdGWHa1qLmwvJ/outputfs

but there could be any mountpoint specified and  
there could be also any mount command in the ReaR code  
and actually there are many mount commands in the ReaR code

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge this PR in its current state  
rather soon because it fixes the specific issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3122](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3122)

The generic issue that possibly confidential values  
may leak out via the ReaR recovery system in ReaR's initrd  
will need a lot of time for careful investigation  
which must be done via separated issues and pull requests.
