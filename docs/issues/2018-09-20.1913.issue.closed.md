-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): N/A

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or

-   Description of the issue:

A NETFS+tar backup will be seen as a success even if there was an error.
This typically happens when there is no space left on the target device.

I know about that behaviour and I assume it is intentionally.

In the past I experienced `tar` exit with non-zero exit code  
but the actual issue was unimportant for me so that  
I decided the result was acceptable.

I think if the running `rear` would abort when the backup program  
returns with non-zero exit code it would be too hard.

I think the intended behaviour is to only warn when the backup program  
returns with non-zero exit code so that the user is informed  
and can decide if the result is acceptable or not in his case.

FYI regarding `WARNING` messages cf.

@jsmeix We can do better, see \#1914 ;-)

@rmetrich  
thanks you for your explanation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1914\#issue-216908023](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1914#issue-216908023)  
which means the issue is a real bug (wrong exit code is used).

@rmetrich  
while you are at it ;-)  
you may also have a look how restore with `tar` behaves.

In contrast to `rear mkbackup` that can abort in case of normal errors  
in general `rear recover` should not abort unless there are fatal
errors  
during backup restore.

Reason:  
The user cannot do much during `rear recover`  
when there are normal errors during backup restore  
so that it is better to only warn about such errors  
but let the user nevertheless continue recovery.  
Ideally via a user dialog so that the user can decide.  
Perhaps the errors during backup restore are acceptable for now  
and can be relatively easily fixed later in the rebooted recreated
system.

merged  
this issue should be fixed.
