@mutax reported this on \#rear.

We use `grep -P` in about 4 different places and Hardy does not have a
`grep` with `-P/--perl-regexp` compiled in.

A valid question is whether we want to support Hardy (Ubuntu LTS 8.04)
at this time, even @mutax was not expecting us to support this. If we
decide not to support Hardy, at least this issue serves as a reminder of
that decision ;-)

Ubuntu LTS 8.04 is support for servers until 2013-04 according to
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu\_(operating\_system)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system))

grep -P is also supported on Open/FreeBSD, so it is wide-spread. I would
add Ubuntu LTS 8.04 to the not-supported list. Or, is there an easy way
to get around the 'grep -P' command?

Some of the grep -P invocation could be rewritten to not use it, but I
don't really see the point. Let's document what is unsupported and why !
