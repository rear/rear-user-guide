-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I could only test that `RESULT_FILES=($LOGFILE)` now works  
    but I could not test guessing bootloader with LUKS encrypted disks  
    because I do not use LUKS.

    Skip LUKS encrypted disks when guessing bootloader (issue 1769)  
    and  
    avoid 'cp' error exit in case of improper RESULT\_FILES member

Furthermore I enhanced the "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1754](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1754)  
so that now it also detects other non-EFI bootloaders  
(in particular also GRUB2).

The basic logic of the code for the "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case is still
wrong, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1754\#issuecomment-383478154](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1754#issuecomment-383478154)

I will do a pull request...
