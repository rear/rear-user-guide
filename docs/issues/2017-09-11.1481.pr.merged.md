This change integrates UEFI tools on demand as determined by
`320_include_uefi_env.sh`.

It avoids replicating UEFI tests already done in
`320_include_uefi_env.sh` and just relies on a correctly set
`$USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` variable. For such variable to be set
correctly, `310_include_uefi_tools.sh` is renamed to
`330_include_uefi_tools.sh`.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS with UEFI. BIOS-only tests outstanding.

Just for my understanding, this PR supersedes
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1477](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1477),
right ?

Yes, it does.

@gozora  
could you merge it if it is also o.k. for you?

I confirm that it fixes \#1478 for me and looks cleaner than anything
else.

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your valuable contribution to ReaR  
that did not only fix a particular issue but also cleaned up  
overcomplicated code which could help a lot if there are  
further issues in this area to get them also properly fixed.
