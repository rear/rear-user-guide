@jsmeix @gozora let us wait on the tests performed by @gozora before
deciding to commit this one

I changed the names to no longer so nice looking  
but (hopefully) technically more correct ones.

Now the following menue entries exist  
(grep for 'Relax and Recover (' in the sources):

<pre>
Relax and Recover (using elilo)
Relax and Recover (using GRUB 2 'linux' and 'initrd')
Relax and Recover (using GRUB 2 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi')
Relax and Recover (using GRUB Legacy)
Relax and Recover (using grub 0.97)
Relax and Recover (using grub 2.0 'linux' and 'initrd')
</pre>

Ugly but hopefully technically correct.

So do we actually support UEFI Secure Boot?

@schlomo @jsmeix Secure boot is the entry using `linuxefi`, but will
some of these entries will not be valid I guess when there is no
executable behind to kick off, or do I misunderstood it?

For me the info from @abbbi in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866\#issuecomment-224563239](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866#issuecomment-224563239)  
was most interesting because it seems to prove that  
sometimes only the GRUB 2 'linux'/'initrd' method works  
and sometimes only the GRUB 2 'linuxefi'/'initrdefi' method works.

Unfortunately @abbi did not mention  
if he uses UEFI with or without Secure Boot.

Because I have currently no idea under what conditions  
which boot method works, I removed words like "UEFI"  
and "Secure Boot" to avoid false expectations and  
used only the technical info what bootloader method  
is used.

In particular I used different texts for each of those  
bootloader methods in rear (according to the comments  
that I found in the sources) so that we could see in  
user issue reports what exact method was used.

@jsmeix has the issue \#866 cleared out regarding this pull request? I'm
a bit lost in the case I'm afraid

@gdha  
no news in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866)  
and currently I don't have the time to dig into it on my own  
to get a better basic understnding of Secure Boot.

Accordingly I set the milestone to any unspecified  
future rear version.

@jsmeix is this pull request still valid?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-08-09 08:28](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/867#issuecomment-238487352):

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/955](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/955)
merged  
this pull request could be obsolete.

But I would like to wait what @abbbi reports  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866)  
if with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/955](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/955)
merged  
really both both GRUB menue entries  
"Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)" and  
"Relax and Recover (Secure Boot)" are working.

As far as I understand what @abbbi wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866\#issuecomment-224563239](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866#issuecomment-224563239)

<pre>
SLES12: (No Secureboot) fails with "can't find command linux"
</pre>

and according to what I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866\#issuecomment-224571520](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866#issuecomment-224571520)  
the current naming  
"Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)" and  
"Relax and Recover (Secure Boot)"  
seems to be not really correct as far as I understand it  
because  
"Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)" does

<pre>
linux /isolinux/kernel ...
initrd /isolinux/initrd.cgz
</pre>

and  
"Relax and Recover (Secure Boot)" does

<pre>
linuxefi /isolinux/kernel ...
initrdefi /isolinux/initrd.cgz
</pre>

i.e. different GRUB commands are called  
and those GRUB commands linux/initrd versus  
linuxefi/initrdefi differ regarding whether or not (U)EFI  
is used and not whether or not Secure Boot is used  
so that - as far as I understand it - my proposal to  
rename those GRUB menue entries into  
"Relax and Recover (using GRUB 2 'linux' and 'initrd')" and  
"Relax and Recover (using GRUB 2 'linuxefi' and 'initrdefi')"  
is still valid from my point of view.

Bottom line:  
As long as it is not clear that the GRUB commands  
linux/initrd match exactly "no Secure Boot" and  
linuxefi/initrdefi match exactly "Secure Boot"  
the current GRUB menue entries names  
"Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)" and  
"Relax and Recover (Secure Boot)"  
should be replaced by correct names.

According to what @gozora explained in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866\#issuecomment-238493050](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/866#issuecomment-238493050)  
it now seems that the current GRUB menue entries names  
"Relax and Recover (no Secure Boot)" and  
"Relax and Recover (Secure Boot)" are the right ones  
so that this pull request is obsolete.
