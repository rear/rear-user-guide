ReaR Snapshot build from today (and now it pains that we don't have the
exact git revision in the RPM :-() on CentOS 7.3

The recovery disk has a different size from the source disk.

Interestingly this version did not ask me to map a disk while our last
release (2.00) does ask me to map a disk (which I find stupid since
there is only once in any case).

Am I the only one who sees this?

@schabrolles can this be caused by
dd65bd00e94f015b5ed81729568eef880e99ad5f? You seem to be the only author
of any change in 300\_map\_disks.sh recently.

Test case is the recovery of the client VM from our
[rear-workshop](https://github.com/rear/rear-workshop). To test for
yourself follow the instructions there to build the server and client
VM, go to the client, install `rear-workshop`, install the latest
Snapshot RPM, do
`cd /etc/rear ; cp workshop/local-with-nfs.conf local.conf` and run
`rear -v mkbackup`. Then start the recovery with `vagrant up recover`.

@schlomo Looks strange ... At a very quick look .... I think it is not
related to my change (I just add multipath device to be proposed like a
disk); but who know :) ....

I'm gonna try to run your rear-workshop later today and have look

@schlomo I quickly try `rear-workshop`, but it seems Vagrant use my KVM
instead of Box to deploy centos\_client ....  
But I got an Error when deploying centos-server from `bento/centos-7.3`
(which seems to be a box VM which could explain why it failed).

Do you know how to force / configure vagrant to use box ?

@schlomo Ok I've found it ... `vagrant up --provider virtualbox` ...

Now I got a network problem (or a conflict with my virtualbox
configuration)

@schlomo There is a Typo in

There is a space before disk `" ^disk` (line 112).

does it work for you when you manually do the change in

Haven't had the time to try again, but the fix seems very much
legitimate to me. In any case I don't see any reason why the blank could
be correct there so that that fix is for sure an improvement.
