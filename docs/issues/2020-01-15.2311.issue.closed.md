-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I have in /etc/rear/local.conf

    LogPrintError "local.conf gets actually sourced"

and with that e.g. `rear -s mkrescue` results

    # usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue | head -n20
    Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git
    Running rear mkrescue (PID 27286)
    Using log file: /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-g243.log
    Simulation mode activated, Relax-and-Recover base directory: /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear
    Source conf/Linux-i386.conf
    Source conf/GNU/Linux.conf
    Source conf/SUSE_LINUX.conf
    local.conf gets actually sourced
    Source init/default/005_verify_os_conf.sh
    ...

The reason is in the `Source` function

        # Clip leading standard path to rear files (usually /usr/share/rear/):
        local relname="${source_file##$SHARE_DIR/}"
        # Simulate sourcing the scripts in $SHARE_DIR
        if test "$SIMULATE" && expr "$source_file" : "$SHARE_DIR" >/dev/null; then
            LogPrint "Source $relname"
            return
        fi

so simulation mode applies only for scripts in /usr/share/rear/  
but files in other directories get actually sourced i.e. executed.

The bug is that  
on the one hand it is perfectly o.k. when the user runs commands  
in his config files as needed e.g. to set specific config variables  
depending on certain conditions or even to do some needed things  
before the actual ReaR scripts are run so that his commands  
could actually change something in his running system  
but on the other hand simulation mode should neven ever  
change something in the user's running system.

The explicit condition `expr "$source_file" : "$SHARE_DIR"`  
indicates there is a reason why simulation mode applies  
only for scripts in /usr/share/rear/ but - as usual - there  
is no comment that tells about that reason.  
That condition originates from the very beginning of Git history

@schlomo @gdha  
do you perhaps know a reason why simulation mode  
applies only for scripts in /usr/share/rear/  
but not for other sourced files like config files?

@jsmeix Well, Sclomo and I considered the config files as configuration
only in 2006 , and we never thought that these files could contain lines
of codes that were meant for execution (even as they are treated as bash
files).  
Of course, times changes lots of things and the scope of ReaR became
much wider.  
It is not a bug, but rather a design flaw ;-) I would say.

@gdha  
thank you for the information.

I think I will meditate on it ;-)  
and try if I can improve how things behave  
as far as possible with reasonable effort  
which could mean in the end only some additional  
comment that describes the potential issue  
in our default etc/rear/local.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)

As a first step I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6207d1f024f601eae2bc4fb092d17e265cb80d93](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6207d1f024f601eae2bc4fb092d17e265cb80d93)  
so things are now at least documented.

Perhaps I can further improve how things behave  
but that happens later as time permits.

Usually commands that are run in config files  
should not actually change (i.e. write) something on the system.  
Instead such commands should normally only read something  
on the system to set set different configuration values depending  
on certain conditions (e.g. values of the enviroment where rear runs)  
as needed by the user's particular case.

I consider it sufficiently "fixed" (i.e. only documented) by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6207d1f024f601eae2bc4fb092d17e265cb80d93](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6207d1f024f601eae2bc4fb092d17e265cb80d93)
