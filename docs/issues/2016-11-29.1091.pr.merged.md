Now there is a new restoreonly workflow  
that is a part of the (unchanged) recover workflow  
namely the part that does only restore a backup,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987)  
which is a prerequirement for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088)  
"support multiple backups".

If there are no furious objections I will merge it soon.

I tested that usual "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover"  
still work (at least for me).

@jsmeix only merge it when you are 100% sure it won't break the
**recover** workflow.

There are two additional other workflows that are  
other parts of the (unchanged) recover workflow:  
layoutonly: recreate only the disk layout  
finalizeonly: only finalize the recovery

For me 'layoutonly' followed by 'restoreonly' seemd to work  
but the final 'finalizeonly' failed to install the bootloader.  
I.e. currently the recover workflow is not yet correctly  
split into separated sub-workflows.

What works for me is 'recover' which restores an initial  
backup of the basic system and installs the bootloader  
followed by 'restoreonly' that restores an additional backup.

One must use the new '-C' option to specify the right  
config files for 'recover' versus 'restoreonly'.

Here an example that had worked for me:

<pre>

@gdha  
I cannot be 100% sure because I cannot test all and everything.

I really tried hard to implement all in an only-additional way  
(i.e. without changing any current behaviour).

But I am not a 100% perfect machine ;-)

@jsmeix sure understood (nobody is prefect ;)  
Do I understand it correctly that the *restoreonly* is only useful when
we had a previous *mkbackuponly*?

Normally one or more restoreonly would match  
one or more previous mkbackuponly when it is used  
as I did above (i.e. for multiple backups).

But I intend that restoreonly should also be useful  
when it is used as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987)  
i.e. to recover a system from soft errors  
(like deleting all of /lib/) or in general when  
the disk layout is not damaged but one cannot  
restore the backup from within the running system.

The current restoreonly workflow does not yet work  
for the usecase as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987)  
because currently there is nothing mounted  
at /mnt/local.  
With manual mounting the right stuff at /mnt/local before  
the restoreonly workflow seems to work for me:

<pre>
f231:~ # rm -rf /lib*

f231:~ # cat /etc/rear/local.conf
-bash: /usr/bin/cat: No such file or directory

f231:~ # reboot
-bash: /sbin/reboot: No such file or directory

f231:~ # init 6
-bash: /sbin/init: No such file or directory

I did a hard power off switch and
booted the local "Relax-and-Recover" GRUB entry
then in the recovery system I did:

RESCUE f231:~ # mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/local
RESCUE f231:~ # 
RESCUE f231:~ # mount | grep sd
/dev/sda2 on /mnt/local type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Slept over it for one night,  
still no dark foreboding,  
I think I merge it today.

Of course its current state is only an initial step  
but I think it is a first step into the right direction  
that should be in GitHub master code so that also  
others can easily try it out and report shortcomings  
or even regressions that I overlooked so that I could  
get things fixed before the official ReaR 2.0 release.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091\#issuecomment-263638707](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091#issuecomment-263638707)

The current restoreonly workflow implements  
only what its name tells (strictly speaking):  
Currently it only restores - nothing more.

I.e. the current restoreonly workflow does not implement  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987)
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987\#issue-173428037](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987#issue-173428037)

<pre>
What is needed to recover from such soft errors is
to get the tree of filesystems mounted at /mnt/local
and then restore the backup therein.
</pre>

The "get the tree of filesystems mounted at /mnt/local" part  
is currently missing - and as far as I see - that part will get  
really complicated.

Reason:

Currently - as far as I know - mounting the tree of filesystems  
at /mnt/local happens somewhat intermixed with recreating  
the layout which is - as far as I see - basically a broken design  
in the current "rear recover" implementation.

As far as I know the current "rear recover" implementation  
works disk-device by disk-device and for each one it does  
partitioning, making filesystem(s), and mounting it/them.

As far as I can imagine this way leads to (currently unsolvable)  
issues with "interwoven mounts", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/548965e045ac33c8aa02d5d284d590e7c0846ac9](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/548965e045ac33c8aa02d5d284d590e7c0846ac9)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497\#issuecomment-67485838](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497#issuecomment-67485838)  
and  
[https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=908854\#c3](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908854#c3)

A clean design would split the recreating layout part into  
separated sub-parts and it would do each sub-part for  
all used device nodes and/or filesystem-like thingies:

1.  

Clean up all used disk devices  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)

1.  

Create lower level block devices (i.e. partitions)  
on all used disk devices (i.e. run parted)

1.  

Create higher level block devices (e.g. LVM)

1.  

Create filesystems on the right block devices  
(i.e. run mkfs.\*)

1.  

Create btrfs subvolumes (if needed)

1.  

Mounting of filesystems and/or btrfs subvolumes  
to create the target tree of filesystem-like thingies  
below /mnt/local
