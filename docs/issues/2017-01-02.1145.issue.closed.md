Neither BACKUP\_TYPE 'incremental' nor 'differential'  
works with BACKUP\_URL=usb:///...  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1141\#issuecomment-269963775](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1141#issuecomment-269963775)

Up to ReaR 2.0  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///... only works  
with 'nomal' BACKUP\_TYPE="".

@jsmeix By now you know my point of view - do not make of ReaR a backup
tool which must support incremental backup. And, as USB work-flow use
timestamp directories it would be hard to implement.

I completely agree with your point of view.

I only thought that when ReaR has support for  
incremental/differential backup, then it should  
work as far as possible with reasonable effort.

Personally I would prefer ReaR has only basic  
backup support by its internal backup methods  
and leave all advanced backup functionality  
to external backup solutions.

If my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1146](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1146)  
is o.k. for you we can leave it at this state  
also for future ReaR versions.

Perhaps it is possible with low effort to make  
BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential  
also work for BACKUP\_URL=usb:

My (currently totally untested) basic idea behind is  
that the timestamp directories that are used for  
BACKUP\_URL=usb implement basically the same  
behaviour as NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY  
so that perhaps it is possible with low effort to use a  
single static directory also for BACKUP\_URL=usb  
in case of BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential.

See conf/default.conf why there is no need for
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY  
together with incremental or differential backup  
so that I guess there is perhaps also no need for  
timestamp directories for BACKUP\_URL=usb  
together with incremental or differential backup.

FYI:  
Personally I am not so happy that ReaR supports advanced  
backup features like BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential  
but as it is already there I like to get it working well as far as  
possible with reasonable effort.

As expected as side-effect of implementing  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160)  
I made BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential  
also work for BACKUP\_URL=usb  
with the following code hack in addition to the  
hacks that I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160\#issuecomment-272119383](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160#issuecomment-272119383)

Additional code change  
(I run it in a current GitHub master code clone):

<pre>
# git diff usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh
...
@@ -55,7 +55,7 @@
...
-    Error "BACKUP_TYPE incremental or differential does not work with BACKUP_URL=usb:///..."
+    LogPrint "Note: BACKUP_TYPE incremental or differential needs special setup for BACKUP_URL=usb:///..."
...
</pre>

Used config  
(no multiple backups for BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential)

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/incrementalbackups"
USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=999
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS=7
FULLBACKUPDAY=Thu
</pre>

First I run "usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup"  
to get an initial full backup of today.

Afterwards I change the config to

<pre>
FULLBACKUPDAY=Wed
</pre>

to get incremental backups.

I made two subsequent incremental backups  
(I run it in a current GitHub master code clone):

<pre>
# echo testy1 >/testy1

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup

# echo testy2 >/testy2

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

On the REAR-000 medium I get (excerpt)

<pre>
rear/e205/incrementalbackups
rear/e205/incrementalbackups/kernel
rear/e205/incrementalbackups/rear-e205.log

rear/e205/incrementalbackups/backup.log
rear/e205/incrementalbackups/2017-01-12-1114-I.tar.gz
</pre>

and for me "rear recover" works well with that.

@dwerner1  
please test how far my above described changes also make  
it work for your particular use case and provide feedback here  
what goes wrong and/or what is missing for your use case.

When doing rear -d -D mkbackup with local.conf like

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"
    USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=999
    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=5
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-DATA
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/tmp/*' '/temp' '/dev/shm/*' '/mnt/*' )
    BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
    FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS=7
    FULLBACKUPDAY=Thu

.. I end up with

`ERROR: BACKUP_TYPE incremental or differential does not work with BACKUP_URL=usb:///...`

Here are some lines from the log file

    ++ test incremental = incremental -o differential = incremental
    ++ set -e -u -o pipefail

Additionally you need to use the change mentioned by me in

OK, that worked out. I made one full and two incremental backups, just
the menu labels look like you described in \#1160

That's a really nice state out of my view! Many thanks @jsmeix !

@dwerner1  
many thanks for your prompt tests even with my current hacks.

I will sleep over it so that tomorrow I have hopefully good idea  
how I can implement it in a backward compatible way...
