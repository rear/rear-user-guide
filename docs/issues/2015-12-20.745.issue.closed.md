usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/33\_find\_isolinux.sh is a symlink to
ISO

Why do we need this?

@schlomo `33_find_isolinux.sh` sets the `ISO_ISOLINUX_BIN` variable
(this was there from the beginning). However, since the packages were
split up some modules were moved to their own sub-directory, and
therefore, the script `35_find_syslinux_modules.sh` was introduced to
fix this. So, script `33_find_isolinux.sh` is purely there for legacy
purposes.

I am not sure I understand what you mean by "legacy purposes".

Can we remove this script to allow USB mode usage without installing
isolinux (I know, we install it by default)?

@schlomo It seems we only need:

    # Define the syslinux directory for later usage
    SYSLINUX_DIR=$(dirname $ISO_ISOLINUX_BIN)

Perhaps, it would be better to create a new script called
`30_find_syslinux.sh` and remove the link to `33_find_isolinux.sh`
(would make more sense I guess). Your thoughts?

@schlomo Just verified it with `OUTPUT=ISO` and `BACKUP_URL=usb:///...`
then the `SYSLINUX_DIR` is used in fact (and needed). With `OUTPUT=USB`
the `SYSLINUX_DIR` is not used.  
I would leave the link so that we don't break the ISO rescue image flow
in combination with USB as backup destination.

@gdha Not sure I follow your thoughts. With OUTPUT=ISO IMHO prep/USB
should not be called at all. So removing something from prep/USB should
not have any impact for OUTPUT=ISO but only for OUTPUT=USB.

Or do we have some auto magic stuff in place that would call prep/USB if
BACKUP\_URL=usb://\*?

@schlomo I removed the link and it found no negative drawback in
OUTPUT=USB nor OUTPUT=ISO. Therefore, we can remove the link. If we get
complaints in the future then we should remember this issue somehow.

Thanks a lot!
