Hi guys, as discussed in Issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/655](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/655)
I created a workaround for me to add the teaming function easily to
rear. I changed the routing script so that no routing of teaming
interfaces will be done within and created a new script 36\_teaming
which handles everything about the teaming function. Because teaming
runs in user space we would need more than just the kernel and the
driver (e.g. daemons and tools). Because of this I simplified the
function that all ip-addresses and routing-entries of a
teaming-interface will be attached to its first available teaming-member
(output by teamdctl).

Tested with RHEL 7.1, latest. Also single interfaces and bonding
interfaces were working after this changes.

Maybe it is something to add to rear, because from my point of view
teaming will become more popular and important in the future.

Thanks for your great work!

Cheers üç∫
