=========================================================================================

HI.  
I cannot seem to find the correct syntax for my local.conf for what I
want to do. I'm not sure which of the EXCLUDE\_\*\*\* variables to use
and how to craft the syntax.  
What I would like to do is specify what LVM volume groups to have their
data backed up and which ones not to have their data backed up.  
But at the same time have Rear backup "ALL" the LVM configuration so
that when I restore the system the /boot and root file systems are
recreated (so the system can boot) and as well restore "ALL" the LVM's
so that I can restore their data from tape. (this last step being
outside of Rear).  
My local.conf file is:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="nfs://10.10.10.10/admin/rear/"  
EXCLUDE\_BACKUP=( "/opt/stage" )  
AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=n  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=1

Using the examples that I can fine, I crafted the EXCLUDE\_BACKUP seen
above, but when I do a rear -v mkbackup it still backs up that file
system and the data within.  
I'm trying to exclude backing up the data of a few file systems, but I
cannot get even one to be exclude.  
Can someone help please.  
Thank you.  
Gary
