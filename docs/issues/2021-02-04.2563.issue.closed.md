#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    CentOS 7.8

-   Rear local.conf  
    OUTPUT=iso  
    BACKUP=netfs  
    BACKUP\_URL=usb://dev/disk/by-lavel/REAR-000  
    MODULES=( {$MODULES\[@\]} 'zfs')

I didn't fill out the rest of the support template, but if I missed
something important, I apologize.  
I have a ZFS pool (not root partition) mounted on /project along with
several ZFS filesystems.

rear backs these up seemingly fine, considering it's just doing a system
wide tar archive.  
But, I am having trouble restoring.

I am following these steps:

1.  Boot recovery media
2.  export MIGRATION\_MODE='true'
3.  rear -D recover
4.  confirm and accept disk map
5.  conform and accept disk layout
6.  pop into shell
7.  recreate pool, filesystems.
8.  leave shell, and confirm/run disk scripts.
9.  pop into a shell again.
10. I can confirm ZFS is mounted on /project and my target disks are
    located on /mnt/local  
    ZFS pools can't be mounted anywhere. They have to be mounted where
    they are going to go, and stay there.  
    So I create a symbolic link /project /mnt/local/project
11. exit shell, and continue recovery.

When the recovery is complete I see the synbolic link I created is gone
and /mnt/local/project is a directory with my files in it.

I'm so close. Can anyone offer an alternative restore process that might
work?

Just wanted to hit this again and see if there are any suggestions to
rear overwriting a symbolic link on recovery.

Okay, I've figured out how to accomplish this during a recovery.

After the disk confirm script, everything will be mounted on /mnt/local

Get into a rear shell and create the ZFS pools and filesystems.  
Then set the ZFS mount point like so:  
zfs set mountpoint=/mnt/local/zpool/fs zpool/fs

When you restore, they will go to the correct place.  
When done, set the mountpoint back to the default:  
zfs set mountpoint=/zpool/fs zpool/fs

@jagauthier  
thank you for your report how one could restore a ZFS pool  
with some manual intervention.

I don't use ZFS and I know nothing about ZFS pool  
so I cannot make any actually helpful comment here.  
As far as I see there is currently no support for ZFS in ReaR because

    user:~/rear.github.master # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -i 'zfs'

outputs nothing.

@jsmeix Do you know if there will be ZFS support later on?  
Or an alternative way to implement it?

I cannot speak for other ReaR developers.  
Personally I have no plans to implement ZFS support in ReaR  
because I never used ZFS and I have no plans to use it and  
ZFS is not part of openSUSE or SUSE Linux Enterprise products.

The normal way how something gets implemented for free software is  
that users who need a particular additional functionality implement it  
and contribute their code to the free software project.  
Usually a particular additional functionality is first implemented
only  
in a basic and specific way how those users need it for their use
case.  
Because it is free software other users with other use cases can then  
further enhance that functionality step by step as needed.

See  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and the sections  
"How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover" and  
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In general how to start with adding support for another filesystem in
ReaR:

To get an idea what scripts in ReaR contain code that belongs to
filesystem support  
search the ReaR scripts for existing filesystems like

    ~/rear.github.master # find usr/share/rear/ -type f -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -li 'ext[234]'
    usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh
    usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200_check_usb_layout.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/131_include_filesystem_code.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133_include_mount_filesystem_code.sh

    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/135_include_btrfs_subvolumes_generic_code.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133_include_mount_filesystem_code.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500_compare_layout.sh

    usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/filesystems-functions.sh

Inspect the code in those scripts to get an overview  
how filesystem support is usually implemented in ReaR.

The main scripts where filesystem support is implemented in ReaR are

    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/131_include_filesystem_code.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh
