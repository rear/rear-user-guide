See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1085](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1085)

For me BACKUP=ZYPPER works in a very initial basic way  
on my SLES12 test system with only one system partition  
with ext4 (and one swap partition) with this local.conf:

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=ZYPPER
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

Currently the new created system boots  
and the login screen shows up but  
currently one cannot log in because  
no root pasword is set which is the  
next thing I will implement.

Nevertheless the current state looks so promising to me  
that I like to merge it into the ReaR master code because  
I think I can make it work sufficiently well.

If there are no objections I like to merge it on Monday.

@jsmeix no problem for me - I trust you enough ;-)  
However, could you explain in a one-liner what makes **BACKUP=ZYPPER**
so different from e.g. **BACKUP=NETFS** ?

I can explain but never ever in a one-liner  
except this one-line is sufficient for you:

<pre>
BACKUP=ZYPPER is totally different compared to e.g. BACKUP=NETFS
</pre>

;-)

Seriously:  
When BACKUP=ZYPPER works sufficiently well  
I will make explanatory documentation, same way  
as I did for the "multiple backup methods".

For today:  
Have a nice weekend!

Meanwhile for me BACKUP=ZYPPER works in a basic way  
on my SLES12 test system with only one system partition  
with ext4 (and one swap partition) with this local.conf:

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=ZYPPER
ZYPPER_REPOSITORIES=( "cd:///?devices=/dev/disk/by-label/SLE-12-SP2-Server-DVD-x86_642192" )
ZYPPER_INSTALL_RPMS="independent_RPMs"
ZYPPER_ROOT_PASSWORD=""
ZYPPER_NETWORK_SETUP_COMMANDS=( 'YAST' 'systemctl enable sshd.service' )
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

Currently there are lots of rough edges so that BACKUP=ZYPPER  
will not yet be officially announced but for interested users  
with a SUSE system (preferably SLES12 what I use)  
the ZYPPER\_\* variables are described in default.conf.

@gdha  
over the weekend I even found an almost-one-liner for you:

<pre>
BACKUP=ZYPPER results a pristine "raw" system
(with default config files from the RPM packages)
that must be configured as needed.
</pre>

cf.  
"Generic system installation with the plain SUSE installation system"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

This is why there are the scripts  
restore/ZYPPER/default/940\_generate\_fstab.sh  
restore/ZYPPER/default/950\_grub2\_mkconfig.sh  
restore/ZYPPER/default/970\_set\_root\_password.sh  
restore/ZYPPER/default/980\_initial\_network\_setup.sh
