When it fails during 900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh  
(that is run during 'rear recover' after the backup was restorted)  
with

    choot: failed to run command '/bin/bash' : No such file or directory

what actually happens is that  
'chroot $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT' fails with '/bin/bash No such file or
directory'.  
which means:

After restore of the backup 'chroot $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT'  
is not possible which indicates that the backup restore  
was not correct (probably mandatory files are missing).

During 'rear recover' the backup restore happens from  
within the running ReaR recovery system into TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
and TARGET\_FS\_ROOT is /mnt/local.

This looks as if no '/bin/bash' was restored which would mean  
your backup restore did not work - perhaps even because  
there is no '/bin/bash' in your backup?

Check what files are in your backup and inspect your  
backup log that was created when you did "rear mkbackup" and  
your backup restore log that was created during "rear recover".

In general regarding ReaR versus backup see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

For a more detailed analysis of issues see the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
what information and files are needed when 'rear recover' failed  
so that others (i.e. we at ReaR upstream) could do a more detailed
analysis.

@richardwheatley87  
in general regarding `BACKUP=NSR`:

I am not a EMC NetWorker (or Legato NetWorker) user  
so that I cannot reproduce anything or even fix anything  
that is specific regarding `BACKUP=NSR`.

In particular I do not have any proprietary third-party backup tool.

In general I do not use any of the third-party backup tools  
so that in general I can neither reproduce any issue nor fix  
or enhance things that are related to third-party backup tools.

When you have a Red Hat support contract, perhaps they could help?

Thank you for your prompt reply.  
I shall read suggested information on disaster recovery, look at my EMC
NetWorker backup configuration and check the logs (both ReaR and NSR)
for info on any failures that occured during the NSR restore phase.

@richardwheatley87 Any update you want to share about the research you
did?

Not yet, I have not had time to progress further. Since the problem
appears to be that the backup has not been restored, I will change the
`NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME=Default` in the site.config file to be the actual
EMC NetWorker pool where my machine backup is stored then re-create the
rescue ISO, using `rear mkrescue`. I thought that the NSR agent on the
machine would know which pool get the backup from.  
Thank you for your interest, I will add an update once I have tried this
and have more information.
