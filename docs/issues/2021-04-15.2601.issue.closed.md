-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hello, I'm trying to setup a fully automated/unattended
recovery/migration to a another bare metal server (thus, with different
mac addresses) from ReaR USB. But before "rear recover" can start, the
process stops and asks the following:

    The original network interface eno1 <old-mac-address> is not available
    1) eno1 <new-mac-address-1> igb
    2) eno2 <new-mac-address-2> igb
    3) Skip replacing eno1 <old-mac-address>
    Choose replacement for eno1 <old-mac-address>

I would like the first answer to always be chosen and never needing user
interaction.  
I have tried configurations with this line:  
`KERNEL_CMDLINE="netdev=eno1"`  
and this line:  
`KERNEL_CMDLINE="net.ifnames=0 netdev=eth0"`  
but, even though in the second case, the net.ifnames is correctly taken
into account since the prompt displays eth0 instead of eno1, I am still
prompted to manually select a network interface.  
How to automatically choose the first available network interface?

-   Workaround, if any:

None

I think `USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT` won't help because the code  
that asks for the right network interface is in  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh)

    echo "The original network interface $old_dev $old_mac is not available"
    PS3="Choose replacement for $old_dev $old_mac "
    skip_choice="Skip replacing $old_dev $old_mac"
    select choice in "${NEW_DEVICES[@]}" "$skip_choice" ; do

and `select` does not have a timeout or so.

@3id0  
attach your "rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup" debug log file cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
so we could see what goes on on your system.

Here you go.  
I hope I'm not publishing anything important in this log -\_-'

[rear.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6367471/rear-linuxhost17.log)

By the way, is there a best pratice for doing a fully
automated/unattended restore with borg via ssh without leaving an
unprotected private key everywhere? (current host, rescue image, next
host...)  
I've used the [restrict directive for
ssh](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/serve.html#examples)
but still it feels weird leaving this key everywhere without password.

EDIT: Oh yes, and adding the USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT=3 did not prevent the
interface prompt to interrupt the unatteded recovery.

When I run "rear -D mkrescue" with this etc/rear/local.conf (excerpts)

    OUTPUT=ISO
    KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" qqqqkey=qqqqvalue"

I get in var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log (excerpts)

    ++ echo 'append initrd=initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw  selinux=0 qqqqkey=qqqqvalue auto_recover '

@3id0  
in contrast in your case I don't see how your KERNEL\_CMDLINE is ever  
added to the bootloader of the bootable medium via `OUTPUT=USB` because
your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6367471/rear-linuxhost17.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6367471/rear-linuxhost17.log)  
only contains (excerpts)

    + source /usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/400_use_serial_console.sh
    ...
    ... Modified kernel commandline to: 'netdev=eno1 console=ttyS0,9600 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0'
    ...

In current ReaR code KERNEL\_CMDLINE is only used in the following `USB`
scripts:

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh

where usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh is
actually run  
and usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh is
basically skipped  
because USB should not do UEFI boot but only traditional BIOS boot.

In usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE is in those lines

        append initrd=/$USB_PREFIX/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw $KERNEL_CMDLINE
        append initrd=/$USB_PREFIX/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw $KERNEL_CMDLINE auto_recover

but currently I don't understand what actually happens while  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
is running from what I see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6367471/rear-linuxhost17.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6367471/rear-linuxhost17.log)

That obfuscated ReaR USB code always drives me nuts...

Is there anything I can do to get you a better log of the "syslinux.cfg"
step?  
Though if I remember correctly, on the ReaR USB boot menu, I once tried
editing the boot options and I could see netdev=eno1 in there along with
the other options.

I tested KERNEL\_CMDLINE+="..." with OUTPUT=USB  
on a USB disk that is connected as /dev/sdb  
to my homeoffice laptop with hostname linux-h9wr  
with the following settings in etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_SUFFIX="ReaRtestBackup2"
    KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" QQQQQQ=qqqqqq"

I am used to use USB\_SUFFIX because I prefer to have things stored on
USB  
in the same way as via NFS, see the comment about USB\_SUFFIX in
default.conf  
but that should not make a real difference regarding kernel command line
options.

I got the kernel command line option added to the bootloader config on
the USB:

    # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

    # find /mnt -type f -name 'syslinux.cfg' | xargs grep QQQQQQ
    /mnt/rear/linux-h9wr/ReaRtestBackup2/syslinux.cfg:
        append initrd=/rear/linux-h9wr/ReaRtestBackup2/initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw  selinux=0 QQQQQQ=qqqqqq
    /mnt/rear/linux-h9wr/ReaRtestBackup2/syslinux.cfg:
        append initrd=/rear/linux-h9wr/ReaRtestBackup2/initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw  selinux=0 QQQQQQ=qqqqqq auto_recover

The rear/linux-h9wr/ReaRtestBackup2/syslinux.cfg  
contents get included by the rear/syslinux.cfg file via

    # less /mnt/rear/syslinux.cfg
    ...
        include /rear/linux-h9wr/ReaRtestBackup2/syslinux.cfg
    ...

so that the additional kernel command line option should be passed to
the kernel  
when booting the ReaR recovery system from that USB disk but I did not
test it  
because I won't boot my homeoffice laptop now from USB (I need it to
work on it).

@3id0  
to verify whether or not your additional kernel command line option  
was actually passed to the kernel of your ReaR recovery system  
boot your ReaR recovery system, log in as root, and check the output  
of `cat /proc/cmdline` and the output of `dmesg` if that kernel
command  
line option is shown.

    # cat /proc/cmdline
    BOOT_IMAGE=/rear/linuxhost17/20210429.1535/kernel initrd=/rear/linuxhost17/20210429.1535/initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw netdev=eno1 console=ttyS0,9600

So yes, netdev option is indeed passed to the kernel of the recovery
system.  
(Copied from a picture, please forgive the typos if any.)  
What's next?

@3id0  
So your additional kernel command line option does not result  
what you expect it to result so the root cause seems to be now  
that something while starting up the ReaR recovery system  
even with that kernel command line option does not result  
the ReaR recovery system networking setup as you want it to be.

In general reegarding ReaR recovery system networking setup we have  
the special `ip= nm= netdev= gw=` kernel command line options, see the
section  
"RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS" in `man rear`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and we also have NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
see its description in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

Perhaps those could help you to get the ReaR recovery system  
networking setup as you want it to be in your particular case?

But I fear those won't help because I fear the recovery system setup
script  
etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
which shows the `The original network interface ... is not available`
input prompt  
runs before the other setup scripts that do the actual networking setup.

I don't remember where I found out about KERNEL\_CMDLINE but I'm pretty
sure there were no mention of the "unattended" option...  
I just tried `KERNEL_CMDLINE="netdev=eno1 unattended"` after checking
your links and it works ! (no prompt about the network interface)  
Thanks a lot @jsmeix !

@3id0  
thank you for your feedback what helped in your case!

The \`KERNEL\_CMDLINE="... unattended" points to  
this code in system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh

    if unattended_recovery ; then
        # we gonna cheat a bit and say we have map made (but we did not and just hope that the interfaces
        # will be in the same order on the recover vm as on the client vm)
        # For some background info see https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/36
        test $MANUAL_MAC_MAPPING || MANUAL_MAC_MAPPING=unattended
    fi

and - voila! - the right ReaR upstream issue was finally found  
[https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/36](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/36)  
that shows more background information and details behind.

It's too bad the line "the original network interface \[...\] is not
available" in [issue
\#36](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/36) was in
another repo *and* in a picture (not in text) because I searched for
this specific string both in the issues of the rear repo and in
DuckDuckGo before posting. If I had found out about issue \#36 this
would have saved all of us a lot of time ^^' well I did learn a lot
about the internals of ReaR along the way so it's not time completely
wasted for me at least. And I guess the next person who searches this
string in a search engine should find this issue.

A suggestion:  
I looked around and I'm pretty sure I read about KERNEL\_CMDLINE in
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L91)
And, as you can see, in this file there is no mention of `unattended` or
`netdev` options, these are only mentionned in the
[manpage](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc#rescue-image-kernel-command-line-options).  
So, I would suggest copying the RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
part from the manpage to default.conf for better documentation (or at
least mentioning this section of the manpage in default.conf).

@3id0  
you are welcome!

FYI  
what I basically always do to get an idea how things are in ReaR  
when I have only some ReaR string as entry point is

    # cd usr/share/rear/

    # find . -type f | xargs grep '<some_ReaR_string>'

and then I inspect the found code parts.

I wonder if we may also need similar (or perhaps even same) code in

for the `automatic_recovery` case  
(i.e. when kernel command line contains `automatic` or `auto_recover`)  
as we already have there for the `unattended_recovery` case  
(i.e. when kernel command line contains `unattended`)
