Trying rear starting a 1.16 on a HP DL360 Gen9 with SLES12 in UEFI mode.

Tried intermediate versions until rear-1.17.0-3.git201505131802.noarch.

Doing an nfs backup fails showing a problem with options for mkisofs:

    Message: Could not create ISO image (with /usr/bin/mkisofs)

Looking at
`/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/82_create_iso_image.sh`:

      1 Log "Starting '$ISO_MKISOFS_BIN'"
      2 LogPrint "Making ISO image"
      3 
      4 if (( USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER )) ; then
      5     # initialized with 1
      6     EFIBOOT="-eltorito-alt-boot -e boot/efiboot.img -no-emul-boot"
      7     Log "Including ISO UEFI boot (as triggered by USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1)"
      8 else
      9    EFIBOOT=""
     10 fi

This suggests that line 6 is incorrect. I'm not sure what the
`-e boot/efiboot.img` is trying to do but -exclude-list seems
appropriate.

However, just changing that isn't enough. After changing -e to
-exclude-list I get:

SLES12 delivers:

    rpm -qf `which mkisofs`
    cdrkit-cdrtools-compat-1.1.11-19.46.x86_64

I'm willing to test, but not sure at this point what to try.

In fact this is *not* a bug in rear, but with *genisoimage* in SLES -
see issues \#214, \#229 and \#585.  
I never understood why SuSe did not update genisoimage package...  
An alternative for UEFI ISO booting on SLES could be using USB or PXE,
but unfortunately both methods are not (yet) UEFI proof.

@rbeldin You could open a bugzilla record with SuSe to ask them polite
to update this package with the `-e` option included (it already exists,
but not sure who build it?).

I'm happy to do that. What is the meaning of the '-e' option? That
might  
be helpful to nudge this in the right direction.

@rbeldin Perhaps read first issue \#214 which in fact the same (you
could reference to it). Too many SuSe customers are infected by this
**genisoimage -efi-boot option missing** problem and it will become a
blocker as EFI booting will become a must with newer generation HW.

Hi...

[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=811636](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=811636)

notes at the end:

"The option -eltorito-platform allows to start a new entry in a
Eltorito  
multi boot environment, making this entry of type "efi". The option  
-eltorito-platform takes no parameter. After you specify it, you
continue  
with the standard Eltorito boot options.

The shell script mentioned in this bug calls "mkisofs" under this name  
but expects behavior that is only available from a patched
genisoimage.  
To fix the problem, you need to do more than just to replace option
names."

Is it possible that the problem is caused by expectation of behavior
that  
is no longer standard?

@rbeldin the problem is that `genisoimage` does not have the option
`eltorito-platform` and is therefore, according Mr. Schilling, obsolete.
Suse could make the factory `mkisofs` package available for SLES 11/12
sooner?
