Hi there,

After running a restore test this morning, I noticed the logfile created
by Netbackup is not copied over to the restored partition:

    2014-03-14 11:34:11 Including finalize/NBU/default/99_copy_bplogrestorelog.sh
    cp: missing destination file operand after '/mnt/local/root/'
    Try `cp --help' for more information.
    2014-03-14 11:34:11 Finished running 'finalize' stage in 1 seconds

In the 99\_copy\_bplogrestorelog.sh (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/NBU/default/99\_copy\_bplogrestorelog.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/NBU/default/99_copy_bplogrestorelog.sh)
) I see that it tries to copy bplog.restore.\* - however the logfile
created is named only 'bplog.restore' so it unfortunately does not pick
up the logfile correctly :

    RESCUE LINUXTEST:/tmp # ll
    total 38936
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 39851308 Mar 14 11:34 bplog.restore
