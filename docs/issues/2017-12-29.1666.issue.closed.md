Current debian packaging produces wrong permissions. According to the
Makefile (target `install-config`) they should be 0700 (u=rwx,go=-) for
directories `/etc/rear` and `/etc/rear/cert/`, and 0600 (u=rw,go=-) for
`/etc/rear/local.conf`. Actual permissions in the debian archive:

    $ ar x rear_2.3-0_amd64.deb
    $ tar tvf data.tar.xz ./etc
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2017-12-20 16:19 ./etc/
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2017-12-20 16:19 ./etc/rear/
    -rw-r--r-- root/root       534 2017-10-02 15:15 ./etc/rear/local.conf
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2017-12-20 16:19 ./etc/rear/cert/

@OliverO2  
I know nothing at all about Debian packaging.

I assume you are talking about ReaR packages for Debian as in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
i.e. from the OpenSUSE Build Service (and not from elsewhere).

I think matching Debian packaging source files are at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.3](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.3)

@jsmeix Yes, precisely. I've also built the debian package locally with
identical results.

By bind googling I found:  
[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/265462/how-to-change-folder-permissions-during-package-installation](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/265462/how-to-change-folder-permissions-during-package-installation)  
which talks about 'dh\_fixperms' that is also mentioned in  
[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html\#rules](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html#rules)  
and described in  
[https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/debhelper/dh\_fixperms.1.en.html](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/debhelper/dh_fixperms.1.en.html)

Yes, seems like `dh_fixperms` is the culprit. It contradicts its own
[(inline) manual
page](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/debhelper/debhelper.git/tree/dh_fixperms),
which omits the fact that the script actually makes **everything** world
readable.

So instead of setting permissions to a *sane state* (as advertised),
`dh_fixperms` paves the way to open up security holes once users insert
secrets into their config files. :frowning\_face:

@frediz  
because in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1163](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1163)
you wrote

<pre>
I've packaged Relax-and-Recover as "rear" for Debian
</pre>

you may have a look here in particular at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1666\#issuecomment-355068485](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1666#issuecomment-355068485)  
whether or not there is perhaps a general security issue  
what file permissions Debian packaging results by default?

@jsmeix thanks for the notice. I'll check the details for the package in
Debian.

Hi,  
the default permissions are the one set by dh\_fixperms as shown above,
and those are sensible default permissions according to Debian Policy
and no sensitive information.  
Most of configuration files in packages have no reason not to be read
and there would be anyway  
readable through the package downloadable by everybody in the Debian
packages archive which  
wouldn't make sense.  
Now, by default, these files don't include anything sensitive, so, I'd
say that if some rear user wants to  
store some keys, he's also responsible for taking care of the protection
of the files in an atomic fashion, that is :

-   have /etc/rear/local.conf be 600 if one stores sensitive information
-   have /etc/rear/cert/\* be 600 instead of the whole trees be 700  
    I completely understand the idea of forcing those permission which
    is what I started to implement in the package but by default from
    what the package provides that is nothing, it's a bit overkill. So
    I'm still wondering :)  
    Maybe rear should fail if sensitive information is stored and no
    proper permissions is set, as other utilities do in that case, so
    that for some reason if the permissions gets changed, no disaster
    occurs.  
    What do you think ?

F.

@frediz Thanks for the explanations. I understand what `dh_fixperms` is
trying to accomplish (default permissions when there is no sensitive
information present). The problem is that dh\_fixperms's documentation
simply does not explain what it actually does to file permissions in
`/etc/`.

You are right that ReaR's default configuration doesn't include
sensitive information. But probably one of the more popular
configuration changes would be setting `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD` with a
password hash. It's like adding the first password hash to (the
read-protected) `/etc/shadow` in terms of sensitivity. So I'd argue it's
better for ReaR users to be safe than sorry here and install the ReaR
configuration files read-protected from the start like PR
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1674](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1674)
does.

Hi @OliverO2 (sorry for the delay, I really need to figure out how to
get notification on my mails despite checked).  
Yes, I thought about all that and don't want to get into troubles :) ..
so I'll commit what I initially did  
as asked that is set restrictive permissions and also back propagate
this to already installed rear package  
into Debian.  
Thanks guys,  
F.

@frediz You're welcome. Thanks for your feedback!
