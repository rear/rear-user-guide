Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover
2.2-git.0.b7927e5.unknown.changed / 2017-10-31

OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Ubuntu/17.04/i386

rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
/etc/rear/local.conf):  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=iso:///backup  
ISO\_VOLID="REARISO"  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///tmp  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )

Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? UEFI

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    If the output of choice is an iso image, and the iso image is used
    to create a FAT32 bootable usb memory stick (I used UltraIso in
    Windows), the Volume ID is truncated, preventing the device from
    being mounted correctly
-   Work-around, if any:  
    ISO\_VOLID can be used as a work-around, although a shorter default
    VOLID would be more convenient.

@MarcoS80 I'm not sure what is the reported issue here ...  
Would you like us to change configuration directive *ISO\_VOLID* to
*VOLID* ?  
If so, I'd disagree as *VOLID* is currently correctly bonded to ISO and
avoiding *ISO* prefix could cause possible namespace conflicts in the
future, so I'd prefer letting it be as it is ...

Apologies!  
What I mean is that at line 301 in default.conf the assignment:  
ISO\_VOLID="RELAXRECOVER"  
could be replaced by an assignment such as:  
ISO\_VOLID="REARRECOV"  
or something like that.  
It is not really a "bug" but it may force the user to explicitly assign
the ISO\_VOLID variable, if the ISO image is to be used to create a
bootable memory stick.

Simply put, it seems that RELAXRECOVER is a bit too long to fit a FAT32
volume label.  
AFAIK, many (MS-Windows) applications, that are used to create EFI
bootable memory sticks, do not bother to create different partitions.
They create a single FAT32 partition and put everything in it.  
In my case (at least), the resulting FAT32 volume label has been
truncated as RELAXRECOVE, with the last R left out, thus during the
restoration process, the script was unable to mount the memory stick.

In general I don't care what Windows programs do, as putting it very
politely, M$ Windows is IMHO quite an egoistic platform ;-).  
On the other hand if we are dealing here with FAT, iso9660 or maybe
other not so robust filesystems it might give a sense to keep labels 8
characters long, so something like REAR\_ISO (REARISO) could be more
appropriate as the default.

@schlomo, @gdha, @jsmeix, @schabrolles any ideas here?

In practice we cannot change such default settings  
because probably zillions of ReaR users use the default  
for their existing ISOs and if we changed the default  
their existing ISOs (that are labelled "RELAXRECOVER")  
would no longer match what there is expected/used in ReaR  
so that regressions happen for "probably zillions of ReaR users".

But what I can do is to add an explanatory comment  
to default.conf that describes when that default value  
must be adapted by the user according to his particular  
environment restrictions.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1568](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1568)
merged  
I consider this issue to be fixed as good as possible in practice.

Regarding "we cannot change such default settings" in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565\#issuecomment-342449263](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565#issuecomment-342449263)

Perhaps actually we can change this specific default setting, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457\#issuecomment-658752233](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457#issuecomment-658752233)

I would appreciate feedback what you think about

With

this issue should now be actually fixed.
