and the comparison between the efi files:

    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  966664 Jul 12 12:03 /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi*

so it seems to not have picked the shim even though the console output
during `mkrescue` suggested that it did:

    Detected current EFI bootloader /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi

Thanks @schlomo for your test - tests on other distributions is exactly
what is needed.

I recall now that the code has had one more huge gap - it is OUTPUT=USB
only, support for OUTPUT=ISO has needed to be added IIRC. Can you please
retry on Ubuntu, but with OUTPUT=USB ?

@pcahyna unfortunately I don't know how to test USB mode on VirtualBox,
and I don't have any time left.

SLE15.6 also doesn't work, similar to Ubuntu.

I'd like to suggest using \#3278 as a quick fix for the moment and this
version as an improvement on that. The approaches are fundamentally
different so that they can either complement each other or you'll simply
remove the 1 file I added.

WDYT?

@pcahyna do you see any chance to unify the EFI boot between at least
ISO and USB, preferably also RAWDISK? Maybe using functions to do the
actual work? Or symlinking scripts between the different directories?

Maybe another approach could be to use your improved "getting infos from
EFI vars" code with my simpler "enable secure boot if shim is used" idea
in \#3278? Maybe that would be less effort?

Will you find time to complete this work in the near future or for the
planned 3.0 release?

This would be too much work, I am afraid. Unless the ISO part proves to
be easier to do this way rather than via an incremental change, which I
doubt.

I think not, but I need to check again what needs to be done for ISO and
why you have not needed any such change in your simpler approach.

@schlomo I am sorry that I forgot why I had not proposed this PR earlier
in the first place (testing on other distros was not the main reason -
the need to complete the ISO support was) and had to be reminded via
your test failure and thus I wasted your time.

This brings me a larger question though: who will test changes on
Ubuntu/Debian? Will you be able to find the time to retest again after
this is completed? I don't have any Ubuntu or Debian test environment
and this is not the first time that the desire of supporting
Ubuntu/Debian and the simultaneous lack of ability of testing changes on
it has been an obstacle. I checked the Ubuntu package: it is in the
Universe repository, meaning Community-maintained instead of
Canonical-supported - a very different situation from Red Hat and SUSE
who provide supported versions to customers and employ people that
support their distros. In Ubuntu, the package seems to be simply taken
from Debian. And in Debian, the maintainer (Frédéric Bonnard) has not
touched the package for a long time and even the one CVE bug is still
unpatched:
[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rear](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rear)
.

I am afraid that this model for Debian and Ubuntu support is not
sustainable.

Generally I prefer to not add half-finished stuff, but if it does not
make integrating a more complete solution more difficult, I think that
perfect is the enemy of good and what you suggest is the best solution.
Let me check in more detail what the exact differences between the
approaches are, please, and I will give my review on \#3278 then.

@pcahyna @schlomo I prefer to have a solid solution and not force a v3.0

@gdha I'm actually for iterative improvement. \#3278 adds support for
secure boot auto-configuration without improving anything for systems
where secure boot is not active. And it doesn't change anything else,
too.

All users with active secure boot will benefit from it and I would like
to give that to our users.

In the absence of paid development or a roadmap with people committing
to work on it within a given time I think that as an Open Source project
we need to take what we can get when it comes.

Indeed, that is true. However, remember our words "*why rush it if we
are not paid for a new release?*"

I am with @schlomo here. I would prefer to take longer for a solid
solution, if the less solid solution either: -- makes things worse in
some cases (I don't see this in the case
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3278](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3278)
), or: -- adds poorly designed configuration options or changes the
interpretation of current configuration options in future-incompatible
way, as it would create more work for the user (basically they would
have to adapt again when a more solid solution is implemented and I
don't think this would be the case in \#3278 either, although I still
need to check).

And I don't think it necessarily means to force a v3.0 release on short
notice - we can still attempt to get this PR merged before 3.0, it
merely means that if it proves too difficult, we have at least
something.

Regarding "we are not paid for ...", any thoughts on the "we are not
paid for Ubuntu /Debian, yet we support it" problem?

That is an unfair statement! It will not help the Open Source movement
by throwing mud.
