-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): SUSE Linux
    Enterprise Server 12 SP1
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): Not needed
-   Brief description of the issue: udevadm trigger does not rename
    network devices
-   Work-around, if any:  
    `udevadm trigger --action=add && systemctl daemon-reload`

Hi guys, I was poking around a bit around issue \#951, and during very
early stage I've run into interesting behavior. Once recovery media boot
was near to finish, *55-migrate-network-devices.sh* lunch asked me to
remap old network device to new one. It looks like this action finished
successfully but it doesn't.

The thing is that after */etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules* was
modified and **udevadm trigger** was called, my network device name was
not changed. After a bit of playing around, following worked for me:

    udevadm trigger --action=add
    systemctl daemon-reload

I'm not sure now if this is related to SLES12 or systemd, so if you have
some distro using systemd, could you check if by changing
*/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules* and calling **udevadm
trigger** works for you?

Thanks

V.

merged  
this issue should be fixed.

@gozora

You are always welcome!  
@jsmeix I love "The Enterprise Way" how you closed this issue :-D  
Anyhow, I can confirm same behavior on Debian with systemd so this fix
should indeed help.
