Hello,

I want to install REAR on an Raspberry3 on Debian Jessie (Raspbian
actually), but I can't find suitable package for ARM (for v2.0)

Is it available anywhere? Or how should I install?

Thanks

Hi @ArnoutVerbeken ,

I don't know if there are some packages for RPI.  
But ReaR is pure bash script, all you need is to download ReaR e.g. from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases),
untar it and run `make install`.

This should do the trick.

@ArnoutVerbeken How do you plan to boot from the rescue image?

@gdha I was thinking about a bootable USB stick and then restore to
SDcard..?

@gdha

I have plans to do some testings on ARM platforms in near future, I
cannot assign me any issue, but I can update this issue when I finish
those tests with my results if you are agree.

Also I cannot guarantee any dates to finish my tests :-P

Anyway I can say now that if the SDcard is detected as mmc device, ReaR
cannot recreate layout for it because this:

**/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh**

<pre>
    for disk in /sys/block/* ; do
        blockd=${disk#/sys/block/}
        if [[ $blockd = hd* || $blockd = sd* || $blockd = cciss* || $blockd = vd* || $blockd = xvd* || $blockd = dasd* || $blockd = nvme* ]]
</pre>

Kind regards,

Indeed, new architectures require new pre-requisites. Looking forward to
pull requests.

So if I understand it right, not much I can do right now, except being
patient and being a tester if needed?

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662)
is merged  
I consider this issue to be at least initially solved.

Now since @Lukey3332 implemented the basics for ARM support  
it should be relatively easy for other ARM users to further  
enhance and adapt that to support more ARM devices  
in particular Raspberry Pi.

@ArnoutVerbeken

FYI:

How you could test the current ReaR GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

In general regarding how to work on issues in ReaR  
see the sections  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"  
"How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover"

Has anyone been able to solve this issue? Why was this closed?
OUTPUT=PXE is the only support for ARM. Can we develop a full raspberry
pi implementation of this?

@Danrancan Unfortuntely, no-one contributed any ARM64 code for ReaR as
far as I know except for the message around PXE booting. However, the
PXE booting itself is not the biggest hurdle, but recovering the PI
itself:

-   the rescue image creation
-   the different disk types are tricky
-   make the target PI bootable again
-   and other unkowns

The question these days is who is willing to spent time on this for
free? Via a team of persons it might be possible...
