Every now and then I noticed during  
recovery system startup a message that looks like  
"grep ... broken pipe" error  
but very quickly it disappears (blanked screen).

I never noticed any real failure because of this  
so that this issue is perhaps only cosmetic  
or at most a minor bug from my point of view.

Today by luck I think I noticed the script:  
40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
which contains only two grep calls:

<pre>
# grep 'grep' usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh

systemd_version=$( systemd-notify --version 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | awk '{ print $2; }' )

    if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep -q systemd-udevd ; then
</pre>
