I wonder if GRUB Legacy support in ReaR  
is still used anywhere?

For example regarding SUSE and openSUSE:  
The SUSE SLES12 release notes  
[https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86\_64/SUSE-SLES/12/index.html](https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/12/index.html)  
read (excerpts):

    ...
    8.4.8.9 GRUB2 Is the Supported Bootloader
    GRUB2 is now available
    on all SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 architectures
    and is the only supported bootloader.
    Other bootloaders that were supported in SLE 11, have been
    removed from the distribution and are not available anymore.

So since SLES12 (since October 2014)  
GRUB Legacy support is no longer needed in ReaR for SUSE,  
cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE\_Linux\_Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise)

    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SLES 12)
    ... was released on October 27, 2014

RHEL 6 uses GRUB legacy. So this would mean dropping support for RHEL 6.

By the way @jsmeix , can we remove suport for ELILO as well? I believe
it is there because of SLES.

@pcahyna regarding ELILO:

In contrast to the GRUB Legacy RPM package 'grub'  
that is no longer there in SUSE's internal build service  
since SLES12 ('grub' existed up to SLES11)  
the ELILO RPM package 'elilo'  
is still there in SUSE's internal build service  
even up to current SLES15.

I don't know under what circumstances ELILO  
might be used by SLES customers with SLES12 or SLES15.  
I will try to investigate that but likely this will take time  
so I would prefer to let this issue only deal with GRUB Legacy  
and deal with ELILO in the separated issue

@jsmeix thanks for the confirmation. It is not a priority, it's just
that I saw ELILO when investigating the current bootloader support (that
I am about to revamp a bit) so I wanted to avoid having to touch
something that would be useless anyway. Since elilo is there, I will
count on it in my plans.

says though:

    GRUB2 is now available
    on all SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 architectures
    and is the only supported bootloader.
    Other bootloaders that were supported in SLE 11, have been
    removed from the distribution and are not available anymore.

Yes, and that contradiction in SLES12 that  
"GRUB2 is the only supported bootloader"  
but an 'elilo' RPM package still exists  
(in SUSE's internal build service)  
needs to be investigated by me.
