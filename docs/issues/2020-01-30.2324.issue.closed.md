In current ReaR code most variables are non-local  
which means most variables are global.

In particular variables that are set in functions  
must be in general local variables to avoid  
that a variable with same name that exists  
outside of the function (e.g. a variable in a script)  
gets set to an unintended new value by the function.

Because often variables in ReaR have very short  
generic names like `dev` the problem happens by accident  
more often as it would with more specific variable names,  
cf. "Code must be easy to read" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

For example think about something like

    # function showdev () { dev=$1 ; echo $dev ; }

    # dev=sda1

    # showdev sdb2
    sdb2

    # echo $dev
    sdb2

versus

    # function showdev () { local dev=$1 ; echo $dev ; }

    # dev=sda1

    # showdev sdb2
    sdb2

    # echo $dev
    sda1

The `dev` example is intentional because  
I know we do have a case like that in ReaR, but  
right now I do not remember where I had noticed it...

...perhaps the actual case in ReaR was not about `dev` but  
about `disk` or something similar - as far as I vaguely remember  
the issue was in the layout code or related to the layout code...
