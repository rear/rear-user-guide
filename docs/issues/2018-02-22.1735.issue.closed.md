#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / 2017-07-20

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer OS\_VERSION=7

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

<pre>
# Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=no
NETFS_URL=nfs://10.1.30.20/u02/rear_backups
</pre>

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    UEFI

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When trying to rear recover on same machine with pv intact I got the
    following error for every disk device:

<pre>
UUID "UUID" already in use on “/dev/sda”
</pre>

-   Work-around, if any:

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=409600 count=300
</pre>

then restart recovery

Is this the expected behavior?  
Is there a way to force pv recreation?  
Would it be possible to add kind of a force switch to rear recover or a
dialog?

Thanks and best regards  
Daniel

@procurve86  
I assume "rear recover on same machine" means  
that you run "rear recover" with an already used disk  
in this case even with the exact same disk of your original system.

In general when you run "rear recover" with an already used disk  
various weird issues can appear depending on what (remaining)  
data there is on the already used disk.

For details and some examples see the issue  
`Add an early "cleanupdisk" script`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)  
and follow the links therein.

Currently there is no such "cleanupdisk" script in ReaR.  
In general it is therefore recommended to run "rear recover"  
with a disk that was already fully cleaned up in advance  
to avoid such issues.

@procurve86  
I think you can automate your workaround

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=409600 count=300
</pre>

via a PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Hi jsmeix

Thank you for your support!  
I'll do it with proposal "PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT"

Have a nice weekend.

Best regards  
Daniel
