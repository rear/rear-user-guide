-   How was this pull request tested?

Works much better for me with my tests.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Make rescue/default/010\_merge\_skeletons.sh  
behave more reliably and more fail safe.

Now it errors out when things really went wrong.

Now is is also supported that both a `$skel_dir` directory  
(e.g. `usr/share/rear/skel/default/`) plus a `$skel_dir.tar.gz`  
(e.g. `usr/share/rear/skel/default.tar.gz`) exist  
and then both get copied into the recovery system,  
first the directory and then the tar.gz so that via the tar.gz  
existing files could be overwritten if needed.

@rmetrich  
if you like you may have a look here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2317/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2317/files)  
at my overhauled rescue/default/010\_merge\_skeletons.sh  
which behaves much better for my tests.
