In relation to \#696 we should decide which out-of-the-box use case to
support via package dependencies.

From my point of view: ISO is the default OUTPUT and therefore, the only
default mechanism. All others are optional and are defined by the users,
where `prep` scripts should trigger a warning if something crucial for
that path is missing.

@schlomo what do you want to do with this issue? No-one else replied...

Let's go with the ISO beeing default. Probably NETFS is also most widely
used, we could consider it beeing the default BACKUP method instead of
REQUEST\_RESTORE.

IMHO there is no immediate need for action.
