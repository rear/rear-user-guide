Rear 2.5 running on SLES12 SP4

Today i have come accross following Situation, which i would like to
discuss, as the recovery  
worked with workarounds, im quite interested wether if this is a bug or
a mis-configuration.

1.  SLES12 SP4, operating system uses Multipath SAN attached disks
    (without LVM)
2.  Some LVM volumes exist, but only one volume group and the local
    discs should be  
    recovered.

The following configuration was used:

    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
    BOOT_OVER_SAN=y
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( 'included_vg') 
    REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lzma"

The OS disks consist of one disk (/dev/mapper/OS) with two partitions.
One partition is  
the Root volume (btrfs), the other one is the EFI partition.

During mklayout it is to be seen, that this disk's volume should be part
of the recovery:

    2020-06-09 19:00:48.558006452 Saving filesystem layout (using the findmnt command).
    2020-06-09 19:00:48.578050243 Processing filesystem 'vfat' on '/dev/mapper/OS-part1' mounted at '/boot/efi'
    2020-06-09 19:00:48.639323912 Processing filesystem 'btrfs' on '/dev/mapper/OS-part2' mounted at '/'

The resulting disklayout.conf howerver, includes only "part" statement
for that disk, not any "disk" statement, just another multipath one,
which does not include any information about initialization type to be
used:

    multipath /dev/mapper/OS 107374182400 /dev/sda,/dev/sdam,/dev/sdbf,/dev/sdt
    part /dev/mapper/OS 251658240 16777216 primary boot /dev/mapper/OS-part1
    part /dev/mapper/OS 107105730048 268435456 primary none /dev/mapper/OS-part2

That leads to a situation, where the disk layout restore, does
initialize the disk allways  
with msdos as default partition table! As there is no disk entry in the
disklayout.conf, the  
code in in 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh allways uses msdos in case
of primary partitions:

        while read part disk size pstart name junk ; do
            names=( "${names[@]}" $name )
            case $name in
                (primary|extended|logical)
                    if [[ -z "$label" ]] ; then
                        Log "Disk label for $device detected as msdos."
                        label="msdos"
                    fi
                    ;;
            esac
        done < <( grep "^part $device " "$LAYOUT_FILE" )

Now, this becomes a problem if GPT is really required and for example
secureboot is used. The recovered system does simply not boot as grub is
unable to access the EFI directory due the OS disk beeing MBR instead of
GPT.

Now my question is: how come that there is a missing disk entry in
disklayout.conf (due to multipath?) or is the existing code during
recovery at fault here?

The workaround was to add the following line at the top of the
disklayout.conf:

`disk /dev/mapper/OS 107374182400 gpt`

before running "rear recover", which worked flawlessly then.

As far as I see from the description this issue here is a duplicate of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2234](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2234)  
that is fixed in current ReaR GitHub master code via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2235](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2235)

Additionally there was  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2236](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2236)  
that is fixed in current ReaR GitHub master code via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2237](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2237)

@abbbi  
please verify that things also work for you  
with current ReaR GitHub master code  
as described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

We need your verification rather soon because  
we will release the next ReaR 2.6 soon, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368)  
and I would like to be sure that the above fixes  
(which worked for us at SUSE and for our customer)  
also work in your particular case.

@jsmeix

Thanks for your quick reply! I will try to test things this week, if i
get access to the systems i spotted this issue and will report back!

@jsmeix

I may not be able to test on the real system as it requires downtime to
be scheduled, i however patched version 2.5 with both of the commits you
mentioned and tested with an Qemu vm, simulating multipath by attaching
multiple disks with the same UUID, and it worked flawlessly!  
So i think this issue is fixed with the commits you mentioned.

The patch also addresses following issue which i was not able to
reproduce using 2.5 and the patcheset:

@abbbi  
thank you so much for your inventive extempore test  
and your prompt feedback!
