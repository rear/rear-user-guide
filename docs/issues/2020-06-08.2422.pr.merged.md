-   Type: **Enhancement** **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Normal**  
    At most "normal" impact because the  
    SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS  
    functionality is only meant to work to some usual extent  
    but not for each and every special cases,  
    see its description in default.conf

<!-- -->

    # But SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS="no" is not at all any guarantee
    # to not have any kind of unprotected SSH key in the recovery system.
    # In general to check if there are unwanted files in the recovery system
    # use KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes" and inspect the recovery system content
    # in $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/ and use COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE
    # to exclude unwanted files from the recovery system.
    SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS='no'

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    A quick "rear mkrescue" test on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system  
    with this in /etc/ssh/ssh\_config

<!-- -->

    #   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentityFile    ~/.ssh/id_dsa
     IdentityFile = ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
      identityfile "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"

and that (dummy stuff) in /root/.ssh/config

    #   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsaqq
    IdentityFile    ~/.ssh/id_dsaqq
     IdentityFile = ~/.ssh/id_ecdsaqq
      identityfile "~/.ssh/id_ed25519qq"

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Overhauled how SSH config files are parsed for IdentityFile values  
to find (and remove) unprotected SSH keys in the recovery system.  
Now "find ./etc/ssh" ensures that SSH 'Include' config files  
e.g. in /etc/ssh/ssh\_config.d/ are also parsed

@gdha @OliverO2  
perhaps you could have a look here and try out if it also works for
you.  
If yes we may even merge that already into ReaR 2.6?

@gozora  
by the way I think I also fixed a `$ROOTFS_DIR` omission  
from before

    ... sed -n -e "s#~#root#g" ...

to now

    ... sed -e ... "s#~#$ROOT_HOME_DIR#g" ...

Tested successfully on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (just a smoke test on a
standard configuration, without extra configuration files and without
unprotected private keys).

I have tested  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2422/commits/4933de3c5e4a29f2bc519f465854cfa3d917f8cf](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2422/commits/4933de3c5e4a29f2bc519f465854cfa3d917f8cf)  
on the same openSUSE Leap 15.1 system as above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2422\#issue-431078521](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2422#issue-431078521)

Before and afterwards I get same SSH key files found and tested  
(same excepts from my `rear -D mkrescue` logs):

    # grep 'ssh-keygen -q -p -P' var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/.//root/.ssh/id_dsa
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/.//root/.ssh/id_ecdsa
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/.//root/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/.//root/.ssh/id_rsa
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/id_dsa
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/id_ecdsa
    ++ ssh-keygen -q -p -P '' -N '' -f /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/id_ed25519

The duplicate found files (`/rootfs/.//root/` is the same as
`/rootfs/root/`)  
happen because of how my current `sed` code works and as a result  
the `sort -u` in

     key_files=( $( echo "${host_key_files[@]}" "${root_key_files[@]}" "${host_identity_files[@]}" "${root_identity_files[@]}" | tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' | sort -u ) )

cannot detect them as duplicates.

I could unify the found file names by using an artificial `./` prefix

    sed ... -e "s#~#./$ROOT_HOME_DIR#g"

instead of my currently more simple `sed` code

    sed ... -e "s#~#$ROOT_HOME_DIR#g"

to make the `sed` result match the other code in

    local root_key_files=( ... ./$ROOT_HOME_DIR/.ssh/id_* )

Should I do that?

If I understand it correctly, those duplicates would be reported to the
user so it's probably best to avoid them.

@OliverO2  
thank you for the hint that duplicates could be reported to the user!

I think actually duplicates are not reported to the user  
because when a file was removed and a duplicate apperars  
in the `for key_file in "${key_files[@]}"` loop the  
`test -s "$ROOTFS_DIR/$key_file" || continue`  
skips the duplicate.

What happens (and I have seen them in my log file) are

    Log "SSH key file '$key_file' has a passphrase and is allowed in the recovery system"

messages for duplicates.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow.
