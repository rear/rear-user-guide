@rear/contributors  
could you please have a look here?

I think this should be fixed for ReaR 2.8  
because otherwise the minor issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3151](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3151)  
would not be fixed in ReaR 2.8 packages  
that are built from our dist/rear-2.8.tar.gz

Let's just add an empty `.vimrc` to `skel/default` with a comment line
explaining why it is there. Or we can add it to `/etc/vimrc` same place?
Wouldn't that have the same effect and it would be more obvious?

Users who want to carry along their own VIM config can still use
`COPY_AS_IS` to do so and it will override our empty default

I have the same `.vimrc`

    " An empty vimrc file to avoid that 'vi' inside the ReaR recovery system shows

usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/.vimrc

    make dist OFFICIAL=1

and all three are missing in dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz

BUT  
when I make another copy as  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/vimrc  
(i.e. without leading dot)  
then it gets included in dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz  
so it seems dot-files are ignored.

I guess it is because of `--exclude=".??*"` passed to tar, which
originates in 56959b54fc by @schlomo .

Unfortunately, if we remove this, I suspect we will get unwanted stuff
in the build, like `.github`, `.fmf` and `.shellcheckrc`.

@jsmeix the root cause is that we exlcude dot files when building the
tar in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/3d17f43a3c0279344c7cd97125b86971081107cb/Makefile\#L90](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/3d17f43a3c0279344c7cd97125b86971081107cb/Makefile#L90)

Therefore we have the ability to use an **archive** as skel, see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/Debian/default.tar.gz](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/Debian/default.tar.gz)

But for this specific problem I'd prefer to solve the `vim` problem via
shipping an `/etc/vimrc` in the hope that such a file would make vim
happy without a `/root/.vimrc` as dot files are often not noticed by
users. If possible.

Or we use code to create the dotfile in the rescue system.

Ah!  
`/etc/vimrc` is not a dot-file - I missed that.

from the dist archive?

@pcahyna
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/3d17f43a3c0279344c7cd97125b86971081107cb/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/010\_merge\_skeletons.sh\#L30-L34](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/3d17f43a3c0279344c7cd97125b86971081107cb/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/010_merge_skeletons.sh#L30-L34)

If the `.vimrc` dotfile would be in such a skel archive then it wouldn't
be filtered out in the `make dist` process. I had added this feature a
long time ago as a way to add arbitrary stuff via the skel process that
would cause problems with git. For example, a block or character device
probably wouldn't work either.

But, I'd rather use a non-dotfile to solve a problem as this is much
easier to see and understand than having to look into an archive hidden
somewhere deep in our source tree. That is why I was asking if
`/etc/vimrc` would also solve the problem.

@pcahyna and I'd rather exclude the development relevant files like
`.shellcheckrc` from our dist archive.

In any case we have slightly different behavior of the `make dist`
process depending on if it runs from a git checkout or not, as it reacts
to the presence of `.gitignore` files to also exclude everything
mentioned there, which covers for example a `var` directory that is
created if you happen to run `./usr/sbin/rear` from the git checkout
prior to running `make dist` (this is the original reason for me to
include that feature of handling `.gitignore` properly for `tar`).

HTH for context

Unfortunately it neither works with /etc/vimrc  
nor with /etc/.vimrc in the ReaR recovery system.

@jsmeix `vim --version` suggests to use `/usr/share/vim/vimrc` and maybe
we should simply add this folder to our default `COPY_AS_IS` to simply
include the original system's vim configuration. If vim is not
installed, then nothing happens. And if it is installed, then it will
work with the defaults.

So it seems like `/etc/vim/vimrc` is not standard but enabled by Debian
via a symlink. Maybe adding both paths (`/etc/vim` and `/usr/share/vim`)
to `COPY_AS_IS` would be a "correct" way to resolve this?

Not sure if I get it. What if there is a non-dotfile in the archive? It
would not get filtered either. What makes the `.??*` pattern special?

the skel archive is a means to transport anything whatsoever into the
rescue system. this of course also works for non-dotfiles. It is only
required for special or weird stuff.

The `.??*` pattern is not special, it simply ensures to not match on
dotfiles with less than 2 characters after the dot which is a common way
to not match on `.` and `..`. Maybe a shorter pattern like `.*` would
have sufficed, I don't remember if I tried that or not.

But what's the problem with dotfiles in the first place? Is it related
to the skel archive or not (if it also works for non-dotfiles)?

I think the only "problem" is, that we filter out dotfiles in the
`make dist` process.

BTW, I just noticed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/486b76b1a8a47afdf0a032b32989c94c47503f7a/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130\_create\_dotfiles.sh\#L32](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/486b76b1a8a47afdf0a032b32989c94c47503f7a/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130_create_dotfiles.sh#L32)

we check for `vi` not `vim` but talk about including the config for
`vim`. Maybe `vi` (the not-improved VI) has a different config or works
without?

I now understand that @jsmeix tried to fix the missing VIM rc file via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/700727b53855d551c0620c46a839755894b26eb3\#diff-86dae0514a9be4af4b9a40cd2670d62f8d815757a620cdebd29038458af0c2d6](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/700727b53855d551c0620c46a839755894b26eb3#diff-86dae0514a9be4af4b9a40cd2670d62f8d815757a620cdebd29038458af0c2d6)
and that we now realize that it didn't work for package building.

@jsmeix to quickly resolve this I'd suggest to also create the `.vimrc`
(with the dot) in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/486b76b1a8a47afdf0a032b32989c94c47503f7a/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130\_create\_dotfiles.sh\#L32](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/486b76b1a8a47afdf0a032b32989c94c47503f7a/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130_create_dotfiles.sh#L32)
or, to try creating a `/usr/share/vim/vimrc` file instead. AFAIK
`/etc/vim/vimrc` is actually not the path that `vim` looks for.
`vim --version` will show you the actual paths it checks.

@pcahyna  
my personal feeling is that currently we are too near  
the ReaR 2.8 release so that I feel rather uncomfortable  
with changing what "make dist OFFICIAL=1" does  
ONLY  
because of this minor issue here, in particular because

By the way (not related to the original problem anymore), having a
gzipped archive in our source tree is at best an antipattern and at
worst a way to sneakily inject malware (who knows what is inside? see
the xz attack), so I hope we will get rid of it.

@pcahyna  
I agree that having a gzipped archive in our source tree  
is bad but I don't agree to get rid of that functionality  
where a user could add a gzipped archive as neded in his  
skel tree to get special things into his ReaR recovery system  
as he needs it - think about a complex piece of software  
where COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, and LIBS could be  
needlessly complicaded for the usre compared to  
"simply pack what is needed into an archive".

But I never used that functionality myself  
so I cannot tell if it is actually useful in practice.

I meant, get rid of the archive, not of the functionality.

While I understand and agree with your thoughts about having an archive
in the source tree I'd like to keep it there to keep testing the skel
archive feature.

I'm fine with removing the dotfile exclude from the tar creation process
because in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/cc1e9e493a4b975b77148eef749a0040e11622ec/Makefile\#L12](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/cc1e9e493a4b975b77148eef749a0040e11622ec/Makefile#L12)
we have an explicit include of the files relevant for ReaR. That already
excludes top-level dotfiles and development stuff in order to create a
"clean" dist archive. For cleaning up we should then also remove all the
other development-related dotfiles (shellcheckrc, gitignore) from the
source tree and have those only on the top level.

For actually solving the vimrc problem, the SLES example maybe confirms
my suggestion that we should add common vimrc locations to `COPY_AS_IS`.

Or we don't deal with it for 2.8 - also totally fine for me as I'm using
`nano` for small editing needs 😁

Regarding usr/share/rear/skel/Debian/default.tar.gz

    # tar -tzvf usr/share/rear/skel/Debian/default.tar.gz
    -rw-r--r-- root/root 1059 2007-10-05 16:06 lib/linux-sound-base/noOSS.modprobe.conf

It doesn't look as if this single file  
could not be a regular file in skel?

    # git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/skel/Debian/default.tar.gz

tells that it originated since "Switch to trunk model"  
which means it is there "since the beginning of time"  
i.e. beyond what we can see in retrospect in git

Yes, I just put some BS into that archive to see that the mechanism
works.

From my current (Wednesday evening) point of view  
I would prefer to "don't deal with it for 2.8"  
and deal with it properly for ReaR 3.0.

I assume an appropriate

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/some/vimrc )

is a sufficient workaround in ReaR 2.8  
for users who want to avoid the annoying message.

Alternatively @schlomo @pcahyna if you work longer today  
and find a solution that you tested that it works for you  
the please make a pull request (we may still postpone  
a pull request to ReaR 3.0 if we think it is better/safer  
to "don't deal with it for 2.8").

I would indeed assume that this is long obsolete, at least
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open\_Sound\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_System)
suggests that this doesn't apply any more.

I'm also totally fine with just removing this archive and to fix
problems if somebody complains about a problem here.

@jsmeix this is an entirely reasonable approach. OTOH, when changing the
Makefile, it is easy to check what is being introduced by the change:

    make OFFICIAL=1 dist
    tar tzf dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz > unpatched.list
    # here change the Makefile...

    make OFFICIAL=1 dist
    tar tzf dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz > patched.list
    diff -u unpatched.list patched.list

so I will leave it up to you.

I will try to make a PR out of the proposed Makefile change.

Testing is useful, but I would very much prefer to move the test to
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/)
where it is clearly separate from ReaR sources.

I postpone this issue to ReaR 3.0 because  
I like to focus on the actual ReaR 2.8 release now  
because I have to leave today already at 14:00
