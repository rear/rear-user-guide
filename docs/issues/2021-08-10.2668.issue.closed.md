Hi,  
I have been working around with REAR for a long while. I have created
ISO using CentOS7 installed on VM using:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=null  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="iso:///backup"

This has successfully created the ISO using "rear mkbackup". Generated
ISO can be used on VM and it is booting without an issue.

I am trying to convert this ISO to a Bootable USB (without using
OUTPUT=USB) as i have to share these iso's and i want people to use them
by creating bootables.  
I used Rufus to create bootable usb of the ISO but it is not booting on
base system.

Can you please guide on exact configuration for this case? i don't have
a requirement to create backup as well, 'mkrescue' can also work in my
case as i just require installed binaries to stay inside the ISO.

Thank you for your response @gdha , I have managed to resolve it using:

-   Creating ISO using mkbackup with the above configurations
-   Then using "isohybrid /path/to/image.iso"
-   Finally using "dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdb"

Bootable created after converting to hybrid iso and making it bootable
using dd is working.

-   I was also stuck in the bigger to smaller / smaller to bigger disk
    migration - but resolved it by customizing the percentage
    accordingly in default.conf.

I have a question @jsmeix @gdha : Is there a way to add a customized
flash screen on boot at recovery? Because REAR can be used as creating
custom Linux ISO images containing installed applications. So adding a
custom screen in these cases will be great and helpful.  
By custom screen i mean just a flash screen at first recovery boot that
might have customized color or text.

@MubbashirAdnan I used to have a simple splash screen with my very old
project mkcdrec with isolinux. The howto can be found here:
[http://frantisek.rysanek.sweb.cz/splash/isolinux-splash-HOWTO.html](http://frantisek.rysanek.sweb.cz/splash/isolinux-splash-HOWTO.html)

Create a splash file and add a copy line in script
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh to try it
out.  
Keep us posted...

Thank you @gdha. Will try it out and let you know.

@gdha Can you please guide if i can change the default timeout settings
that appear after we boot the ISO?  
To be more specific, i am using REAR as mkbackup with the backup
included within the ISO. I am using it as migrator on variable disk
layouts. When i choose automatic recover while booting, i have to face 4
to 5 menus confirming disk layout and running disk creation scripts. I
have to choose 1 (which is default) every time. The default timeout to
choose option 1 is 300 seconds in each menu. Can i change this to 10 or
20 seconds? Thanks

@MubbashirAdnan Use the variable USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT=3 in the
local.conf file to define 3 seconds for example.

@MubbashirAdnan  
in general see the config variable descriptions in default.conf  
e.g. the description of the various USER\_INPUT\_\* config variables  
that is in ReaR upstream master code currently at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L240](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L240)

Hello @gdha @jsmeix, Thank you for the help. Can you please let me know
regarding the REAR ISO for migration on different disk sizes. How do i
exactly configure manually if i face a disk size mismatch error while
installing the generated ISO? I have performed it using the default.conf
by increasing the percentage. But i want to know if there is a way to
easily change the configuration of disk size while ISO is installing.
Please tell the exact lines that i have to write in runtime
configuration.

Using default.conf disk increase percentage: i created ISO on 500GB
drive and I had to install it on 1TB disk size, so i increased the disk
size to 100%. What if i have to install it on even bigger disk i.e. 2TB?
should i go past 100%?

Waiting for the kind response, Thanks :)

@MubbashirAdnan

regarding migration to a system with a bit smaller or a bit bigger
disk  
see in conf/default.conf the description of the config variables  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE

I recommend to not use AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS="yes"  
with layout/prepare/default/430\_autoresize\_all\_partitions.sh  
because that may result bad aligned partitions in particular  
bad aligned for what flash memory based disks (i.e. SSDs) need  
that usually need a 4MiB or 8MiB alignment (a too small value  
will result lower speed and less lifetime of flash memory devices),  
see the comment at USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE  
in default.conf

In general regarding system migration with ReaR  
(e.g. to a system with substantially different disk size):

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also a virtual machine)  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
that would do the annoying legwork for you.

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before.

Additionally ReaR supports to migrate a system  
but here "supports" means that ReaR provides a lot  
that should help you to get such a task done  
but it does not mean that it would "just work" without  
possibly laborious manual settings and adaptions  
with trial and error legwork until you made things work  
for you in your particular case.

that provides additional information what one must manually adapt  
when migrating onto different hardware.
