This is a respin of the previous PR I closed because it was suboptimal
regarding bridges on virtual interfaces (such as libvirt bridges used
with KVM).

    Add support for Bridge Interfaces

    Bridge interfaces are widely used. This patch enables configurations as
    shown below:
    1. Bridge over simple Ethernet
    2. Bridge over Bond
    3. Bridge over Vlan interface

    Usually, virtual interfaces are skipped, but for Bridges to work, we
    consider Bridges as physical interfaces, because the Bridge interface
    holds the IP address, not the physical interface attached to the Bridge.

Commit 0c0ee4a032c1b44135a07e28e89c3da01dde99d5 is identical to the one
that has been approved.  
Commit ff22996de6ea7035eec4e829053b1ad80a9f390d fixes the support of
bridge when using Simplified bonding.  
Commit 0958e2aa7a02552e299dd1169c99066e225874c1 limits the bridge
interfaces to the ones linked to physical interfaces somehow (purely
virtual bridges are useless when recovering).

I set same assignees and reviewers here

@gdha  
could you have a look at the code and if it looks o.k.  
we could merge it to have it in ReaR 2.3.

@rmetrich @jsmeix Is this pull request still relevant in the sense of PR
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574)?

@gdha yes, please integrate in rear2.3, PR \#1574 will be rear2.4 and we
already hit such issues

Hello @gozora @gdha  
I'd like to inform you that the code **doesn't** work on RHEL6, because
it makes use of "ip" commands not understood, such as "ip link add name
XXX **master** YYY".  
This is due to @gozora making me remove Commit
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1553/commits/d675166f3ca92f525d916abfc25dbcd1d7126fe5](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1553/commits/d675166f3ca92f525d916abfc25dbcd1d7126fe5)
;-)  
(use of brctl).  
I'll hence reintroduce brctl for older "ip" releases.

QUESTION: Should I submit a new PR or can I reuse this one?

@rmetrich  
I never tried to re-use an already merged pull request  
therefore I would recommend to be on the safe side and  
do a subsequent change for an already merged pull request  
via a new separated pull request.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1553\#issuecomment-340003156](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1553#issuecomment-340003156)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d675166f3ca92f525d916abfc25dbcd1d7126fe5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d675166f3ca92f525d916abfc25dbcd1d7126fe5)

<pre>
if CONDITION ; then
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" "brctl" )
fi
</pre>

I agree with @gozora that we should aviod to force users  
to install 'brctl' if that is not really mandatory.

For example on my SLES11 system I have 'brctl' by default  
but on my SLES12 system I do no longer have 'brctl' by default  
(I assume because nowadays 'ip' should be preferred).

Accordingly - if possible - the code in ReaR should at runtime  
decide if 'brctl' should be called or the 'ip' command.

For example a more conservative approach  
via a simple testing if 'brctl' is executable like

<pre>
# Use 'brctl' if executable (even if also 'ip' is executable)
# because 'brctl' should work backward compatible
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1570
if has_binary brctl ; then
    brctl ...
else
    ip ...
fi
</pre>

Or an approach that perfers the modern way and only  
falls back to the old way if the modern way fails like

<pre>
# First try 'ip' because 'ip' is the future-proof way
# and fall back to 'brctl' if 'ip' failed
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1570
ip ... || brctl ... || BugError "Neither 'ip' nor 'brctl' worked"
</pre>

cf. "Dirty hacks welcome" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Additionally you should get 'brctl' into the recovery system  
in a non-mandatory way (i.e. only if 'brctl' is installed on the  
original system) via:

<pre>
# Have 'brctl' in the recovery system (if available)
# because 'brctl' is needed on older systems where
# things like "ip link add name XXX master YYY" are
# not supported, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1570
if CONDITION ; then
    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" "brctl" )
fi
</pre>
