-   rear version: 2.00 git
-   OS version: Arch
-   rear configuration files: USB NETFS
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? UEFI
-   Brief description of the issue: Migration from `/dev/sda` to
    `/dev/nvme0n1` fails, due to device translation `/dev/sda1` becomes
    `/dev/nvme0n11` in the new disklayout.conf, which in the generated
    script becomes partition `11` (instead of 1).

Note:  
`/dev/nvme0n1` = first NVMe drive  
`/dev/nvme9n1` = 10th NVMe drive  
`/dev/nvme10n1` = 11th NVMe drive

I suspect similar failures for eMMC storage, using naming scheme
`/dev/mmcblk*`

And [Clonezilla
lists](https://github.com/stevenshiau/clonezilla/blob/master/clonezilla.spec)
that there are also nvme naming schemes like `nvme*n2`, `nvme*n3`:

> -   Expand NVME support to disk device name like /dev/nvme0n2, and
>     /dev/nvme0n3 instead of /dev/nvme0n1 only.
