-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The new Bareos ReaR integration introduced with \#3240 uses features
    introduced with Bareos 20.  
    However, the oldest official supported version of Bareos is 21 (the
    current version is Bareos 23).  
    Therefore we add a requirement for a Bareos Director &gt;= 21.

@joergsteffens Please add some comment why this check is so important in
script
`usr/share/rear/prep/BAREOS/default/450_check_bareos_config_files.sh`  
For the rest the code looks good to me.

@gdha  
Do you mean the version check in
`usr/share/rear/prep/BAREOS/default/460_check_bareos_director.sh`? If
yes, than you mean as comment in the code or as LogPrint message? As
code comment I can recycle the commit comment:

    The Bareos ReaR integration uses features introduced with Bareos 20.
    However, the oldest official supported version of Bareos is 21 (the
    current version is Bareos 23).
    Therefore we add a requirement for a Bareos Director >= 21.

However, that a bit extensive as a log message. Do you have a proposal?

@joergsteffens Just add the comments in the script that is sufficient -
thanks. I will test the code on CentOS 8 today.  
BTW - I noticed that we need `jansson-2.14-1.el8.x86_64.rpm` on EL8 (I
had version 2.11 which resulted in bareos not being able to upgrade to
the latest version).

I added the comment.

But that is a problem with your installation, or?  
We build the package once, but automatically test it against:  
EL\_8.x86\_64@Alma-8-x86\_64  
EL\_8.x86\_64@Oracle-8-x86\_64  
EL\_8.x86\_64@RHEL-8-x86\_64  
EL\_8.x86\_64@Rocky-8-x86\_64  
EL\_8.x86\_64@Stream-8-x86\_64

Pure CentOS 8 is dead, AFAIK.

Yes, that is true, therefore, I don't make a big deal of it.
