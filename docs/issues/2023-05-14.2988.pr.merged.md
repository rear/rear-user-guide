supersedes \#2979 and should solve everything discussed there. Code is
based on the work by @codefritzel and adapted by me.

My considerations and decisions:

-   the non-interactive mode is marked *experimental* because it only
    changes the way how `UserInput` works and there might be some
    scenarios where it won't work as advertised. I don't want to put a
    lengthy explanation about the technical details in the help text,
    hence *experimental* to indicate the current status.
-   Without `--non-interactive` nothing should have changed (but I fixed
    a few places that seemed like they could cause problems)
-   With `--non-interactive` the `UserInput` timeouts are hard coded to
    3 seconds (short, but not too short) and every `UserInput -I FOO`
    call can happen only once. If it happens again then it will `Error`
    out.
-   I treat an automated response by `USER_INPUT_FOO` the same as using
    the default response given via `-D`
-   I'd like to keep it this simple till further testing reveals
    scenarios where multiple calls to the same `UserInput -I FOO` would
    be successful, and then I'll adjust the code accordingly (no
    premature optimisation).

Finally, I'd like to merge this rather soon so please look for reasons
why this is a really bad idea and leave further improvements to future
iterations.

@rear/contributors please have a look.

PS: The `UserInput` function is really hard to understand and to test
(via `rear shell`) because it does *so much*, if somebody wants to
contribute a unit test then this would be my starting point.

I am wondering if there a reason why it is called 'non-interactive'  
and not 'unattended' which is a term that we already use in ReaR?

Perhaps it is good to use 'non-interactive'  
for the usr/sbin/rear command line option  
to distinguish it from the already existing  
recovery system kernel command line option  
'auto\_recover/automatic' and 'unattended'  
because each one implements a differnt thing so the three  
'non-interactive' 'auto\_recover/automatic' and 'unattended'  
look same but actually they are only similar  
and belong to different parts of the same goal?

@schlomo  
PS: The UserInput function was really hard to implement  
to get it into a state that provides what was needed  
at that time when the UserInput was implemented.  
Feel free to overhaul it and replace it with something better.  
I already overhauled much old code without useful comments  
that I could not understand with reasonable effort so  
meanwhile I got rather tired to endlessly clean up old code.

This could in principle happen with loops that are not infinite loops
but iterate over some restricted set of items. I suspected that the
layout code might have instances of this, as it may be necessary to
enter input multiple times at the same code spot for multiple disks or
other storage objects. But I have found this code that maps multiple
disks interactively:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/3333cf8050cb347a8390192391a149bc0def3b77/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh\#LL286C3-L292C2](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/3333cf8050cb347a8390192391a149bc0def3b77/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh#LL286C3-L292C2)

which already takes care of it. So, I believe this is either taken care
of and if not, code that does not do it could be adapted in a similar
way (generating unique identifiers for every iteration).

The following is only for the non-interactive mode:

The crucial thing is to abort only if there was no active user input  
which means to abort only if the 'read' timeout happened.  
The UserInput function returns 1 only if 'read' timed out  
(provided there is no syntax error or some lower level error).

Because the current user\_input\_ID gets only added  
to USER\_INPUT\_SEEN\_WITH\_TIMEOUT when return\_code=1 is set  
the current code seems to implement that  
(as far as I see from plain looking at the code).

Regardless of the needed condition in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2988\#issuecomment-1549529195](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2988#issuecomment-1549529195)  
I think this condition is not sufficient to make things work  
in general in non-interactive mode.

I think (as far as I see from plain looking at the code)  
the current implementation aborts at a second UserInput  
with a user\_input\_ID that had timed out before.

But in non-interactive mode it is the usual case  
that UserInput times out and the default input is used  
when the user has not specified a predefined input.

As far as I remember in most cases the default input  
is to let ReaR continue so that the normal behaviour is  
that ReaR continues when the user does nothing  
regardless of normal/interactive or non-interactive mode.

I implemented the various UserInput calls this way  
as far as possible to get intentionally a default behaviour  
of "automated proceeding" - unless the user must make a decision.

So in normal mode the following code would  
automatically proceed after each timeout

    ...
    UserInput -I WAIT_UNTIL_TIMEOUT -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
    ...
    UserInput -I WAIT_UNTIL_TIMEOUT -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
    ...

In contrast in non-interactive mode it would abort at  
the second 'UserInput -I WAIT\_UNTIL\_TIMEOUT' call.

I think (as far as I understand it) the current implementation  
enforces that a user\_input\_ID must never be used a second time.

I think this is what @pcahyna meant with  
"iterate over some restricted set of items"  
in his

@jsmeix what I meant by "iterate over some restricted set of items" was
code like this:

    for d in "${disks[@]}"; do
      UserInput -I CONFIRM_DISK -p "confirm the use of disk ${d}"
      ...
    done

This can be fixed by generating a unique ID for each disk that is to be
confirmed. My point was that the code that iterates this way when
mapping disks is already using this idiom and is thus safe.  
What is still problematic is code like you have shown:

    UserInput -I WAIT_UNTIL_TIMEOUT -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
    DoStuff
    UserInput -I WAIT_UNTIL_TIMEOUT -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
    DoOtherStuff

This, too, can be fixed by changing the IDs to be unique, like

    UserInput -I CONFIRM_STUFF -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
    DoStuff
    UserInput -I CONFIRM_OTHER_STUFF -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
    DoOtherStuff

I don't know whether there actually is code like this (that reuses the
same input ID in several places).

@pcahyna @jsmeix your concerns are valid and I planned to go through our
codebase to look at such cases with the goal of defusing potential
problems, as you suggested.

I'm going over all uses of `UserInput` to fix them up. Except for the
ones mentioned below, all the User Input calls have a default or won't
run into a perpetual loop.

The following cases are not clear to me and I left them be as they are
now:

-   [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh\#L553-L555](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L553-L555)  
    This could theoretically be called multiple times, but I'm not sure
    if this can be called multiple times for ISO

    Those are used for OPAL and set the timeout to `0`, so I assume that
    nobody needs this non-interactive right now.

-   [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a/usr/share/rear/restore/NBKDC/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh\#L101-L107](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a/usr/share/rear/restore/NBKDC/default/400_restore_backup.sh#L101-L107)  
    Manual wait for restore to happen, timeout set to `0` so that we
    can't support non-interactive here either

therein the UserInput for the '(iso)' case  
in the mount\_url() function in lib/global-functions.sh

When a UserInput is needed here things are already in a  
rather exceptional (a.k.a. erroneous) state:  
A device node where the ISO is attached to is needed  
but ReaR could not determine such a device node  
so ReaR must ask the user.

In non-interactive mode ReaR may directly abort here  
but I think it is better to let ReaR continue  
with the default value (i.e. try with '/dev/cdrom')  
and when this is not right things will fail later with

    ERROR: Mount command '...' failed.

I.e. things should behave sufficiently OK as is.

When I was reading that code I asked myself: How could we ever truly
test this???

Usually while I am implementing such kind of code  
I set up some artificial stuff to simulate  
how things behave in the erroneous cases  
but of course I cannot test an actual  
erroneous case on real hardware  
with reasonable effort.

In the end for code like

it does not matter if "try something" works perfectly well.

@schlomo  
I would like to better understand the reasoning behind why you  
"treat an automated response by USER\_INPUT\_FOO the same  
as using the default response given via -D"

I assume the reason is to avoid an endless loop  
when the user has specified a USER\_INPUT\_FOO value  
in his etc/rear/local.conf file that leads to a loop?

For example something like

    USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_CODE_RUN=0

which matches in layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh

    choices[0]="Rerun disk recreation script ($LAYOUT_CODE)"

If my assumption is right I wonder if it is OK  
to let ReaR behave automatically different than  
what the user had explicitly specified because  
I think it contradicts how I understand what  
"final power to the user" should mean.

I.e. in my example above when the user had specified  
something that makes ReaR loop then ReaR must obey.  
ReaR must not attempt to do automated "corrections"  
of what the user had specified regardless if  
what the user had specified makes sense  
from our point of view.

But I am not against to  
"treat an automated response by USER\_INPUT\_FOO the same  
as using the default response given via -D"  
in non-interactive mode because it means ReaR would error out  
when the same user\_input\_ID gets an automated response  
(i.e. the same automated response) a second time  
which indicates that things do not move forward and  
when things do not move forward in non-interactive mode  
it is an erroneous state so it is OK to error out then.

I only like to get a sound understanding whether or not  
this behaviour is actually right or perhaps wrong.

@jsmeix I added your two suggestions. About your question in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2988\#issuecomment-1568434201](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2988#issuecomment-1568434201)
I think that my logic here is very simple: If ReaR starts to run in
circles during non-interactive mode, meaning that the same question is
asked again (same `UserInput -I XXX`), then we assume that additional
iterations of the same question will be answered with the same answer -
either the default value or something provided by the user - and
therefore will not lead to a different result. Therefore it is better to
abort with a clear error message so that other code, e.g. that was
running `rear recover` via SSH, can know about it and handle it.

For that logic it indeed doesn't matter *why* the answer to a question
is the same, it only matters that *it is* the same and we assume that it
is the same answer even though it would be possible to inject code into
ReaR that would go and modify the `USER_INPUT_XXX` variable between
calls to `UserInput`.

I think we should merge this and see how it behaves in production and
improve it where needed. I'm very confident that regular use of ReaR
will work "as expected".
