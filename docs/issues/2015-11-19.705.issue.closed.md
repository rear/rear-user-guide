While using the ReaR NSR-Mode, i found some things that did not  
work like expected. Well, I do not like it that ReaR is doing  
it's NetWorker stuff at a few hundred Systems ;-)

I did some changes to some of the rear scripts, to make it easier to  
handle for me and i hope some of that will be also useful for you.

##### First you will find some remarks to that changes:

**/usr/share/rear/output/NSR/default/95\_nsr\_save\_result\_files.sh**  
*PATCH1:*  
It is not smart form me that "rear mkrescue" will do a save-command  
automatically. If I really want to do one, there is the possibility  
to do "rear mkbackup"  
-&gt; To Skip it I added NSR\_SAVE-Variable in /etc/rear/local.conf:
NSR\_SAVE="NO"

*PATCH2:*  
In many Cases it is not possible to identify the correct Pool.  
The Client could be saved to different Pools or in a worse case  
the datas are also stored in a Clone-Pool.  
For the moment I have no idea how to do it automatically.  
-&gt; My Workaround is to set the NSR\_DEFAULT\_POOL\_N in
/etc/rear/local.conf.

*PATCH3:*  
In many Cases the Part to verify the backup will not work correctly,  
in cause that the Saveset will be the Filesystem and not the files  
itself.  
I changed that part. But for me that part it is only useful if i  
really need to debug. Or maybe if I do the rear-command manually.

**/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf**  
The basic NSR-Config will cause in space-problem in the
/tmp-filesystem  
if i use it with a NetWorker-Server.  
-&gt; Idea: handle the exclude-variable within /etc/rear/local.conf  
-&gt; Workaround: For the Moment I changed COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_NSR  
in the default.conf  
Anyway it could be a good thing to check if ther will be enough space  
in the /tmp Filesystem

**One last remark:**  
The new Enhancement (from \#653), that should check if there is a ISO  
in the Backup, should also be managed (enable/disable) by a Variable  
in /etc/rear/local.conf

**My version of 95\_nsr\_save\_result\_files.sh:**

@fireclown Which version of rear were you using? In github sources there
were some serious modification made around NSR. It would be nice that
you verify this as it could resolve already some of your issues
mentioned above?

i am using rear-1.17.2-1.el5 from the epel-repository.

I will look tomorrow for changes in you soruces.

Alright, now, i have checked ReaR with the actual git-sources and  
I'm sorry it does not really help :(

(PATCH1) "rear mkrescue" will do already a NetWorker save-command.  
Solution: Only "rear mkbackup" should do that.  
Suggestion: If ther will be no other way Enable/Disable by Variable in
local.conf

(PATCH2) maybe a good idea, but it only work for jukebox devices. I am  
also using a DataDomain, so it does not work for me and also  
not for AFTD-Devices.  
The other open Problem is to avoid Clone-Pools.  
Suggestion: Sorry, open for automatic detection.

(PATCH3) it is better, now you can find the saveset, for me that's ok,  
I suggest also showing the ssid.  
Just that part wanted also to show the files in the backup, then  
you will need my part of that script, to show the files in the saveset.

./conf/default.conf  
Makes the same problems then before, i run out of space in /tmp,  
so i have to extend the COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_NSR-Variable.  
Suggestion: Possibility to extend Exclude in local.conf

default/65\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh  
I do not like it to be done with "rear mkrescue"  
mkrescue should only create an ISO like doing it with NETFS  
and like it is written in the help.  
&gt; mkbackup create rescue media and backup system  
&gt; mkbackuponly backup system without creating rescue media  
&gt; mkrescue create rescue media only  
or there should be a possibility to Enable/Disable it.  
or it one smart way could be to integrate within a "rear checklayout"

@fireclown Thank you for taking your time to check out the latest
code.  
Just want to emphasize when external backup programs are involved there
is no need to run *rear mkbackup* as only a rescue image is required,
therefore, *rear mkrescue* is sufficient.

Concerning **Patch 1** I would prefer a generic variable to save the ISO
image (with external backup programs) and the default should be *1* (yes
save ISO).  
Currently, we already have a variable as such in place:

    ./conf/default.conf:TSM_RESULT_SAVE=y
    ./output/TSM/default/95_dsmc_save_result_files.sh:if [[ "$TSM_RESULT_SAVE" = "n" ]]; then

However, I think we should broaden the variable in the sense it is
understandable and useable by other backup mechanism such as TSM, DP,
NSR, BAREOS and so on. What do you think?  
Any suggestions?

Concerning **Patch 2** - define your definition in
`NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME` could be the trick. Perhaps, take some time to
write a small article about it and we would be glad to publish it on our
rear website?

Concerning **Patch 3** - I'm not a NSR user and therefore, I'm not sure
what ssid means for NSR. There are other NSR users, perhaps, they can
discuss the pro/contra's with you as I have no clue.

Concerning `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NSR` - running out of space in `/tmp`:
have you seen:

    ./conf/default.conf:# the TMPDIR influences the mktemp command to define an alternative basedir instead of /tmp
    ./conf/default.conf:TMPDIR=""

Concerning `default/65_check_iso_recoverable.sh` - see **Patch 1**
remarks. It is about the same.

**Patch1:**  
yes, that looks like that what i need. I think it will be helpful if  
you can make it generic and available for all Backup-Programs.

My motivation is, that i am also a NetWorker-Admin and i want to have  
more control about the external accesses to it. The \*Result\_SAVE can  
prevent a few hundred requests (maybe at the same time).

**Patch2:**  
the automatic pool research is a little bit tricky, I am just  
trying to find a solution. I will tell you ;-)

**Patch3:**  
Yes I can make it, but my ISO will be very huge (189GB) if  
I don't Exclude other Directories.

The **ssid** is the saveset id

so it could be added like that:

    mminfo -s $NSRSERVER -a -q "client=$CLIENTNAME,name=${SNAME},pool=${POOLNAME}" \
        -r "pool,ssid,ssretent,name" > $TMP_DIR/saved_result_files

As we cannot do anything here without 'being contracted' by a NSR
customer I close this issue until further notice
