Currenly we have in default.conf

    CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="no"

because of backward compatibility, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1411](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1411)  
but in general things would work more fail-safe in the recovery system  
when it contains all local users of the original system by default,  
see that section in default.conf and for another example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2341](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2341)

Is there a real reason why the ReaR recovery system should not  
have all local users of the original system by default?

I am wondering if all local users in the recovery system by default  
could result some security issue because of whatever secrets  
in the recovery system by default in particular passwords  
or password hashes.  
On my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system etc/passswd of the recovery system is

    root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    daemon:x:2:2:Daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
    rpc:x:477:65534:user for rpcbind:/var/lib/empty:/sbin/nologin
    usbmux:x:466:65533:usbmuxd daemon:/var/lib/usbmuxd:/sbin/nologin
    nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/var/lib/nobody:/bin/bash
    sshd:x:467:467:SSH daemon:/var/lib/sshd:/bin/false

so there are no password hashes and there is no etc/shadow  
or etc/gshadow in my recovery system so I think the recovery system  
does not contain password hashes.

With `CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="yes"`  
the only difference of the entries in etc/passwd  
on my original system compared to my ReaR recovery system is

    -root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    +root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

and the entries in etc/group are same for me.

@jsmeix will do a test to see what it gives.

@gdha  
thank you for having a look how it would behave on your system(s).

I don't know what might be all the implications, but it sounds
reasonable. Better than trying to cherry-pick users that might be needed
and hitting problems like \#2341 .

@pcahyna  
could you check if `CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="yes"`  
behaves reasonable well on some RHEL standard systems?

I think all we need to check is that `CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS="yes"`  
behaves reasonable well on default systems so that we could use it  
in our default.conf.  
Of course when users do exceptional things then the ReaR defaults  
may no longer "just work".

@yontalcar can you please have a look?

If there are no objections I would like to have that  
in the next ReaR 2.6 release, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368)

@gdha @pcahyna @yontalcar  
and in general all @rear/contributors  
could you provide some info how things look from your point of view?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2399](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2399)  
this issue should be done.

If there are security issues or even regressions because of  
the new default CLONE\_ALL\_USERS\_GROUPS="true"  
please report them as new separated issues.
