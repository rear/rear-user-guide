Running

    rear -v format /dev/sdb1

with a device that already has a btrfs filesystem rear stops with the
following error message

Looking at the format/label script, I don't see any btrfs support and we
default to ext3. I would remove the btrfs support altogether.

@gdha Is that acceptable ? Or do you prefer to fix btrfs label support
in this case ?

Rear doesn't supprt btrfs file system format for USB-disks (for the
moment). However, I would not remove btrfs support from rear altogether.
It is still experimental, but it did work in my case...

We're only considering the btrfs support in `rear format` here when I am
talking about removing it.

So do you prefer to fix btrfs label support, or do we remove it as a
supported filesystem ?

remove btrfs for the moment for (USB) extrenal storage (sorry about
closing and re-opening actions - was busy cleaning my mouse...)
