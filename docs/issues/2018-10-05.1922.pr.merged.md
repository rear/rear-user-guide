-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not at all tested because currently I have no UEFI test system

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Avoid `nullglob` pitfalls in 250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
    like the workaround in  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1921\#issuecomment-426999409](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1921#issuecomment-426999409)  
    and  
    generally overhalued that script  
    in particular changed code like

<pre>
if DIR_OF_SOME_FILES_EXISTS ; then
    cp DIR_OF_SOME_FILES/* ...
    StopIfError "Could not copy ..."
else
    Log "Warning: did not find DIR_OF_SOME_FILES"
fi
</pre>

to something like

<pre>
if SOME_FILES_EXISTS ; then
    cp SOME_FILES ...
else
    Log "Warning: did not find SOME_FILES"
fi
</pre>

because the former code has wrong logic from my point of view:  
The former code errors out when `cp SOME_FILES` fails  
but proceeds (with only a warning in the log)  
if SOME\_FILES do not exist.  
If it is essential to copy SOME\_FILES it would also  
have to error out when SOME\_FILES do not exist.  
Because the former code indicates it is not essential to copy
SOME\_FILES  
I think it should also not error out when `cp SOME_FILES` fails.

@gdha @gozora  
could you please review my changes carefully.

Could you please also have a look at the `FIXME` parts.  
Perhaps we could clean up all of them.
