-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I used the documentation from this URL
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/13-tcg-opal-support.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/13-tcg-opal-support.adoc)
    to create a rescue USB stick with PBA environment for OPAL 2 SEDs.  
    The commands

<!-- -->

    rear mkopalpba
    rear mkrescue

work fine and do not show errors. Also dd-ing the raw image to a USB
drive works, but when booting from the USB I see some errors about files
not found. However, those fly by so fast I cannot really read them.
After logging in, the command rear does not work. Instead, it gives an
error that /usr/share/rear/default.conf cannot be found and some other
source errors where files seem to be missing.  
Upon checking, there simply is no /usr/share/rear-directory on the USB
drive. It does exist on my main OS, though that I use to create the
rescue image.  
I'm currently using the pkgbuild from ARCH AUR, but I also tried cloning
the git repo manually and used that version. But the outcome stays the
same. When using the git version in the local dir, I sometimes see this
error:

    Broken symlink '/usr/share/rear' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target

Any help here is highly appreciated.

I am not a OPAL user and I do not have a TCG Opal 2-compliant

So "rear mkopalpba" made a TCG-Opal-PBA-localhost.raw  
that seems to contain only 23 files of usr/share/rear  
(only some usr/share/rear/lib/\*functions.sh files)  
while "rear mkrescue" made a rear-localhost.raw.gz  
that contains all of usr/share/rear (1521 files of usr/share/rear in my
case).

Because I am not a OPAL user and I do not have a self-encrypting disk  
I cannot tell if the above made TCG-Opal-PBA-localhost.raw is right  
i.e. I cannot verify if it works as described in the section

    Administering Self-Encrypting Disks
      Creating a Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA) System

Hi,  
thanks a lot for your reply. My problem, however, is not with the SEDs.
It is with the rescue system. Let me explain:

My plan is as follows:

1.  Create a REAR rescue image with OPAL PBA support
2.  Put the rescue image on a USB disk and boot from it. This way I can
    make sure I have a recovery system to disable drive encryption if
    anything breaks.
3.  Enable drive encryption (or to be more precise: enable drive
    locking) to enforce the encryption
4.  Install the PBA into the ShadowMBR on the Boot drive
5.  Power-down, reboot and hope for the best :)

Right now, I fail at point 2. I can create the rescue image and boot
from it. However, in the rescue system the 'rear' command does not work
because it wants to source some files from /usr/share/rear which simply
are not present in the rescue system.

For what it's worth though, here is what I did right now, to create the
rescue image:

1.  Clone github-repo to local disk:
    `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear`
2.  Run rear command from local git repo to create the PBA:
    `usr/sbin/rear -D mkopalpba`

Again, as you can see it mentions some symlink error to a non-existant
directory on the recovery system:

    Symlink '/usr/share/rear' -> '/usr/share/rear' refers to a non-existing directory on the recovery system.
    It will not be copied by default. You can include '/usr/share/rear' via the 'COPY_AS_IS' configuration variable.

I mean, I can try to workaround with the COPY\_AS\_IS instruction and
see what it gives me. However, I do not understand the reason, though.
The files are there on the system that I use to create the rescue image.
Why do they not get copied? And why is it trying to copy from
/usr/share/rear and not usr/share/rear? ShouIdn't it take all the files
from the local github repo version?

Thanks,  
Andi

So.. using COPY\_AS\_IS solved it, but I do not really understand why
and what the difference is.

I never had a symlink `/usr/share/rear -> /usr/share/rear`  
so this seems to be the root cause in your particular case.

I have no idea why you have such a symlink.  
Normally you should not have such a symlink.

E.g. in my `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git` directory

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # find . -type l -ls | less

does not show such a symlink.

FYI  
why symbolic links must be copied as symbolic links  
see the comment in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh)

    Symbolic links must be copied as symbolic links ('tar -h' must not be used here)
    because 'tar -h' does not finish and blows up the recovery system to Gigabytes,
    see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1636

Hi,  
so I double-checked like four times. I also do not have a symlink to
/usr/share/rear nor is it one. That is the reason why I am so
dumbfounded by that message.

But anyway.. I managed to get the OPAL thing working. Both disks are now
locked. However, rear let me down with the OPAL enabling and locking
procedure as well and I also do not use the rear-created PBA because
that cannot unlock the disks for whatever reason. I use the one provided
by chubbyant. You can find it on
[www.sedutil.com](http://www.sedutil.com) or
[https://github.com/ChubbyAnt/sedutil/releases](https://github.com/ChubbyAnt/sedutil/releases)
if you are interested.
