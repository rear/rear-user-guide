Hi,  
the backup log contains the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY, is it possible to
blank it?

My /etc/rear/local.conf:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="nfs://10.0.xx.xx/backup/"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE="backup\_$(hostname)\_$(date
-Iseconds)\_crypt\_des3"  
GRUB\_RESCUE=1  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD="SECRET"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED=1  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY=”testpw123”

On the target server:  
\[root@fs-01 rear-backup\]\# cat
backup\_rear-backup.xxx.int\_2015-03-26T14:50:16+0100\_crypt\_des3.log  
2015-03-26 14:50:37 tar --warning=no-xdev --sparse --block-number
--totals --verbose --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system
--ignore-failed-read --anchored --gzip -X
/tmp/rear.b7bE08LIU8DwWBV/tmp/backup-exclude.txt -C / -c -f - / /var
/boot /var/log/rear/rear-rear-backup.log | /usr/bin/openssl des3 -salt

tar: Removing leading \`/' from member names  
...

Because nfs use no encryption, it is not a good idea to send the
password of the crypt backup true the same line. Is it possible to
disable it? Or antoher best practice to do it?

My goal is:  
The backup file needs to be encrypted on target and the line secure
(rsync or nfs but without sending the password of the backup file).

Many thanks in advance!

Best regards  
davixd

IMHO full automation and security are always in confict and require some
trade off.

The log is not the main problem. The rescue system also contains this
password and most likely it lies next to your encrypted archive. In any
case, if you want to have an automated restore then the rescue system
needs the password.

I can think about some ideas:

-   Use asymmetric cryptography: The key to encrypt stays on the server,
    the rescue image contains another key that can be used to decrypt
    the backup.
-   Control ReaR from outside (e.g. an external agent) that provides the
    encryption/decryption keys on-the-fly without storing it on disk.
    Maybe the discussion in \#522 helps there. Basically you can add
    ReaR config on the command line without storing it in a file.

Thanks for the advice/tip! But for me there is no need for such a
complex scenario, because I dont need a full automated restore system.

What I have in mind:  
encrypt the backup file while or after (on the the source system).
Sending the backup file to the target without any password in log or
rescue medium. While restoring, the rescue medium have to ask for the
password (and password have to be typed in, stdin) to be restored.

Is something like this possible with rear?

I think that it can be done, but probably you would need to change
something in ReaR or maybe change the way how the password is
integrated. Maybe
[https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/openssl.html\#PASS-PHRASE-ARGUMENTS](https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/openssl.html#PASS-PHRASE-ARGUMENTS)
can servce as a method to allow different usage scenarios with the same
code. If you have the password stored in a file that is excluded from
backup then you are almost there. Maybe one needs to separate between
the backup password and the restore password, the default beeing the
same.

In any case, ReaR needs to be extended for this feature. Do you want to
provide us a patch?

Iam new to this project, so I have to find out first, how everything is
working together. Before I even didn't know, that the rescue image is
saving the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY. But sure, when I will have
something, I will post the patch for that.

Thanks.

I have modified some codes lines, to achieve this goal and its working.

Edit: /usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh

Modify line 43 to: LogPrint "Encrypting archive with a key."  
Modfy line 81 to: $(cat $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt) $LOGFILE |
$BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_OPTIONS BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY | $SPLIT\_COMMAND

With this settings the crypted key don't occur in the logs and is not
present in the rescue iso. To recover the key have to be typed it in in
/etc/rear/local.conf, BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY="".

Is there another place where the crypt key is also stored? If not, then
the rescue iso and the backup.tar.gz is save to be transported over
unsecure lines.

I have tested it successful in basic configuration (backup and
recover):  
/etc/rear/local.conf:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="nfs://10.0.x.x/backup/rear/"  
GRUB\_RESCUE=1  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD="SECRET"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED=1  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY="testpw123"

I hope there are no side effects, I will test it also with extended
settings.

Great!

Could you please provide a pull request with your change?

Also, could you please make sure that ReaR refuses to start working if
the key is missing? Or give the user a chance to type it in
interactively?

I find giving users clear guidance an important aspect. Most likely the
user doing the restore won't know exactly what was configured years ago.

Thanks a lot!

Yes, sure, a pull request will come soon.

ReaR is already giving a hint, when the key is missing to type it in in
local.conf.  
What have to / can be done: Is to make it interactively. I will try it
soon.

Is incremental backup supported by ReaR? Cause I tried it with
BACKUP=NETFS and there is a problem while recovering grub.

Many thanks in advance!

@davixd How far are you with the pull request? If I don't hear something
soon I'll push this to the milestone 1.18...

Hi guys,  
sorry, but I was very very busy in the last few months.

Here is my pull request:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/594](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/594)

These are the two changes, which have to be made in
/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh, to achieve
this goal.

The asking for interactive password is not included yet, but while
trying to recover the backup without a password, rear shows a hint in
the error message (stdout) to get sure there is a password set in
/etc/rear/local.conf.

I hope my pull request is done the right way (my first pull request).

@davixd Thank you for the pull request - it is just fine.  
Just add a label so we do not forget to add proper documentation for
this feature.
