-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In default.conf add `/var/tmp/rear.*` to BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE  
because since ReaR uses `/var/tmp/rear.*` as BUILD\_DIR  
one would get at least the whole BUILD\_DIR  
of the current "rear mkbackup" run  
in the backup by default.

Additionally describe why ReaR's VAR\_DIR/output is excluded.

Also describe why the `'/directory/*'` form is used, cf.

@schlomo  
thank you for your prompt review!

@jsmeix I don't get why you need it. You wrote:

BUT, in usr/sbin/rear there is already  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2e663e8705b1cd3dc8a849bae3fb02a9f4a4f017/usr/sbin/rear\#L636](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2e663e8705b1cd3dc8a849bae3fb02a9f4a4f017/usr/sbin/rear#L636)

which should be sufficient with respect to the reasoning above (although
not equivalent since there may be leftover build directories from
previous ReaR runs).

@pcahyna  
what would I do without your careful review :-)

Yes, of course, you are right - and  
my change was basically completely wrong :-(

I guess I had leftover build directories from  
my various previous "rear -D mkbackup" runs  
and didn't pay careful attention to the exact  
directory names.

Yes, yes, I know, I know:  
One should not do "by the way" changes  
while one is actually working on something else.  
One should do one thing at a time, step by step,  
each one carefully and thoroughly - in theory.  
In practice...

I will fix my mess with a subsequent pull request.
