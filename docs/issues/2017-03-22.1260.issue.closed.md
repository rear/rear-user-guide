Centos 7 minimal OS. ReaR format seems to work when looking at it's log
and the console output. As does mkrecover. However, the drive is not
bootable and also, its not mountable.

The ReaR log issues a warning about alignment and performance, but no
errors. It does label the device as REAR-000. I see this when I insert
the device into a different machine. It must have been writable. I don't
see any data though?  
It sets a maximal mount count to -1 ? and continues to finish after 306
seconds.

Attempting to mount the device as ext3 or 4 fails/  
I've noted in the syslog output it refers to ext4 though the dialog
says  
Type exactly 'Yes' to format /dev/sdb with ext3 filesystem:

/var/log/rear/rear-<machinename>.log attached.  
[REAR\_log.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/862318/REAR_log.txt)

I see it says it's writing a master boot record of type msdos to
/dev/sdb.

Any help greatly appreciated.

Hi @ipcctv,

1.  try to fill issue template, it helps when (at least) I try to
    reproduce issues ...
2.  try to run `rear mkbackup` and test if booting works (I have a dim
    feeling that you need to run `rear mkbackup` at least once when
    launching ReaR for first time after `rear format`)

Hi Gozora. I thought I had and attached them - sorry. Er the more than
excellent news is that I've done the mkbackup and then a recovery. All
seems fine, so thank you very much for that and the quick response. My
remaining issue seems to be when I try to mount it on my HP system, it
will not have it. It says it's mounting as read/only, being write
protected and says it has a file system type of null.

What I did was to make a subdirectory off /mnt called usbtest and then
typed variout things like  
mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb /mnt/usbtest and same with -t ext4 and also no
option to the -t. All the above but as follows mount -t /dev/sdb /mnt

What confuses me also is that putting the usb stick into a laptop seems
fine. Whatever the outcome, thanks and I'm further along!!

Tom/

As per previous post, I also tried the -t ext4 and no option to the
-t.  
The error when trying to mount is

<pre>
[root@btpevtlk01 sbin]# mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb /mnt
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
</pre>

and the dmesg output is

@ipcctv  
I cannot help with specific issues how to mount something.  
Because you wrote "minimal OS" and you got  
a "missing ... helper program" error message  
I guess your "minimal OS" is too minimal. See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755)

In general regarding how to use a USB medium, see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

In particular regarding what "rear format" results,  
see the various USB\_DEVICE... variables  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

I think the issue is sufficiently answered  
so that I close it.

@ipcctv  
I noticed that you wrote

<pre>
mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb /mnt
</pre>

Usually this cannot work because there is no  
filesystem on /dev/sdb (that is the whole disk)  
but a filesystem is e.g. on /dev/sdb1 (first partition)  
or /dev/sdb2 (second partition) ...

jsmeix, thanks. Now I feel stupid :-) I should and do know better -
normally. That's what you get when you try to do too many jobs at once.
But thanks to everybody too for sharing your time/skills. Tom.

@ipcctv  
don't worry.  
The same kind of things happen also to me.  
My preferred way is to think "long and careful" about something,  
then I finally ask a "well founded" question on a public forum and  
a short time after I had made my "current state of mind" public,  
I see who (not what) the root cause is ;-)

Many thanks for your feedback that now things work for you.
