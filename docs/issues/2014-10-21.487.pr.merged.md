While recover a system to a smaller disk, we get the following error
message:

    Error: You requested a partition from 47.5GB to 50.4GB.
    The closest location we can manage is 47.5GB to 50.4GB.
    2014-10-14 11:02:29 An error occurred during layout recreation.

We tried then to create the partition by hand with unit B

    # parted -s /dev/sdg unit B mkpart '"logical"' 47517990912B 50419088135B
    Error: You requested a partition from 47517990912B to 50419087872B.
    The closest location we can manage is 47517991424B to 50419087872B.

    # echo '47517991424 - 47517990912' | bc
    512

As you can see, parted needs 512B empty space before the partition start
point.  
After adding one block to $start it works without a problem.
