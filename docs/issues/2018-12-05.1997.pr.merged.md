Fix an error due to missing `$TMP_DIR/` before
`$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME`.  
This prevents the ISO to be generated because of `initrd` cannot be
found.

We miss this one ... maybe because I mostly use PXE to test ReaR on
Power....  
If you agree, I would like to merge this one ASAP.

@schabrolles  
many thanks for testing OUTPUT=ISO on PPC64LE!

FYI:  
Currently I fail to see via my "usual forensics" using  
`git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/800_create_isofs.sh`  
how that could have ever worked or when it became broken again  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/109](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/109)

I have the dim feeling I may have had messed it up  
at the time when I introduced REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME?

@jsmeix I don't know either how it could have worked before (I'm sure it
was working...)  
Maybe some script like `800_create_isofs.sh` were previously executed
inside the $TMP\_DIR...
