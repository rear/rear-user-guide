-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    rear-1.17.2-1.el7.noarch
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL-7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

<!-- -->

    [root@rearclient ~]# cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://192.168.122.129/rear
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.168.122.129/rear
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"

    [root@rearclient ~]# cat /etc/rear/.cifs
    username=root 
    password=root

-   Brief description of the issue:

Rescue image does not contain cifs credentials file specified during
image & backup creation which causes an error during the backup
restoration procedure. Even though this file can be manually recreated
in rear's rescue shell, you should consider adding it to the final
rescue image, especially when it is explicitly mentioned in the man page
under BACKUP\_URL=cifs:// section.

Regardless that I don't know about cifs:

In general when something is missing  
in the rear recovery system ("rescue image"),  
you can specify what you need therein via

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2 )
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" program1 program2 )
</pre>

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

For an example you may have a look at  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf

In particular to get those automatocally for cifs  
you need to implement something appropriate  
in the rear scripts that works for you and  
then provide that as Github pull request.

@tcerna  
does it work for you with appropriate COPY\_AS\_IS  
and/or REQUIRED\_PROGS settings?

No feedback.  
Assuming no news is good news.  
Closing.

By chance I noticed in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issue-167618522](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issue-167618522)

<pre>
BACKUP_URL="cifs://192.168.0.13/g/BACKUPS/rear"
BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/creds"
</pre>

I tested what happens when one has

<pre>
etc/rear/.cifs
</pre>

versus

<pre>
etc/rear/cifs
</pre>

and - guess what - etc/rear/.cifs does not get  
automatically copied into the rear recovery system  
but etc/rear/cifs gets automatically copied into  
the rear recovery system.

Therefore there is a bug in the man page.  
Instead of using a dot file it should describe  
using a normal file name.

The reason is in  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/10\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
that code:

<pre>
### Copy configuration directory
mkdir $v -p $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear
cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/ >&2
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/947)
merged  
I consider the issue to be fixed.

@jsmeix what prevents us from doing
`cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/   $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/ >&2` to also include the dot
files? And, the `mkdir` line wouldn't be needed as well then...

@gdha  
there are no comments in the code that explain  
why the code is as it is so that I cannot know  
why dot files are not copied.  
I assumed this behaviour is intentional but I did not want  
to do forensics in this case to find out what might be  
actually meant with this code.  
Therefore I simply adapted the documentation to match  
what the current code does.

FYI, some forensics:  
git log -p usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/10\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
shows this inital commit where that code was added:

<pre>
commit 28bac7ad4e6ab67e4e955fec27fc3556082c896e
Author: Jeroen Hoekx <jeroen@hoekx.be>
Date:   Wed Apr 3 11:39:56 2013 +0200
    Add option to set configuration directory from command line.
...
+### Copy configuration directory
+mkdir $v -p $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear
+cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/
</pre>

a bit later it was changed to

<pre>
+cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/ >&2
</pre>

Perhaps it never was intentional that dot files are not copied?

@gdha  
when $CONFIG\_DIR is not '/etc/rear' wouldn't then

<pre>
cp .. $CONFIG_DIR/* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc
</pre>

be wrong because shouldn't then also the $CONFIG\_DIR  
value be used as target directory in the recovery system?

@jsmeix indeed you are right - forget about it - close it again

@jsmeix Sorry couldn't help to get files starting with a dot on-board:  
`cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/.[a-z]* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/ >&2`  
It is working - now I'm pleased as well:

    # ls -a /tmp/rear.Pp6tp8LYOttYS0c/rootfs/etc/rear
    .  ..  .cifs  local.conf  local-lab-with-bareos.conf  local-with-nfs.conf  os.conf  rescue.conf

For me it is perfectly fine when it also works for dot files.
