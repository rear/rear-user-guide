##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

\#3276

-   How was this pull request tested?

Manually on OL9u3 with secure boot and on Ubuntu 22 and openSUSE Leap
15.4 without secure boot

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

use `mokutil` to check for secure boot and guess the shim file - failing
back to the previous behaviour if this doesn't work.

probably \#3277 is a better or more complete implementation, however
this one just adds a single file to automate the configuration that I
had to add manually so far.

I need to check why is my approach so much more complicated than this,
but IIRC this is related to the code comment:

    # The good solution would check the EFI variables for the bootloader
    # that is used to boot the system. But this is not implemented yet for
    # secure boot.
    #
    # The code in usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh
    # could be used as a starting point for this, however currently
    # it tries to read the actual boot loader# used only as a last resort
    # if well-known files are not found.

Indeed, in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3277](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3277)
I check whether the EFI variables point to the shim as the initial
bootloader, and use file pattern matching only as last resort.

Rescue system boots and shows secure boot to be active:

@pcahyna to summarise: I'd suggest merging this as a step towards better
secure boot support. It is meant as a simple fix to autoconfigure the
shim. Nothing more.

@pcahyna I thought about what you wrote and here is another idea: What
about unconditionally using the shim if it is available?

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/76791f9b1a821ed019063ced48e502ba9a468857/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/370\_detect\_secure\_boot.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/76791f9b1a821ed019063ced48e502ba9a468857/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/370_detect_secure_boot.sh)
I tried to put this together and this code managed to recover a
non-secure-boot Ubuntu 22.04 on a secure boot recovery system,
effectively migrating the system onto secure boot :-)

I still have a problem with it: On a non-secure boot system with shim
the grub menu doesn't load automatically, but the system stops at the
grub prompt.

Only as a minor side note by the way:  
I am wondering if the right spelling is:  
'secure boot' or 'Secure Boot'?  
Curently we use both in ReaR (and also 'Secure booting').  
But  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI\#Secure\_Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot)  
indicates the right spelling is 'Secure Boot'.

@schlomo  
thank you for this valuable improvement step!

I do fully agree with your reasoning in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3277\#issuecomment-2232537772](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3277#issuecomment-2232537772)

Better moving forward little step by little step  
(usually two steps forward, one step back and one step sideways)  
than to not move forward at all.

In particular in this case where all is ReaR internal code  
(except the small info comment in default.conf)  
we can later "just" adapt and enhance things as we like.

@schlomo what do you mean? The GRUB menu of the recovered system, or of
the rescue image? And is it a problem only with your alternative
implementation at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/76791f9b1a821ed019063ced48e502ba9a468857/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/370\_detect\_secure\_boot.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/76791f9b1a821ed019063ced48e502ba9a468857/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/370_detect_secure_boot.sh)
or also with the current changes in this PR?

In any case, I would consider this a serious regression - the current
code just works on a non Secure Boot with shim (except that after
recovery the bootloader is set to GRUB directly bypassing the shim, as I
already mentioned earlier - but the system works fine).

that was only with the alternative implementation that used the shim
whenever found. I'll double check to be sure.
