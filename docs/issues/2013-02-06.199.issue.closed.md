Since 1.1x rear mounts the filesystems while the recover with the
originated mount options. I have a problem with the final chroots for
mkinitrd and grub. I use SLES11 SP2 and mount the "normal" filesystems
due to some security advices with the "nodev" option.  
So when there is done the chroot to /mnt/local the /dev doesn't work and
there are errors from the mkinitrd part (only cosmetic) but also from
the part the grub configuration because grub says the device does not
exist and he does nothing.

Since I was not able to mount a udev or devfs to /mnt/local/dev quickly
like its done for /proc, I solved it by overwriting the "nodev" with
"dev" for / in the disklayout.conf

Here's my change in layout/save/GNU/Linux/23\_filesystem\_layout.sh

        options=${options#(} 
        options=${options%)} 

>        # Don't mount the original root fs with nodev, chroot for initrd and grub won't work 
>        if [[ $mountpoint = "/" ]]; then 
>         options=$(echo $options|sed 's/nodev/dev/') 
>        fi 
>         echo -n " options=$options" 

Please feel free to adopt this change. Maybee a better place to solve
this problem is not when writing the disklayoutfile, but when reading
it. It would also be possible to do a remount before the chroots, but I
thought this would be the place nodev is removed thoroughly.

I had an adittional problem.

In my old environment (SELS10, rear 1.7.23, TSM-Backup with TSM-Client
6.2) a rear recover produced a ISO of about 40MB. In my new environment
(SLES11, rear 1.14 and TSM Backup with TSM-Client 6.4) the ISO is about
175MB!

Some of the groth is about SLES11, some is about rear (packaging all
storage and network drivers into the iso). But most of the growth is
caused by the new TSM Client which has a lot of huge libs. I had to
enlarge my /tmp and /var filesystems to run rear recover successfully.  
Therefor I exclude some files via COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_TSM in my
local.conf

COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_TSM=(
/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/libTsmViSdk.so
/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/libTsmViSdk.so
/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/libtypes.so
/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/plugins64/libdiskLibPlugin.so )

TSM-Restore works without them and the ISO shrinked to 100MB

Maybee you can add this in the default.conf, (maybee as comment) to give
users a hint where to start.

@dagwieers @jhoekx What are your opinions about the "nodev" issue?

Let's just ignore the `nodev` option in
13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh.

Not quite tested the fix. Please reopen if the issue is still present.
