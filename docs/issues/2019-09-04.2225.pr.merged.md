@goldzahn indeed that makes sense. If @jsmeix agrees we can merge it

@jsmeix I followed your recommendations and changed
framework-functions.sh and also 200\_check\_tmpfs.sh, build rpm again
and tested rear -v -d mkrescue successfully , but I cannot test the
duplicity part, so I cannot guarantee for that working properly.

@goldzahn  
thank you for your contribution!

Neither can I test anything that belongs to third party backup
software  
because neither do I use nor do I have such software so that such code  
improvements must be done without testing.  
But we all looked at the plain code changes and when noone of us  
noticed a possible issue with the changes, things should work.
