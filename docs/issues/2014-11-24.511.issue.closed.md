I'm not sure if this is the correct place to write this, but I am having
difficulty in configuring the bconsole.conf portion for use with rear.

Do I configure my clients /etc/bareos/bconsole.conf with the same
Director and password that the Bareos server uses? If so, I am getting
the following message

    24-Nov 17:02 planetx-dir JobId 0: Fatal error: bsock.c:131 Unable to connect to Client: hale-bopp-fd on 192.168.1.10:9102. ERR=Connection refused

How do others configure this?

Perhaps have a peek at
[http://www.bareos.org/en/HOWTO/articles/relax-and-recover-with-bareos.html](http://www.bareos.org/en/HOWTO/articles/relax-and-recover-with-bareos.html)

I was able to finally connect. I'll create some documentation on the
process as it was unclear to me.

Something else I noticed was that during a Bareos restore, the
BAREOS\_CLIENT variable in

    /usr/share/rear/restore/BAREOS/default/40_restore_backup.sh

looks for the entire hostname string in /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf.
Shouldn't hostname -s typically be used instead of the FQDN?

Here is an example of what I mean.

    [root@hale-bopp ~]# BAREOS_CLIENT=$(grep $(hostname) /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf | awk '/-fd/ {print $3}' )
    [root@hale-bopp ~]# echo $BAREOS_CLIENT

    [root@hale-bopp ~]# BAREOS_CLIENT=$(grep $(hostname -s) /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf | awk '/-fd/ {print $3}' )
    [root@hale-bopp ~]# echo $BAREOS_CLIENT
    hale-bopp-fd

Thank you for the response thus far.

@pgporada I think that @aussendorf or @joergsteffens are better placed
to give an answer on your question.

That is actually a bug which I will fix within the next few days. Also,
I will add a configuration option to specify the client name directly.

@sebastianlederer Any luck with an update to rear yet?

Sorry for the late reply, it has been quite a busy week.

The (trivial) fix is in my rear fork, but I still had no chance to test
it.

Hopefully I will get to it till the end of this week.

Best regards,

Sebastian Lederer

Finally got around testing the fix, found a new bug and fixed that too.
Tests are ok now.
