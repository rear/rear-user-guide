@hpannenb  
thank you for your continuous improvements  
of the NSR related code in ReaR!

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections from other ReaR maintainers  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

@hpannenb  
FYI regarding setting a variable to a default/fallback value  
unless the user had it already set, you may have a look at  
how I try to achieve that in default.conf via

    test "$VAR" || VAR="default_value"

for example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L226](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L226)
