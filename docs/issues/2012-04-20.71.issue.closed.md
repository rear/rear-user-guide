The swap partition also gets shrunk in auto\_resize\_disks.sh. In my
case it's a little 1GB partition and I want to work with a minimum of
1GB of swap on all my systems because I dont want to have the OOM Killer
killing my processes too early :-)

I have been looking at the implementation. It is not going to be easy to
do this without an almost complete rewrite. That is why I am moving this
out of the v1.14 milestone.

Here is the workaround i am using, i think it will not work when there
are multiple swap partitons per device and it does not log anything like
"will not resize swap partiton":

/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/40\_autoresize\_disks.sh  
line 45 new:  
done &lt; &lt;(grep "^part $device" $LAYOUT\_FILE | grep -v $(grep
"^swap $device" $LAYOUT\_FILE | cut -d' ' -f 2))

original:  
done &lt; &lt;(grep "^part $device" $LAYOUT\_FILE)

@jhoekx Jeroen - is the above solution the way to go for this issue? Or,
is it too quick and dirty?

It's a creative workaround :-)

It looks like it doesn't cause any problems in other cases once you add
a space after `swap $device`, so if it solves this particular issue...

@kpieth any feedback is welcome  
@jhoekx adding an extra space character after `swap $device` result in
an error as the `grep -v` is empty.
