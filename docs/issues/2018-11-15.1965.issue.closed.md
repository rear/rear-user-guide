Hi there, i got the following issue. It's strange because on a similar
system it works fine.

    it):  
    rear -v mkrescue failes with the error:

there seems some strange with the rear path, eg, the logfile is full of
control+M or ^M., for example:

<pre>
++ [[ -z file:///opt/re**ar^M** ]]
cp -v /tmp/rear.bHyZIJCRlJSjtrL/tmp/README $'/opt/rear\r/sgrtsrv460/'
</pre>

that seems pretty strange to me (note the \\r in the path)

Probably your config file includes some special character in the:

<pre>
OUTPUT_URL=file:///opt/rear
</pre>

line?

Hi Michael, you were right, it was the solution! I've pasted the
local.conf from my notepad++ and the default linebreaks were set to
\\r\\n. I've changed them to \\n. replaced the local.conf on the system
and not it runs fine. Thank you!

@jsmeix perhaps we should add a small scan on the local.conf file on
these copy/paste things from windows (Ctrl-M) as it is not the first
time these smaller annoying issues pop-up?

@abbbi  
many thanks for your analysis and for finding the root cause!

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1965\#issuecomment-439306377](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1965#issuecomment-439306377)  
this issue is solved.

@sandroLuk  
FYI:  
In ReaR also all config files are read and executed  
as bash scripts via `source` cf. "Character encoding" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
source\` had failed

@gdha  
I had a quick look how one could implement a (hopefully) simple sanity
check  
when all config files are read in sbin/rear in "Combining configuration
files"  
but I think this is not possible with reasonable effort because  
on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system which is like SLES12:

<pre>
# unix2dos -n etc/rear/local.conf etc/rear/local.dos.conf
unix2dos: converting file etc/rear/local.conf to file etc/rear/local.dos.conf in DOS format...

# bash -n etc/rear/local.conf && echo OK || echo FAILED
OK

# bash -n etc/rear/local.dos.conf && echo OK || echo FAILED
OK

# source etc/rear/local.conf && echo OK || echo FAILED
OK

# source etc/rear/local.dos.conf && echo OK || echo FAILED
' is not a typo you can use command-not-found to lookup the package that contains it, like this:
    cnf 
FAILED
</pre>

Accordingly simple `bash -n` is insufficient.  
One must actually `source` the file to see if it is valid.

Actually `source` the file is done in sbin/rear at "Combining
configuration files"  
but in this case here `source` did not show an error because  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2584647/rear-sgrtsrv460.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2584647/rear-sgrtsrv460.log)  
reads:

<pre>
2018-11-15 10:17:48.359177828 Including /etc/rear/local.conf
2018-11-15 10:17:48.360697084 Entering debugscripts mode via 'set -x'.
+ source /etc/rear/local.conf
++ OUTPUT=$'ISO\r'
++ OUTPUT_URL=$'file:///opt/rear\r'
++ GRUB_RESCUE=$'1\r'
+ test 1
+ Debug 'Leaving debugscripts mode (back to previous bash flags and options settings).'
</pre>

But I wonder about the `Source` function in lib/framework-functions.sh  
that currently blindly proceeds if `source` fails at

<pre>
    # The actual work (source the source file):
    source "$source_file"
</pre>

if ReaR should not better error out here when `source` fails  
because I cannot imagine how things could further work at all  
when already `source` had failed for a script or a config file,  
cf. "Try to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@gdha  
regarding wong values for config variables (as in this case here):

It needs to be checked individually in the code/scripts  
that deal with a particular config variable if its value is valid.  
E.g. for file names like `test -e "$FILE_NAME_VARIABLE" || ...`  
(the double quotes are mandatory for this kind of `test`).

@gdha  
I found out why in current ReaR the Source function in
lib/framework-functions.sh  
must blindly proceed when `source` fails (i.e. when `source` returns
with an  
non-zero exit code) because in current ReaR scripts usually "blindly
return"  
the exit code of the last command and currently we do not care about  
that exit code.

In current ReaR code things work pefectly o.k. when a script finished  
intentionally with a last command that results non-zero exit code.

Also for config files that is possible and currently allowed like

<pre>
FOO="$( ls qqqq )"
</pre>

as last assignment in local.conf which results:

<pre>
# source etc/rear/local.conf && echo OK || echo FAILED
ls: cannot access 'qqqq': No such file or directory
FAILED
</pre>

I will add an explanatory comment to the Source function  
in lib/framework-functions.sh why `source` therein must  
blindly proceed if it returns with non-zero exit code.

see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1542](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1542)  
where a few of those cases are already fixed  
(only those where a script explicitly calls `return`).

Finally - I should have done that initially - I even had a look at  
usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
and I think things are perfectly right therein because  
it errors out when things failed.

I only noticed that we should use LogPrint in  
`case "$scheme" in (nfs|cifs|usb|file|sshfs|ftpfs|davfs)`  
to show the user what will be done as in the other cases.

Converting a `local.conf` file into DOS format (extra Carriage Return
character \[^M or \\r\] after the linefeed):

    # unix2dos -o local.conf

Running rear results in:

    ERROR: Problem transferring result files to rsync://gdha@nas/volume1/homes/gdha/rsync^M

However, a plain `source` of the DOSified `local.conf` file will not
show any errors:

    # source local.conf && echo OK || echo FAIL
    OK

An easy check to see whether it contains ^M is with the `od` utility
(should be part of coreutils and standard available on all Linux
flavours):

    # od -x local.conf.good | grep -q 0d && echo Ctrl-M found || echo File is good
    File is good
    # od -x local.conf | grep -q 0d && echo Ctrl-M found || echo File is good

@gdha  
thanks for your additional testing!

Interestingly your result differs from mine which is good  
because now we see how difficult it is in practice  
to develop a good and simple test.

You don't need the big `od` hammer ;-)  
to check for a single byte value,  
`tr` (which is already used at many places in ReaR)  
is sufficient:

<pre>
# test "$( echo -e "First\nSecond\nLast" | unix2dos | tr -d -c '\r' )" && echo CR found
CR found
</pre>

Accordingly we could do in sbin/rear something like

<pre>
for config in site local rescue ; do
    if test -r "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" ; then
        # Delete all characters except '\r' and error out if the resulting string is not empty:
        test "$( tr -d -c '\r' < $CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf )" && Error "Carriage return character in $CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf (perhaps DOS or Mac format)"
        Source "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" || true
    fi
done
</pre>

and similar at the other places where config files are read.

Perhaps @schlomo may even know a plain bash-only method?

The only place in ReaR where `od` is mentioned (but not used) is  
in the comments of the function percent\_encode() in
lib/global-functions.sh  
so that we should avoid to introduce using `od` in particular when it
is  
used in sbin/rear we need `od` mandatorily in the recovery system.
