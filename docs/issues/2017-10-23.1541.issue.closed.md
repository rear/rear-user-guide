Using Relax and Recover 2.2 running on Debian 8.9 64 bit  
Install from repository and all dependencies met, however try to just
run "rear -v" results in error log below, no matter what I run, just
getting this error, seems to be a dependency error, but not sure  
from the log:

As ReaR already stated you are missing required program `file`.  
`sudo apt-get install file` should do the trick.

I guess that not all program needed by ReaR are enforced during
installation. To avoid repeating *rear mkbackup -&gt; error -&gt;
package install* situations, I install LSB package that contains almost
all progs needed by ReaR.  
It should be `sudo apt-get install lsb-base` on Debian.

V.

Thanks again, I really though "file" was missing another piece to it and
never though to just install "file", once added that did the trick,
thanks for the quick support and tip on the LSB package
