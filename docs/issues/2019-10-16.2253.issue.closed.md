While working on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2252](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2252)  
there in particular while I did a "by the way" overhaul of  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
I noticed that both scripts abort 'rear recover'  
when the user did an invalid date or time input.

I think this is too hard and unfriendly in this particular case.

I think if possible there should be an endless retry loop  
until the user provided valid input (or intentionally aborts).

As an example how the user could retry things in case of failures see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh)  
how the user can run the disk layout recreation code (diskrestore.sh)  
again and again until it succeeds or the user aborts 'rear recover',
cf.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2257](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2257)
merged plus  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/08f59566a968681771b64bfc5c791b34b8384cf5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/08f59566a968681771b64bfc5c791b34b8384cf5)  
I think this issue is solved as far as possible for me for now  
and hopefully even without regressions.

I would appreciate it if ReaR users in particular those who  
use BACKUP=TSM or BACKUP=NBU or BACKUP=GALAXY10  
could test that changes as long as ReaR 2.6 is still under development  
and report if there are regressions so that I can fix them,  
preferably each one as a new and separated GitHub issue.
