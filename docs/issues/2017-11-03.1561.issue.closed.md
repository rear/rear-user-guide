#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 7, but
    doesn't matter here
-   Brief description of the issue:

The Teaming interface code (360\_teaming.sh) doesn't support VLans,
Bridges, Bonds, etc, because the code has been split from
310\_network\_devices.sh.  
This is a heavy limitation of the feature.

@rmetrich  
according to what

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/360_teaming.sh
</pre>

shows me the 360\_teaming.sh script was  
not split from 310\_network\_devices.sh  
but the 360\_teaming.sh script was created  
separated from scratch via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2cac34fd4f2277cd1095d5ff3f0dd4272f2bb4eb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2cac34fd4f2277cd1095d5ff3f0dd4272f2bb4eb)

I assume your intent is to merge the code in 360\_teaming.sh  
into the 310\_network\_devices.sh script so that afterwards  
the Teaming interface code also supports all what  
310\_network\_devices.sh already supports?

@jsmeix Exactly, I'd like teaming to just work in all contexts.  
If merging in 310\_network\_devices.sh is acceptable, I'll go ahead and
propose a patch.

@rmetrich  
I look forward to your pull request!

At least I accept basically anything that improves ReaR  
(even up to dirty hacks that intend to make things work)  
provided the code is well explained, cf.

@jsmeix FIY, new code currently being tested:  
[https://github.com/rmetrich/rear/tree/Team](https://github.com/rmetrich/rear/tree/Team)  
Adds support for crazy setups!

@rmetrich  
I had a quick look at your new code and I am very impressed mainly  
because of your good explanation what your code should do.  
For me on a first glance it looks very good to do such a  
general overhaul and re-implementation and I appreciate  
your efforts very much.

But my networking knowledge is only about some basic stuff  
so that I cannot really review if the new code is actually o.k.

Therefore other ReaR maintainers with better networking knowledge  
would have to actually review if your new code is o.k.

Because your new code is basically a re-write of  
rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
I think we may have to postpone that big change  
after the current upcoming ReaR 2.3 was released  
(i.e. for the next ReaR 2.4 release) to avoid  
possible (unexpected) regressions in ReaR 2.3.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

@rmetrich  
many thanks for cleaning up scatteded pieces of code  
that actually belong to one same functionality  
into one piece of code in one single script.
