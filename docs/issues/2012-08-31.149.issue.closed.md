hi,

after successful 'rear -v mkbackup" and burning ISO and booting from CD
and after login, I try to 'mount.cifs' and getting error message: mount
error(2) no such file or directory ???

my system is openSUSE 12.1 in out of ISO installation with
rear-1.13.0-13.noarch.rpm installed.

regards,  
bernd

Is it possible to try the same with the latest snapshot release ? You
can use the OpenSUSE RPM packages for this too from the Snapshot
repository. It is likely going to fail in the same way, but I'd like to
be sure as the upcoming 1.14 will have lots of improvements.

I'am frustrated,

same with snapshot version and all other versions.  
same at openSUSE 11.4 in out of ISO installation.  
'rear -v mkbackup' works fine with cifs share, after booting from CD and
try to mount.cifs with same share gives error: mount error(2) no such
file or directory ?  
this sucks really, I spend now many days and CDs and no resolution, I
have no further idea.

dmesg gives:  
CIFS VFS: could not allocate crypto hmacmd5  
CIFS VFS: could not setup hash structures rc -2  
CIFS VFS: cifs\_mount failed w/return code = -2

Your issue seems to be related to this message
`CIFS VFS: could not allocate crypto hmacmd5`.

To me that suggests that CIFS (a kernel module) is lacking some crypto
module, likely `tcrypt`.

Have you tried doing: `modprobe tcrypt` before doing the restore ?  
If that does not make a difference, you could also try doing:
`modprobe -v --all -t crypto`.

From some reports about this exact error, it might also be related to
anonymous (guest) CIFS access. As a test, you might want to test using a
username/password (see the documentation on how to configure
Relax-and-Recover to use CIFS credentials).

Please do report back.

I do not use guest account, I have created a user 'rear' with password
access.  
I will try your suggestion and report back.

Strike the comment about tcrypt and the crypto modules, it had
references to md5 and hmac, but it's a test module so it does not offer
anything. As far as I can tell the crypto stuff used in cifs does not
come from kernel infrastructure.

One option is to see if you can provide a different `sec=` option to
your mount command line, but if all else fail we may have to wait until
we have OpenSUSE test infrastructure to mimic this behavior an debug
ourselves.

-   solved

the kernel-crypto-md5 module is not loaded and is missing in rescue
image, the solution for openSUSE is to preload the module on startup in
/etc/sysconfig/kernel and it will be included in rescue image and
mount.cifs works.

what is exactly the kernel module name? Use `lsmod | grep md5` and paste
the output. In our prep phase we have to make sure this kernel module is
copied to the rescue image.

the module is md5, /lib/modules/{kernel-version}/kernel/crypto/md5.ko

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/388198?u=0732dee3fe5002278cfbf40359ec431bdcf5f06c&v=4" width="50">[dagwieers](https://github.com/dagwieers) commented at [2012-09-04 08:07](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/149#issuecomment-8255468):

I have two concerns:

-   RHEL (and others) include this functionality in the kernel, not as a
    separate module, so a solution is specific to one or more
    distributions
-   If cifs.ko depends on md5.ko, it should have a dependency set (seems
    to be a bug/oversight in the kernel)

I would take this up with the distribution. Can you open a ticket with
OpenSUSE asking why the cifs.ko module does not depend on md5.ko ? Why
they don't compile it as part of the kernel ? And how does OpenSUSE make
sure it gets loaded when a user on OpenSUSE needs mount.cifs ? With this
I mean, "how does the distribution handle this lack of dependencies",
rather than "how does the user work around the problem".

I would hate to see us implement something specific for OpenSUSE if the
problem is in fact a kernel issue (which might already be fixed with
newer kernels and/or which might affect other distributions too).

If we really need a solution that covers everything, I would suggest to
include the crypto-drivers as part if the stock drivers we include (much
like storage and network).

there is no problem with mount.cifs in openSUSE in 11.4 or 12.1 when
needed, this works fine.  
the problem is, that rear does not include the md5 module in rescue
image, when it was not loaded at the moment of the creation of the
rescue image.  
for rear, I would prefer your last suggestion, to include the
crypto-drivers as part of the stock modules.

@berndg There is no problem because OpenSUSE (somehow) preloads md5.ko.
The real problem is that cifs.ko does not depend on md5.ko and thus gets
not loaded automatically. Maybe there is a good reason for not having
this dependency and that's maybe why Red Hat decided to compile it into
the kernel.

Just look at:

    [dag@moria rear]$ grep cifs /lib/modules/2.6.32-279.5.2.el6.x86_64/modules.dep
    kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko:

What is apparent from the 'modules.dep' file is that there is no single
general-purpose module that depends on crypto modules, so I think there
is a purpose in not having these dependencies.

In the meantime I added some code to include *all* crypto modules (about
1MB on my system) on the rescue image, but that does not guarantee
md5.ko is being loaded (yet).

I need to reopen this issue as the modules are not automatically loaded,
yet.

openSUSE does not preload md5 module, it is only loaded when needed acc.
use of mount.cifs and corresponding answer of cifs share.  
also rear must not load it automatically but it must be available for
loading therefore it must be included and referenced in rescue image .  
best choice would be that all crypto modules are be available for
loading.

Ok, I misunderstood. The above fix should help in that case. If this fix
does not solve your issue, feel free to reopen the issue.

Thanks for your help in getting it fixed !

just a last comment about this:  
we do have a script
`usr/share/rear/rescue/NETFS/default/39_check_crypto_modules.sh` which
is supposed to be taken care of the CIFS crypto stuff. If the script
becomes obsolete now, we better remove it, right?

Ouch, I was not aware there was a special case already implemented. The
question begs, should we make this specific to the CIFS case, or not. Is
a 1MB increase in the size of the rescue image (in all cases) acceptable
or not. I am undecided.

The other question is, why did this particular script fail ? It is clear
that the current fix covers more cases.

Let's reopen to get to the bottom of this :-)

further tests reconfirm my statement.  
<code>local.conf:</code>  
<code>MODULES=("${MODULES\[@\]}" 'md5')</code>  
<code>\#MODULES\_LOAD=()</code>  
when useing mount.cifs md5 is loaded from cifs but it must be included
in rescue image!

IMHO we should automatically include these kinds of modules and not
make  
users include them manually. Some helper modules don't have
dependencies  
because they are loaded by demand, so we should just have a list of
such  
things.

I'm in favour of removing the existing script
`usr/share/rear/rescue/NETFS/default/39_check_crypto_modules.sh` and
include all modules (if I'm not mistaken this is standard behavior in
v1.14 already).  
Do we have an agreement?
