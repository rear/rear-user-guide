This patch enables support for OPAL 2 self-encrypting NVMe disk drives.

I will amend this PR and/or propose merging it as soon as testing
results come in (cf. progress in \#2475).

@OliverO2  
thank you for your improvement in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2488/commits/48669d230486adee85755f92bf5c6a0c5b5a7f92](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2488/commits/48669d230486adee85755f92bf5c6a0c5b5a7f92)

It is such a pleasure for my eyes!  
Perfect code that is 100% to the point with a complete explanatory
comment  
and that with even the same number of characters as my clumsy attempt
before.

Have a nice and relaxed weekend!

@jsmeix  
My pleasure, I just happend to cross-check and found out that `extglob`
is actually enabled throughout ReaR. :-)

Have a nice weekend, too!

Yes, there are some well hidded 'secrets' (like the global `extglob`) in
ReaR.

Right now I adapted the "Beware of the emptiness" section in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so that it now at least mentiones that also `extglob` is globally set as
follows:

    There is a global 'shopt -s nullglob extglob' setting in usr/sbin/rear
    where the 'nullglob' setting means that ...

@OliverO2  
Thanks for providing these patches.  
Previously, the disks were unlocked but "unlocked\_device\_count" did
not increase due to failing partprobe. Thus the password prompt was
showing up again.  
Your patches fix the issue for me (NVMe disks using UEFI boot).

I would like to make you aware that at least in my PBA environment the
shell options nullglob and extglob are NOT set (contrary to the
situation in the booted OS). Thus the shell was complaining about
incorrect syntax.  
Adding "shopt -s nullglob extglob" to the top of "unlock-opal-disks",
re-creation and upload of PBA fixed this issue, but I am not sure if it
is the correct place to put it.

@enzolis  
Thank you so much for your feedback. Good to hear that it works in
general. I'll take care of safely integrating
`shopt -s nullglob extglob`. It is my plan to come up with a
ready-to-merge solution within 7 days.

With the successful test report by @enzolis and the fix for missing
'nullglob extglob' options I'd consider this patch ready to merge.

@rear/contributors  
please have a look.  
Perhaps you see some obvious issues.  
If there are no objections I would like to merge it on Thursday
(05.Oct.2020) afternoon.
