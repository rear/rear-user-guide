Can you tell us which version of Relax-and-Recover you are using?

Errors like these should have been fixed in trunk.

Can you try again with one of the trunk packages from OBS?

Sorry, a bit too early. Now i get another error: 2012-08-17 16:25:35
ERROR: Could not mkdir '/tmp/rear.4ARCJZ1SwL0twwd/outputfs/sm-star1'

That seems to be the same error as in \#146. Let's track it there.

@jetwes I am not convinced this is the same error as in \#146, can you
provide us with a more detailed log ? And the configuration you are
using ? Thanks in advance !

Closing this ticket as it seems to have a relation to \#146 (NFS and
root\_squash).
