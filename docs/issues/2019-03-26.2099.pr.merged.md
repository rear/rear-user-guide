-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system as in  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2088\#issuecomment-474446764](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2088#issuecomment-474446764)  
    and subsequent comments.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

A SUSE colleague found the simplest way to get the current PID  
without using bsh 4.x $BASHPID:

    read current_pid junk </proc/self/stat

This also works even in nested subshells in a sourced script  
and it is simpler than what I had used before

    tmpfile=$( mktemp )
    cat /proc/self/stat >$tmpfile
    current_pid=$( cut -d ' ' -f4 $tmpfile )
    rm $tmpfile

because `read` is a shell builtin (so no parent PID stuff is needed)  
and the `<` stdin redirection does not cause another subshell.

When there are no objections I would like to merge it soon today.
