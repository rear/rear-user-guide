@castilma  
the current actual changes in this pull request  
do not fix something in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
but they fix correctly typos in comments in other files.

Will you add more typo fixes to this pull request  
or is it finished for now so that it could be  
"just merged" right now?

No real bug (a severe typo in documentation could be a real problem)  
so nothing urgent here so I set milestone to ReaR 3.0

Are you referring to my issue with USB\_BOOTLOADER?  
Since it was mentioned that my operating system is not the target
audience, I wasn't sure you were interested in something like:

    --- a/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    +++ b/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    @@ -1231,6 +1231,7 @@ USB_BIOS_BOOT_DEFAULT=""

Maybe that's not needed anymore if PR \#3366 gets merged.

IMHO both this PR and your suggestion in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3364\#issuecomment-2548143415](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3364#issuecomment-2548143415)
are good, happy to see this in 2.8 @jsmeix

I will "just merge" it in about one hour or so  
unless severe objections against "typo fixes in comments" appear ;-)

@castilma  
thank you for your contribution to ReaR!

Also small things like typo fixes matter because  
correct spelling shows that we care about details.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d5b48f30e299049c9e6d5df1d1a19b74b3b8bdcf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d5b48f30e299049c9e6d5df1d1a19b74b3b8bdcf)  
I improved the USB\_BOOTLOADER description in default.conf  
to make it clear that for UEFI with GRUB2 also  
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER must be set appropriately,
