From the logs you've provided I can see that your USB Borg repository
already contains some previous backups (archives), What I mean is that
you've already run some successful backups prior this error. Is that
correct?  
If so, can it be that your USB disk is experiencing some IO errors/HW
problems?  
If not, can you please provide full log from `rear -d -D mkbackup`
session ?

Thanks

V.

You need bigger ESP on your USB device:

Excerpt from the log:

    ++ cp -p -v /tmp/rear.JsEmyhSq6taUJk5/tmp/initrd.cgz /tmp/rear-efi.B2USe//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz
    '/tmp/rear.JsEmyhSq6taUJk5/tmp/initrd.cgz' -> '/tmp/rear-efi.B2USe//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz'
    cp: error writing '/tmp/rear-efi.B2USe//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz': No space left on device
    ...

ReaR controls size of ESP partition by
[USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L863-L873)
variable. Be aware that after updating of USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE, you
need to reformat your USB storage (`rear format ...`), which will
obviously cause DATA LOSS.

@gozora @jsmeix perhaps it would be a nice idea to have something like
[https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/blob/master/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/postexecute/default/96\_call\_for\_action\_after\_preview.sh](https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/blob/master/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/postexecute/default/96_call_for_action_after_preview.sh)
to scan for errors?

Hello @gdha,

I personally don't think it is hard to locate error in ReaR log file,
but if you think that others might benefit, I don't mind.  
Just be aware that running code from
*96\_call\_for\_action\_after\_preview.sh* on ReaR debug log still
returns lot of errors:

    $ ./check_error.sh rear-node2.log | wc -l
    236

That is indeed true, but out of space can be search out of array of the
most common errors for example.

ReaR 2.4 is rather old and the terminal output in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2526\#issuecomment-733962038](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2526#issuecomment-733962038)  
shows that ReaR 2.4. does not have our current ReaR  
enhanced `Error` function behaviour that always shows  
`Some latest log messages since the last called script ...`, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L557](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L557)

I implemented this enhanced `Error` function behaviour via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2420688530e84cf5fbee37b715d9e22bc8ba7f2e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2420688530e84cf5fbee37b715d9e22bc8ba7f2e)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877)  
in ReaR 2.5, see doc/rear-release-notes.txt

    Now the Error function shows some last messages of the last sourced
    script to the user (issues #1877 #1875)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L1419](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L1419)

For an example how current ReaR `Error` function behaviour  
looks like on the user's terminal see the `rear -v mkrescue` output at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2524\#issue-749678000](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2524#issue-749678000)

I assume if @gaia would have used current ReaR  
there would have been some more useful output about the actual error  
on the terminal where "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" was run  
and then this issue report would perhaps have not been needed  
because the root cause would have been directly visible to the user.

I think this issue can be closed and no further attention is needed.

@gdha  
only for the fun of it:  
Your script  
[https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/blob/master/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/postexecute/default/96\_call\_for\_action\_after\_preview.sh](https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/blob/master/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/postexecute/default/96_call_for_action_after_preview.sh)  
is a "no-go" because it contains the forbidden word `WARNING`, cf.  
[https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

@gozora  
thank you for your time requesting ReaR debug log files  
and inspecting them to show the user the root cause!
