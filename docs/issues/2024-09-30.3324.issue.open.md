-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

This is my first time working with ReaR. I'm working with a "test"
system and running through the "rear -v mkrescue" and it appears the iso
is being written but I'm getting three errors or "warning" messages. It
looks like It'd be safe to delete the symlinks in message 1, but I'd
like to verify that it's safe to delete the symlink for message 2, or
does it need to link to a valid grub.cfg file? Does the warning in
message 3 need to be or can it be corrected?

Message 1) Failed to copy all contents of
/lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7.x86\_64 (dangling symlinks could be a
reason)  
Since there the symbolic link point to non-existent files (there are 4
of them).

Message 2) Broken symlink '/etc/grub2.cfg' in recovery system because
'readlink' cannot determine its link target  
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 22 Sep 26 08:37 /etc/grub2.cfg -&gt;
../boot/grub2/grub.cfg  
The target link does not exist, the only thing in /etc/grub2 is grubenv.

Message 3) Did not find /boot/grub2/locale files (minor issue for UEFI
ISO boot)

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Have not tried the recovery yet.

@RLDuckworth Did you already try to boot from the ISO image as a test? I
think it should work.

Good morning,

I was able to boot the ISO image, select Relax-and-Recover (UEFI and
Secure Boot) and it looks like it’s ready to run rear recover. Before I
had been selecting the Relax-and-Recover (BIOS or UEFI without Secure
Boot) and it would not boot.  
Should I be able to boot either one?

I will go ahead and run a rear recover and see what happens. This is all
trial and error right now. Is there a way to determine exactly what
backup will be restored from Rubrik?

We’re making progress. Thanks very much!

Rubrik is an external backup program where I do not have any knowledge
of - sorry.

But should we be able to boot from either menu item - Relax-and-Recover
(UEFI and Secure Boot) or Relax-and-Recover (BIOS or UEFI without Secure
Boot)? I noticed in the ISO creation output, it said Using
'/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi' as UEFI Secure Boot bootloader file
but didn’t say anything about without Secure Boot bootloader file.

Thanks,

You configured it to use **Relax-and-Recover (UEFI and Secure Boot)**,
therefore, that's the way to boot from then.

However, you have a point as well and the ReaR team is aware of it and
it is on our to-do list for improvements. The ISO booting architecture
is 20 years old and need a proper rewrite! However, as always there is a
but, lack of sponsoring, which forces us to lower its priority.

*End users always forget that Open Source contributors need food as well
and that is not free. This is a general remark and is not meant for
you.*
