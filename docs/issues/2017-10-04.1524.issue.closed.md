I am using current ReaR master code.

During recovery system startup I noticed a message about  
'MASKS readonly variable'  
that is soon cleared from the recovery system startup screen  
by the subsequent recovery system login screen.

I found the following piece of code in  
usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh

<pre>
readonly -a MASKS=(
</pre>

but - at least on a first glance - I fail to see where  
that readonly variable would be changed.

I assume the 'MASKS readonly variable' message happens  
because during the recovery system startup  
the 'network-functions.sh' is sourced three times by  
skel/default/bin/dhclient-script  
and also by  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00-functions.sh  
and by  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

@schabrolles  
I think your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b01c8a97cc3b678f815a9a7bac8f061dabfb40a7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b01c8a97cc3b678f815a9a7bac8f061dabfb40a7)  
could be the reason.

Starting the ReaR recovery system in debug mode  
(i.e. with additional kernel commandline parameter 'debug')  
shows that during 58-start-dhclient.sh there is the

<pre>
/usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh: line 7: MASKS: readonly variable
</pre>

message and I think this happens because since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b01c8a97cc3b678f815a9a7bac8f061dabfb40a7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b01c8a97cc3b678f815a9a7bac8f061dabfb40a7)  
/usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh was already sourced  
in 00-functions.sh so that now sourcing it again in  
58-start-dhclient.sh results that 'readonly variable' message.

@gdha  
because skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
is mostly your code I assign this issue also to you  
to have a look how we could fix it properly.
