Hello,  
This is informational only, we use SSHFS to run ReaR for backups. During
a backup, SSHFS creates a working area mount point in /tmp. The mount is
/tmp/rear.xxxxxxxx/outputfs.  
We always run backups during the overnight hours, and noticed files were
being deleted from our backup servers. After searching for three months
on why our backups were deleted we found the issue.  
Redhat 6 & 7 has utilities called **tmpwatch** and **tmpfiles** that run
daily. These utilities delete files greater than 10 days old from `/tmp`
and `/var/tmp`. So during the night when ReaR was backing up a server
and if **tmpwatch** started at the same time, **tmpwatch** would
traverse `/tmp` and delete backups greater that 10 days old on our
backup server.  
The resolution was to change the location of *TMPDIR* in the local.conf.

Thanks,  
John

This is exact reason why I'm not a fan of automatic cleanup scripts.
There is always that "little something" that should not pass the cleanup
filter, but it does (for whatever reason).  
BTW */var/tmp* could be subject for cleanup as well, I'd even say that
is is option \# 2 for cleanup right after */tmp*, so I'd not consider
this final solution either, but that is just matter of taste.

@John-Leone  
many thanks for your information and in particular  
for your explanatory description what goes on  
so that even I - as non Red Hat user - can easily  
understand what goes on on your system.

As far as I understand it it looks as if there is a severe bug  
in that tmpfiles cleaning utility because it seems it does not limit  
its work on the one filesystem where /tmp directly belongs to  
(i.e. that cleaning utility is cossing filesystem boundaries).

As a test on a testing virtual machine where it does not matter  
when it gets destroyed I would mount e.g. /usr/ at /tmp/usrmountpoint  
and watch what that tmpfiles cleaning utility does with files in /usr  
that are older than 10 days ...

I'm in agreement with you, we think this is a Redhat bug.  
I did open a case with Redhat to report this problem.  
Adding the TMPDIR variable will solve this problem for us but I know
anyone using CentOS or Fedora can encounter this problem too.

3.18. /tmp : Temporary files

3.18.1. Purpose
The /tmp directory must be made available for programs
that require temporary files.

Programs must not assume that any files or directories
in /tmp are preserved between invocations of the program.
Rationale

IEEE standard POSIX.1-2008 lists requirements similar
to the above section.

Although data stored in /tmp may be deleted
in a site-specific manner, it is recommended
that files and directories located in /tmp
be deleted whenever the system is booted.

FHS added this recommendation on the basis
of historical precedent and common practice,
but did not make it a requirement because
system administration is not within the scope of this standard.

5.15. /var/tmp : Temporary files preserved between system reboots

5.15.1. Purpose

The /var/tmp directory is made available for programs
that require temporary files or directories that are
preserved between system reboots.
Therefore, data stored in /var/tmp is more persistent
than data in /tmp.

Files and directories located in /var/tmp must not be deleted
when the system is booted. Although data stored in /var/tmp
is typically deleted in a site-specific manner, it is recommended
that deletions occur at a less frequent interval than /tmp.
