-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.2 and higher
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): n/a
-   Brief description of the issue:
    -   script `rescue/default/430_prepare_timesync.sh` needs an update
        with **ntpd** and `/etc/inittab` - today it should become a
        systemd script
    -   secondly, it might be useful to add **NTPDATE** as a third
        possibility to set-up time

Just a quick comment that adding chrony as another option to sync time
may be a good idea since RHEL/CentOS 7.x use chrony by default.

I could help with this or take this on within the next few weeks, if
you'd like.

@N3WWN Hi Richard - indeed chronyd is used by RHEL and ubuntu and for my
rear-automated-testing I just added an ansible playbook for this fact
([https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/commit/ccfd1cf1a3a7690292738542d1cad22536c3f8a9](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/commit/ccfd1cf1a3a7690292738542d1cad22536c3f8a9))  
However, that being said does not mean that our rescue image is chronyd
ready, therefore, your help would be very much appreciated.

The **NTPDATE** feature should be implemented for rear-2.3 as then my
rear automated testing system can compare hours more easily. **Chrony**
is for 2.4 or later.  
Therefore, I change the milestone to 2.3 for the ntpdate update.

@gdha I can start work on the ntpdate feature today and get it to you
ASAP. If I can't get it today, would next week be okay?

@N3WWN Try to do it today, if not then I will check it tomorrow (only
have a few hours before I leave for a trip). We will see - thanks for
your kind offer!

I will be away Thu-Mon which is why I say it may be next week, but will
do what I can today.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1608](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1608)
merged  
the NTPDATE feature is implemented for ReaR 2.3  
so that I close this issue as "fixed/solved/done".

For the further enhancement with Chrony for 2.4 or later  
a separated new issue should be opened.

Roger that @jsmeix ! I will open a new issue when I get back early next
week.
