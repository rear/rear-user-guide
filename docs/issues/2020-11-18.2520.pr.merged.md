-   How was this pull request tested?

Works well for me.  
On my openSUSE Laep 15.1 system I get during "rear -D mkrescue"

    Included current keyboard mapping (via 'dumpkeys -f')
    Included fallback US keyboard mapping /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwerty/defkeymap.map.gz
    Included other keyboard mappings in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps

But I did not test the various failure cases.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Inform the user about possible issues with keyboard usage in the
recovery system  
but use neutral wording for those user messages to avoid false alarm  
except when it fails to include the current keyboard mapping  
(which is no fatal Error because the US keyboard mapping is included as
fallback).

The actual reason behind why the changes here are needed is  
that it seems newer Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu)  
no longer contain any keymaps directory as part of the base system,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519\#issuecomment-729264699](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-729264699)  
so those distros do no longer provide console-multi-keyboard support by
default.  
In such cases ReaR aligns with what there is without being needlessly
verbose.

If the distro provides console-multi-keyboard support, ReaR includes it
(without being verbose).  
If the distro has decided that this is not necessary, ReaR aligns with
it (without being verbose).  
If the user has installed multi-keyboard support, ReaR aligns with it
(without being verbose).  
Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2520\#issuecomment-729681053](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2520#issuecomment-729681053)

Only when including the current keyboard mapping failed (i.e. when
'dumpkeys' failed)  
it shows subsequent messages on the user's terminal in any case (via
LogPrint and LogPrintError)  
but normally it shows subsequent messages only in debug mode (via
DebugPrint).

Thanks for picking this up. I'm now getting these messages on Ubuntu:

    No fallback US keyboard mapping included (no KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY specified)
    No support for different keyboard layouts (neither KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY nor KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES specified)

The wording is certainly better, but it still gives the impression that
something might be wrong here (in particular, as these are the *only*
messages appearing). More importantly:

-   The motivation for these messages may not be apparent to users (see
    below).
-   The messages lack guidance on what to do about it.

Now I try to put myself into two different user's shoes:

-   US keyboard user
    -   "I have a US keyboard. Is this not included? What is a fallback?
        Why should I care about different keyboard layouts at all?"
-   German keyboard user
    -   "I have a German keyboard and never touched anything else. I
        have heard from the older guys that there was a time when US
        keyboards were seen in Germany. Not these days. Why would there
        be a need for some "fallback"?"

So of course, your mileage may vary, but you get the idea.

ReaR's [Coding Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
says:

> Unless usr/sbin/rear was launched with '-v' or '-d' or '-D' **there
> should be no output on the user's terminal**.

Schlomo says in [WARNING is a waste of my
time](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html):

> WARNINGS for most cases only create extra manual work because somebody
> needs to go and check some log file and decide if there actually is a
> problem.

Note: It does not really matter if the word `WARNING` appears. Someone
has to make a decision. If there are two messages, that means spending
time on two decisions. In addition, if there are no directions, if means
investing more time to research the issue.

To summarize:

-   The keyboard issues might no longer be relevant today with `ssh` use
    for rack servers and non-local keyboards being the rare exception
    elsewhere.
-   The notion of having a "fallback keyboard" may not be clear to
    users.
-   If ReaR runs on a system configured for a US keyboard, the message
    `No fallback US keyboard mapping included` is wrong. The standard
    keyboard is the "fallback keyboard".

My conclusions:

-   Two messages is at least one too much.
-   ReaR should not simply complain but rather provide helpful guidance
    on what to do.

Consider my suggestion in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519\#issuecomment-729264699](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2519#issuecomment-729264699):

    TIP: To support different keyboard layouts, see 'KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY' in 'default.conf'.

With a message like this, you could put in additional commentary in
`default.conf` explaining the situation better than any message could
do. There you could describe why a different keyboard layout might need
to be supported and what could be done about it (e.g. installing
packages, setting variables).

@OliverO2  
thank you for your comments!  
I will need some time to think about it.  
As always sleeping over it should help me.

Unless usr/sbin/rear was launched with '-v' or '-d' or '-D'  
there should be no output on the user's terminal  
of course unless there is something important to say to the user  
and because of the reasons in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781)  
my current personal opinion is that messages about possible issues  
with the keyboard in the recovery system are important to notify  
the user in any case.

I may consider your suggestion if at least the `TIP` was removed  
for example something like

    To include different keyboard layouts set KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY (see default.conf)

because personally I hate it when computers give me (unsolicited) tips  
what those machines "think" that I should preferably do.  
"Shut up I am 'root' - I know what I do" ;-)

only when 'dumpkeys' failed it shows subsequent messages on the user's

@OliverO2  
does in now behave better in your environment?

I don't like it so much now because now the code looks somewhat
oversophisticated.  
But I like to find out how to get your needs any my needs aligned as far
as possible.

@jsmeix  
Wow, that must have been a short night! ;-)

I would not call it over-sophisticated, but user-friendly: ReaR now
follows what Linux distributions have decided (and what their users now
are used to). If the distro includes console-multi-keyboard support,
ReaR has it (without asking). If the distro has decided that this is not
necessary, ReaR aligns with that decision. If a user has decided to
install multi-keyboard support, ReaR again will pick it up. Looks just
right.

I ran the new code on my Ubuntu system and now there is no output
appearing. Ideal from my point of view. ReaR does the right thing, I can
relax. ;-)

This is what a had just written before your new commit came in:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take your time!

Now I see that you consider "TIP" as some imperative from a machine
pretending to know better. I have never thought of it that way. For me
"TIP" is just a friendly reminder because the machine does not know what
you might want to do and you might not know what the machine has in
store for you. ;-) I stuck with "TIP" because there are many places in
ReaR where this is used and I wanted to be consistent.

I usually get upset if software starts to throw nonsense at me or if its
programmer was too lazy to figure out what is going on, back-delegates
the decision to me and fails to provide me with necessary information.

@OliverO2  
thank you for your prompt reply.  
I will sleep over it nevertheless and  
if I am still satified with it tomorrow I will "just merge" it.

Regarding the wording `TIP`:

I perceive the wording "TIP" as some kind of patronizing behaviour from
a machine.

For the fun of it a side note:  
I had an uncle in Westphalia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia)  
who told me that one of the things that he doesn't like is  
"a good advice from someone else when things went wrong"  
and what makes him even angy is  
"a good advice that is true from someone else when things went wrong"  
;-)

Regarding your

    I stuck with "TIP" because there are many places in ReaR
    where this is used and I wanted to be consistent

I only find it in your code:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -i 'tip[:]* ' | grep -v 'gethostip'

    usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280_create_bootable_disk_image.sh:
            LogPrintError "TIP: You might achieve loop device partition support by installing the 'kpartx' tool, if available."

    usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/270_create_grub2_efi_bootloader.sh:
        LogPrint "TIP: You can achieve a faster EFI boot by installing syslinux for EFI on this system"

    usr/share/rear/prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001_configure_workflow.sh:
        LogPrintError "TIP: Your system seems to include a Plymouth graphical boot animation. You can achieve a nicer user"

@jsmeix  
Thank you for taking care of it and for going the extra mile.

> I only find it in your code:

Oh, really! It must be because ReaR has become too smart over time. In
the past there was:

-   b3db59e10da3885ac287e41a7c341bab50e08f05 (Florent38 committed on Jul
    17, 2013)
-   c532ab71231647384e973b093560cdd56568bbe5 (dagwieers committed on Jun
    26, 2012)

(Some other TIPs are present in the documentation.)

And I was so convinced that the "TIP" prefix was not my idea at all...
;-)

Guess who removed that `TIP` wording via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/df1d9623f6202f7908e6be8787211b4787626107](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/df1d9623f6202f7908e6be8787211b4787626107)  
:-)

Good evolution:  
From scaring `WARNING` to patronizing `TIP` to nothing :-)

When there is a `TIP` in the documentation I don't perceive it as
patronizing  
because I don't perceive reading documentation as if someone is talking
to me.  
In contrast working on a computer is some kind of dialog with a
machine  
and I don't like to get (unsolicited) good advice from a machine:

    user@host $ rm -rf ~
    Removed all files in your own home directory.
    TIP: Now it's time for having a good backup.

;-)

I tested it with artificial errors and (at least for me) things behave
well  
for "rear mkrescue" / "rear -v mkrescue" / "rear -d mkrescue".

Artificial error in rescue/GNU/Linux/500\_clone\_keyboard\_mappings.sh

    if dumpkeysQQQ -f >$ROOTFS_DIR$original_system_dumpkeys_file ; then

to let that fail.

Artificial error on openSUSE Leap 15.1:

    # mv /usr/share/kbd/keymaps /usr/share/kbd/keymaps.away
