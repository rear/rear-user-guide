After a successful recovery of RHEL we got an error at start-up:

    mount: special device LABEL=/boot/efi does not exist

in (saved) log file I noticed:

    +++ echo -e 'Creating vfat-filesystem /boot/efi on /dev/sda1'
    +++ mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1
    +++ dosfslabel /dev/sda1 options=rw

In the disklayout.sh file the label was saved correctly, but the issue
is that we're missing an uuid entry (or a fake one) so that the label
was the options entry instead.  
To fix this change:

    # diff 23_filesystem_layout.sh /tmp/gratien/23_filesystem_layout.sh
    51c51
    <                 echo -n " uuid= label=$label"

    ---
    >                 echo -n " label=$label"

will test this immediately :-)
