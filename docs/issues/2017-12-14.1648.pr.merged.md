What is the definition of unwanted "noise" from the mount points?

[https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/master/libmount/src/utils.c\#L267](https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/master/libmount/src/utils.c#L267)  
till  
[https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/master/libmount/src/utils.c\#L299](https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/master/libmount/src/utils.c#L299)  
contain more then 3 pseudo file systems "cgroup|fuse.\*|nfsd".

Which of libmount/src/utils.c additional pseudo-FS are also "noise" in
this context?

I have included them all here, with the goal to easily remove the file
systems that are needed are.

If there was a definition I would have written that  
in the comment in the code.  
I introduced the unspecific word

<pre>
"noise"

@ProBackup-nl Why not making an array of **pseudofs** ? A long list as
you proposed looks ugly and is difficult to read. What do you think?

@gdha I have no preference for either array or list, as long as the
items are sorted.

@ProBackup-nl  
many thanks for your in-depth analysis what such  
"unwanted noise" actually should be that results  
this clear and explicable solution.

@gdha  
beware of arrays as panacea for anything  
that contains more than one word ;-)  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1495\#issuecomment-330161395](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1495#issuecomment-330161395)

See how the excluded\_fs\_types string is used in the code:  
Its value is used as egrep pattern (and a egrep pattern is a string).  
Accordingly in this case a string of words fits better than a  
complicated construct of separated words (i.e. an array).  
Actually the excluded\_fs\_types value is even a single word.

@ProBackup-nl  
I have a question regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1648\#issuecomment-353569516](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1648#issuecomment-353569516)

Why must the items be sorted?

I think in general it does not matter in an egrep pattern  
whether or not its items are sorted, e.g. as in

<pre>
# echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz' | grep -E 'baz|foo'
foo
baz
</pre>
