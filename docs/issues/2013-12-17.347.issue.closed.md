Hi,

OS = centos 6.5 minimal

I am trying to create a rescue disk and i get the following error when i
type in sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue as per instructions;

ERROR: USB Device /dev/sdc/sdc1/REAR-000 is not a block device.  
Not understanding why/what is not a block device....  
I used the format cmd as per instructions

Any help is appreciated, thanks
