My question is similar to issue \#622, except rather than wanting to
have two separate devices, I'd like one big external usb harddrive but
with two partitions: a small bootable partition to hold the ISO files,
and a second partition to hold the backup.

I have a laptop with an SSD and I'd like to use external usb harddisk
for booting and backups since harddisk are cheap and I have lots of
spares around.

My laptop is encrypted with dmcrypt and formatted with btrfs (except for
/boot which is ext4)  
I thought I'd like to make backups using ESZ's zsh script from
[http://hub.darcs.net/esz/btrfs-backup](http://hub.darcs.net/esz/btrfs-backup)

Their script requires that the backup medium be setup as a raid mirror
with a missing disk, then partitioned with LVM and dmcrypt on top of the
LVM volume and finally formatted with btrfs.  
I know btrfs is supposed to handle disk management, but maybe it lacks
encryption, hence the need for btrfs on top of dmcrypt on top of LVM on
top of RAID for paranoia.

If I could partition a one or two terabyte harddisk into a small (eg.
4G) parition for REAR and the remainder for ESZ. I could make the 2nd
partition part of a raid mirror, make it an LV, fill with random data
and cryptsetup then format as btrfs.

My idea would be  
OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE="/dev/sdb1"  
OUTPUT\_URL=usb://dev/sdb2 (or should it be e.g. usb://dev/dm2)? or do I
need the usb:// ?  
cryptsetup open /dev/dm2 crypt-backup  
mount /dev/mapper/crypt-backup /mnt/backup  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///mnt/crypt-backup

Thanks.

@osoloco not a bad idea, but unfortunately it requires a serious rewrite
of the USB handling code. A few months ago we started with EFI USB
booting, but due lack of time we have put it on hold. What I'm trying to
say it is possible, but who will write it?

We will not implement this at current time and shall close this issue -
you can re-open this again if there is a real need for it and are
willing to buy program time for the implementation (on-site/remote)
