##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1972](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1972)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By running `rear recover` on Arch Linux.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This patch avoids `rear recover` to end with error if /boot/efi
    directory does not exist in late recover stage (archive is already
    restored), and instead adds /boot/efi to SElinux relabeling ignore
    list, only if /boot/efi directory exists.

After thinking about this PR for a while, I've decided for less invasive
and IMHO more correct way ...

Argh!

@gozora  
thank you to call my attention to that script.

I never had a look at that script before because I do not use SELinux.  
In general I do not like unconditioned special case handling.

The following issues exist since the beginning in that script:

With that script every user who has UEFI (and /boot/efi) gets a new
file  
/etc/selinux/fixfiles\_exclude\_dirs created during "rear recover".

What about users who do not use SELinux?  
They get a useless /etc/selinux/fixfiles\_exclude\_dirs created.

What about users who have already a /etc/selinux/fixfiles\_exclude\_dirs
file?  
They get their /etc/selinux/fixfiles\_exclude\_dirs overwritten.

This means two more conditions need to be checked:

(a)  
Do nothing when SELinux is not used.

(b)  
Do not silently overwrite user's files.  
An existing file is user data that was restored from the his backup
and  
user data is usually sacrosanct unless the user confirmed otherwise  
or at least ReaR has to save user's files before overwriting them, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854\#issuecomment-403013334](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854#issuecomment-403013334)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/632bc2dee4d5b82cfe91416c81254f0bc9919a70](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/632bc2dee4d5b82cfe91416c81254f0bc9919a70)

@gozora  
because you are already working on it I would very much appreciate it  
if you could also clean up that script in general.

Hello @jsmeix

My knowledge of SELinux is limited to disabling of this feature ;-)

> (a)  
> Do nothing when SELinux is not used.

I'm not sure if we can detect SELinux usage and mode of operation
reliably across all distributions...

> Do not silently overwrite user's files.

Fully agree, Maybe using:

    -  cat > $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs <<EOF
    +  cat >> $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs <<EOF
    ...

Would be better ...

@gdha  
I assigned you too here because I assume you could help  
with the SELinux related questions here.

But there is no need to do the general clean up right now here.  
We could also do it later in a separated step as time permits.

@gozora  
I also know nothing at all about SELinux setup.

But even without any SELinux knowledge only by plain looking at the
code  
I assume at the beginning an additional condition like

<pre>
# Skip if there is no etc/selinux/ directory (e.g. when SELinux is not used)
# and if there is no etc/selinux/ directory creating a fixfiles_exclude_dirs file
# therein cannot work anyway:
test -d $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux || return 0
</pre>

is needed to make the subsequent code work fail-safe.

A proposal how to clean it up and make it work more straightforward:

<pre>
# For UEFI we should avoid SElinux relabeling vfat filesystem /boot/efi

# Skip if UEFI is not used:
is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return 0

# Skip if there is no etc/selinux/ directory (e.g. when SELinux is not used)
# and if there is no etc/selinux/ directory creating a fixfiles_exclude_dirs
# file therein cannot work anyway:
test -d $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux || return 0

# Skip if there is no boot/efi directory:
test -d $TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi || return 0

# Do not overwrite an existing etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs file
# An existing file is user data that was restored from his backup and
# user data is sacrosanct unless the user had confirmed otherwise:
if test -s $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs ; then
    Log "Not overwriting the existing etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs file"
    return 0
fi

# Create etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs file from scratch:
cat &gt; $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs &lt;&lt;EOF
/boot/efi
/boot/efi(/.*)?
EOF
</pre>

By the way:  
What if /boot/efi is not a mounted vfat filesystem?  
Can this happen with UEFI?  
I think this cannot happen with UEFI on Linux because  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI\_system\_partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition)  
reads

<pre>
The EFI system partition needs to be formatted
with a file system whose specification is based
on the FAT file system and maintained as part
of the UEFI specification; therefore, the file system
specification is independent from the original
FAT specification.
</pre>

But what if the ESP is not mounted at all (can this happen on Linux?)?  
or if the ESP is mounted but not at /boot/efi (e.g. on Arch Linux)?  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI\_system\_partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition)  
reads

<pre>
The mount point for the EFI system partition
is usually /boot/efi, where its content is
accessible after Linux is booted
</pre>

The "usually" indicates we cannot rely on ESP mounted at `/boot/efi`  
and I don't know if the ESP content needs to be accessible after  
Linux is booted in any case.

Using code to "Determine where the EFI System Partition (ESP) is
mounted" from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/14bfcd40d8d78ba6c45db11cbd31b2f83d0fb6c2](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/14bfcd40d8d78ba6c45db11cbd31b2f83d0fb6c2)

<pre>
# Determine where the EFI System Partition (ESP) is mounted in the currently running recovery system:
esp_mountpoint=$( df -P "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" | tail -1 | awk '{print $6}' )
# Use TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi as fallback ESP mountpoint:
test "$esp_mountpoint" || esp_mountpoint="$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi"
</pre>

should sufficiently mitigate possible issues where ESP is mounted  
also in this case here.

Perhaps also the test in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/14bfcd40d8d78ba6c45db11cbd31b2f83d0fb6c2](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/14bfcd40d8d78ba6c45db11cbd31b2f83d0fb6c2)

<pre>
# UEFI_BOOTLOADER empty or not a regular file means using BIOS cf. rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh
# Double quotes are mandatory here because 'test -f' without any (possibly empty) argument results true:
test -f "$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" || return 0
</pre>

could be useful in this case here?

If I am right, those duplicated testing code snippets in several
scripts  
might be later combined and moved into one general function...

@gozora  
of course it must be  
`cat > $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs <<EOF`  
(I fixed it in my comments above).

For the (not so) fun of it:  
The reason for the typo was that I use `<pre> ... </pre>`  
for preformatted text blocks but within `<pre> ... </pre>`  
one cannot use `<` or `>` literally because they are reserverd HTML
charaters  
so that to display `<` or `>` one must use their HTML entities `&lt;`
and `&gt;`  
and I had accidentally used `&lt;` for `>` instead of `&gt;` but now I
learned  
that I can also use three backticks ```` ``` ```` and even how to
display backticks  
as backticks by having them in backticks plus leading and trailing
spaces,  
it's just so easy to simply write Markdown that even shows plain ASCII
text  
(braindead modern world)...

@gozora @gdha I cannot form an opinion as I am too far away from this
problem.

Just wondering, if the `fixfiles_exclude_dirs` file exists and does not
contain the ESP mount point, will the recovered system still work? Why
not simply inject/append the ESP there?

Because this is only about to avoid SElinux relabeling the vfat
filesystem of the ESP  
my assumption was that it is "the right thing" to skip the actual action
in that script  
(which is creating etc/selinux/fixfiles\_exclude\_dirs file from
scratch)  
when any of the needed conditions is not met.

@gozora Sorry for the late wakeup, didn't see this until now, but adding
/boot/efi to exclusion list is not needed at all. Internally, SELinux's
`fixfiles` checks if the file system supports security labels, and VFAT
doesn't, so it never tries to relabel `/boot/efi`.

Hello @rmetrich,

Reading
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1972](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1972),
this PR was mostly about correcting

    if ! test -d "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi" ; then
        Error "Could not find directory $TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi"
    fi

whew
[510\_selinux\_fixfiles\_exclude\_dirs.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/Linux-i386/510_selinux_fixfiles_exclude_dirs.sh)
runs.

*/boot/efi* was part of
`$TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs` even before this PR
...

But honestly I did not spent much time hacking SELinux, so if you think
that */boot/efi* is not needed in this list, feel free to update the
code ;-).

V.
