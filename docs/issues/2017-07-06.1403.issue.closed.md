    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

    The following information may help to resolve the situation:

    The following packages have unmet dependencies:

should we remove **isolinux** from the ***control*** file as long as we
support ubuntu14.04?

Maybe removing isolinux is an option, although on all other distros our
agreement was IIRC that we want to include the dependencies to make the
default config work.

Root cause is that Debian split the syslinux package without proving
`Provides` for the old stuff.

I guess as long as we don't use different control files for different
Debian versions we won't solve this problem. AFAIK there are no macros
in control files that we could use to achieve a similar result to our
spec file macros.

If we add it to the FAQ page then we are fine I guess

Yes, and also to the description of the DEB package. We could also add
both the new and the old name as `Recommends`. People doing
`apt-get install` will actually see that.

@schlomo So your suggestion is that we remove `isolinux` and `xorriso`
from the **Depends** line and move these two to the **Recommends**
line?  
And, furthermore, add some comments about it in the **Description** part
of the *control* file, right?

I think we can't provide a solution to this problem as long as we only
build a single DEB for all Debian versions (or build from the same
control file). So the "good" solution would be to expand our build
tooling to have different control files - or parts of it - for different
Debian version: New and old.

In the mean time we can add all the potential packages to **Recommends**
to show the user that we would recommend to install those as well.
Unresolvable Recommends shouldn't harm anybody.

And yes, removing the isolinux and xorriso packages from **Depends**
will allow all Debian distros to install our ReaR package again.

As there is now a Debian maintainer who explicitly does not use our
control file for his builds I think that this is the best we can do
right now. In any case it only is relevant for those users building
themselves or installing from OBS.
