the patch add support for "OUTPUT\_URL=null" and fix my situation below.
maybe there are other situations which user will want to set "null"
OUTPUT\_URL.

my /etc/rear/local.conf is setup like below base on the advice from
email list:  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup/  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://10.1.1.1/share/nfs/

the archived file will first goto /tmp, then create iso to
/var/lib/rear/output, and finally copy iso to nfs share. if the iso file
is large, it will consume huge space at local server. so I tried to tune
"ISO\_DIR" to remote server.  
then I don't need OUTPUT\_URL anymore. but rear won't let me set it to
blank, so I add 'null' method for it.

Well done - that is why I like open source!
