-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
    OS\_VERSION=7

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf"):  
    BACKUP=NSR

-   Hardware (virtual machine): Hyper-V guest

-   System architecture (x86 compatible): x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    UEFI / GRUB2

-   Storage: Virtual disk provided by the Hyper-V host.

-   Description of the issue:

The backup method is configured to be NSR (Legato).  
The "rear mkrescue" command fails with:

    ERROR: Could not save result files with save
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-<hostname>.log for details
    Terminated

The log file contains:

    2019-11-29 12:01:33.455795532 Including output/NSR/default/950_nsr_save_result_files.sh
    2019-11-29 12:01:33.457489262 Saving result files with NSR (EMC NetWorker)
    /usr/share/rear/output/NSR/default/950_nsr_save_result_files.sh: line 50: mminfo: command not found

Indeed, the output of the command "rpm -ql lgtoclnt | grep mminfo" is
empty. The command mminfo is not shipped with Legato client package
(probably any more).

@bruncsak  
regarding BACKUP=NSR:  
In general there is nothing at all what I could do in case of issues  
with third-party backup tools or any other third-party software  
because I do not have such software on my systems  
so that I can neither test nor reproduce anything.

The last adaptions and enhancements  
for BACKUP=NSR were done by @hpannenb

@hpannenb  
could you again have a look here?  
Of course as time permits.  
Thank you in advance!

@bruncsak  
in general regarding issues for non-current ReaR versions  
like what you use `Relax-and-Recover 2.4` see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@bruncsak I checked on one of our RHEL7 based servers. On these we have
installed the package lgtoclnt-8.2.4.9-1 which (still) contains the
mminfo command. Which version do You use? Anyway it would be interesting
if there is a successor command available for the same purpose (see
[http://www.ipnom.com/Legato-NetWorker-Commands/mminfo.html](url))

The initial code for the NSR workflow was included by @gdha with commit
38bb7835f08ef0e0f71ea1c2c6f0e21278572440. It might be a code change is
required for newer/upcoming Legato Networker releases. My use case
"NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=y" does not require the mminfo.

I have the version lgtoclnt-9.2.0.5-1 installed. This version ships the
following utilities:

/usr/bin/nsr\_render\_log  
/usr/bin/nsrports  
/usr/bin/recover  
/usr/bin/save  
/usr/sbin/dbgcommand  
/usr/sbin/fsra.jar  
/usr/sbin/fsra\_res.jar  
/usr/sbin/nsr\_render\_log  
/usr/sbin/nsr\_shutdown  
/usr/sbin/nsradmin  
/usr/sbin/nsrclient\_nsrfa  
/usr/sbin/nsrexec  
/usr/sbin/nsrexecd  
/usr/sbin/nsrfsra  
/usr/sbin/nsrlogd  
/usr/sbin/nsrlogin  
/usr/sbin/nsrlogout  
/usr/sbin/nsrpurge\_adhoclog  
/usr/sbin/nsrrcopy  
/usr/sbin/nsrssltrust  
/usr/sbin/nsrvbaflr  
/usr/sbin/recover  
/usr/sbin/save  
/usr/sbin/savefs  
/usr/sbin/uasm

I do not know is there any new relative to the previous version which
may supersede the mminfo utility?

I tried to run the "rear mkrescue" command with "NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=y"
setting. It finished to run with success, I got an ISO image. I still
have to test the recovery.

If the mminfo utility is unreplaceable, it would be nice to
automatically switch to client mode with some reasonable defaults.

@bruncsak Could you ask EMC support why mminfo was removed? Perhaps, it
was moved in another package?

In general regarding mandatory programs:

Mandatory programs should be listed in the REQURED\_PROGS array  
not in the PROGS array, cf. the comments in default.conf.

So I think in rear/conf/default.conf

    PROGS_NSR=( nsrexec nsrexecd mminfo save savefs savepnpc recover nsrfsra nsrinfo nsrretrieve nsrwatch nsrports uasm )

together with prep/NSR/default/400\_prep\_nsr.sh

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" "${PROGS_NSR[@]}" fmt )

is at least partially insufficient and should be enhanced  
by an additional REQUIRED\_PROGS\_NSR array in default.conf like

    PROGS_NSR=( nsrexec nsrexecd save savefs savepnpc recover nsrfsra nsrinfo nsrretrieve nsrwatch nsrports uasm )
    REQUIRED_PROGS_NSR=( mminfo )

(add to REQUIRED\_PROGS\_NSR all mandatory programs for NSR)  
plus in prep/NSR/default/400\_prep\_nsr.sh

    PROGS+=( "${PROGS_NSR[@]}" fmt )
    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS_NSR[@]}" )

bcause all REQUIRED\_PROGS are verified to exist in the recovery system
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh\#L204](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh#L204)

@gdha, I checked with EMC support. The support said that the extended
client package (lgtoxclnt) contains the mminfo binary. However, I did
not install this immediately, rather upgraded first the lgtoclnt package
to match the version of the server. With lgtoclnt-19.1.1.1-1.x86\_64 the
extended client is lgtoxtdclnt-19.1.1.1-1.x86\_64 (slightly different
prefix).

The mminfo binary utility is available now.

@gdha  
I closed it because you had set it to "fixed/solved/done"  
but perhaps you liked to keep it open because of a  
possible cleanup or enhancement as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2290\#issuecomment-563301281](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2290#issuecomment-563301281)
