In my recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982/commits/120de787904e4b94eb07e2a3a0ccc24f9204cdf6](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982/commits/120de787904e4b94eb07e2a3a0ccc24f9204cdf6)  
the comment is not fully correct because  
it talks about `VAR="${VAR:-default}"`  
(which I did not enter manually but via copy&paste - sigh!)  
where `{ VAR="${VAR:-default}" ; } 2>/dev/null`  
must be used in any case to avoid 'VAR=default' in the log.

What is actually meant is the `VAR="${VAR:-}"` case  
where the default value is empty  
so 'VAR=' in the log does not reveal a secret.  
But when VAR is already set as `VAR=secret`  
then with 'set -x' the plain `VAR="${VAR:-}"`  
would reveal the secret in the log as 'VAR=secret'.

Regarding

    Wouldn't it be better though to avoid sourcing {site,local}.conf
    with Source and thus avoid the possibility of '-x' being set
    and exposing secret values entirely, without having to protect
    every private variable (and thus having to remember to do it)?

Yes and no ;-)

Yes,  
because using 'source' for config files makes things  
more secure for the user who may forget to use the  
rather special confidential way in his config files  
to set secret config variable values.

No,  
because using 'source' for config files makes it  
harder for us to see in a debugscript log file  
what (non-secret) config variable values the user  
has actually set in all his config files.

And - as always - tertium datur:  
Perhaps I can solve the whole thing reasonably well via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967)  
by using 'source' for config files  
to get things more secure for the user  
plus  
a sufficiently proper implementation that shows  
all (non-secret) config variable values  
in debug or debugscript mode.  
My current offhanded idea is to maintain a list of  
config variable names that can contain a secret value  
(e.g. an array of variable names in default.conf  
so the user can specify confidential config variable names  
as needed to provide "final power to the user")  
where it is only reported whether or not such variables have  
a non-empty value but the actual secret value is not shown  
unless usr/sbin/rear is run with the new command line option  
'--expose-secrets'.

Also, we should remember to declare every new secret variable in
default.conf this way and if we do, it makes the file uglier.

Have you actually used a debugscript log file to find out what the user
has set? Personally I always ask users to provide their
{local,site}.conf files if I need to see configuration parameters for
debugging.

You could use a heuristics : see the regex in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1507557009](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1507557009).  
Also, if you need config variables in log file for debugging, and if
using just `source` to source configuration files, then the DEBUG mode
should output all config variable values at the beginning of the log
(except the secret values, unless `--expose-secrets` is given). It could
make it easier to investigate what parameters are set than by digging in
the `set -x` debug output (OTOH you would see all the configuration
values, evenb defaults, not just those set by the user).

Another idea: perhaps we could introduce yet another config file called
`private.conf` (or similar) where we would instruct the user to put
secret values? This way we could use plain `source` just for this file,
and also it would be less likely to expose secret values in bug reports
(we can say, provide us your `local.conf` and `site.conf` but not
`private.conf`).

Yes, we can add a new config (I'd call it `secrets.conf`) to be more
explicit, but we won't be able to prevent users "doing it wrong". OTOH,
I also find it totally acceptable to have users use the
`{ VAR=value ; } 2>/dev/null` syntax because that will force them to
think about this secrets management issue. Maybe another 2 lines of
explanation in `local.conf` and in the man page are enough for that?

In the sense of keeping things simple I'd prefer such a "low tech"
approach, at least for now and as long as we use Bash to read
configuration variables.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982/commits/211495bf02695b88157f62c8cd4b291290436fc6](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982/commits/211495bf02695b88157f62c8cd4b291290436fc6)  
I added an explanation how to set a secret value  
in etc/rear/local.conf

Regarding the man page:  
I would like to do that in a more general way via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967)  
because then I got a better overview how all that  
is meant to work and to be used in ReaR.

@pcahyna regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982\#issuecomment-1540235162](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982#issuecomment-1540235162)

of course it is our duty to implement special care  
when dealing with secrets - usually with special code as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156)

In the past I have used the debugscript log file  
a few times to find out what the user has set  
in particular when the user did not yet provide  
his config or did not provide his whole config  
or provided some config manually with typos.  
But I won't mind if config values are no longer  
in the log file - it only makes it sometimes  
harder for us to get the config values.

Show all values, also defaults, not just those set by the user,  
and with --expose-secrets even secret values,  
is what I like to implement via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967)

A totally offhanded perhaps a bit crazy idea:

When all possibly secret variables are set in default.conf  
in one of those ways

    { VAR='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { VAR='default' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { VAR="${VAR:-}" ; } 2>/dev/null
    { VAR="${VAR:-default}" ; } 2>/dev/null

we could extract those variable names via some regexp  
and check the user config files whether or not  
those variable names appear in user config files without

    { VAR=... ; } 2>/dev/null

I.e. do something similar as what we currently do via  
init/default/001\_verify\_config\_arrays.sh

In the new explanatory comment in default.conf the part

    Do not use something like
      echo 'my_secret_password' | openssl passwd -6 -stdin
    because that stores the whole command in a history file (e.g. ~/.bash_history)
    (unless you know how to run commands without keeping the history).

Those are the config variables that could have secret values:

    # grep '{ .* ; } 2>/dev/null' usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  | grep -v '^#'

    { OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { OPAL_PBA_TKNKEY='tpm:opalauthtoken:7' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="${BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY:-}" ; } 2>/dev/null
    { TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { GALAXY11_PASSWORD=${GALAXY11_PASSWORD:-} ; } 2>/dev/null
    { ZYPPER_ROOT_PASSWORD='root' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { YUM_ROOT_PASSWORD='root' ; } 2>/dev/null

For each of them I will check our code that  
we do not leak their values into the log file.

According to the output of

    # for v in OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD OPAL_PBA_TKNKEY BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD ZYPPER_ROOT_PASSWORD YUM_ROOT_PASSWORD ; \
     do echo $v ; \
      find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f \
       | xargs grep "\$$v" \
       | grep -v ': *#' ; \
      echo =================== ; done

all except BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY  
leak their value into the log file.

For GALAXY11\_PASSWORD I did already
