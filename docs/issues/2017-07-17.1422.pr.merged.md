@gozora can you please check if this would work? I think it will help
the users if we explain them why ReaR aborts and to give them a chance
to fix it.

@schlomo  
Yes I think that might be useful information.

@gozora please check & improve as you see fit and merge. I can't test it
here and fully trust you. I simply thought that it is probably easier to
just send you a PR with my thoughts in code than to describe them in
text.

@schlomo I'll take a look on this, once I have that retry\_command ()
story done ;-)

@gozora here you go, only show the mount point :-)

And here I even see that I am 12 hours behind @gozora

Explanation:  
I had looked directly at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e7dcb4e5546bb1d0422cb2703d2ee1c0e7571c34](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e7dcb4e5546bb1d0422cb2703d2ee1c0e7571c34)

@schlomo  
yes, it a good training exercise for users  
wo don't see after the ReaR error message  
all their other mountpoints where it is also mounted  
to exercise the iterative step-by-step approach ;-)

Now what I see under the "Files changed" tab of this pull request  
it looks unexpected/strange to me because now it looks as if  
this pull request contains several additionally changed files  
that are not meant to be changed by this pull request.  
Is this only a strange way what GitHub shows  
or did this pull request get somehow broken?

Good catch, I think I need to push this again, will do so in the
evening. This branch is definitively broken.

Some time ago such unexpected additionally changed files  
happened also to me in one of my pull requests but I cannot  
remember the reason. I think I vaguely remember it might  
have been something like "git rebase" in my branch or so.

@jsmeix @gozora I fixed the branch by force pushing the correct commits
into it. Please update your copy to try it out. Thanks a lot.

@schlomo I just finished testing. It looks OK for me.
