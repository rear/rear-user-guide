Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template
=======================================

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.18
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 6.7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL="file:///var/rear"  
    OUTPUT\_URL="file:///var/rear"  
    NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=y  
    BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/mnt'
    '/media' '/var/crash')
-   Brief description of the issue  
    I got rear generated on local FS /var/rear and then copied it to a
    NFS server manually, as the server is behind firewall. Now when I
    boot the server with rear iso recovery, how do I specify path for
    NFS share(new location of rear) when I am at relax-and-recover menu.
-   Work-around, if any

Just edit the `local.conf` file and change the variable content of
`BACKUP_URL` to the new location. Hopefully, you are not missing any NFS
related executables (as these may not be copied during *mkbackup* phase
as it was not required). You can try and verify it...

I think I did not clarified issue properly. Server is behind firewall.
NFS will not work. So, I have intentionally used BACKUP\_URL=file:///
option in local.conf. Now, I have rear generated on local FS, and I have
copied it on a jumphost for this firewalled server. If I boot the server
with rear-server.iso file generated with rear mkbackup, It tries to
recover from BACKUP\_URL=file:///localdirectorypath, which it cannot
access at time of recovery. So, now how can modify this parameter (after
rear is already generated and server is waiting to recovered), when I
have changed the location of my rear backup.

@dheeraj86mathur well guess you answered your own question. Just change
the BACKUP\_URL to the new location before starting `rear -v recover`
will do the trick

That brings in my exact question, where can I modify BACKUP\_URL to new
location, because start rear -v recover ?? I cant modify local.conf now,
as the server is already down. Even if i could modify local.conf, it
will not update the existing rear backup and iso, which I have already
generated. One option is to mount iso file in rw mode and then modify
BACKUP\_URL value in isolinux.cfg .... But will it work, I havent tried
this yet and want to know if that is correct method ..

@dheeraj86mathur The complete rear environment is still available in the
rescue image. Just edit `/etc/rear/local.conf` and you are ready for the
recover ;-)

As far as I understand it the issue is sufficiently answered  
so that I close it, if needed it can be reopened.
