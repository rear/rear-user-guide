While doing 08387b9ba6c7b374edb56e01bc99ff8d060af440 I realized (grep
for local.conf) that there are places where we check local.conf for a
configuration setting and there are other places where we write to
local.conf.

Example: If users use site.conf to configure the use of DHCP in the
rescue system then it won't work.

I think that this is very dangerous. Why not use the rescue.conf which
is read *after* the local.conf for that purpose? Also, instead of
greping local.conf for configuration items we should be sourcing in the
ReaR configuration and use the value if set.

I'll improve the `./prep/GNU/Linux/21_include_dhclient.sh` script some
time later

@Reiner030 when you enhanced the rules of Debian packaging did you
notice if the local.conf file got overwriiten?
