@rear/contributors please check if you agree with this change. I believe
that it is better to abort early than to behave in unexpected ways.

@pcahyna  
thank you for this improvement.

I fully agree that in particular for "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
(i.e. for all workflows that run on the original system)  
it is always better to abort early than to (silently)  
behave in unexpected ways.

For "rear recover" it is different.  
Here it is in general better to abort early  
than to (silently) behave in unexpected ways.  
But for "rear recover" there are certain cases  
(e.g. recreation of the initrd)  
where it is better to proceed "bona fide" and  
try out of something will actually fail later  
than to check things in advance and abort in advance  
without ever trying the real thing.

@pcahyna  
I do not understand why you set

    saved_tmpdir="${TMPDIR-}"

two times but you do not use the saved\_tmpdir value  
between when it is set first and when it is set for the second time.  
So I do not understand why you set it for the first time.  
In particular I fail to understand what you like to tell with

    # Can legitimately change in internal defaults, so we will set it again
    # after reading them.

Good point, but I think that this case falls in the first category: even
with "recover", we should abort early and let user fix their local.conf,
if needed. "recover" can behave in strange ways when TMPDIR is not set
properly.

The first initialization can be deleted, I just did not want to leave
the value unset, but there was no good reason for it.

I think this case falls **indirectly** in the first category  
so it is OK to always error out here.

Details:

I think this case does not directly fall in the first category  
because I think "rear recover" likely works  
even with TMPDIR (uselessly) set in a user config file  
so it could be better for the user to not bother him  
and proceed "bona fide" and try out if something  
will actually fail during "rear recover".

Nevertheless I think in this case it is OK to always error out  
because "rear recover" cannot run without "rear mkrescue"  
(or "rear mkbackup") before.  
Because the user config files in the ReaR recovery system  
are usually same as what they were when "rear mkrescue"  
(or "rear mkbackup") was run before, we can safely assume  
that "rear recover" will normally not error out with TMPDIR  
set in a user config file.

In the unusual case when the user changed a config file  
in the ReaR recovery system before running "rear recover"  
it is OK to error out when the user had falsely set TMPDIR in  
a config file because this will correctly tell the user that  
his config file change in the ReaR recovery system was wrong  
and how to properly achieve what he intends.

It may work now, but as soon as some code uses `mktemp` after the
configuration is sourced, it will misbehave with
`mktemp: failed to create file via template '/foo/bar/tmp.XXXXXXXXXX': No such file or directory`
if `TMPDIR=/foo/bar` exists in the original system, but does not exist
in the recovery ramdisk.

No such code exists now, but I guess it will appear sooner or later.

EDIT: N.B. this was not an issue until my commit
2721c2743ea959631be0d30eac92984a708c1e66, because there was code to
unset TMPDIR in the recovery system.

EDIT: I agree with the rest of what you wrote.

Meanwhile I think the

    Error "Setting TMPDIR in a configuration file is not supported. To specify a working area directory prefix, export TMPDIR before executing '$PROGRAM'"

is wrong - both the message and the Error() abort.

I think this should be only a user notification like

    LogPrintError "Setting TMPDIR in a configuration file does not work to specify ReaR's working area, see default.conf about TMPDIR"

Reason:

Setting TMPDIR in a ReaR config file does not work  
to specify ReaR's working area BUILD\_DIR  
BUT  
setting or unsetting TMPDIR in a ReaR config file  
is probably the only way to specify a different TMPDIR  
(i.e. different than TMPDIR for ReaR's working area)  
for the programs that are called by ReaR.

For example assume a user needs to have  
ReaR's BUILD\_DIR in /path/to/much/space  
but he wants to keep the system's default TMPDIR  
for the programs that are called by ReaR.

@jsmeix

> ... wrong - both the message and the Error() abort.

I could do this, but the motivation for aborting early is to prevent
nasty surprises when recovering, since while one takes care to ensure
that the TMPDIR exists in the original system, I am afraid that
essentially nobody realizes the implication that the same TMPDIR would
be used for recovery as well and thus needs to be included in the
ramdisk. This thus leads to frustration when the recovery is actually
needed (often under time pressure) and resulting support calls (that
dedicated support or I will have to handle, or will land in our issue
tracker). The case when one sets TMPDIR back to the default is safe, but
most other cases will not be. Not supporting it is thus the simplest,
most robust solution.

If we really decide to downgrade it to printing and continuing despite
what I wrote above, then I perhaps should revert
2721c2743ea959631be0d30eac92984a708c1e66, since the motivation for that
was that setting TMPDIR in the middle of user configuration is
unsupported anyway, so the code is unneeded. Restoring it would help
with the concerns above.

Note though that supporting the case where one needs to have ReaR's
BUILD\_DIR in /path/to/much/space but one wants to keep the system's
default TMPDIR for the programs that are called by ReaR is risky. What
if for some reason we move the creation of the build area below sourcing
of the user config again? Then it would break, as it would create
BUILD\_DIR in the system default location instead of in
/path/to/much/space. I don't think we should teach users to rely on such
intimate details of the implementation. Are you aware of any case where
an user wants TMPDIR for called programs to be different than for the
build area, anyway?

By the way  
regarding where `TMPDIR=` is used in ReaR code:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'TMPDIR' | grep -v ':[ ]*#'

    usr/share/rear/conf/examples/rescue-and-backup-on-same-ISO-image-example.conf:
    TMPDIR=/mnt2/tmp

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:
    export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}"

    usr/share/rear/restore/DUPLICITY/default/200_prompt_user_to_start_restore.sh:
    test $TMPDIR && old_TMPDIR=$TMPDIR
    export TMPDIR=$TARGET_FS_ROOT
    test $old_TMPDIR && TMPDIR=$old_TMPDIR || unset TMPDIR

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh:
    efi_mpt=$( mktemp -d $TMPDIR/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX ) || Error "mktemp failed to create mount point '$TMPDIR/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX' for EFI partition '$efi_part'"

So there is a wrong config example `TMPDIR=/mnt2/tmp` in  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/rescue-and-backup-on-same-ISO-image-example.conf

    # The defaul location /tmp might be too small to contain the backup (temporary location)
    # use an alternative for /tmp (as backup.tar.gz size might be too big for /tmp)
    TMPDIR=/mnt2/tmp

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for your endless work and patience  
with that endless "how to properly deal with TMPDIR" stuff!

This makes THE difference between quick hacks  
versus thorougly thought-out practicable solutions  
even if a solution cannot solve all possible cases  
but we can only do what is possible with reasonable effort.

Please merge it as soon as you can.

@jsmeix thank you for the thoughtful review and correction of the
obsolete example! Merging.  
By the way:  
you searched for `TMPDIR`, but any invocation of `mktemp` implicitely
uses `TMPDIR`, so we have some more uses beyond those that you found.

@pcahyna  
I searched for TMPDIR because I was interested  
what we do with the TMPDIR variable itself  
in particular where we modify it  
(not where we use its value e.g. via mktemp).

But I missed to search our documentation:

    # find doc -type f | xargs grep 'TMPDIR'

    doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc:
    TMPDIR=/bigdisk::
    The +TMPDIR+ is picked up by the +mktemp+ command to create the +BUILD_DIR+ under +/bigdisk/tmp/rear.XXXX+
    The default value of +TMPDIR+ is an empty string, therefore, by default +BUILD_DIR+ is +/tmp/rear.XXXX+

I will also fix that right now...

@jsmeix good catch! I think that documenting default values separately
from default.conf is often a bad idea - the documentation becomes soon
obsolete.
