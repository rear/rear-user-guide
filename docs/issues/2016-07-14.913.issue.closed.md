-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):
    -   Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):

<!-- -->

    # cat /etc/rear/os.conf
    OS_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer
    OS_VERSION=7

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

<!-- -->

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/external-drive
    GRUB_RESCUE=1

-   Brief description of the issue
    -   In case my /boot partition is too small to write iso file here,
        it just put a small warning, that it is not big enough. So if I
        run this in cron, I don't know if something went wrong and there
        is no ISO image in /boot.
    -   Then if I want to recover totally broken system, I can't because
        it does not contain recovery image
-   Work-around, if any
    -   I don't know it it exists - maybe I can resize /boot before

@schlomo  
this "WARNING:" is probably something for you to comment  
( because I know what you think about warning messages ;-)

I am not al all an expert in this area but from my point of view  
it seems having "enough disk space available" is a mandatory  
condition to proceed.

In general I think rear should error out if mandatory  
conditions to propceed are not fulfilled cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I will do a pull request...

I would like to clarify what is happening here:

-   You are talking about adding the kernel and initrd to the GRUB(2)
    boot menu, not the ISO image.
-   This is an add-on feature which is enabled by `GRUB_RESCUE=y`. You
    should never rely on this feature for disaster recovery purposes.
    The main reason for this is to be quickly able to recover a server
    from soft errors like deleting all of `/lib` without digging out the
    rescue boot media.
-   ATM the code checks for sufficient free disk space before copying
    files.
-   If there is not enough space then we print this WARNING and
    continue. The reason is that the actual rescue media can still be
    successfully written later on. This means that the main objective of
    ReaR (create bootable rescue media off-server) was not compromised.
    This main objective was not compromised by the failure to add ReaR
    to the local boot configuration. Therefore this should be a WARNING
    and not an ERROR, IMHO

That said, if you want please submit a pull request that adds a new
boolean variable `GRUB_RESCUE_REQUIRED` which will, when enabled, change
the WARNING into an ERROR. For example, you could replace the `return`
statement after the WARNING with a check for this variable and have it
die there with a message like "GRUB\_RESCUE is required but could not
add ReaR". It would be also nice to have the same WARNING/ERROR behavior
for other failure cases in this code path.

And please provide code for both GRUB and GRUB2 which are ATM handled in
different files.

I disagree.

I think when the user has specified in local.conf

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=1
</pre>

then it should mean that rear must do that  
without the need for an additional

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE_REQUIRED
</pre>

confirmation.

I.e. I think that an explicit setting in local.conf  
is a mandatory request that rear must do that.

In contrast if the default would be "GRUB\_RESCUE=1"  
then one could consider that as "do it as far as possible"  
depending on how that functionality is described  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

@gdha

What do you think how settings in local.conf  
should be meant in general?

Perhaps the different points of view are because  
in older rear versions the default was

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
</pre>

but nowadays it is changed to

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=n
</pre>

by git commit 7e098795  
but git log only tells about that commit:

<pre>
    * default.conf: GRUB_RESCUE=n instead of y before (to save space under /boot)
</pre>

but no GitHub issue number.

The initial commit where GRUB\_RESCUE was added  
was 5b02e4ff5d49aab9d2af8417fc1a6559b9d23dd7  
but again no GitHub issue or other further information...

The whole GRUB\_RESCUE functionality is meanwhile  
overhauled and documented in default.conf  
via several pull requests (see above).  
In particular the initial issue here was fixed  
via
