-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In sbin/rear set RECOVERY\_MODE also in PORTABLE mode  
because the PORTABLE mode is meant to be used only  
to run 'rear recover' within a foreign rescue system.

Yes, of course - I know.  
My plan is to replace our leftover  
direct usage of /etc/rear-release

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'rear-release' | grep -v ': *#'

    usr/sbin/rear:
    test -e "/etc/rear-release" && RECOVERY_MODE='y' || RECOVERY_MODE=''

    usr/share/rear/init/default/002_check_rear_recover_mode.sh:
    if test -f /etc/rear-release ; then

    usr/share/rear/lib/help-workflow.sh:
        test -f /etc/rear-release && currently_usable_workflows="recover layoutonly restoreonly finalizeonly mountonly opaladmin help"

    usr/share/rear/lib/recover-workflow.sh:
            test -f /etc/rear-release -a -w /etc/motd && echo -e '\nWelcome to Relax-and-Recover.\n' >/etc/motd

    usr/share/rear/lib/mountonly-workflow.sh:
            test -f /etc/rear-release -a -w /etc/motd && echo -e '\nWelcome to Relax-and-Recover.\n' >/etc/motd

    usr/share/rear/build/default/970_add_rear_release.sh:
    echo "$PRODUCT release $VERSION" >$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear-release

where direct usage of /etc/rear-release is not needed.  
At first glance I think direct usage of /etc/rear-release  
is only needed in

    usr/sbin/rear:
    test -e "/etc/rear-release" && RECOVERY_MODE='y' || RECOVERY_MODE=''

    usr/share/rear/build/default/970_add_rear_release.sh:
    echo "$PRODUCT release $VERSION" >$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear-release

so direct usage of /etc/rear-release in

    usr/share/rear/init/default/002_check_rear_recover_mode.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/help-workflow.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/recover-workflow.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/mountonly-workflow.sh

should be replaced by using RECOVERY\_MODE instead.  
But that replacement belongs to another  
separarated cleanup pull request  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3234](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3234)  
not to this one which is (only) about to  
"Set RECOVERY\_MODE also in PORTABLE mode",  
cf. my `Yes, yes, I know, I know` part in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224\#issuecomment-2122463410](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3224#issuecomment-2122463410)

By the way:  
By chance I learned about RECOVERY\_MODE in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3112\#issuecomment-1862738726](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3112#issuecomment-1862738726)

For the fun of it some code archeology:  
RECOVERY\_MODE  
was introduced on Jun 9 2012 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f035085e26d22ce154cadd0c887e312cf954fab5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f035085e26d22ce154cadd0c887e312cf954fab5)  
but three years later on Dec 11 2015 it was not used in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ad2283c402736253e4f76d36659f353695aeceea](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ad2283c402736253e4f76d36659f353695aeceea)  
wherefrom I learned about /etc/rear-release  
that again three years later I used on Jan 2 2018 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6ef640fd39ed5280b96def1644222269042d4f81](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6ef640fd39ed5280b96def1644222269042d4f81)  
(that is also ancestor of lib/mountonly-workflow.sh)  
and subsequently also on Oct 23 2018 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5e6ed355c1600041ff09564096870110e6d70dcd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5e6ed355c1600041ff09564096870110e6d70dcd)
