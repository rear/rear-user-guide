-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"): Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.3 (Ootpa)

-   Issue  
    With DRBD9 there is a new behavior when trying to become primary,
    without the second node reachable. The command "drbadm --
    --overwrite-data-of-peer primary $resource" will end with an error
    "refusing to be primary while peer is not outdated".

-   Workaround:  
    Edit
    "/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/150\_include\_drbd\_code.sh"
    line 30:  
    Old:

<!-- -->

    drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary $resource

New:

    drbdadm del-peer $resource
    drbdadm primary $resource --force

@dragon299  
thank you for the descriptive issue report  
and in particular for your workaround.

I have zero personal experience with DRBD  
so I cannot reproduce or test anything here.

Based on your descriptive report  
I tried to implement your workaround  
as some kind of dirty hack via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2636](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2636)

Please have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2636](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2636)  
and test it and provide feedback if the changes therein  
make things work for you in your particular environment.

See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in
