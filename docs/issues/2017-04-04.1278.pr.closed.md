Files and directories created for PXE/TFTP are too restricted (500 or
400 with owner root) which prevent them to be accessible during
tftp/bootp process.  
This is mostly due to the default `umask 0077` set in `010_set_umask.sh`

I just propose two light modifications:

-   Force creation of output directory `$opath` in 755 when `OUTPUT=PXE`
    and protocol is NFS.
-   Use `cp -p` to preserve permission and avoid `umask 0077`
    permission.

@gdha  
could you also have a look?

In general I think there should be no problem  
when the ReaR recovery system (e.g. its kernel  
and initrd or an ISO file) is generally accessible  
because as far as I remember what @schlomo  
had written somewhere a longer time ago  
the ReaR recovery system should not contain  
confidential stuff (like passwords or user data).  
As far as I know confidential or private stuff  
is only in the backup.

@gozora  
could you also have a look?

My general question to you is whether or not  
in case of UEFI the ReaR recovery system  
may contain confidential stuff?  
I am not at all a UEFI expert but when I think  
about "UEFI" I also think about "Secure Boot"  
and perhaps in case of UEFI + Secure Boot  
the ReaR recovery system may contain  
confidential stuff?  
This particular case here is about PXE/TFTP boot  
but I don't know if UEFI could be also in use  
for PXE/TFTP boot?

My basic concern is whether or not security issues  
could arise when the files of the ReaR recovery system  
(kernel + initrd or an ISO image) are generally accessible.

Or in other words:  
As far as I see this pull request contradicts the comment in  
output/default/010\_set\_umask.sh  
and I wonder if an exception is really o.k. in this particular case.

@jsmeix I don't see any security problem, until initrd and kernel are
not public writeable.

As far as I know PXE code is executed before UEFI, so for me this two
technologies are independent (but I have zero experience with such
setup).  
UEFI have some "plugins" that can boot from DHCP, but again I've never
played with them before.

@gozora, initrd and kernel are NOT public writeable.  
here is an output of the result DIR with this patch:

Those files are created in mode 0444 in `800_copy_to_tftp.sh` (line
37).  
That's why I propose to use `cp -p` during `950_copy_result.sh` to
preserve this right access mode.

    # files must be readable for others for PXE
    chmod 444 "$PXE_TFTP_LOCAL_PATH/$PXE_KERNEL"
    chmod 444 "$PXE_TFTP_LOCAL_PATH/$PXE_INITRD"
    chmod 444 "$PXE_TFTP_LOCAL_PATH/$PXE_MESSAGE"

I don't know if there is any side-effect with this change, may be we can
use this `cp -p` only when `OUTPUT=PXE`.  
What do you think ?

I asked a colleague and got the following basic idea:

Default access permissions via things like umask/chmod  
are in practice only relevant for local user access.  
For access via various network protocols it depends  
on each network protocol whether or not local access  
permissions have an effect.  
Accordingly in practice it should not make things  
really less secure for acces via network when the  
local access permissions are more permissive.

@gozora  
as far as I read in  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot\_Execution\_Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment)  
PXE code is executed by BIOS or by the UEFI firmware.

As far as I understand it PXE code basically loads  
a bootloader (PXELINUX in case of ReaR) and then  
that bootloader loads kernel and initrd.

My concern in this particular case is not that ReaR files  
are generally writable (which would also be an issue).

My concern is that ReaR files are generally readable  
when ReaR files contain confidential or private stuff.

At least the ReaR backup contains confidential  
(e.g. whatever keys - like for ssh access)  
and private stuff (user data) and it is clear  
that the user must protect his backup from  
unintended access.

My question here is whether or not also other ReaR files  
like kernel and initrd could contain confidential or private stuff.  
In this case also other ReaR files would have to be protected  
against unintended access.  
It seems in general local access permissions are insufficient  
to protect files against unintended access via various network  
protocols.

In general, I really can't say if ReaR restore/recovery system contains
any private files. I'd guess that no.  
If talking about UEFI related files, I think that it should be OK.  
I've never studied secure boot very deeply but my general understanding
is that you have signed kernel with private key (which is of course not
part of image) and during boot it is compared against public keys with
help of shim.efi (somehow). So no files that should really remain
secret.

By default the ReaR recovery system should not contain  
confidential or private stuff (as far as I remember what  
@schlomo wrote a longer time ago) unless the user  
explicitly configured something e.g. via COPY\_AS\_IS  
and things like that (e.g. SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD).

But I think since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267)  
this is no longer true because now we have  
by default in conf/GNU/Linux.conf

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( ... /etc/ssl/certs/* /etc/pki/* )
</pre>

where - as far as I understand it - in /etc/ssl/certs or  
/etc/pki also self-generated private stuff could be stored.

Hi guys,  
Forget about this request. I was using `OUTPUT_URL` instead of
`PXE_TFTP_URL`... that's why the right access of the files was not
preserved.  
When using `PXE_TFTP_URL`, everything is fine.

You can close this request.

@schabrolles  
many thanks for all your testing and thorough analysis!  
That helps a lot to make ReaR better.  
In this case we can ignore the proposed change in this pull request  
but we cannot ignore your finding that using OUTPUT\_URL  
instead of PXE\_TFTP\_URL does not work for PXE boot.  
If this is not yet properly documented, it should be  
properly documented at least in default.conf.

@schabrolles  
because I am not a PXE boot user, I would very much appreciate it  
if you could check if ReaR usage for PXE boot is properly documented  
and if not do a new pull request with documentation enhancements.

Again, many thanks for your valuable contributions to ReaR!

@jsmeix, I will have a look to the documentation, but I've found a good
example in
`usr/share/rear/conf/examples/PXE-booting-example-with-URL-style.conf`.  
One Idea could be to have this example directory directly in
`/etc/rear`. it will help New user to easily start using ReaR.

I will also send some other pull request regarding PXE/TFTP. I need some
modification to make work properly on POWER architecture which does not
support PXE natively but grub
([https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red\_Hat\_Enterprise\_Linux/7/html/Installation\_Guide/chap-installation-server-setup.html](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-installation-server-setup.html)).

I will open a another request to discuss about this subject with you.
