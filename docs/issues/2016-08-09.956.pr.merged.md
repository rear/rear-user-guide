Hello,  
after migration fs\_uuid for root partition wasn't changed in ELILO
config file **/etc/elilo.conf**

e.g.

\_image = /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.101-68-default

@ltomasik  
I have basically no idea what you are talking about here  
( in particular I do not use elilo on my test systems):

From
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/956\#issue-170095691](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/956#issue-170095691)  
I can only pick a few snippets

<pre>
migration
ELILO
YaST2
SAP
</pre>

from which I guess you use a SUSE or openSUSE system  
with elilo and SAP and you used Relax-and-Recover  
to somehow migrate that system from one kind of hardware  
or virtual machine onto another somewhat different kind of  
hardware or virtual machine or something like that.

In the end I only like to understand if your proposed change  
could cause any unexpected regressions for other users.  
If there are no regressions I could "just merge" it.

To understand if your proposed change could cause any  
unexpected regressions for other users, I like to understand  
your environment and what exactly you intend to do with  
Relax-and-Recover.

@jsmeix  
we have following scenario:  
SAP Hana, SLES 11 SP4, SAN boot, UEFI, ELILO, migration,
Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git

e.g.  
original LUN: 360002ac0000000000000000700015e10  
root\_partition: /dev/mapper/360002ac0000000000000000700015e10\_part4  
fs\_uuid: c7c47b25-30d8-42bc-8ca8-13f939b5c7b8

new LUN: 360002ac0000000000000000200015e10  
root\_partition: /dev/mapper/360002ac0000000000000000200015e10\_part4  
fs\_uuid: 170afd84-3e91-466c-bdd4-2cbe90c19ddc

We did backup with ReaR and tried to restore it on same hardware with
different LUN (DR tests). It failed because of:

-   there was an unchanged original fs\_uuid in /etc/elilo.conf, we
    fixed it with
    [d9f76e6f](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/956/commits/d9f76e6f8c39bc9a774e1326e95d9e089a5a0ec0)
-   there was an unchanged original lun wwid in /etc/elilo.conf and
    /etc/fstab, we fixed it with  
    [e1a704b6](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/956/commits/e1a704b641e1ae1d92ba1e19dd756e05b128b9b5)

Restore finished successfully after we applied above mentioned changes.
Without it restore was still failing with following error.

@ltomasik  
in finalize/GNU/Linux/15\_migrate\_lun\_wwid.sh you use "&gt;&8".  
Using that file descriptor is deprecated,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887)  
I would like if you change that to something usual like  
"&gt;/dev/null" or "&gt;&2" to get stdout in the log as needed  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)

I am not at all an expert in this area  
but as far as I see your changes only add functionality  
and do not change existing functionality  
so that for me it looks safe to merge it.

Nevertheless I like @gdha to also have a look:

@gdha  
could you have a look if it is o.k. when I merge it?

@jsmeix  
I overlooked \#887 and reused old code from
"15\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh". My bad. Sure I'll change it.

@gdha  
many thanks for having a look and merging it!

@ltomasik  
many thanks for your contribution to Relax-and-Recover!

Just found this accidentially. Shouldn't the `lun_wwid_mapping.conf`
file be in `/etc/rear/mappings` like the other mapping files?

Yes, I overlooked that we have separate directory for mapping files.
