-   Type: **New Feature** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2276

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    ReaR rescue system boot with:  
    OUTPUT=USB and OUTPUT=ISO  
    on  
    - SLES12-SP2  
    - Fedora29  
    - Centos 7

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    **This patch adds following:**  
    - Possibility to boot original system for UEFI boot with
    OUTPUT=NETFS  
    and OUTPUT=USB (similarly to non UEFI ReaR rescue system).

    \- Introduces couple of new variables that could be later beneficial
    for other UEFI code:

    -   esp\_mpt - mount-point of ESP (e.g. /boot/efi)
    -   esp\_disk - disk device holding ESP (e.g. /dev/sda1)
    -   esp\_relative\_bootloader - relative path to UEFI\_BOOTLOADER
        (e.g. /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI)
    -   esp\_disk\_uuid - UUID of disk holding ESP

    \- Replaces grub-mkimage for building of Grub2 boot image for
    OUTPUT=USB  
    with build\_bootx86\_efi() (grub-mkstandalone).  
    - Replaces separate Grub configuration for OUTPUT=USB with  
    create\_grub2\_cfg()

    Using
    [build\_bootx86\_efi()](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh#L39)
    and
    [create\_grub2\_cfg()](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh#L495)
    in OUTPUT=USB will  
    unify process of Grub boot image creation with OUTPUT=NETFS.

@gdha @jsmeix I'd really appreciate if you could "just" test this code
by trying to boot to ReaR recovery system Grub menu and test whether
your original system gets booted, when **Boot original system** menu
option is chosen (it doesn't really mater whether you use NETFS or USB).

Thanks

Testing will take some time because I first need to set up  
a UEFI booting system but that is on my todo list anyway:  
I like to test UEFI USB recovery with my laptop that I use  
currently in BIOS mode (the one I used at FOSDEM).

No rush, take your time!

@gozora  
I think I will not find time to test it in the foreseeable future  
so feel free to merge it as you like.

@gozora  
thank you for all your work here!

Currently I can not at all test things like that  
because for now I have to work from home  
on a rather limited computer.

@gozora  
I have a question because you had written `OUTPUT=NETFS`:

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2326\#issue-370505870](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2326#issue-370505870)  
you wrote `OUTPUT=USB and OUTPUT=NETFS`  
and also in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf you wrote  
`# 1. UEFI boot with OUTPUT=NETFS without secure boot (SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="")`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2983](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2983)  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2326/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2326/files)

Do you really use `OUTPUT=NETFS` or is that a typo which should be
`BACKUP=NETFS`?

But when `BACKUP=NETFS` is meant I would not understand what in
default.conf  
`# 1. UEFI boot with BACKUP=NETFS without secure boot (SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="")`  
would mean because what backup method is used should be irrelevant for
the boot method.

The related issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276)
indicates that  
this pull request was actually about `OUTPUT=USB with BACKUP=NETFS`  
but I like to be on the safe side regarding possibly exceptional
`OUTPUT` vaules.

The reason behind is that I like to add a
prep/default/036\_valid\_output\_methods.sh  
script that tests for valid `OUTPUT` vaules, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2501\#issuecomment-709911656](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2501#issuecomment-709911656)

So I need to know what exceptional `OUTPUT` vaules are in use "out
there"  
in addition to the well known ones that are documented in "man rear"

    OUTPUT=RAMDISK
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT=PXE
    OUTPUT=OBDR
    OUTPUT=USB
    OUTPUT=RAWDISK

Hello @jsmeix,

Unfortunately I don't remember details, but checking config files on my
Fedora 29 test servers I've made a typo

    [root@fedora29 backup]# cat local.conf_NFS
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

    BACKUP_URL=nfs://backup.virtual.sk/mnt/rear
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://backup.virtual.sk/mnt/rear/iso

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/mnt' '/media' '/var/tmp/*' )

    USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"

    GRUB_RESCUE=y

    [root@fedora29 backup]# cat local.conf_USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_SUFFIX="$HOSTNAME"
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/mnt' '/media' '/var/tmp/*' )

    GRUB_RESCUE=y
    GRUB2_DEFAULT_BOOT="1"
    USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"

So the correct statement should look line this:

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    ReaR rescue system boot with:  
    OUTPUT=USB and OUTPUT=ISO  
    on  
    - SLES12-SP2  
    - Fedora29  
    - Centos 7

and

`# 1. UEFI boot with OUTPUT=ISO without secure boot (SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="")`

@gozora  
thank you so much for your prompt and explanatory reply.  
I will fix the wording.
