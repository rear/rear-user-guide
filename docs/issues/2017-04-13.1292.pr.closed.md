(1) Change EFI partition from primary to ESP,  
(2) name partitions,  
(3) Set boot\_flag to "esp" for EFI systemd-boot  
(4) Make log message more explicit

I find it quite handy when `parted /dev/sdb print` also prints a name
describing the purpose of the partition, like:

    Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name      Flags
     1      4194kB  214MB   210MB   fat16        EFIBOOT   boot, esp
     2      214MB   15.6GB  15.4GB  ext4         REARDATA

Regarding "modern" flags like 'esp' or 'legacy\_boot':

Older 'parted' on older Linux distributions do not support them, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1308\#issuecomment-295246028](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1308#issuecomment-295246028)

The current code errors out when parted fails to set a flag.  
I don't know how the various parted versions behave when  
they should set a flag that is not supported.  
I guess parted returns then a non-zero exit code so that  
"rear format" errors out.

Accordingly I think there could be code that retries  
those parted calls with a traditional flag as fallback  
something (untested proposal) like

<pre>
 if ! parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE set 1 $boot_flag on >&2 ; then
    # try a traditional flag as fallback
    if ! parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE set 1 boot on >&2 ; then
        Error "Could not make first partition bootable on '$RAW_USB_DEVICE'"
    fi
fi
</pre>

@gdha ESP is in parted since release 3.2 (2014-07-28).

@ProBackup-nl RHEL 6.3 still has parted 2.1, and lots of RHEL 7.2 still
have version 3.1. I don't mind to have it on-board, but then at least it
may not break parted &lt; version 3.2.  
Will you re-work the pull request, or would like to drop it?

@gdha Please drop this request. After I have seen how easily new
non-optional dependencies (like `bc`) are introduced in this project, I
have lost my appetite.

@ProBackup-nl I am sorry for your frustration. I think that this topic
is something that should be part of a future ReaR major release that
does away with all the pre-systemd compatibility requirements.

@schlomo I think that it is not wise to introduce a new
(hard/non-optional) dependency for a calculation problem that exists in
one old version of a distribution.  
In my opinion the code should check whether a (calculation) issue
exists, and only in that case the code should require (`bc`) dependency
to handle the exception (incorrect large integer calculations by bash).

@ProBackup-nl good point and I agree. I actually take it to support my
thesis that we should cut our obligations to the past and start working
on a new ReaR version that is geared towards recent systems (recent
probably being somewhat relative). I have a strong feeling that this
will simplify a **lot** of things within ReaR.

@schlomo By the way, I am not frustrated, more disappointed. Please do
post me a note as soon as the `bc` dependency is optional. I can even
see a need to support relatively older systems.

I'll try to remember. BTW, I recently read the [Archlinux
FAQ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Frequently_asked_questions#Why_is_there_only_a_single_version_of_each_shared_library_in_the_official_repositories.3F)
and liked this part:

> Several distributions, such as Debian, have different versions of
> shared libraries packaged as different packages: libfoo1, libfoo2,
> libfoo3 and so on. In this way it is possible to have applications
> compiled against different versions of libfoo installed on the same
> system.
>
> In case of a distribution like Arch, only the latest stable versions
> of packages are officially supported. By dropping support for outdated
> software, package maintainers are able to spend more time ensuring
> that the newest versions work as expected. As soon as a new version of
> a shared library becomes available from upstream, it is added to the
> repositories and affected packages are rebuilt to use the new version.

It kind of makes me wish we could split ReaR into two parts: One that
supports only recent distros and another one for the old stuff. I know
that many if not most of our users rely on ReaR supporting their old
stuff, this is just me as a developer speaking.

@schlomo The newest versions of packages is one of the main reasons to
use Arch Linux in the first place. Once too many I stumbled upon ancient
packages in the major distributions, where I needed a newer version to
get things done. And there wasn't a quick solution to install that newer
package version.
