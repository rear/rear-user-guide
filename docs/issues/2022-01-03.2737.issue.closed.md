#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

Here is your query answered as much as we have:-

ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): **2.6.5 (latest available)**

OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
/etc/rear/os.conf"): **RHEL 8.0**

ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
/etc/rear/local.conf"):

Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
guest or PowerVM LPAR): **HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen9**

System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact ARM
device): **x86\_64**

Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or ELILO
or Petitboot): **UEFI GRUB2**

Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
multipath (DM or NVMe): **DM**

Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT"):

Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it): We
were trying to do testing on Physical server using 7.9rhel OS version
but its failing to recover each and every time so we are going to try on
RHEL 8.0 OS version hence we need to know if any specific hardware
requirement should be placed prior testing the bare metal recovery.

Workaround, if any: NA as of now

Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug
log files):

Hello @suraj952, no specific hardware is required by ReaR, but some
hardware (especially storage) setups can be unsupported. I know of two
cases: IMSM RAID (\#2702) and iSCSI storage. From a quick look at the
HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen9 specs, I don't see anything that should be
unsupported. Since you will apparently use this hardware to test
recovery of some other systems, you should make the system as close as
possible to your production system.

Regarding iSCSI see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429)  
`Implement iSCSI support (currently iSCSI needs special manual setup)`  
where in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429\#issuecomment-645626221](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429#issuecomment-645626221)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429\#issuecomment-646216100](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429#issuecomment-646216100)  
show an example of special manual setup that is needed for iSCSI.

@suraj952  
in general see in particular the section  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I assume this question was sufficiently answered.
