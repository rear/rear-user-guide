[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436)  
revealed that currently it is not clear  
when 'source' versus 'Source' should be used in ReaR  
so that area needs to be sorted out and cleaned up.  
This is a bigger task for the future as time permits.

I think that the main issue now is whether to use it for library files:
