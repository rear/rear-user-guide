Now pack/GNU/Linux/900\_create\_initramfs.sh  
first tries to create initrd.xz with the newer xz-lzma compression and  
if that fails it falls back to creating initrd.cgz with gzip
compression.  
Because now two ReaR initrd filenames are used  
initrd.xz versus initrd.cgz  
the global variable REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME is set  
and used in various subsequent scripts where before  
the filename initrd.cgz was hardcoded.

I changed my first implementation  
from "automatically do the right thing"  
so that now by default still gzip is used  
plus a new config variable REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION  
so that the user can if needed specify the compression  
as described in default.conf.

@gdha  
if you like you may have a look what I did here.  
For me (one SLES12) it "just works".  
Also the lzma compressed initrd.  
Becaue I did not change the default  
I think it is reasonably safe against regressions.  
Finally with the new REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME variable  
all the scripts that had hardcoded 'initrd.cgz'  
are now cleaned up in this regard.  
Bottom line:  
From my current point of view I like it much  
so that I think it should be merged.

Hi @jsmeix,

REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME is not properly initialized in default.conf.  
Also, if change to LZMA by default will cause problems with DRLM.  
I encourage you to keep GZIP compression and
REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME=initrd.cgz by default.

Regards,

@didacog  
many thanks for having a look!  
I appreciate your feedback because I was not aware  
that there could be something "outside of ReaR"  
which could be affected by a change of compression  
or filename of ReaR's "own" initrd.

REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME is no config variable  
but a global variable that is used "only internally"  
so that it is not mentioned in default.conf  
REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME is not intended to be set  
by the user and if it is set by the user this does not have  
any effect because pack/GNU/Linux/900\_create\_initramfs.sh  
sets it "right" regardless of what the user may have set.  
In the case switch in pack/GNU/Linux/900\_create\_initramfs.sh  
the default case is: REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME="initrd.cgz"

In my current implementation the default is not changed, see

@didacog  
with my current implementation the user can specify  
the 'gzip' compression for 'initrd.cgz', see

@jsmeix  
Thanks for your clarification, I missed some comments in the pull
request while I was in the mobile, I've seen your 1st comment
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182\#issue-203361250](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182#issue-203361250))
by chance and I've taken a look to it.

Sorry for not reading your later comment:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182\#issuecomment-275409022](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182#issuecomment-275409022)
:\_(

I apreciate if, before changes like this, we can start a discussion to
prevent possible regressions with the integration with DRLM, just to, in
case of something will change at the end, we'll can "syncronize our
clocks" and solve the problem without complications. ;)

See you next week at fosdem!! ;)

Regards,

@didacog  
to be able to prevent possible regressions  
with the integration with DRLM  
I would very much appreciate it if you could  
provide some general documentation about  
in waht way DRLM depends on ReaR, in particular  
on what ReaR internals DRLM depends on.

When I change things *in* ReaR I try to  
keep ReaR working backward compatible  
which means for me that a user does not need  
to adapt his settings in /etc/rear/local.conf  
but anything else is currently considered by me  
to be ReaR internals that I can change as I like.

Accordingly I need a better understanding  
what in addition to the ReaR config variables  
are not ReaR internals.

@gdha  
if you do not object, I would like to merge it soon.

@jsmeix  
DRLM depends on ReaR PXE (kernel & initrd build) included and the init
stage where ReaR downloads it's configuration from DRLM.

We want to adjust it as soon as possible to support multiple backup
methods new feature in ReaR from DRLM also,....

But I'm looking forward to see you at FOSDEM next Saturday, I hope
you'll have time to attend to the DRLM workshop talk and be able to know
a little bit more about DRLM. ;-)

@didacog  
I will be there the whole Saturday  
so that after you watched my glorious and famous  
"Essentials about Disaster Recovery with Relax-and-Recover"  
introduction, I will of course watch your even greater  
"Disaster Recovery management with ReaR and DRLM"  
;-)

For others what we are talking about here, see

@jsmeix The problem is solved now on DRLM side (v2.1.1). Works well with
LZMA (initrd.xz). ;)

@jsmeix you're welcome.

These lines in default.conf can be deleted:

<pre>
1382 # An initrd.xz with lzma compression is known not to work together with DRLM,
1383 # see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1182#issuecomment-275423441

I think to be backward compatible

those lines should be better changed to
