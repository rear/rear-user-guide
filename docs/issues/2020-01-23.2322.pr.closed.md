At the very beginning of user/sbin/rear  
verify that the specified interpreter /bin/bash actually is bash  
because the initial line `#!/bin/bash` alone might not be sufficient  
cf.

My current check does not yet work good enough  
because when I specify `#!/bin/sh` in usr/sbin/rear  
the check succeeds because I have a symlink `/bin/sh -> bash`  
(so `/bin/sh --version` reports `GNU bash ...`)  
but rear fails in plain `sh` mode with things like

    # usr/sbin/rear dump
    /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 369: `trap': is a special builtin
    /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 296: LogPrint: command not found
    ...

so I need to further enhance the check...

@rear/contributors  
do you think such additional checks are useful in practice  
to let ReaR error out early when things "look fishy"  
according to "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
OR  
could it happen that ReaR falsely errors out at those checks  
while in fact things are OK?

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2307\#issuecomment-578208997](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2307#issuecomment-578208997)  
some kind of verification that bash is used to run the ReaR scripts  
is needed to avoid inexplicable errors as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2307\#issue-548234164](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2307#issue-548234164)  
that need much too long to see what the actual root cause is.
