Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    cat /etc/rear/local.conf 
    # This file etc/rear/local.conf is intended for the user's
    # manual configuration of Relax-and-Recover (ReaR).
    # For configuration through packages and other automated means
    # we recommend a separated file named site.conf next to this file
    # and leave local.conf as is (ReaR upstream will never ship a site.conf).
    # The default OUTPUT=ISO creates the ReaR rescue medium as ISO image.
    # You need to specify your particular backup and restore method for your data
    # as the default BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does not really do that (see "man rear").
    # Configuration variables are documented in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    # and the examples in /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ can be used as templates.
    # ReaR reads the configuration files via the bash builtin command 'source'
    # so bash syntax like VARIABLE="value" (no spaces at '=') is mandatory.
    # Because 'source' executes the content as bash scripts you can run commands
    # within your configuration files, in particular commands to set different
    # configuration values depending on certain conditions as you need like
    # CONDITION_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special_value" || VARIABLE="usual_value"
    # but that means CONDITION_COMMAND gets always executed when 'rear' is run
    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.

    cat /etc/rear/site.conf
    #
    # This is ReaR site specific conf file.

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

<!-- -->

    1) install rear, create /etc/rear/site.conf with GRUB_RESCUE=y setting.
    2) run sudo -v mkrescue (output and log in attachments)
    3) boot and try to select rear from grub menu

Grub menu does not contain rear -option. When I compare this machine's
/etc/grub.d contents to another  
Ubuntu 20 machine's installation where rear is also installed with
GRUB\_RESCUE=y setting,  
I noticed that in this machine there is no /etc/grub.d/45\_rear -file or
any other rear files in /etc/grub.d.

-   Workaround, if any: Unfortunately none found so far.

What we would need to debug issues is what is asked for in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
that reads (excerpt)

i.e. the full debugscript mode via `-D` not only the normal debug mode
via `-d`.

@gdha  
thank you for your explanatory  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2545\#issuecomment-831746535](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2545#issuecomment-831746535)

I think I understand now the root cause of this issue:  
I think the root cause are misleading user messages  
in case of GRUB\_RESCUE setup with UEFI.

In case of GRUB\_RESCUE setup with UEFI the LogPrint messages  
in output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh are basically

    Setting up GRUB_RESCUE: Adding Relax-and-Recover rescue system to the local GRUB 2 configuration.
    ...
    Finished GRUB_RESCUE setup: Added 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB 2 menu entry.

so the user expects a 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB 2 menu entry  
but the `UEFI "Relax-and-Recover" boot entry motivation` explanation
comment  
in output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh tells

    If UEFI boot is in use, we will not modify grub.cfg,
    but setup "Relax-and-Recover" entry in UEFI boot menu instead.

so what the user actually gets is no 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB 2 menu
entry  
but a 'Relax-and-Recover' UEFI boot menu entry, see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/954](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/954)

My

@gdha @gozora  
I would much appreciate it if you could have a closer look  
and ideally review (perhaps even test) my pull request changes.

Hi,

As a user, I don't understand why you'd add an entry to the UEFI boot
menu and not the grub menu when GRUB\_RESCUE=1 is set. GRUB\_RESCUE=1
should add an entry to the Grub menu and nothing else. If a user wanted
to add an entry to the UEFI boot menu, then there should be a separate
setting called UEFI\_RESCUE=1 or something like that. Additionally, I'd
like to provide a user experience perspective. I have multiple systems,
some running UEFI, while others are old BIOS systems. Trying to keep
track of which are which is hard enough, but when you also add trying to
remember what the boot menu key is on each of those UEFI systems, it
feels like a pretty rough user experience, especially when you're trying
to recover a production system under pressure. From my perspective, it's
a lot easier to just set a grub timeout and be able to select ReaR from
the grub menu, regardless of what hardware the system is running on.
Just my .02.

@CaptainRedHat I tend to agree with your comments, therefore, I've added
the "needs sponsorship" flag. Who has time to pick this one up?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2609](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2609)
merged  
there is now at least a better description in default.conf  
how GRUB\_RESCUE with UEFI and GRUB2 currently works  
and in output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh there is better error
checking  
plus some alignment with how create\_grub2\_cfg() creates a GRUB2 config
file.

@CaptainRedHat  
in general regarding what you don't understand read the description  
`UEFI 'Relax-and-Recover' boot entry motivation`  
in usr/share/rear/output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh)  
that explains why

    If UEFI boot is in use, we will not modify grub.cfg,
    but setup 'Relax-and-Recover' entry in UEFI boot menu instead

from the point of view who implemented the current code.  
We are very grateful for his many various actual contributions to ReaR  
(otherwise there would be in particular no GRUB\_RESCUE with UEFI).

Now we look forward to your pull request that provides what you ask
for,  
cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)

    Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base,
    almost every problem will be characterized quickly
    and the fix obvious to someone.
