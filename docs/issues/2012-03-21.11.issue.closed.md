We need to implement reserved block count in percentage, rather than
fixed sizes, otherwise changing the container (logical volume/partition)
size may cause problems because the reserved block count is too high/not
proportional to its new size.

This one popped up when doing demo restores on very reduced/tight block
devices. And while the container was big enough for storing the data,
creating the filesystem failed because the reserved block count was
larger than what the container was able to handle.

Ok, I was cleaning the TODO file. So we already knew about this problem
