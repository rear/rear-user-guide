@idna38  
for future pull requests could you please provide  
at least a meaningful subject (not just `WIP`)  
and a short description text because otherwise  
it is in practice impossible to see what an issue  
is about in GitHub overviews for example like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc](https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)  
that shows this pull request currently as

    WIP
    #3080 by idna38 was merged ... 18 hours ago

and also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/79d9e7681ef4966df7b9ed95ecff95ec8a7b79e6](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/79d9e7681ef4966df7b9ed95ecff95ec8a7b79e6)  
tells nothing,  
so please also provide at least a meaningful commit subject  
and a short commit description text.

I think you can even now change the subject and description  
of this pull request to make it look meaningful  
in GitHub overviews.  
If you cannot change this pull request, I could do it  
when you provide me a meaningful subject and a  
short description text.

WIP means work in progress, and this is a PR to merge work I did on a
customer machine back into the feature branch.

I'm still trying to figure out the smartest way for this kind of
scenario.

Since the merge is *not* into `master` but into a feature branch I hoped
that nobody would care (or notice).

Since you did I'll try to be more clear about these things so that you
maybe can know already from the notification email that you can safely
ignore this.

OK, now I see.

I use regularly GitHub overviews like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc](https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)  
versus  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc](https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)  
to keep an overview about our currently active  
versus our done issues and pull requests.
