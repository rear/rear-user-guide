Could you please let us know what can we do to get this working on
SLES12 SP1? is there any specific patch or update need to be installed?
We are stuck on a project where acceptable DR process needs to be hand
over. if there is a workaround then kindly let us know.

Thanking in advance.  
Vish

Regardless of "quick response is not guaranteed with free support"  
you ask for urgent help but think I have time to manually pull out  
information from your file that does not "just display" in my browser  
(I will of course not download foreign data).

Just write the basics as plain text here and I may have a look  
when I have time.

In case of real urgency use the official SUSE support contact  
according to your SUSE Linux Enterprise support contract.

I mean 'urgency' is at our end so please see if you can help us in
getting this resolved. I came across some patch you have released but it
seems currently its not in the download archive unless I am seeing it
somethign different completely.  
once again Thanks a lot for looking into it.

Hi, I will need help in fidning any workaround to get this working on
SLES 12 SP1. Could you please review below log files while recovering
through rear image? Your help would be much appreciable. Thanks and

-----&gt; this is after trying snapper and try to recover the image but
still failed

Yes, agree that it failed, but this time it failed with:  
`+++ btrfs subvolume set-default /mnt/local/home`  
Try to manually enable snapper for **each** LVM lvol with BTRFS like:

    snapper -c home create-config /home
    snapper -c opt create-config /opt
    snapper -c perflog create-config /perflog
    ...

    snapper create
    rear mkrescue

Let me warn you about possible implications though, guys in SuSE
certainly had a reason for [not enabling *snapper* for small partitions
by
default](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sled-12/book_sle_admin/data/sec_snapper_setup.html).

@gozora, Yes we tried this solution from -
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1036](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1036)
- by enabling snapper for each LVM vol and then ran it and as you can
see it ( test VM log) progressed from stopping at lvroot and then stuck
in lvhome. Just wondering if we are missing anything in base OS, which
is needed to complete BMR recovery.  
Thanks a lot for coming back to me, I will try again on a new VM
tomorrow and keep you posted

Whether you are missing something in base OS or not, is something I
can't answer.  
You can setup Linux in many ways, and in general there are no rights or
wrongs (only bigger or smaller compromises).

I for example consider using btrfs on top of LVM as useless redundancy.
Yes it works, but IMHO it just introduces another layer of complexity.

@gozora We had ran this using snapper for each FS/vol as attached in
here. I have attached the log for your analysis and error is still same
where it stuck in mounting /home while recovering.

<pre>
+++ btrfs subvolume set-default /mnt/local/home
btrfs subvolume set-default: too few arguments
usage: btrfs subvolume set-default <subvolid> <path>

    Set the default subvolume of a filesystem

2016-11-18 12:01:11 An error occurred during layout recreation.

Ahh!  
First plain text error message here that I can "just read".

The error message in the above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1095\#issuecomment-264467678](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1095#issuecomment-264467678)  
is the same as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1057\#issuecomment-260920515](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1057#issuecomment-260920515)

In both cases the partitioning and filesystems layout  
is rather complicated.

Unfortunately in both cases I have currently no time  
to dig into that (on a voluntary base - of course when  
you pay SUSE for official support, things change ;-)  
see also  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/support/](http://relax-and-recover.org/support/)

In general:

When one likes to use ReaR for disaster recovery  
one must set up the system in a way that is supported  
by the current ReaR code - or one must adapt and  
enhance the ReaR scripts to make it work for one's  
particular use case.

One can set up a system in zillions of ways  
where one gets into trouble with ReaR.

Regarding "VM" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1095\#issuecomment-264236824](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1095#issuecomment-264236824)

In particular on virtual machines I do not understand  
why to use such a complicated setup, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1057\#issuecomment-259640399](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1057#issuecomment-259640399)

For example on KVM/QEMU with the qcow2  
file type for the virtual disk images one can specify  
e.g. a 2TB virtual disk size to have more than enough space  
but on the host system the qcow2 virtual disk image file  
will only be as big as the actually used space on the  
virtual disk.

I wonder about all that complicated stuff with  
tons of virtual disks and tons of partitions  
plus LVM on top of them plus several btrfs  
filesystems on top of LVM that becomes  
a monstrosity from my point of view.

At least I currently fail to understand  
what the real advantage of all that  
could be on a virtual machine?

In general see  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In particular therein see the sections  
about "Inappropriate expectations" and the  
subsequent "Recommendations".
