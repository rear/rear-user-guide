I request for comments what the right process is  
how to get rid of disgraced functionality in ReaR.

Over the years lots of functionality gets added to ReaR.  
Most of it turns out to be actually useful in practice.  
But some functionality turns out to become more and more  
a hindrance or it even turns out to be "simply wrong".

I would like to get rid of such "disgraced" functionality in ReaR  
in a reasonable way so that the resulting backward incompatible  
changes do not hit the users out of a sudden.

My ad hoc idea is to declare functionality "deprecated"  
in one version of ReaR with a planned timeline in what  
future version this functionality will be finally dropped  
plus  
LogPrint messages if that functionality is actually used that  
inform the user about "deprecated and planned end of life".

@jsmeix please define what you mean with disgraced functionality? Can
you give an example?

With "disgraced functionality" I mean functionality  
that we do no longer like to have in ReaR.

The "we" therein means there must be agreement  
before a functionality can be dropped.

My current examples where I personally think  
it would be better if that functionality was not in ReaR are:

MANUAL\_INCLUDE cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019)

USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166\#issuecomment-273101775](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166#issuecomment-273101775)  
and related to that I also think its reverse-logical counterpart  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY  
is questionable because currently ReaR behaves contradicting  
with backup on USB versus on NFS.  
In particular I think for BACKUP=NETFS ReaR should behave  
same for all BACKUP\_URL that are supported for NETFS.  
In general I think ReaR should not implement  
any kind of backup management functionality.

UDEV\_WORKFLOW cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)

Bottom line from my point of view:

Some special "corner case" functionality does not work well  
and it could be a horrible effort to make it work well and  
probably it is impossible to make it work well without some  
incompatible changes here and there but then I wonder  
if it is not better in the end to get rid of such functionality?

@schlomo suggested in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1475\#issuecomment-327782839](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1475#issuecomment-327782839)  
a way how to deal with backward incompatible changes,  
i.e. a test with a meaningful Error exit message  
that enforces the user to adapt to the new way.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1475\#issuecomment-327823112](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1475#issuecomment-327823112)  
also @gdha likes a test with a meaningful Error exit message  
that enforces the user to adapt to the new way.

And I (@jsmeix) also like it this way because I also  
"favor the Error message to make the whole topic more explicit  
and to get our users to actually update their configuration" cf.
