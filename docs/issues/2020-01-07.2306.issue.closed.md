Hello,  
would it be possible, to implement this new backup software in ReaR?

Sure, why not? Please provide a PR with it and we will be happy to take
a look at it.

From skimming the docs I would say that it should be fairly simple and
straight forward to do.

First things first ;-)  
I think a GitHub pull request is basically the last step.

@dcz01  
in general what you need for a new backup method  
to get your backup restored during "rear recover"  
is as a first step using only generic means in ReaR  
to get the backup restore tool and all what it needs to run  
(libraries, config files, whatever else) included in the  
ReaR recovery system where "rear recover" is run,  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

The generic means in ReaR to get things included  
in the ReaR recovery system are the config variables  
`COPY_AS_IS`, `REQUIRED_PROGS`, and `LIBS`,  
cf. usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
or the current one online starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1286](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1286)  
see also "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

So basically what you need in your `etc/rear/local.conf` are things like

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( /path/to/backup/restore/program /path/to/helper/program ... )
    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/backup/config/dir /path/to/other/needed/stuff ... )

plus perhaps if needed

    LIBS+=( /path/to/libraries/that/are/not/automatically/found ... )

Because there is not yet any script in ReaR that would automatically  
restore your backup during "rear recover" you also set in
etc/rear/local.conf

    BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE

plus perhaps if needed an appropriate `OUTPUT_URL=...` setting  
because with `BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE` the OUTPUT\_URL value  
is not inherited from the BACKUP\_URL value so you need to  
specify the OUTPUT\_URL value explicitly.

Then create the ReaR recovery system (without backup) with

    rear -D mkrescue

and make your backup manually.

On your testing (replacement) hardware boot  
this new ReaR recovery system and therein  
run "rear -D recover" which should recreate the disk layout  
and afterwards it stops in the script  
usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200\_prompt\_user\_to\_start\_restore.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200\_prompt\_user\_to\_start\_restore.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200_prompt_user_to_start_restore.sh)  
where you need to manually run the backup restore command  
to get your backup restored into `TARGET_FS_ROOT="/mnt/local"`.

After you had restored your backup into `/mnt/local` continue  
the "rear -D recover" process to get the bootloader installed  
and the other `finalize` stage things (e.g. recreate initrd, ...).

I assume you will need to do some trial and error steps  
until you get it working for you with manual backup restore.

When that works you can as a next step try to automate that  
with appropriate new config variables in default.conf like

    COPY_AS_IS_RESTIC=( ... )
    REQUIRED_PROGS_RESTIC=( ... )

and if needed

    LIBS_RESTIC=( ... )
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_RESTIC=( ... )

plus new scripts in directories like

    usr/share/rear/prep/RESTIC/default/
    usr/share/rear/backup/RESTIC/default

    usr/share/rear/verify/RESTIC/default
    usr/share/rear/restore/RESTIC/default/

that automate making the backup during "rear mkbackup"  
and restoring the backup during "rear recover".

@dcz01 To who was the question raised? To the community or to the core
developers? I think the core developers have their hands full with
supporting ReaR and updating it to a quality level that is required for
these days Operating Systems.  
You can always try to do the first integration tests (with following PRs
which we can examine), or ask for sponsoring by others?
