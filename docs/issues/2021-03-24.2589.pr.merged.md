Instead of replacing "USB device" by pure "disk device"  
I replaced "USB device" by "USB or disk device" to indicate with the
word "USB"  
that those messages belong to the `OUTPUT=USB` method  
which is primarily meant to be used with "USB disk like thingies"  
(i.e. removable disks that are usually attached via USB)  
e.g. USB mass storage devices like USB sticks or USB disks.

What about saying "Block device" instead of "USB or disk device"?

EDIT: I see that it would not satisfy the requirement of indicating the
relationship to the USB method.

@pcahyna  
I think "block device" is technically 100% right  
but mostly meaningless for the user because  
basically all devices in ReaR are block devices  
so one could also say only "device" which is never wrong  
but completely meaningless as a superflous word like "thingy".

The general problem with the `USB` stuff in ReaR is that it was added  
to fulfill a specific requirement of a specific ReaR customer's use
case  
so that the `USB` stuff in ReaR behaves somewhat special and different  
compared to other methods, i.e. `USB` is somewhat incompatible, cf.

If there are no objections that "USB or disk device" is wrong  
i.e. if "USB or disk device" is "good enough" at least for now  
I would like to merge it today afternoon.
