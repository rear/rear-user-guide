-   Type: **Bug Fix** **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1868](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1868)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I neither have any tape device nor can I use OBDR  
    so that I cannot test or reproduce anything that is specific for
    OBDR.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Initial tentative support for OBDR on ppc64le  
    via a new `output/OBDR/Linux-ppc64le` sub-directory  
    that contains currently only two symlinks to existing scripts

<pre>
output/OBDR/Linux-ppc64le/300_create_grub2.sh -> ../../ISO/Linux-ppc64le/300_create_grub2.sh
output/OBDR/Linux-ppc64le/800_create_isofs.sh -> ../../ISO/Linux-ppc64le/800_create_isofs.sh
</pre>

@schabrolles  
I have an idea how you could do some kind of  
"blind smoke tests" on real PPC64 and PPC64LE systems  
that could indicate if this changes here could work at all:

Specify `OUTPUT=OBDR` and then run `rear -s mkrescue`  
on a PPC64 system and on a PPC64LE system and  
compare what scripts would get run on each of them.

When the scripts that would get run on PPC64LE  
look reasonable to you compared to the the scripts  
that would get run on PPC64 we can assume  
this changes here could work at all.

In this case I would "just blindly" merge this pull request  
because the two more symbolic links for OBDR on PPC64LE  
cannot cause a regression elsewhere and if OBDR still  
does not work in parctice on PPC64LE it is also no regression  
compared to what it was before this pull request.

Simply put:  
I would like to merge this pull request soon so that  
our SUSE partner who tests OBDR on PPC64LE on SLES12  
can try out our ReaR GitHub master code with real OBDR hardware.

@jsmeix here is the diff of `rear -s mkrescue` on ppc64 and ppc64le.
Looks good.

@schabrolles  
thank you for the diff of `rear -s mkrescue` with `OUTPUT=OBDR`  
on ppc64 versus ppc64le!
