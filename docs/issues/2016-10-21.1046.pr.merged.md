Today I've discovered some useful Borg environment variables, that
allows automatic launch of backup to encrypted repository (sending
pass-phrases from ReaR to Borg in non-interactive session should not be
a problem any longer).  
I'll prepare pull request with this enhancement.

Btw. Do we have some preferred way of storing sensitive information like
passwords?

@gozora  
off the top of my head I don't know a preferred way of  
storing sensitive information like passwords.  
For example I implemented an optional password  
for ftpfs, see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859)  
where the password either must be manually entered  
several times during "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover"  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859\#issuecomment-223540169](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859#issuecomment-223540169)  
but this way it is the secure method or alternatively  
the password can be (optionally) specified as plain text  
in the BACKUP\_URL variable and then it is up to  
the user how to protect that info in /etc/rear/local.conf

@jsmeix,  
Thanks, I'll check that!
