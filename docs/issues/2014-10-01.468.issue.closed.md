Hello,

I have a problem with USB restore - error:  
Message: The LSB package is not installed

Do i need to install any LSB packages on Debian?

Funny thing is, that the commands:

    lsb_release -r -s | tr -s " \t" _
    lsb_release -i -s | tr -s " \t" _

printout the correct information (Debian and 7.6) - so the LSB should
work.

Only error I see at backup is:

@black187 sorry, on my fresh debian 7.6 system I could not reproduce
your error...

There are 30+ packages which require lbs-release package - but it must
not be installed automatically with basic server image.  
But rear has the needed dependency to lsb-release (in github version
minimal) as I see ;)

@black187 for some reason the `/etc/rear/os.conf` was not generated
during the backup. Perhaps you could run once `read -vD mkrescue` and
send the log-file to us Also verify if your /tmp directory was writable
for you?  
I did the test myself today and it was created correctly. No idea why it
did not work for you?

@Reiner030 in our `rear.spec` for RHEL/SLES we try to auto-create the
`/etc/rear/os.conf` file so it is already present during the
installation of the package. Perhaps, we could foresee something similar
for Debian/Ubuntu as well? I am not an expert on debian package
creation....

@black187 this issue seems related to issue \#512 !
