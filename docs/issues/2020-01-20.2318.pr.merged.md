#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Put large files in $FDRUPSTREAM\_DATA\_PATH/rear and verify that
    image created by 'rear mkrescue' does not include those large files.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    We are working on changes to the FDR/Upstream ReaR workflow, and
    under certain conditions will put the ReaR output files in
    $FDRUPSTREAM\_DATA\_PATH/rear. So on subsequent runs of 'rear
    mkrescue', we do not want to include that directory in the image
    since it serves no purpose and it causes the image to grow in size
    each time 'rear mkrescue' is run. In effect, it is a recursive
    backup. This pull request is intended to eliminate that problem.

@rowens275  
thank you for your enhancements for BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM!

Could you also add a comment to usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
that describes the reason behind why `$FDRUPSTREAM_DATA_PATH/rear`  
and `$FDRUPSTREAM_INSTALL_PATH/usserver` are excluded from the  
backup (i.e. why the files in those $FDRUPSTREAM\_DATA\_PATH
directories  
do not make sense in the backup) so that other FDR/Upstream users
could  
easily understand the reason behind.

I would like to have one more approval from another ReaR maintainer.

@gdha  
in general default exludes from the backup could do harm  
(i.e. when needed files are missing from the backup) so an  
explanation when things are excluded by default from the backup  
is needed:
