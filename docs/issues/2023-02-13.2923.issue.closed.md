There are several rear packages missing from the OBS repository / rear
download page
([https://relax-and-recover.org/download/](https://relax-and-recover.org/download/)).

I understand that for old distro versions there will not be any new
builds, but I see no reason to remove the rear versions that were
working on those systems.

Is possible to reestablish these repos that are now missing?

debian 6, debian 7, debian 8, debian 9, ubuntu 12.x, ubuntu 14.x, ubuntu
16.x, ubuntu 17.x, ubuntu 19.x & CentOS 5 are some of the packages
missing.

I know that these are old and unsupported OS versions, but for DR
purposes some people may need to maintain an old OS version and may want
rear package available for the version that OS was supported.

Thanks,  
Didac

For those older Linux distribution versions  
their build repositories settings were removed  
in the openSUSE Build Service (OBS)  
from the ReaR package building project  
via regular requests that all maintainers  
of OBS package build projects get from time to time  
to free computing resources in OBS for sufficiently  
building packages for current distribution versions  
by no longer building for no longer maintained versions.

I don't know about OBS internals but I think  
because OBS is meant (only) as a build service  
(and not as a long term package download storage)  
it is an automatism that packages become no longer avaiable  
to be downloaded for Linux distribution versions when  
they are no longer built for those distribution versions.  
I think it is not possible to keep old built packages  
only for download without also keeping them building.  
I guess a reason is that keeping old built packages  
would need too much storage space in OBS over time.

Regarding ReaR for people who have old OS vesions:

I would assume that people who have an old OS  
(that is no longer maintained by those who make the OS)  
and who need disaster recovery for such an old OS  
already have set up their disaster recovery procedure  
so they do not need to upgrade ReaR to a newer version  
and normally they should not upgrade ReaR, cf. the section  
"Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Also everybody can use our current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code via "git clone" and from there  
also get any needed state before via "git checkout", cf.  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Furthermore if someone really must have ReaR as package  
I assume (but I did not test it right now) that it  
usually works to install a ReaR package that is built for  
a newer version on an older version of the same distribution  
because ReaR is only bash scripts and documentation  
so there should be always the same actual package content.  
Perhaps package dependencies may not match an older OS  
but then it should be possible to ignore them.

Finally if someone really must have ReaR for an old OS  
built as package for his specific old OS version,  
then he can build it as he needs it on his own on OBS  
or he lets someone else do it for him and pays for it ;-)

I hope my above explanation  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2923\#issuecomment-1427820436](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2923#issuecomment-1427820436)  
of the reasons behind and the possible solutions or workarounds  
sufficiently explains things so that this issue can be closed.
