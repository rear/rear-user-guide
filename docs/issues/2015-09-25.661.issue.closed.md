`mingetty` is no longer a dependency for rear as it uses `agetty` if it
finds it.

See
[http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2015-October/003223.html](http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2015-October/003223.html)
for a user report who had to manually install mingetty on Ubuntu.

Maybe we should keep mingetty as a dependency? Or add it to
REQUIRED\_PROGS on those systems that need mingetty? Or somehow make
sure that at least one of the supported \*getty progs is available?

@schlomo I opt for the last option - will review the code in the coming
days

The following files/scripts contain references to `mingetty`:

    skel/default/etc/inittab
    skel/default/etc/event.d/tty2
    skel/default/etc/event.d/tty5
    skel/default/etc/event.d/tty4
    skel/default/etc/event.d/tty1
    skel/default/etc/event.d/tty3
    skel/default/etc/init/tty.conf
    skel/Linux-ppc64/etc/inittab
    rescue/GNU/Linux/41_use_xen_console.sh

Perhaps we should produce an (more) intelligent `prep` script which
indenties if the Linux system still uses `mingetty` as primary tty
program and if that is the case add it to `REQUIRED_PROGS`?  
Otherwise, `agetty` would do.

+1 for the intelligent prep script.

Hi @gdha  
This change breaks RHEL ppc64 platform...  
Here is the grep "getty " result in ppc64. It also hit agetty.

    # ps ax | grep "getty " | grep -v grep
      872 hvc0     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/agetty --keep-baud 115200 38400 9600 hvc0
    25820 tty1     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/agetty --noclear tty1

So could you please change the search word of getty, maybe "/getty" ??

@mmitsugi great catch - thanks - corrected it (hopefully correct this
time)

Checked if new script `45_symlink_mingetty.sh` did work:  
`lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       6 Oct 30 21:30 mingetty -> agetty` (yes
it does). We are good now to remobe mingetty from the rear.spec file

@gdha @schlomo

I tested the latest code with Ubuntu 14.04.2 ppc64le and Ubuntu 15.04
ppc64le.  
And as a result,

-   15.04 is using systemd and there is no mingetty dependency in rear
    iso. It works well without mingetty.
-   14.04.2 is using upstart and there is mingetty dependency in rear
    iso.  
    As @schlomo mentioned:
    [http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2015-October/003223.html](http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2015-October/003223.html)  
    upstart is using skel/default/etc/init/tty.conf and there is
    mingetty call in it.  
    So, it doesn't work well without mingetty.
-   As far as I know RHEL6 is also using upstart, so rear iso for RHEL6
    also needs mingetty.

There are 2 options to fix the above problems:  
option 1: change rpm spec and deb control to check distro version and
add dependency of mingetty if needed. Add mingetty dependency if it's
RHEL6 or Ubuntu 14.04

-   we can keep using mingetty for upstart distribution.  
    option 2: change upstart tty.conf not to use mingetty
-   console will be changed from mingetty to others for upstart
    distribution
-   default terminal of each distro seems to be: RHEL6 -&gt; agetty /
    Ubuntu 14.04 -&gt; getty

Both changes needs a little bit ugly distro switching code in spec/deb
control file or tty.conf.  
Let's discuss how to fix the above problem and let me know if you have
better option.

@mmitsugi there should be a symlink toward mingetty from (a)getty. Was
it missing?

@gdha thanks for quick reply. In tty.conf, mingetty is called with
mingetty unique parameter... So, we should consider which options in the
above is taken.

@mmitsugi Could you try if you change the line in
`./skel/default/etc/init/tty.conf` file from:

    exec /exec /sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin root $TTY

into

    exec /sbin/mingetty  $TTY

What the effect is?

@gdha as far as I tried,

-   getty and agetty needs parameter
-   getty and agetty are parameter compatible
-   mingetty parameter is not compatible with that of getty/aggetty

So, I added the fix like following and it works fine so far.

    respawn
    instance $TTY

    script
        if [ ! -L /sbin/mingetty ]; then
            exec /sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin root $TTY
        else
            if [ "$TTY" == "/dev/xvc0" ||
                 "$TTY" == "/dev/hvc0" ||
                 "$TTY" == "/dev/hvsi0" ]; then
                exec /sbin/mingetty -L ${TTY#/dev/} 9600 vt100
            else
                exec /sbin/mingetty -8 38400 ${TTY#/dev}
            fi
        fi
    end script
