Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)
is merged  
therein in particular via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391/commits/523b956f5dc7a8dd87c9037e3b7adb02a215398d](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391/commits/523b956f5dc7a8dd87c9037e3b7adb02a215398d)  
both STDOUT and STDERR are redirected to the log file.

The redirection of STDOUT causes regressions for things  
that are intended to run in an interactive way with a user.

Any code that "just calls" interactively working tools like

<pre>
less "$some_file"
vi "$another_file"
</pre>

will appear as if ReaR had hang up because the user  
does not see any STDOUT output on his terminal  
unless proper specification to use the the original STDIN  
STDOUT and STDERR when rear was launched by the user  
as follows:

<pre>
less "$some_file" 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
vi "$another_file" 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

cf. "What to do with stdout and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Because I @jsmeix cannot check the whole code  
I assume there are some places where interactive tools  
are "just called" that need to be fixed.

So did you check the use of an editor / viewer in the recovery workflow
when the disks are different? IMHO we should fix at least that part.

The calls of 'less' and 'vi' in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/500\_confirm\_layout.sh  
usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/100\_ask\_confirmation.sh  
usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_script.sh  
should be o.k. because they happen within a select command  
that uses the the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR  
basically like (excerpts):

<pre>
        select choice in "${choices[@]}"; do
            case "$REPLY" in
                (1) less $RUNTIME_LOGFILE;;
                (2) less $VAR_DIR/layout/config/df.txt;;
                (3) rear_shell;;
                (4) vi $LAYOUT_FILE;;
                (5) vi $LAYOUT_CODE;;
            esac
        done 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

The 'vi' calls in  
usr/share/rear/restore/BACULA/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
should be o.k. because they happen within a rear\_shell function  
that uses the the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR

<pre>
function rear_shell () {
...
    HISTFILE="$histfile" bash --noprofile --rcfile $bashrc 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
}
</pre>

I had adapted the 'read' and 'select' calls and the rear\_shell  
function via the commits in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)  
so that we should be "mostly o.k".

But I cannot know what other arbitrary interactive tools  
might be "just called" in which various ways and where.

@schlomo  
regarding "should we revert this":  
In case of issues because of of redirected STDOUT  
all one needs to do is this change in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
- exec 1>&2
+ # exec 1>&2
</pre>

to get back the old behaviour without redirected STDOUT.

@gdha  
I agree with you to keep the redirected STDOUT at least for now  
so that courageous users who use the current GitHub master code  
can try it out how it behaves with redirected STDOUT in their  
particular environments and for their particular use cases.  
E.g. I cannot test how third party backup tools behave.  
Possibly there are issues when third party backup tools  
work interactively and need "0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8" added.  
Until the ReaR v 2.2 Milestone release date  
(which is currently end of September 2017)  
we have plenty of time to collect user feedback  
and I have plenty of time to fix the issues, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391\#issuecomment-311043325](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391#issuecomment-311043325)  
If I fail to fix things we can easily do the above  
change in usr/sbin/rear for the ReaR 2.2 release.

During
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)  
I had only tested that "read ... 0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8"  
and "select ... do ... done 0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8"  
work with the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR  
but I had not explicitly tested that commands that  
are called within "select ... do ... done 0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8"  
also work with the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR.

Now I explicitly tested the latter and it works (as expected).

FYI how I tested it:

1.  

At the beginning of init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
I added this testing code (I used an 'init' stage script because  
that is run both during "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover"):

<pre>
UserOutput "user output"
LogUserOutput "log user output"

LogPrint "test stdout and stderr output"
echo "stdout output"
echo "stderr output" 1>&2

LogPrint "test command stdout and stderr output"
cat /etc/issue qqq

LogPrint "test read"
read -p "Type some user input: " 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
LogPrint "user input is '$REPLY'"

LogPrint "test select"
test_file="/tmp/rear_test_file"
rear_shell_history="echo foo
echo bar
echo baz"
choices=(
    "View Relax-and-Recover log"
    "Go to Relax-and-Recover shell"
    "Edit $test_file"
    "View $test_file"
    "Exit select"
)
# Use the original STDIN STDOUT and STDERR when rear was launched by the user
# to get input from the user and to show output to the user (cf. _input-output-functions.sh):
select choice in "${choices[@]}"; do
    case "$REPLY" in
        (1) less "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE";;
        (2) rear_shell "" "$rear_shell_history";;
        (3) vi "$test_file";;
        (4) less "$test_file";;
        (5) break;;
    esac
    LogPrint "User selected: $REPLY) ${choices[$REPLY-1]}"
    # Reprint menu options when returning from less, shell or vi
    Print ""
    for (( i=1; i <= ${#choices[@]}; i++ )); do
        Print "$i) ${choices[$i-1]}"
    done
done 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

For me it works as expected.  
Note the interesting effect of the LogPrint call that  
happens within the "0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8" environment:  
Here LogPrint logs to the terminal because the original  
STDERR is used within the "0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8" environment  
which proves that things fully work as expected.

1.  

To test if it also works with redirected STDIN (to be future-proof)  
I added in usr/sbin/rear below the STDOUT and STDERR redirections

<pre>
# Discard STDIN as a test:
exec 0&lt;/dev/null
</pre>

For me it still works as expected.

1.  

I did a "rear mkbackup" and then  
a "rear recover" on a system with a bigger disk  
to get the disk migration dialogs and  
for me all works as expected.

@schlomo @gdha @gozora  
if you have an idea how I could automatically check  
the ReaR bash scripts which external programs they call  
I would very much appreciate helping information.

If you want to check an interactive `rear recover` then you'll need to
take strace along with `PROGS+=(strace)` and run it like this or
similar:

    strace -qq -f -o log.txt -e execve rear recover
    sed -ne 's#.*execve("\([^"]*\).*$#\1#p' <log.txt | sort -u | tee >/mnt/local/root/rear-progs.txt

@schlomo  
thanks for your input!

Perhaps I can use it for another task but for what I would like  
to get here I think it does not help (as far as I understand it).  
Things like 'strace' or anything that monitors a currently  
running 'rear' can only show what that current run does.  
To find out how interactive stuff behaves during a current run  
I just need to do and watch that current run.

But what I would like to find out is what interactive stuff  
could be hidden at any place in the code that I do not see  
when I run it myself.  
Think about code like

<pre>
if CONDITION ; then
    echo "Please confirm removal of $some_file"
    rm -i $some_file
fi
</pre>

When CONDITION is not true when I run it in my environment  
I can never see myself that this code would no longer work.

Simply put:  
I was looking for some kind of static code analysis.

I think static code analysis for bash is really tricky.

`find usr \( -name \*.conf -o -name \*.sh \) -exec cat '{}' \+ | sed -n -e 's#^[\t ]\+##' -e 's/ .*$//' -e '/^[#"()[{};>*$]/b' -e '/[=()|$:]/b' -e 'p' | sort -u`
gives too many false positives because it doesn't understand multi-line
strings, here strings etc.

`find usr \( -name \*.conf -o -name \*.sh \) -exec cat '{}' \+ | sed -n -e 's#^[\t ]\+##' -e 's/ .*$//' -e '/^[#"()[{};>*$-]/b' -e '/[=()|$:"'"'"']/b' -e 'p' | sort -u | xargs which`
only finds programs that you actually have installed, but you can be
sure that all of them can be called by ReaR.

Maybe we can actually use this last part to automatically populate the
`PROGS` variable ☺

HTH,  
Schlomo

Things are somewhat worse than expected.  
Currently my primary concern are the zillions of 'echo' commands  
and things like that.  
In most cases their output is not meant for the user.  
But some output is actually for the user.

I will fix as many regressions as I can  
(which means as many as I detect).

If current redirected STDOUT is too bad for normal usage  
I found meanwhile a good way how one could work easily  
with redirected STDOUT for testing and development  
but the default is no redirected STDOUT  
via this change in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
 # Make stdout the same what stderr already is.
 # This keeps strict ordering of stdout and stderr outputs
 # because now both stdout and stderr use one same file descriptor:
-exec 1>&2
+test "$REAR_STDOUT_INTO_LOG" && exec 1>&2

</pre>

Now one can call

<pre>
REAR_STDOUT_INTO_LOG=y usr/sbin/rear ...
</pre>

to run it with redirected STDOUT for testing  
but otherwise it runs as before.

@schabrolles  
I ask you because in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1348](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1348)  
it seems you are a TSM user:

restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
contains 'echo' commands where I do not fully understand  
how they are meant so that I cannot fix them to work  
with redirected STDOUT.

Could you please have a look?

@jsmeix,

Most of the `echo` used in this script are used to produce an animation
showing restoration in progress.  
"Cursor" animation : '/' '-' '' '|'  
and number of files restored change and stay in a single line.

I don't think we need to copy this in a log file ... May be only the
result (number of files restored)

@schabrolles  
thanks for your information!

I like it so much to have functions that are named  
as existing (and totally different) tools:

<pre>
# type -a star
star is /usr/bin/star

# man star

  Star is a very fast tar(1) like tape archiver
  with improved functionality.

@schabrolles we got rid of the progress indicator (spinner) in ReaR, is
your code doing something like that?

I wonder in general to what extent an animated cursor  
is useful when the animation only proceeds if there  
is output from a long running command, i.e. when  
the code is of this form:

<pre>
# for each animated_cursor function call
# show one of the characters / - \ |
function animated_cursor () {
    ...
}

long_running_command \
  | while read long_running_command_stdout ; do
        echo $long_running_command_stdout
        animated_cursor
    done
</pre>

When long\_running\_command outputs there is no real need  
for an additional animated cursor but as long as  
long\_running\_command does not output (i.e. when there would be  
a real need for an animated cursor) nothing is shown.

I think a more useful implementation might be like

<pre>
long_running_command_output=""
long_running_command 2>&1 \
  | while read -t 1 long_running_command_output || TODO ; do
        if test "$long_running_command_output" ; then
            echo $long_running_command_output
            long_running_command_output=""
        else
            animated_cursor
        fi
    done
</pre>

The problem is that read returns non-zero exit code when it  
times out so that "wile read -t 1 ... || ..." must be used  
to continue the while loop when read times out.  
But "wile read -t 1 ... || true" results an endless loop.  
Currently I don't know what TODO in this case to  
continue the while loop only when read times out.

The only thing that works for me is this way

<pre>
long_running_command_output=""
{ echo foo ; sleep 5 ; cat /etc/issue ; sleep 5 ; cat qqq ; sleep 5 ; echo FINISHED ; } 2>&1 \
  | while read -t 1 long_running_command_output || true ; do
        if test "$long_running_command_output" ; then
            test "FINISHED" = "$long_running_command_output" && break
            echo $long_running_command_output
            long_running_command_output=""
        else
            animated_cursor
        fi
    done 1>&7
</pre>

via an artificial special final "FINISHED" string  
to break the endless while loop.

@jsmeix @schabrolles @schlomo I would prefer to get rid with the
animation - any objection?

That's what I meant.

I also would prefer to get rid of the animated cursor,  
at least in its currently implemented form.

In general I think ReaR does not need to provide  
any automated ongoing "I am still alive" messaging.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1401](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1401)
merged  
I think I found and fixed (hopefully) almost all places  
where 'echo' was used to output on STDOUT.  
What is not yet fixed are arbitrary program calls  
like "less some\_file" or "vi another\_file"  
which will be my work for the next week...

@gdha  
it seems you changed the milestone date  
for ReaR v 2.2 to 20 July 2017  
from end of September 2017 cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398\#issuecomment-311886920](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398#issuecomment-311886920)

@schlomo @gdha  
in this case I think it is perhaps better for ReaR v 2.2  
to stay on the safe side and to not have STDOUT redirected  
by default by disabling the STDOUT redirection in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
- exec 1>&2
+ # exec 1>&2
</pre>

Alternativerly we may have STDOUT redirected by default  
unless the '-v' option is specified so that users who miss  
user dialogs could easily get them back via "rear -v ..".

What do you think what is best for ReaR v 2.2?

For ReaR v 2.3 that is currently dated end of October 2017  
we can reconsider if the STDOUT redirection should  
then be done by default in any case.

@jsmeix @schlomo The purpose of ReaR v2.2 is to have an intermediate
package on request of a customer (where Schlomo did some updates for
\[which are not yet in the master\]). The question of STDOUT redirects
by default? If you do not mind to post-pone to the 2.3 release then I
would go for that track?

I postponed the redirection of STDOUT vor ReaR v 2.2 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f47f705c0857e46b93c2ccc49b8ba504c05559eb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f47f705c0857e46b93c2ccc49b8ba504c05559eb)

This obsoletes

@gdha @schlomo  
I even prefer to have redirection of STDOUT postponed  
vor ReaR v 2.2 because this is best for our users.

After the ReaR v 2.2 release I will re-enable it again so that  
we can get user feedback how redirected STDOUT behaves.

redirection of stdout into the log file is re-enabled  
as intended for ReaR v 2.3 and if I cannot fix the  
possible regressions we can again postpone it.

Sufficiently done for ReaR 2.3.

Remaining things can be fixed for ReaR 2.4 or later  
as time permits and as users ask for it.
