currently in rear 1.18 the udev workflow  
runs a longer running task (by default the mkrescue workflow)  
that is triggered by plug-in of a "REAR-000" labeled USB stick  
via a udev event rule in etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules

But udev cannot be used to launch longer running tasks  
when a udev event happens.

Reason:

There is a hard 120 seconds timeout in udev  
after which any by udev started process is killed.

The reason is that udev proceeds event by event  
and as long as there is a process running that was  
started by udev for an event, udev cannot proceed  
with any subsequent event for that device.

Therefore udev kills any running process that was  
started by udev after 120 seconds.

As a consequence the whole udev workflow in rear  
cannot work as it is currently implemented.

Interestingly doc/rear-presentation.adoc contains

<pre>
  ** Easier workflow (udev): insert, wait, pull (2 min max)
</pre>

where the "2 min max" seems to indicate that the  
hard 120 seconds timeout in udev was know.

But from my point of view a hard kill after 120 seconds  
cannot be seriously considered to be an acceptable  
constraint for running a rear workflow.

@gdha  
@schlomo  
I ask for your opinion what to do here because  
I don't know what to do with the udev workflow  
at least for now for rear 1.19

IMHO we should change the design:

-   udev serves as a trigger
-   a systemd service waits for that trigger to run `rear mkrescue`or
    `rear mkbackup` as a task

That we we should get much better control over the entire process.

BTW, what prevents `rear mkrescue` from completing in 2 minutes?

Ha!  
my colleague who is a udev expert (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838\#issuecomment-219712673](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838#issuecomment-219712673)
)  
also mentioned to use a "systemd service"  
to do longer running tasks.

But ( fortunately! ;-) I am both a noob regarding udev  
and a noob regarding systemd so that (seriously)  
I really have no clue how I could implement that.

Regarding  
"what prevents rear mkrescue from completing in 2 minutes":

a)  
Slow USB medium and big UEFI bootable system  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810\#issuecomment-205783287](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810#issuecomment-205783287)

<pre>
An UEFI bootable ISO image is much bigger (almost 450MiB)
than a traditional BIOS bootable ISO image which is less than
120 MiB for me.
</pre>

b)  
The "mkrescue" workflow is not the only possible workflow  
that can be triggered via the udev workflow, e.g. via

<pre>
UDEV_WORKFLOW=mkbackup
</pre>

the mkbackup can be triggered via the udev workflow  
and then things can really last long when the slow  
USB stick is also used to store the backup.

c)  
In general running a rear workflow with a time bomb  
is probably not "the right thing" that can be used in a  
more professional (a.k.a. "enterprise") environment.  
On the other hand in such an enviroment probably  
nobody plugs-in USB sticks into hundreds of servers.

I fully agree that we should not rely on a 2 minute time limit
whatsoever.

However, I would still recommend to investigate why the UEFI image is 3x
bigger than the BIOS image. Sounds very strange to me.

I guess we have improved this size problem implementing much precise
measurements in commit 46212bc.  
But yes, EFI related devices are larger as kernel and initrd needs to be
copied two times, because of huge differences how elilo and grub
behaves.

IMHO we should find a way to have kernel & initrd only once on the
boot  
media.

Well that will be kind of hard, especially with elilo as it needs to
have initrd and kernel on same partition where from it is launched. Grub
on the other hand does not have such limitations...  
This of course applies only for EFI booting ...

I am not sure if I understand the full context. IMHO

-   we build a rescue image on an USB device
-   the USB device has a single partition with a simple file system like
    vfat
-   we put kernel and initramfs on that filesystem
-   we write elilo or grub configs that use those kernel and initrd

Or what actually happens? Maybe the "rescue boot from local system
disk"  
feature makes stuff more complicated?

I've foud point d) as continuance for @jsmeix list

If you are running server with no DNS servers configured following code
in 99\_sysreqs.sh adds to runtime until it times out:

    ip addr show | grep inet | grep -v 127.0.0. | sed -e "s/ brd.*//" -e "s/inet6//" -e "s/inet//" | while read ip ; do
      DNSname="$( dig +short -x ${ip%/*} )"
      if test -z "$DNSname" ; then
          echo "    ip ${ip%/*} subnet /${ip#*/}"
      else
          echo "    ip ${ip%/*} subnet /${ip#*/} DNS name $( dig +short -x ${ip%/*} )"
      fi
    done

Btw. I've uploaded whole log
[here](http://www.gozora.sk/tmp/rear-debian.log). As you can see Debian
looks to be even more eager and terminates the script after aprox 30s.

FYI:  
Regarding how to mitigate the problem that  
UEFI bootable ISO images are much bigger than  
traditional BIOS bootable ISO images,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841)  
I have that idea in mind since

Should I perhaps create a separated issue to  
"investigate why UEFI image is much bigger than BIOS image" ?

@jsmeix no need for investigation, I know it ;-) and I think I've
already explained it.  
It is all because of elilo and grub.

When you launch grub in EFI it can conveniently browse whole ISO content
so we can reach kernel and initrd wherever it is located.  
elilo on the other hand can see only content of partition/virtual image
where from it was launched for this reason it is desirable to have
kernel and initrd in same location like elilo is.

One more important fact is version of EFI. Some versions are capable of
seeing ONLY vfat portion of ISO (boot image) but other versions can see
content of whole ISO image...

For this reasons I've decided to have rather two copies of same data
then risking ending up with unbootable/useless medium.

@jsmeix Changed the flag from to 'bug' to 'minor bug' as the issue is
already open for 1 yr, and as nobody complains it cannot be a big
blocking issue. When I have time I will look into it - perhaps it is a
feature which can be removed?

I close it as "won't fix" because as nobody complains  
it doesn't hurt so that we can leave it as is.
