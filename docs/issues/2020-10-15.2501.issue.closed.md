(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

    Release:    20.04
    Codename:   focal

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    # cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=iso
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.10.1.247/rearx/test1/

yes it is my first try :-)

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    ESXi guest

    nfs or local

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

a) Typo in config file not reported.

b) Script 900\_copy\_result\_files.sh failed silently not installing a
README file which causes a latter script to fail. Should this script
handle the error better?

But since Im new to ReaR - I could be wrong on this. But from a newbie
experience ended up spending more time chasing up my nfs config,
doubting someting there since it was just newly installed nas etc... And
then it was just that I had a typo in a config file because I typed it
in instead of cut and paste.... Who says laziness doesnt pay.

It's a user experience type of thing, more of an enhancement then any
major issue,

E.g. local.conf contained "OUTPUT=iso"

Causes a shell script error with a cp failing copying a README file when
running rear

    rear -v mkrescue
    .... deleted msgs ....
    Copying resulting files to nfs location
    Saving /var/log/rear/rear-rearx.log as rear-rearx.log to nfs location
    Copying result files '/tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/tmp/VERSION /tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/tmp/README /tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/tmp/rear-rearx.log' to /tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/outputfs/rearx at nfs location
    ERROR: Could not copy result file /tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/tmp/README to /tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/outputfs/rearx at nfs location
    .... deleted msgs ....

The script which causes the error as it looks like it does not copy the
README file to /tmp/rear.6YQKxaBfN7OfgB8/tmp/README

/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/900\_copy\_result\_files.sh

And on this line could see what was going wrong -  
`cp $v $(get_template "RESULT_usage_$OUTPUT.txt") "${TMP_DIR}/rsync/${RSYNC_PREFIX}/README" >&2`

Looking at the potential files to be copied made me check the config
file for OUTPUT and indeeed it should be upper case (as is in the man
page etc)

    ls -1  /usr/share/rear/conf/templates/
    EFI_readme.txt
    ...
    RESULT_usage_ISO.txt
    ...

Tells me I had messed up the config file, and OUTPUT was incorrectly to
iso.

-   Workaround, if any:

a)  
In local.conf use -  
OUTPUT=ISO

b)  
Get more sleep :-)

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Thanks - been meaning to give ReaR a try every since I heard of it.  
I am sure, no doubt, it will save me hours at some point !!!!

Simply put:

Currently there is basically no syntax checking in ReaR  
(except at very few exceptional places).

Currently user experience is not an actual development goal for ReaR.

Of course we (i.e. the ReaR upstream developers) do not actively work
against our users  
but in almost all cases we and our users are happy when "things work at
all".

Cf. the section "RPM packages for disaster recovery" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads (excerpt):

    The software ... is intended for experienced users and system admins.
    There is no easy user-frontend (in particular there is no GUI)
    and in general software for disaster recovery
    does not behave really foolproof (it runs as 'root' and
    you need to know what it does). 

Further information:

Implementing reasonalby good user experience  
needs much more development time compared to  
implementing only the plain functionality.

We at ReaR upstream have many open issues about plain functionality,  
even huge things that wait but need to be done, for an example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2254](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2254)  
and the other issues mentioned therein, in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791\#issuecomment-406513969](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791#issuecomment-406513969)  
with more other issues mentioned therein.

So in foreseeable future there will be no ReaR upstream development
time  
for issues that go beyond plain functionality.

Of course things change when a user needs something implemented  
that he cannot implement on his own (e.g. "no knowledge" or "no time")  
but he can and wants to pay someone to implement if for him, see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/support/](http://relax-and-recover.org/support/)  
and  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)

I tried `OUTPUT=iso` and I see now that this issue is much more
serious  
than it looks on a first glance because with `OUTPUT=iso` none of the  
scripts in directories like `prep/ISO` and `output/ISO/` are run.  
In my particular case `rear -D mkrescue` did not even error out with
`OUTPUT=iso`  
so it behaves against "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

That makes complete sense, and appreciate the very complete response.
It's an imense project, and extremely important one. Keep up the good
work and park this issue as you feel appropriate.

Technically it is only a minor bug in ReaR when it misbehaves in case of
wrong or invalid user settings  
regardless that such misbehaviour could be a mayor annoyance for the
user - in particular when  
there are no helpful (error) messages.

Meanwhile (as always sleeping over an issue helps a lot ;-) I remember
the exceptional place  
where we have syntax checking in ReaR that matches this issue here:  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh)

I will add a matching prep/default/036\_valid\_output\_methods.sh

@pick34  
if you like you could add a  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/036\_valid\_output\_methods.sh  
script with content as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2503/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2503/files)  
to your installed ReaR scripts  
and play around how then ReaR behaves in case of invalid OUTPUT values.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2503](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2503)
merged  
this issue should be fixed  
as far as possible with reasonable implementation effort, cf.

@pick34  
thank you for your issue report that revealed a generic misbehaviour in
ReaR.

much appreciated. And again - much appreciated. Been meaning to
install  
ReaR for all our physical iron for some time now. Having problems with
a  
restore and rpcbin but that's for another bug.

Regards - Allan

@pick34  
you reported that you use ReaR 2.5.

ReaR 2.6 is our current ReaR upstream release, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
that lists a link that points to  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu\_20.04/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu_20.04/)  
wherefrom you can go to  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu\_20.04/amd64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu_20.04/amd64/)

You may also have a look at the sections  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" and  
"Help and Support" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In general we at ReaR upstream support (on a voluntary basis)  
only the newest ReaR upstream version or  
preferably the ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

This does not mean we reject all issues with older ReaR versions  
but we only spend time with older ReaR versions when it is obvious  
that the issue also exists in current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because we fix only the ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

Therefore "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"  
would help us at ReaR upstream most and at the same time  
it should help you most because when you are used to use  
our current upstream master code you get all our fixes directly.  
See also the section  
"Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
I.e. you can test the current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
until things work for you as you need it in your particular case  
and then don't change what works for you unless there is real need.
