The current TODO file still lists remaining known issues, some of which
are still relevant, but most no longer applicable.

Can everyone go through the list and remove those that they have added
or deemed irrelevant ? Those items that are still relevant should be
added to this issue-tracker.

I have already cleaned up the ones that affected me.

All issues have been moved to Github. This can effectively be closed
now.
