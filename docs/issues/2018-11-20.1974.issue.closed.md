-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): **2.4**

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): **RHEL7**

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    BACKUP=NBU

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

The Netbackup tools are copied as is into the rescue ISO. They are
located in `/usr/openv`.

It appears that the new
`usr/share/rear/build/default/980_verify_rootfs.sh` detects libraries
dependencies and complains because some binaries and libraries included
when including all of `/usr/openv` do not satisfy the dependencies.  
This leads to an error while creating the rescue ISO.

Also, before that, `/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh`
finds out libraries but skips them because they are copied in multiple
places (I will log an issue later about that).

Quick question: Do we have someone with access to NetBackup?

@rmetrich \#1907 is a similar issue like yours. One of my customers is
using NBU for backup, but not together with ReaR (they use
`BACKUP=NETFS`). Unfortunately my time is limited I can spend on ReaR
when I work for them (for obvious reasons as ReaR is working smoothly on
their site).

@gdha I'm working on that currently. Was asking because I don't have
access to NetBackup at all, so it's less efficient.

@rmetrich  
see in particular my comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907\#issuecomment-422338473](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907#issuecomment-422338473)

Because neither you nor I have access to NetBackup  
there is nothing we can do to properly fix issues with  
third-party backup tools.

As band-aid workaround for such issues I implemented  
`NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY`  
see default.conf.

Well I'll try having something better anyway.

I provided a patch to a customer, if this is a success, I'll submit it
here.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980)
merged  
I assume this issue is fixed.

@rmetrich  
many thanks for forwarding Red Hat's "private" ;-) fixes  
to ReaR upstream so that all ReaR users can benefit.  
It is much appreciated!

@jsmeix no no, these are not yet in RHEL's repo, it's just in dev phase
:-)

@rmetrich  
ah!  
Even better to keep ReaR upstream topmost up-to-date :-)
