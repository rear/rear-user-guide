Incremental or differential backup is currently  
only known to work with BACKUP\_URL=nfs://.  
Other BACKUP\_URL schemes may work but at least  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///... is known not to work with  
incremental or differential backup, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1141](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1141)

@gdha  
if it is o.k. for you I would like to have that test in ReaR 2.0  
to avoid that users use incremental/differential backup  
with BACKUP\_URL=usb
