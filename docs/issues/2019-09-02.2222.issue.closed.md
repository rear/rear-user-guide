#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): \*\* ALL, including latest\*\*

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): **All Linux using LVM2**

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): **ALL**

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): **ALL**

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): **ALL**

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): **ALL**

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

With \#1806 we fixed LVM2 volume group recreation when volume groups had
Thin pools.  
The idea consisted in using `vgcfgrestore` then deleting the Thin pools
and recreating them using `lvcreate` commands.  
It appears that this is not working properly, see Red Hat BZ
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1747468](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1747468)
for details.

Additionally, our use of `vgcfgrestore` is probably not appropriate at
all, it works by chance (see comment
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1747468\#c3](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1747468#c3)
for details). Typically, it works only for Linear volumes, and won't
probably for Caches and Raid hierarchies or when there are existing
Snapshots on the system.

-   Workaround, if any:

The only proper solution I see is stop relying on `vgcfgrestore` at all,
but then we are not capable of restoring volume groups and logical
volumes with all properties from original system.

**So what should we do now???**

What properties would be lost? To preserve segment properties, I
proposed using lvextend for each segment separately, see

Tons of properties, and also dependent on the release of LVM2.  
For example when LV is cached, when Raid level is complicated.  
For now, only a small subset of properties are fetched using **lvm lvs**
(see `layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh`)

@dwlehman, do you please have any advice on how to save LVM
configuration for later recreation on a different system, while
preserving the above mentioned properties and not relying on
vgcfgrestore?

A general note one such kind of issues:

There are many other cases where ReaR does not support  
arbitrary sophisticated or complicated setups.

E.g. arbitrary file system tuning parameters are often not supported  
(only for XFS there is rather complete support for that, cf.
`MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS`)  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2010](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2010)  
or one can set up a too complicated disk layout structure  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2023](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2023)  
or whatever special bootloader stuff  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2003](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2003)  
and so on ...

Currently in very most cases "rear mkrescue" does not even detect  
when things are too complicated for ReaR so "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
seems to "just work" but later the user learns the hard way  
by doing a test with "rear recover" when things don't work,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005\#issuecomment-447806726](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005#issuecomment-447806726)

Currently this is how ReaR is meant to be used:  
Do a tentative "rear mkbackup" and then verify on your replacement
hardware  
that "rear recover" actually works for your case, cf. in particular the
section  
"No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and several other similar places in that article.

So - from my point of view - what would help first and foremost is  
that "rear mkrescue" could detect more cases (as far as already known)  
where the system is "too complicated for ReaR" and error out in such
cases.

Such cases (missing functionality in ReaR) would be neither an
`Error()`  
nor a `BugError()` but a new kind of `MissingFeatureError()`.

I missed that in current ReaR the bug is that vgcfgrestore is the wrong
tool  
according to
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1747468\#c3](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1747468#c3)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26300485?u=9105d243bc9f7ade463a3e52e8dd13fa67837158&v=4" width="50">[pcahyna](https://github.com/pcahyna) commented at [2019-09-03 13:32](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2222#issuecomment-527459824):

So, the strategy could be:

-   first of all, implement the detection of cases where the
    vgcfgrestore strategy will not work, and warn the user in those
    cases
-   then gradually implement the missing cases (if feasible).

By the way, I looked at what Clonezilla is doing. From a quick look at
the sources, they seem to restore using vgcfgrestore, and don't mention
anything special for thin pools at all, so they probablty have not
considered this use case either.

A side note FYI  
how one could set up basically anything with ReaR see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2086](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2086)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2019-09-03 14:00](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2222#issuecomment-527471604):

In general regarding "warn the user" see  
[https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

That's why I would prefer to error out with something like a

    MissingFeatureError "Unable to restore VG rhel/pool00 with Thin volumes: Thin pool rhel-pool00-tpool"

plus - to "provide final power to the user" - a new config variable  
something like `LVM_THIN_VOLUMES_IGNORE=( rhel/pool00 )`  
where the user can specify what should be deliberately ignored  
so that he can intentionally skip the matching `MissingFeatureError`  
i.e. this is the way how the user confirms that he is aware of the
issue.

@jsmeix I meant to "warn the user" by erroring out actually, I agree
that just log a warning and continue is not that helpful. The key part
though is to detect the problem during the mkrescue step, not during the
recovery step, when it is too late.

so, is unclear to me what the status closed of this issue means: is ReaR
able or not to recreate a lvm on thin pool structure like this?

I think the bot has closed the issue prematurely. ReaR still cannot
recreate a thin pool structure. If you don't want / have no resources to
support this, perhaps you should mention it. also related upstream BZ is

By the way, what version of ReaR have you tried and what errors did you
get on your thin pool layout?
