-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
replaced the hardcoded 'reboot'  
by using a `REBOOT_COMMANDS` array  
(plus REBOOT\_COMMANDS\_LABEL string)  
so the user could specify a alternative command  
like 'shutdown' or 'poweroff'  
(see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3068](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3068))  
or a sequence of commands if needed  
(plus a label that is shown to the user).

Use USER\_INPUT\_INTERRUPT\_TIMEOUT  
and USER\_INPUT\_UNATTENDED\_TIMEOUT  
instead of hardcoded 'sleep' timeout values  
to speed up things in unattended\_recovery mode.

Show non-zero exit codes to the user  
when sourcing config files failed.

Abort when /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
does not exist (or is empty).

Set `SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV="null"` in any case  
(not only when sourcing default.conf)  
because also in other config files (e.g. local.conf)  
secret default values could be set via

    { VARIABLE='secret value' ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

It works well for me with

    ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended
    ISO_DEFAULT=automatic
    RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND=poweroff
    USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT=5

    OUTPUT=ISO

I mean I get a full automated and unattended recovery  
with 'poweroff' after recovery.

If you wonder why would anyone want anything else than a simple command
for reboot - on machines with more sophisticated firmware one may need
some complicated dance with firmware settings, as we currently do in our
PowerVM test here

Regarding the name - wouldn't `UNATTENDED_REBOOT_COMMANDS` for example
be more descriptive? The setting seems to be used only in the unattended
case.

The current RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND is used  
both in the 'automatic\_recovery'  
and in the 'unattended\_recovery' cases  
via

    reboot_command="${RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND:-reboot}"
    ...
    if automatic_recovery ; then
    ...
            choices+=( "$reboot_command" )
    ...
                (3)
                    $reboot_command
    ...
    if unattended_recovery ; then
    ...
            echo -e "\n'$reboot_command' in $timeout seconds (Ctrl-C to interrupt)\n"
    ...
            $reboot_command

(see its description in default.conf).

So UNATTENDED\_REBOOT\_COMMANDS would be a too specific name  
and AUTOMATIC\_OR\_UNATTENDED\_REBOOT\_COMMANDS looks oververbose  
and perhaps the current RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND might become  
useful later also for other (currently unknown) use cases.

So I think the current generic name is future-proof and  
it still tells sufficiently what that thingy is about.  
That RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND does not matter when the user  
manually types in his reboot command should be obvious.

@pcahyna  
in your example  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070\#issuecomment-1802901263](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070#issuecomment-1802901263)  
it seems POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT or POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
are sufficient for your needs so I am still wondering  
if more than a simple command is ever needed  
for the actual "reboot" call?

The only reason I can imagine right now is that some  
reboot preparation commands are needed but then I wonder  
why POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS could ever be not sufficient.  
I.e. I am wondering if ever reboot preparation commands  
cannot be run "inside" 'rear' via POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
but must be run after "rear recover" had finished.

I ask because a RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMANDS array  
would make the code (a bit) more complicated and  
unless there is a reason I would prefer the KISS principle.

On the other hand a RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMANDS array  
would make it even more future-proof for other  
(currently unknown) use cases.

Preparation steps can be done in POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS and only the
actual reboot in RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND. But to me it looks more
logical to keep related things in one place. Otherwise, one has to think
about stuff like, what if ReaR fails, won't it lead to the execution of
one command without the other? (It would not, by the way, as I
understand it, because if there is an error exit,
POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS are skipped, and the script which runs
RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND skips it as well in case of a non-zero exit
code. But one has to think about it, while if one puts it into one
variable, the relation is obvious.)

An user who will investigate how to automate things will see both
POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS and RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND and it will be
easier to use if both are named the same way (without the subtle
COMMANDS vs. COMMAND difference) and use the same semantics (array of
commands).

Yes, we don't know what the users' use case will be, so an array is more
flexible, especially if users want to set the variable at multiple
places (think site.conf vs. local.conf or managing local.conf by
appending multiple pieces of content). That was the reason of preferring
`*_COMMANDS` over `*_SCRIPT`: with a single script like it is difficult
to append (or in the case of reboot, prepend) commands to a preexisting
setting: one has to do some complicated dance with semicolons to get it
right.

Thank you for pointing out that the command is also for the automatic
but not unattended case. Still, to me it does not look obvious that
RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND is run after ReaR terminates (somehow one
would expect a POST\_RECOVERY thing to be run after a RECOVERY thing,
not before). OTOH, I am not able to find a better name now and maybe the
REBOOT part makes it clear enough (reboot must be the last thing to be
done).

Maybe something like `RESCUE_SYSTEM_REBOOT_COMMANDS` as it is actually
run by the rescue system and not ReaR itself? `POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS`
and `RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMANDS` would also work for me, or maybe
`RESCUE_REBOOT_COMMANDS`?

Maybe most important is to stick with the naming scheme of `*_COMMANDS`
that makes finding those options simpler and trusting users to read the
explanation we put into our `default.conf` for each of those.

@pcahyna @schlomo  
thank you for your valuable comments.

Perhaps the simplest and most clear name is

    REBOOT_COMMANDS

without additional things like "RECOVERY" or "POST"  
because REBOOT alone makes it clear what it is about.

My assumption is that users who think about setting  
'REBOOT\_COMMANDS' read its description in default.conf  
and normally the default `REBOOT_COMMANDS=( reboot )`  
"just works" unnoticed by users so in particular users  
won't falsely fear that e.g. "rear mkbackup" may 'reboot'.

Good idea, simple is better, and rebooting is sort of very final for a
program to do, so that the exact context doesn't matter so much. :-)

@pcahyna  
thank you in particular for your

    Preparation steps can be done in POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS
    and only the actual reboot in RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND.
    But to me it looks more logical to
    keep related things in one place.

I mention RFC1925 so often,  
in particular RFC1925 items (5) and (6) and  
I tell so often to Keep Separated Issues Separated ("KSIS")  
but here I was about to implement RFC1925 items (5) and (6),  
so lesson learned  
(could be RFC1925 additional item (13) - its number tells all :-)

    (13)
    No matter how hard you try, in practice you can't avoid
    to implement item (5) and/or (6) of this RFC1925
    (unless others care and show you your fault).

Thank you @jsmeix for this improvement. I have found another use for it
: copy logs like /var/log/messages and the systemd journal to /mnt/local
for later inspection. It would be more logical to do it in
POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS in fact, but it may be better to copy logs as
late as possible to capture the most of them.

@pcahyna  
currently REBOOT\_COMMANDS are only useful when "rear recover"  
is run in 'auto\_recover'/'automatic' or 'unattended' mode.  
I am thinking about how to make REBOOT\_COMMANDS also useful  
when "rear recover" is run manually.  
The problem is how to make ReaR's internal REBOOT\_COMMANDS data  
available outside of ReaR so that the user could call them  
on his commandline.

We don't know what happens between a user running `rear recover`
manually and eventually rebooting the system - and we don't know if
`/mnt/local` is still the recovered system or maybe something else.

Therefore I'd be careful about assuming too much and copying logs there.

The situation of running the recovery fully automated is much more
controlled so that in that case it is safe to make those assumptions.

I think that this PR is a very good iteration and improvement for ReaR,
big thanks to @jsmeix for working on this.

This is not a problem for the case I mentioned, because I need this to
collect data in automated testing, which runs unattended. (It could be a
ReaR enhancement to copy systems logs at the end of recovery though. We
are already doing the same with the recovery log.)

what do you mean by "making them useful"? I would not execute them
automatically at the end, that's what `POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS` are for.
One could preload the shell history with the commands or something
similar.

With "making them useful when 'rear recover' is run manually"  
I mean that the user could relatively easily  
run the REBOOT\_COMMANDS manually from his  
recovery system commandline prompt.

What I am currently thinking about is something like a script  
e.g. /bin/reboot\_commands.sh inside the recovery system  
that gets generated during "rear mkrescue" so that  
the user could alternatively call that script  
instead of "reboot" if he wants.
