### Requesting support or just a question

BACKUP=NETFS

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output

Hello,  
I use LUKS encryption on my server.  
Maybe it is possible to get a copy of the operating system  
and later restore it as is (with existing slots).  
Is it possible without setting the LUKS password phrase  
at the time of the restoration process?  
I tried different options with values ​​in the  
LUKS\_CRYPTSETUP\_OPTIONS variable,  
but this did not give results.

From what I see in the code in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh#L91>  
it seems there is support for some predefined `password` value.

As far as I understand the code that predefined `password` value  
can be specified in the disklayout.conf file  
in the `crypt` entries, see  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc#luks-devices>

    LUKS Devices

    crypt /dev/mapper/<name> ... [password=<password>] ...

Because I hope it is not possible to get a LUKS password  
out of a running system, I assume it is not possible to store  
a LUKS password during "rear mkrescue" in the disklayout.conf file.

So to provide a predefined LUKS password for "rear recover"  
you would have to manually add it to disklayout.conf  
from inside the running ReaR recovery system  
before you launch "rear recover".

So this is likely not what you mean with "without setting the  
LUKS password phrase at the time of the restoration process"  
because you would have to manually add it to disklayout.conf  
at the time of the restoration process.

Therefore I think the only way out could be  
using the BLOCKCLONE backup method  
which does basically 'dd' of a whole block device, see  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/12-BLOCKCLONE.adoc>

The BLOCKCLONE backup method is meanwhile rather old,  
e.g. see in its documentation

    GPT not supported (work in progress)
    No UEFI support (work in progress)

and - as far as I can tell - it is likely not much used  
(otherwise I would expect at least a few user issue reports)  
so certain things may no longer work or may need some  
adaptions and enhancements to make it work again.

I have no personal experience with the BLOCKCLONE backup method  
so I cannot help much when there are issues in this area.

@jsmeix Thank you for your response. I will try to study the code in the
script 160\_include\_luks\_code.sh  
Thanks a lot again.
