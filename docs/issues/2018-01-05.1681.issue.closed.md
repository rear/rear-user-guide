See the "problem with sparse partition-names" mail thread  
on the <rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org> mailing list  
in particular  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-January/003506.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-January/003506.html)

Summary:

In case of non-consecutive partition device nodes for a disk  
(e.g. /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda3 exist but there is no /dev/sda2)  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" produces a right disklayout.conf  
but "rear recover" recreates something different  
(i.e. /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 but no /dev/sda3)  
and that causes various issues.

The workaround for the user is to manually add  
on his original system placeholder partitions  
(e.g. a tiny /dev/sda2 placeholder partition)  
to ensure consecutive partition device nodes for the disk.

There should be at least tests in ReaR that warn or error out  
in case of non-consecutive partition device nodes for a disk.

In case of traditional MBR partitioning with an extended partition  
that contains logical partitions like

<pre>
/dev/sda1 is a boot partition
/dev/sda2 is an extended partition
/dev/sda5 is the first logical partition
/dev/sda6 is the second logical partition
</pre>

the "missing" /dev/sda3 and /dev/sda4 are not an issue  
but things like

<pre>
/dev/sda1 is a boot partition
/dev/sda3 is an extended partition
/dev/sda5 is the first logical partition
/dev/sda6 is the second logical partition
</pre>

(/dev/sda2 is missing)  
or

<pre>
/dev/sda1 is a boot partition
/dev/sda2 is an extended partition
/dev/sda5 is the first logical partition
/dev/sda7 is the second logical partition
</pre>

(/dev/sda6 is missing)  
would be an issue.

Details:

In case of non-consecutive partition device nodes for a disk  
i.e. when partition table entries are empty on the disk  
for example when in case of traditional MBR partitioning  
the two first partition table entries are empty  
so that there is no /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 like this

<pre>
# fdisk -l
Disk /dev/sda: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk identifier: 0x00050095

/dev/sda4       12597272 41943039 29345768  14G  f W95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/sda5       12597280 37769247 25171968  12G 83 Linux
/dev/sda6       37769256 41941031  4171776   2G 83 Linux

# mount | grep sda
/dev/sda5 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
/dev/sda3 on /boot type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
</pre>

"rear mkrescue" produces correct entries in disklayout.conf like

<pre>
# Disk /dev/sda
# Format: disk <devname> <size(bytes)> <partition label type>
disk /dev/sda 21474836480 msdos
# Partitions on /dev/sda

part /dev/sda 3224371200 3225427968 primary boot /dev/sda3
part /dev/sda 1024 6449803264 extended lba /dev/sda4
part /dev/sda 12888047616 6449807360 logical none /dev/sda5
part /dev/sda 2135949312 19337859072 logical none /dev/sda6
# Filesystems (only ext2,ext3,ext4,vfat,xfs,reiserfs,btrfs are supported).
# Format: fs <device> <mountpoint> <fstype> [uuid=<uuid>] [label=<label>] [<attributes>]
fs /dev/sda3 /boot ext4 uuid=a9a9689b-498c-4262-b211-eb0bd2eeea93 label= blocksize=4096 reserved_blocks=5% max_mounts=-1 check_interval=0d bytes_per_inode=16384 default_mount_options=user_xattr,acl options=rw,relatime,data=ordered

swap /dev/sda6 uuid=b83c85d0-587e-4aa4-bba7-5bd6c9d7b307 label=
</pre>

but during "rear recover" it fails because diskrestore.sh  
looks like this (excerpts)

<pre>
parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos >&2
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart 'primary' 2097152B 3226468351B >&2
parted -s /dev/sda set 3 boot on >&2
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart 'extended' 3226472448B 21474836479B >&2
parted -s /dev/sda set 4 lba on >&2
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart 'logical' 3226476544B 16114524159B >&2
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart 'logical' 16114528256B 18250477567B >&2
</pre>

which fails at "parted -s /dev/sda set 3 boot on" with

<pre>
+++ parted -s /dev/sda set 3 boot on
Error: Partition doesn't exist.
</pre>

because there is no partition 3 because what was  
the boot partition /dev/sda3 on the original system  
gets recreated as first primary partition /dev/sda1  
and the extended partition /dev/sda4 on the original system  
will be recreated as second partition /dev/sda2.

Because the disklayout.conf saves the right partition device nodes  
of the original system it should be possible (with reasonable effort)  
to use this for tests preferably during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
and/or at least during "rear recover" when partition device nodes  
that get or will be created on the replacement hardware  
will or do not match the ones on the original system.

An addedum:  
As far as I see the current MIGRATION\_MODE in ReaR  
only has some basic support to migrate whole disks  
but currently there is no support in ReaR to migrate  
partitions on a disk as it would be needed here  
but migrating partitions is not considered here.  
Migrating partitions on a disk could become a future  
enhancement - provided there is actual need for it.

My offhanded idea is to add a new  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_conf.sh  
(same idea behind as for build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh)  
that tests if there are non-consecutive partition device nodes  
for a disk in the disklayout.conf file.

Not doable in the currently planned time until the ReaR 2.4 release,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1790\#issue-319663141](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1790#issue-319663141)

That would be a drastic change, but maybe using disk UUIDs in
disklayout.conf instead of names, bypassing completely the devices
names. The resulting partition scheme would not be 100% equal but it
would be simpler for the recovery process imho

I'm not familiar with rear workflow so I may be heading in the wrong
direction though.

@GreenBlood  
can you explain in more detail how you think using disk identifiers  
(instead of plain kernel device nodes) could help?

A side note:  
In general what is called a UUID in this area is a filesystem UUID  
but on empty disks on replacement hardware there are none.

I think on new replacement hardware whatever hardware disk identifiers  
would usually not match what there was on the original system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1057\#issuecomment-258832970](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1057#issuecomment-258832970)

Furthermore I think that any kind of other naming for disk devices  
would not help because in the end there is a sequence of `parted`
calls  
that create all partitions on the replacement disk from scratch  
where the first `parted` call is `parted mklabel` which creates  
a new partition table from scratch and then all partitions are  
created one by one via subsequent `parted mkpart` calls,  
see what during `rear recover` a 'diskrestore.sh' contains  
or my initial description above which contains excerpts  
of a 'diskrestore.sh' on my test system.

I think the root cause is that `parted mkpart` has no support  
to specify the intended partition number - at least I do not see  
how one could do that in the parted manual at  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html)  
except by creating dummy placeholder partitions in between  
that get later removed via `parted rm` as workaround.

A disklayout.conf syntax check as proposed in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2006\#issuecomment-460646685](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2006#issuecomment-460646685)  
is much related to other checks as the above proposed  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681\#issuecomment-355611173](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681#issuecomment-355611173)  
so that all such checks should be in one same script.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2060](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2060)
merged  
I consider this issue to be done.

The new verify script
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
tests disklayout.conf that was created by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
for non-consecutive partitions and lets "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
error out if non-consecutive partitions are found because currently  
"rear recover" fails when there are non-consecutive partitions and  
it is better to errors out early during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
when things cannot work during "rear recover", cf.
