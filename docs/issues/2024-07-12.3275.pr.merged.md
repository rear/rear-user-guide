-   Type: **Other?**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Description of the changes in this pull request: After merging PR
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3269](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3269)
    we wanted to enhance the spelling check workflow to use
    codespell-project/actions-codespell instead of building our own
    image. Furthermore, now we only have to check the added or changed
    files and not the complete master branch.

Yep - it works fine as it found a spelling error in its own workflow ;-)

    Error: ./.github/workflows/spellcheck.yml:22: seperate ==> separate
    Codespell found one or more problems

@gdha I'm wondering if another approach might be simpler: Use the PR
files changed info to create an exclude file that lists all the files
that *didn't* change and then let codespell work on the full repo? You
can simply append the not-changed files to the potentially existing
exclude list file and that should be enough. And safe with regard to
funny file names.
