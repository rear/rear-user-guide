Please forgive me.  
I am so sorry for leaving this message here, but I couldn't find any
other resources....

Is there an IRC channel where users and developers of Relax-and-Recover
go to assist each other?

My situation is that I am on Fedora 21 Workstation and I can run both
the format and mkrescue without errors on both an external Toshiba 1TB
USB 3.0 drive and a PNY 8GB thumbdrive. But for some reason neither of
them will boot. It's probably related to my laptop (a Gigabyte P35) but
I would like to talk to others about it... Maybe someone has a similar
situation...

Again, I apologize for putting this question here.  
I really hope that there is a IRC channel somewhere...

There exists an IRC channel \#rear however I don't find the time anymore
to follow it actively. Need to work to earn some money;
