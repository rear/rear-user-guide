After a successful recovery the system hangs on /boo/efi as it cannot
mount it, because the original UUID (from the source) was changed on the
target system. The /etc/fstab entry of /boot/efi can contain an UUID
which was changed after recovery...

    UUID=07B1-600D          /boot/efi               vfat ...

Rear does not contain yet the code to change the new UUID of vfat file
systems in restored /etc/fstab file.
