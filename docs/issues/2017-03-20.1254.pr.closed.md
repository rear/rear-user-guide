<strike>I have no experience with `mkbackup`. Should that do the
`mkrescue` step again? Or not?</strike>

Yes it should, according to
[540\_choose\_backup\_archive](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/547c17bcde83b7aef71424bd51d39a127c8bf0c1/usr/share/rear/verify/USB/NETFS/default/540_choose_backup_archive.sh#L22)
`mkbackup` should make backup+recovery, where `mkbackuponly` should only
make the backup.

When testing these 2 commands, they seem to run ok.

@jsmeix One unintended debug leftover is removed. The commenting of the
debug section has now been uncommented.

This code not only introduces systemd-boot boot support. I needed to
catch some situation to prevent execution from breaking, f.e. because of
not existing commands, folders, etcetera.

Which code raises questions? I will then add some more comments to try
to explain what and why.

@gdha I did try to exclude
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup from the git
commit, though that failed due to my inexperience with `git`.

@ProBackup-nl any chance to rework the pull request?

@gdha Am I correctly understand that:

> I think @schlomo is right that we first should detect where the ESP
> directory is located and use that in a variable, e.g. ESP\_DIR

is referring to:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1246\#pullrequestreview-27076231](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1246#pullrequestreview-27076231)  
?

I do need a little more guidance into the desired direction for
reworking ESP\_DIR, as commented in [pull request
1246](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1246#discussion_r111259160).

@gdha I am stuck in reverting changed files in this branch that are not
related to this pull request. Removing files from the pushed commit is a
challenge.

Regression:  
[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things)
doesn't help.

Any changes that are not strictly related to systemd-boot support are
now moved to separate pull requests: \#1288, \#1289, \#1290, \#1291,
\#1292, \#1293, \#1294.

The goal here is to only commit these changed files here:

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh 
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh 
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh 
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/830_copy_kernel_initrd.sh 
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh 
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/070_find_systemd-boot.sh 
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh 
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_find_syslinux_modules.sh 
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/400_check_extlinux.sh 
    usr/share/rear/prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh 
    usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh 

That leaves me with the question: **How to fix this branch and/or pull
request from undesired file changes?**

My best guess is:

1.  `git log --graph --decorate --oneline`

<!-- -->

    * 0fd2f3b1 (HEAD -> rear/rear#1214, origin/rear/rear#1214, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) ESP_DIR added, duplicate check for /boot/efi in both 310 and 320 removed in 320, explicitly error out in 310 when USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER is set to 1 and there is no /boot/efi
    * 7917a0be systemd-boot support added
    * 97016d5a line 53: syntax error near unexpected token else fixed
    * 8d03b0ce syntax error near /boot fixed
    * 24f5b514 320_include_uefi_env made less case sensitive, and also allowing /boot to be completely VFAT file system
    *   4fb1f98a (upstream/master) Merge pull request #1219 from jsmeix/small_coding_style_iprovements_regarding_pull_request_1217

1.  figure out a decent SHA historical version from before 7917a0b, my
    guess 97016d5
2.  `# git checkout SHA -- path/to/filename`

Maybe, I should [revert this unmerged
commit](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html#pushed_new_simple)
using: `git revert SHA`?

@ProBackup-nl do a `git pull` first to fix the upstream modified files
first. If that does not work I would discard this pull request and
create a new one with an updated branch

@gdha It seems I fixed the upstream modified files:

    # git status
    On branch rear/rear#1214
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/rear/rear#1214'.
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    # git pull
    Already up-to-date.

I was even able to revert 0fd2f3b1 and 7917a0b.

Now my limited knowledge makes me think that it is best to bring the
rear/rear\#1214 branch up to date with rear:master (instead of 87
commits behind rear:master) (How?). Then re-apply my changes, `commit`
and `push`. Or do you have better suggestions?

@ProBackup-nl based on feedback I saw I think we better drop this pull
request and start from scratch with first finding the ESP partition

As issue \#1214 has been closed - we better close this PR request as
well - until further notice.
