-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    see
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539\#discussion\_r540783195](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539#discussion_r540783195)  
    and
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2155](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2155)

The value of SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD but also  
ZYPPER\_ROOT\_PASSWORD and YUM\_ROOT\_PASSWORD  
values must not appear in the log file  
in particular not in debugscript mode with `set -x`.

The enhancement is that with things like

    { test "$SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD" ; } 2>/dev/null || SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD=''

it is posible to have no SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD in etc/rear/local.conf  
but specify it only when needed as exported environment variable like

    # HISTIGNORE='*SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD*'
    # export SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='qqqq'
    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue

to set that password in the recovery system  
without a trace about its value in the log  
or in a ReaR config file or in the bash history.
