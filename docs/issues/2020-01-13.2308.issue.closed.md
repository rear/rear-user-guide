There are no such links because there is no Red Hat 8 in  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/)  
or  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/)

I guess this is because ReaR is not built for Red Hat 8 according to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
and this is because it sems there is not yet Red Hat 8 available at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/add\_repository\_from\_default\_list/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/add_repository_from_default_list/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
so currently ReaR cannot be built for Red Hat 8.

But because ReaR is only bash scripts (plus documentation)  
and ReaR's bash scripts are the same for all Linux distributions  
it means that, in the end, it does not really matter for which  
Linux distribution you use those bash scripts.

Bottom line:  
I think for Red Hat 8 you can use ReaR that is built for Red Hat 7.  
But I am not a Red Hat user so I cannot verify if this is actually true.
