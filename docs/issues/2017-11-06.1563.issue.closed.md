-   Brief description of the issue:  
    The EFI System Partition cannot be created correctly because the

-   Work-around, if any:  
    In:  
    /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
    the command:

<pre>
parted -s $device mkpart '$name' ${start}B $end >&2
</pre>

at lines 190 and 203, should be:

<pre>
parted -s $device mkpart '"$name"' ${start}B $end >&2
</pre>

whereas the command:

<pre>
echo "parted -s $device name $number '$name' >&2"
</pre>

at line 246 should be:

<pre>
echo "parted -s $device name $number '\"$name\"' >&2"

@gozora  
yesterday I had a quick look at that code  
but I do not yet fully understand what goes on.

In particular I do not understand how those values  
could contain blanks (so that special quoting is needed).

I fear a plain wrong value gets used here - I mean  
a value that is not meant for that parted parameters.

Because the values in a disklayout.conf line are positional values  
a missing value (e.g. when one is empty) lead to false  
positional values in a disklayout.conf line which results that  
wrong values get used for certain parted parameters  
and that shows up as weird errors at unexpected places.

But currently I have no time for a deeper analysis  
what actually goes wrong here - be patient...

I hit the issue as well.  
Commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2540c7a2319791b58fa2b9c87fdefbe3c5341b4c](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2540c7a2319791b58fa2b9c87fdefbe3c5341b4c)  
removed the double-quote from the following lines:

    -parted -s $device mkpart '"$name"' ${start}B $end >&2
    +parted -s $device mkpart '$name' ${start}B $end >&2

and

    -parted -s $device mkpart '"$name"' $start_mb $end_mb >&2
    +parted -s $device mkpart '$name' $start_mb $end_mb >&2

which is wrong. This is needed for the UEFI partition which is usually
named "EFI System Partition".  
**parted** is likely not parsing arguments correctly:

-   parted -s /dev/sda mkpart "EFI System Partition" ... fails
-   parted -s /dev/sda mkpart 'EFI System Partition' ... fails
-   parted -s /dev/sda mkpart EFI\\ System\\ Partition ... fails

@rmetrich  
additionally I wonder about when the $name variable gets evaluated  
compared to when the $device variable gets evaluated  
because there is a difference between

<pre>
"'$var'"
</pre>

and

<pre>
'"$var"'
</pre>

as in the following example

<pre>
# device="/dev/sdX"

# name="EFI System Partition"

# echo parted -s $device mkpart '$name'
parted -s /dev/sdX mkpart $name

# echo parted -s $device mkpart "'$name'"
parted -s /dev/sdX mkpart 'EFI System Partition'

# echo parted -s $device mkpart '"$name"'
parted -s /dev/sdX mkpart "$name"

it was before

As I wrote in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-342446715](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-342446715)  
I cannot imagine how partition names with blanks could work at all
because  
as far as I see in
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
the code is basically as follows:

<pre>
create_partitions() {
...
    while read part disk size pstart name flags partition junk; do
...
            cat >> "$LAYOUT_CODE" &lt;&lt;EOF
my_udevsettle
parted -s $device mkpart '$name' ${start}B $end >&2
my_udevsettle
EOF
...
    done &lt; &lt;(grep "^part $device " $LAYOUT_FILE)
...
}
</pre>

For me name values with blanks (even if quoted) in disklayout.conf  
cause wrong reading and therefore wrong variable assignments  
when I use a disklayout.conf with name values with blanks as in

<pre>
# grep ^part disklayout.conf
part /dev/sda 14173601792 1048576 partition_name1 none /dev/sda1
part /dev/sda 1048576 14174650368 partition name2 bios_grub /dev/sda2
part /dev/sda 2147483648 14175698944 'partition name3' swap /dev/sda3
part /dev/sda 5151636992 16323182592 "partition name4" none /dev/sda4

# while read part disk size pstart name flags partition junk ; do echo "'$part' '$disk' '$size' '$pstart' name='$name' flags='$flags' partition='$partition' junk='$junk'" ; done &lt; &lt;(grep "^part /dev/sda " disklayout.conf)
'part' '/dev/sda' '14173601792' '1048576' name='partition_name1' flags='none' partition='/dev/sda1' junk=''
'part' '/dev/sda' '1048576' '14174650368' name='partition' flags='name2' partition='bios_grub' junk='/dev/sda2'
'part' '/dev/sda' '2147483648' '14175698944' name=''partition' flags='name3'' partition='swap' junk='/dev/sda3'
'part' '/dev/sda' '5151636992' '16323182592' name='"partition' flags='name4"' partition='none' junk='/dev/sda4'
</pre>

The only one that works is partition\_name1 which does not contian a
character from $IFS  
cf.

Indeed, there is likely a big issue with parted command-line parsing ...

Unfortunately the parted manual is very silent about quoting.  
In  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html)  
the only place is

<pre>
Command: name number name

Sets the name for the partition number (GPT, Mac, MIPS and PC98 only).
The name can be placed in quotes.

Example:
   (parted) name 2 'Secret Documents'

Set the name of partition 2 to ‘Secret Documents’. 
</pre>

As far as I understand it this means parted's internal parser  
supports single quotes for values with blanks.

When calling parted on the command line it seems  
there is a bug in parted that it does not handle a  
command line argument argv\[N\] that contains blanks  
as a single value with single quotes for its internal parser.

It seems when calling parted on the command line all  
command line arguments get sent to its internal parser  
as a single string of all command line arguments.

In this case it explains why when calling parted on the command line  
a value with blanks must be provided with duplicated quoting  
to get it with the inner quoting caracters to parted's parser  
i.e. in the form like in the above example

<pre>
parted -s /dev/sdb unit MiB mkpart "'part name 5'" 9 10
</pre>

to get 'part name 5' to parted's parser.

When you call plain 'parted' and then use it interactively  
single quotes work because then you talk directly  
to parted's parser:

<pre>
# parted /dev/sdb
GNU Parted 3.2
Using /dev/sdb
Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.
(parted) unit MiB mkpart 'part name 6' 11 12
</pre>

In contrast when you call a whole parted command on command line  
you need duplicated quoting, the outer quoting for bash, the inner  
quoting for parted's internal parser:

<pre>
# parted -s /dev/sdb unit MiB mkpart "'part name 7'" 13 14
</pre>

It was just a cleanup. Of course I don't know now what I was really
thinking at the time but I guess I was just surprised by the unusual
double quoting. In addition I might have overlooked that the lines
affected were inside a here document:

Here's a little test:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    device='/dev/xd1'
    name='EFI System Partition'
    start=1024
    end=4096

    echo "Outside of here document:"
    echo '#1' parted -s $device mkpart "$name" ${start}B $end >&2
    echo '#2' parted -s $device mkpart '"$name"' ${start}B $end >&2

    echo "Inside a here document:"
    cat <<EOF | bash
    echo '#1' parted -s $device mkpart "$name" ${start}B $end >&2
    echo '#2' parted -s $device mkpart '"$name"' ${start}B $end >&2
    EOF

Output is:

    Outside of here document:
    #1 parted -s /dev/xd1 mkpart EFI System Partition 1024B 4096
    #2 parted -s /dev/xd1 mkpart "$name" 1024B 4096
    Inside a here document:
    #1 parted -s /dev/xd1 mkpart EFI System Partition 1024B 4096
    #2 parted -s /dev/xd1 mkpart "EFI System Partition" 1024B 4096

Your analysis seems absolutely plausible. Parted obviously has some
strange quoting requirements which would be expected with the MS-DOS
command interpreter but not here. Parted really should do the necessary
translations from arguments internally. (Parted has
[other](https://www.jethrocarr.com/2012/08/10/gdisk-oh-glorious-gdisk/)
[issues](https://www.weisskunst.de/dr/node/60) as well.)

So in a nutshell, my quoting changes for the parted calls should be
reverted. Parted would then be called as before with its partition name
argument enclosed in double quotes which are not stripped by the shell.

I am thinking about a more fail-safe way how to encode  
possible $IFS characters (like spaces) in a GPT partition name  
because the current ' ' -&gt; '0x20' -&gt; ' ' re-replacement breaks  
when a partition name already contains the (sub)string '0x20'.

In  
[http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/gpt\_white\_paper\_1\_1.pdf](http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/gpt_white_paper_1_1.pdf)

I found

<pre>
Each GPT partition has a 36-character Unicode name

GPT allows for each partition to have a 36 character Unicode name
</pre>

which looks scaring because Unicode is no character encoding  
(but e.g. UTF-8 would be a character encoding for Unicode)  
so that currently I do not know what byte values are valid  
for a GPT partition name (I guess UTF-8 would be valid).

[GUID Partition Table -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) says:

> Partition name (36 UTF-16LE code units)

What about simply using the `&nbsp;` HTML entity to encode spaces? If
someone had a partition name containing the `&nbsp;` sequence it
probably happened by mistake anyway. In contrast `0x20` could appear as
part of something like `P10x200G`.

And another thought: There is probably no need to be concerned about
GPT-internal encodings. I'd expect command line tools such as `parted`
and `gdisk` to accept arguments in the current locale's encoding and do
necessary translations internally. Anything else would seem like a bug
to me.

FWIW:

On SLES10 with GNU Parted 1.6.25.1  
parted does not support providing a GPT partition name  
directly in the mkpart command.

With GNU Parted 1.6.25.1 one must do it via a separated 'name' command  
as follows:

<pre>
# parted -s /dev/hdc mklabel gpt

# parted -s /dev/hdc mkpart primary 10 20

# parted -s /dev/hdc print
Disk geometry for /dev/hdc: 0kB - 2147MB

# parted -s /dev/hdc name 1 "'my first partition'"

# parted -s /dev/hdc print

On SLES11 SP4 with GNU parted 2.3 it works  
to provide a GPT partition name directly in the mkpart command:

With

this issue should be fixed to a currently reasonable extent

Yes, that's always the problem with arguments being interpreted
according to the current locale, when we'd really like some
locale-agnostic binary string, which could be converted back and forth
in a lossless fashion without caring for its native locale.

Ideally when during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" that runs in POSIX/C
locale  
tools report values, those values are already "somehow right" so that  
later those same values can be used "as is" again as input for those
tools  
to set up something in POSIX/C locale - even if those vaules actually  
contain non-ASCII bytes.

But I fear in reality things "just break arbitrarily" when non-ASCII
bytes  
appear in values when tools run in POSIX/C locale.

Therefore I have the dim feeling that in the end we are forced to call  
specific tools as needed during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" in a UTF-8
locale  
and accordingly we would need to have UTF-8 support by default in the  
recovery system so that those specific tools which need it can also
run  
in a UTF-8 locale during "rear recover" - but as far as I learned  
the whole scripts must still run in POSIX/C locale, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1035](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1035)

Currently only Borg backup restore is run in a UTF-8 locale,  
see prep/BORG/default/200\_prep\_borg.sh  
and restore/BORG/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh

By the way I found another place in the code where  
a dirty hack 'sed' workaround for UTF-8 is done,  
in lib/mkrescue-functions.sh - see also

I wonder if I should implememt a test  
that is run during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
which tests if there is a non-ASCII byte in disklayout.conf  
and errors out perhaps even via BugError?

If ReaR character set support should be limited to 7-bit only, then yes,
I'd favor an early error message during `rear mkrescue/mkbackup` over a
failing rescue operation.

On the other hand, I'd prefer ReaR to move towards supporting an 8-bit
character set (the default being UTF-8), which is possible in my view in
a backward-compatible manner. Cf.

@OliverO2  
of course an early error exit during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
is preferred over a failing "rear recover" operation, cf.

Only a nitpicking side note:  
I think the root of all evil is not 7-bit versus 8-bit character
encoding.  
I assume any single-byte character encoding would "just work" - only  
how characters look at the screen could be wrong - but I would think  
that for any single-byte encoding the actual byte values would not
change.  
I think the root of all evil is single byte encoding versus multibyte
encoding.

Actually, probably not - at least with parted: See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706\#issuecomment-362031250](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706#issuecomment-362031250)

Multi-byte encodings are downward compatible with 7-bit ASCII. So 7-bit
will always work.

> I think the root of all evil is single byte encoding versus multibyte
> encoding.

Not really. Even if you used a single-byte 8-bit encoding such as ISO
8859.1, a tool like parted operating in the `C` locale would have no
idea of how to convert this into a wide-character string: As soon as it
finds character codes &gt; 127, it would fail.

So it's all about proper locale setting, or sticking to 7-bit ASCII.

@jsmeix  
Below is some code you could use to reproduce what parted does:

    $ LC_CTYPE=C ./wcs Schön
    Error during translation: Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character
    $ LC_CTYPE=en_US.utf8 ./wcs Schön
    "Schön" converted to a wide-character string is "Schön"

Store as `wcs.c` and use `cc -o wcs wcs.c` to compile:

    #include <wchar.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <errno.h>
    #include <limits.h>
    #include <malloc.h>
    #include <locale.h>

    /* original function from parted's strlist.c, with xrealloc call replaced by realloc call */
    static wchar_t*
    gettext_to_wchar (const char* str)
    {
        int     count;
        wchar_t*    result;
        size_t      status;
        mbstate_t   ps;

        count = strlen (str) + 1;
        result = malloc (count * sizeof (wchar_t));
        if (!result)
            goto error;

        memset(&ps, 0, sizeof (ps));
        status = mbsrtowcs(result, &str, count, &ps);
        if (str != NULL)
            goto error;

        result = realloc (result, (status + 1) * sizeof (wchar_t));
        return result;

    error:
        fprintf (stderr, "Error during translation: %s\n", strerror (errno));
        exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

        if (argc != 2) {
            fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s STRING\n", argv[0]);
            exit(1);
        }

        printf("\"%s\" converted to a wide-character string is \"%ls\"\n", argv[1], gettext_to_wchar(argv[1]));

        return 0;
    }

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your analysis!

Currently I have no time to have a closer look  
how parted and ReaR in C locale interact, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706\#issuecomment-362236133](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706#issuecomment-362236133)  
and after FOSDEM there are already "other important things" waiting...

I think my percent-encoding does not change any byte value  
so that I think I got UTF-8 encoded characters as output  
from parted regardless that parted runs in C locale  
during "rear mkrescue" and that looks wrong to me.  
Later when "rear recover" (that also runs in C locale)  
feeds that same bytes into parted (under the assumption  
that my percent-decode really results the same bytes)  
parted fails when it gets its own output bytes as input,  
cf. my "Ideally..." wish versus my "...fear..." and my "...dim
feeling..." in my above
