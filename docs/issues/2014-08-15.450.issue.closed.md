I'm using rear on a 2-node drbd cluster for d/r and backups, and plan to
tweak the backuparchive filename written such that it indicates whether
the node was acting as "primary" or "secondary" at the time of the rear
backup. As delivered using the NETFS incremental option, the default
filename looks like 2014-08-12-0826-F.tar.gz. I want to customize such
that the filename looks like 2014-08-12-0826-F.primary.tar.gz, (or
2014-08-12-0826-F.secondary.tar.gz). The scripting to accomplish this is
easy enough - my question is, where would you suggest inserting this
customization? Should it be done within the
/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/07\_set\_backup\_archive.sh file, or
is there a better place? Or, perhaps an environment variable that can be
used?

Thanks

@bbeaver sorry for the delay - yes - the
prep/NETFS/default/07\_set\_backup\_archive.sh is the best place to
modify it (albeit lost after updating rear)
