If you like to make a backup to disk, but use a disk with content you
want to retain, you cannot format the disk. And that's fine, the
formatting of the disk is strictly speaking not necessary (as long as
the device's filesystem is acceptable). However in this case if the
partition is not in fact marked *bootable*, the device will not be
booted from by extlinux.

We can avoid this problem by marking the partition bootable in case we
add syslinux as the bootloader.

This is my attempt to do this:

     usb_syslinux_version=$(get_usb_syslinux_version)
     syslinux_version=$(get_syslinux_version)

However it fails:

    [root@moria rear]# rear -v mkrescue

And the log contains:

     Warning: WARNING: the kernel failed to re-read the partition table on /dev/sdb (Device or  resource busy).  As a result, it may not reflect all of your changes until after reboot.

Even though it worked...
