-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Fix function modinfo\_filename:  
Output the original module\_filename also when it is a symlink  
because in the code below 'cp -L' copies the symlink taget content  
as a new regular file with file name as the name of the symlink  
so the copied content can be still found under its original name,  
cf.

Additionally in case of MODULES=( 'all\_modules' ) also use 'cp -L' to  
copy the actual content to avoid dangling symlinks in the recovery
system.

@hpannenb  
could you test it?  
I would much appreciate it if you could  
because I do not have your special modules as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2677](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2677)  
and for my simple case the code before had also "just worked"  
i.e. I cannot test the special cases where it really matters.

@hpannenb  
thank you for your prompt testing!  
It helps a lot when proposed fixes get verified by those users  
on their systems where an issue had actually happened.
