-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.6, compile from source.

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    VERSION="V10 (Tercel)"  
    ID="kylin"  
    VERSION\_ID="V10"  
    PRETTY\_NAME="Kylin Linux Advanced Server V10 (Tercel)"

Not in os list, and no lsb\_release command available. It's simaliar
with centos7, so in /etc/rear/os.conf I wrote:  
OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
OS\_VERSION=7

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://10.0.90.60/database/nfs/  
    BACKUP\_URL=nfs://10.0.90.60/database/nfs/

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    KVM guest on aarch64(ARM64)

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    aarch64, Vendor ID: HiSilicon, Model name: Kunpeng-920

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    Don't know.

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):  
    Only /dev/sda, it's a kvm virtual scsi disk

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I saw rear2.4 release note begin to support arm, now 2.6 can
mkbackuponly my machine, but can't make ISO. Any workaround for this?
Thanks.

The `Currently only OUTPUT=PXE is supported on ARM`  
comes from usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-arm/060\_check\_config.sh  
which was contributed via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662)  
in relation to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1197](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1197)

As far as I see according to the `git log` output nothing was
contributed  
regarding further ARM support enhancements since that time.

@jsmeix Thanks a lot. Got it.

@qiulg  
if you like to contribute enhancements for ARM support  
you may have a look at generic information like  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
see also the section "How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

FYI:  
I do not have ARM hardware so I myself cannot actually help with ARM
issues.
