    Not tested by me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
make umounting the EFI virtual image more fail-safe:  
In any case 'sleep 1' after 'cp' before normal 'umount'  
and if this fails try 'umount --lazy' and if that also fails  
show the user a LogPrintError (and proceed bona fide)  
so the user can understand why later at the end  
cleanup\_build\_area\_and\_end\_program() may show

    Could not remove build area

when lazy umount could not clean up things until then.

In restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh and  
same also in restore/YUM/default/410\_restore\_backup.sh  
it calls `umount "$BUILD_DIR/outputfs"`  
because BUILD\_DIR/outputfs is needed as mountpoint  
to mount something (a medium that contains the backup)  
so inform the user about an umounting failure  
(if there was something mounted at BUILD\_DIR/outputfs)  
so he can understand why the subsequent mounting fails  
or why several things got mounted stacked one over the other.

@pcahyna  
in my current change here for  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
I call only plain 'umount --lazy' without additional '--force'  
so I cannot use the `umount_mountpoint_lazy` function here  
because that calls `umount $v -f -l $mountpoint`.

I do not like '--lazy' with additional '--force'  
because "man umount" tells:

    -f, --force
    Force an unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system).
    Note that this option does not guarantee that umount command does not hang.

As usual the description is rather terse and does not explain things  
so one has to imagine what could be meant.

Currently I understand this as if '--force' may hang up  
because in general to enforce something one must try hard  
to get that something done which means "don't give up"  
but "try hard endlessly" so it may never finish.

In contrast '--lazy' has opposite meaning  
so 'umount --lazy' basically always returns and  
lets things clean up on its own in the background,  
e.g. see  
[https://serverfault.com/questions/1101277/how-does-a-lazy-unmount-actually-work](https://serverfault.com/questions/1101277/how-does-a-lazy-unmount-actually-work)  
that reads (excerpt):

    Lazy umount is a regular umount, which happens in background.
    In addition is hides the mount entry, which makes it looks
    like umount have worked (or Detach the filesystem from
    the file hierarchy, how man page says). In really the
    unmount will happen when filesystem is not in use anymore.

    Thus, for a real umount one should use --force and wait ...

So I think '--lazy' and '--force' contradict each other.

Or what do I misunderstand here?

@jsmeix I am not sure myself. The impression I get from the manual page
is that the main motivation for umount options is the case of NFS mount
where the server became unreachable. I am not even sure whether `-f`
does anything useful in the case of local filesystems.

We still do `umount ... || LogPrintError ...` so that `rear` will
happily continue even in case of an `umount` error.

I'm wondering if we maybe should be more strict and actually
`StopIfError` to avoid follow-up problems like reported by @thomas-merz
originally? That way he would have noticed the problem via a direct
error message from ReaR instead of via some other monitoring noticing
lots of new filesystems...

Also, maybe the discussed `sleep 1` would also be a good solution
instead of a cascae of `umount` attempts?

I find the `fuser` really useful in case of umount troubles, great idea!

And finally, maybe `umount` should be converted into a ReaR function to
always have that error handling attached to it?

It is my goal behind to get in the end a  
sufficiently simple and reliably working  
umounting function in ReaR.

But this will take some time in particular  
to get sufficient experience how things behave  
for real users out there on their systems.

What "just works" for us on our clean test systems  
may terribly fail for users on problematic systems.

E.g. see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908)  
As far as I can remember we never had an issue  
like that with plain and simple 'umount' before.

E.g. see my comment in this pull request code  
how 'fuser' must be called to avoid possibly  
scaring and misleading output in certain cases.

Bottom line:  
RFC 1925 item (8) It is more complicated than you think.

That one should even better read:  
In practice it is more complicated than one imagines in theory.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections.

This is only a first step towards a (hopefully) sufficiently  
simple and reliably working umounting function in ReaR, cf.

jsmeix with the addition of `sleep` it helps with \#2908, right?

Yes, the "sleep 1 and retry" helps in particular with  
issues like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908)  
but in general I prefer to try simple things first,  
see my new comments via my recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909/commits/d6559072f4bc64c5ba18ff2fdd03b410ad340ace](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909/commits/d6559072f4bc64c5ba18ff2fdd03b410ad340ace)

When normal umount works after simple 'sleep 1'  
it avoids in particular possible issues with 'fuser -M'  
on older Linux distributions that do not support '-M'.
