The reason for this is that Relax-and-Recover is using the currently
running kernel as the basis for its rescue image. As a result if the
running kernel is no longer installed, there are no drivers found. So we
basically assume that the running kernel is still installed.

We could improve this, however if the logic depends on the bootloader
(to find the 'upcoming' kernel to use) it might get very complex very
quickly :-/ So the logic should only chime in when it is determined that
the current kernel is no longer installed.

A simply workaround in your case would be to execute
`rear -v -r 3.0.74-0.6.10-default mkrescue`.

PS Maybe I should look at how kdump is handling this (might be possible
it doesn't handle the case either though).

I do prefer that users reboot after installing a new kernel - good
practice anyway - no need we improve rear for this. The possible error
is documented now in GitHub :-)

I agree it is better that the kernel used for Relax-and-Recover is the
one that is running (or at least one that booted once before). However
if it is possible that the current kernel is no longer installed, and
Relax-and-Recover bails out because of this, I would prefer the second
best option: search for another kernel.

If we object to using a kernel that may never have been booted once, we
should at least detect this case and provide with a more specific error
IMO. Especially if people use "rear mkrescue" from cron, it would be
more convenient to indicate that **"the currently running kernel is no
longer installed on this system"**.

I would prefer a specific error in prep over adapting the current
error-message to hint, because:

1.  an empty STORAGE\_DRIVERS could be related to something else (a bug
    ?)
2.  even if the kernel is not installed, STORAGE\_DRIVERS could be
    non-empty (e.g. out-of-tree driver)

The main question is, what's the best way to determine that the running
kernel is not installed ? Should we test for a set of directories that
should always be there (all of them):

-   /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/crypto/
-   /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/
-   /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/lib/
-   /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/modules.dep

Or is there something more appropriate/safe ?

BTW I like to involve @jhoekx, he's got a good (cross-distro) taste for
things like this as well ;-)

:-)

Do we need to check subdirectories? Is /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel
not  
sufficient?

From a package deployment perspective (everything installed is there  
because we want to use it) I could imagine that we should automatically
set  
-r <kernel version> not to the current kernel but to the greatest
\*installed

-   kernel. If that happens to be the running kernel then nothing
    changed, if  
    there is a difference then we use a kernel that at least has all
    files  
    available and that would have been used after the next reboot
    anyway.​

@jhoekx I deliberately do not check for */lib/modules/$(uname
-r)/kernel*, because if you have *any* file added (e.g. mvfs.ko or
anything out-of-tree, maybe vmware-tools or an hp-driver) the parent
directories will still be around, STORAGE\_DRIVERS will not be empty,
most likely it will bail out the moment it doesn't find the kernel. But
since the name of the kernel is also not standardized...

@schlomo We don't wan't to automatically pick up the latest installed
kernel since it may not properly boot. Sure, the intention is to use it,
but we don't want to be confronted with an unbootable DR image if the
new kernel trashed the filesystem when it gets booted into the first
time. It is safer to use the current kernel, if it exists. As soon as
the server is rebooted (successfully) `checklayout` may notice it and
recreate the image.

@dagwieers so why not take the latest\_installed-1 kernel if the
current  
kernel is not available? Wouldn't that be better than failing the rear
run?

@schlomo Apart from the difficulty to determine what the
latest\_installed-1 kernel is, if you have had 2 new kernels installed,
but did not reboot neither yet, you are still booting a kernel that may
not boot as part of the DR. Maybe you got 2 kernels because the previous
update had a known defect.

So if the current kernel is not available, my preference would be to
stick with whatever kernel/image we had before by failing (likely the
last succesful run was the current kernel/ramdisk), rather than to
deliver something suboptimal. So I would simply add a check and escalate
this to the user so cron mails it, or it's obvious from the output on
screen.

BTW The reporter's example shows a single new kernel on the system, so
there wouldn't even be a latest\_installed-1 kernel ;-)

Fine with me. Better error messages are always good.

I got the error message because i have a kernel compiled without block
modules.  
I think it should be detected if the kernel is build with storage
modules or fixed builtin.

Can you suggest some modinfo calls to find out if that is the case?
Are  
there some modules which are representative of that case?

Also, how could we handle the case where only some drivers are built
into  
the kernel and others not?
