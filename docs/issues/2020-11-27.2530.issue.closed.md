I've recently faced a problem in which I need to make a bootable ISO
from my current local centos with all its configs and installed apps, so
that I can write it on a USB flash drive and install it on some other
machines.

I've searched about this, and tried some of them untill I finally found
`Relax-and-Recover` (i.e. rear) app which seems to work the way I
want.  
The problem however is that, I couldn't make a *single* `ISO` and it
instead generates a 250MB ISO and 1.7GB tar.gz file next to it.  
My current config is as follows:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///run/media/user/myusb
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///run/media/user/myusb/bck
    ISO_DIR=file:///run/media/user/myusb/iso

What I want is just 1 bootable ISO which contains the whole backup that
can be bootable on USB stick and be installed on other machines.  
How should I do this?

Because you wrote `bootable on USB stick`  
I wonder why you don't use the `OUTPUT=USB` method, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

In any case regardless what method you prefer to use  
you must thoroughly test and validate on replacement hardware  
that "rear recover" actually works for you as you need it,  
see the section "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding `OUTPUT=ISO` with `BACKUP_URL="iso:///..."`:

One single ISO with the backup included in that ISO works for me with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup"

and also with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///other
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup"

In both cases I get the ISO with the `backup/backup.tar.gz` included  
stored locally at `var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso`  
(`linux-h9wr` is the hostname of my test system):

In the latter case with `OUTPUT_URL=file:///other` that one must be  
a separatedly mounted thing so I do `# mount /dev/sda6 /other` in my
case  
so I get the ISO from `var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso`  
also copied there at `/other/linux-h9wr/rear-linux-h9wr.iso`  
i.e. I have the ISO now two times on my local disk.

In the former case with `OUTPUT_URL=null` I get the ISO only  
stored locally at `var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso`  
but not duplicated as a copy somewhere else.

With

    OUTPUT=ISO
    ISO_DIR=/other/myISOdir
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup"

I get the ISO only  
stored locally at `/other/myISOdir/rear-linux-h9wr.iso`  
but not duplicated as a copy somewhere else.

CAUTION WITH BIG FILES IN THE ISO

There is a limit of the ISO 9660 file system that is 2GiB or 4GiB
according to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_9660\#The\_2/4\_GiB\_file\_size\_limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660#The_2/4_GiB_file_size_limit)

Under normal circumstances files greater or equal 2GiB should not appear
in the ISO.  
An exception is when the backup is included in the ISO with
BACKUP\_URL=iso://  
where the backup archive file (e.g. backup.tar.gz) could be greater or
equal 2GiB.  
When there is a 2GiB file size limit a backup.tar.gz that is greater
than 2GiB  
will get corrupted in the ISO so backup restore via "rear recover" would
fail  
which is a dead end because the backup in the ISO got corrupted.

"man mkisofs"  
(at least on my SLES12-SP5 for /usr/bin/mkisofs from the
cdrkit-cdrtools-compat RPM)  
reads (excerpts):

    -allow-limited-size
      ... files larger than 2GiB ... cannot be represented in ISO9660 level 1 or 2

Wich indicates in practice that limit is 2GiB (and not 4GiB).

Usually 'mkisofs' is called with '-udf -allow-limited-size'  
cf. usr/share/rear/prep/ISO/GNU/Linux/320\_verify\_mkisofs.sh  
but only if the '--help' output of ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN shows
'-allow-limited-size'  
so there are cases where ISO 9660 level 1 or 2 is used that has a 2GiB
file size limit.  
For example when 'ebiso' is used there is a 2GiB file size limit  
but also other tools that are specified by ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN could have
that limit.

Accordingly to be on the safe side pay special attention when there are
files  
to be included in the ISO that are greater or equal 2GiB.

When your ISO making tool has a 2GiB file size limit  
but your backup.tar.gz is greater or equal 2GiB  
your "too big" backup it will get included in the ISO  
but it gets corrupted there so your backup is lost.

@jsmeix Thank you very much, it did create a 2.7g iso. I tried to
install it and everything went well in manual installing, but in
automatic installation it will face with `access denied` error.  
And the second problem which is i'm worried about is, the `OS Configs`
like privacy etc. has been lost, how can i keep them?

@jsmeix  
the crucial thing is not the size of the whole ISO  
but the size of the files inside the ISO.

Currently I cannot comment on the automatic mode  
because I almost never use it (long ago I had tested it once).

What do you mean with
`the OS Configs like privacy etc. has been lost`?  
Could you explain in more detail what exact `OS configs` you mean  
and where they have been lost (i.e. where you would expect them to
be).  
The ReaR recovery system (basically kernel and initrd in your ISO)  
is a totally different thing than your original system so if you
expect  
the ReaR recovery system would have same `OS configs`  
as your original system it is not true. The basic config  
of the ReaR recovery system is in usr/share/rear/skel/  
plus some generated things during "rear mkrescue".

@jsmeix `os configs` I was wrong, and i did a double check, and it was
the same as the original one.  
Can I select the "usb" as destination for the generated iso? with this
config?

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL="file:///run/media/swall/USB"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup"

What I did:

    # mkdir /other
    # umount /dev/sdb1
    # mount /dev/sdb1 /other

then used below, and it did worked for me:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///other
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup"

And as you told, I tested the only one copy version of iso( only into
the usb) as below and it did worked:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    ISO_DIR=/other
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup"

Thank you @jsmeix

Is there any way for 100gb iso? or should we use another config for
rear?

@SeyyedKhandon

I don't have much personal experience with huge ISOs.  
Personally I use basically always

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

as in the usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE\*-example.conf files  
i.e. with a small rear-hostname.iso and separated backup.tar.gz  
on a NFS server.

In general regarding `BACKUP_URL=iso`:

This includes the whole backup (which can be several GiB up to some
TiB)  
into the ISO image and that calls for various troubles in general.

So my first and foremost question would be:

Why is it a must that a user has his whole backup inside the ISO?

That is not normal (I know nobody who does it nowadays)  
and it does not make sense under normal circumstances.  
In exceptional cases it may make sense so it is possible  
but the admin has to know what it means when doing it.

Normal usage of ReaR keeps the backup separated from  
the ReaR recovery system (in this case the ISO).

Having the whole backup inside the ISO has generic drawbacks:

To boot the ReaR recovery system on replacement hardware  
means to boot from a huge ISO which may not always work.

The backup is no longer separatedly accessible  
(e.g. to restore a few files directly from the backup)  
but somewhat buried into the ISO  
(ok. one can just mount the ISO if needed).

Also see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf about  
ISO\_MAX\_SIZE and its additional specific drawbacks.

Some more info FYI:

Regarding "Creating bootable USB from ReaR ISO" see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)

If you need a UEFI bootable thingy, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2394\#issuecomment-627226008](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2394#issuecomment-627226008)  
why isohybrid cannot be used to make a "normal"  
non-UEFI-bootable ISO image UEFI bootable.

To get a UEFI bootable thingy you could  
alternatively use `OUTPUT=RAWDISK`, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500)  
therein starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500\#issuecomment-724280432](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500#issuecomment-724280432)  
and subsequent comments.

But I am not a `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` user so currently I cannot tell  
if it is possible to get the backup.tar.gz included in the RAWDISK
image  
so that you could get an "all-in-one" UEFI bootable RAWDISK image  
that contains the ReaR recovery system plus the backup.tar.gz.

@OliverO2  
is our `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` developer  
so probably he could help here (as far as his time permits).

I really just want to backup the whole os, I'm not sure how should I
recover from that if there will be `.iso`, `.tar.gz` separated from each
other.  
Let's say we have a os and want to backit up on a local external hdd,
how can i do it, and restore it(lets say we want the normal method which
just will create a 250mb iso and a .img file with huge 50gb size), how
should we do that?

In my case with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

with a small `rear-hostname.iso` and separated `backup.tar.gz` on a NFS
server  
I boot the `rear-hostname.iso` (that contains the ReaR recovery
system)  
on my replacement hardware (my "hardware" are KVM/QEMU virtual
machines)  
log in as root into the booted ReaR recovery system and only run
`rear recover`  
to recreate my original system on my replacement hardware  
(I did that hundreds of times for testing various things).

The ReaR recovery system is specific for the original system  
where it had been made with `rear mkbackup` or `rear mkrescue`.

With the ReaR recovery system in `rear-hostname.iso`  
separated from the backup in `backup.tar.gz`  
one can create an updated ReaR recovery system separatedly  
with `rear mkrescue` (only new `rear-hostname.iso` on the NFS server)  
or one can create an updated backup separatedly  
with `rear mkbackuponly` (only new `backup.tar.gz` on the NFS server)  
depending on what is needed to update  
e.g. update the backup each day but update the ReaR recovery system  
only when needed via `rear checklayout || rear mkrescue`  
Regarding updating the backup see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

The ReaR recovery system contains the needed info to get the right
`backup.tar.gz`  
from the NFS server because the recovery system contains
/etc/rear/local.conf with

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

so it mounts that specific NFS share and restores the backup directly
from there  
(i.e. no need to move the backup around in a ISO or on a medium).

As far as I know

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

is the normal method that is used by most SUSE Linux Enterprise
customers  
who use Relax-and-Recover as their disaster recovery framework.

For now I would most recommend the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover"  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#First\_steps\_with\_Relax-and-Recover](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#First_steps_with_Relax-and-Recover)

In general I would recommend to read through the whole long  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
article and pick out what is of particular interest for you.  
Perhaps some "relaxing leisure time reading" over the weekend?  
For certain meaning of "relaxing leisure time" ;-)

Now it's weekend - at least for me :-)  
I wish you a relaxed and recovering weekend!
