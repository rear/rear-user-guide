##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal** (creating RAWDISK output fails with "no space
    left on device")

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

On Ubuntu 18.04, it has been observed that after creating a loop
device  
and creating a properly sized VFAT file system &gt;250 MB on it, after  
mounting the file system size was actually just 30 MB. Reason: The  
partition detection did not pick up the correct partition sizes of the  
associated image file. This change uses losetup's --partscan option  
(supported by util-linux v2.21 and above) to offer one additional  
opportunity to detect partitions. If the option is not available, a  
traditional losetup call will be used as a fallback.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow.

@OliverO2  
thank you for continuously testing ReaR on current Ubuntu versions  
and for your adaptions to keep ReaR working on new Ubuntu versions!
