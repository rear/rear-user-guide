Hello,

we try to use the "Portable Install" of ReaR, means we download a
release file, extract it, symlink the /usr/sbin/rear file and run Rear.

Affected ReaR versions: 2.8 and 2.9  
Affected OS: OracleLinux 9, but should not be limited to this
distribution

If I try to run `rear checklayout` I get this error: Failed to source
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

    [root@gisu1017 opt]# rear checklayout
    /sbin/rear: line 382: /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf: No such file or directory
    ERROR: BUG in Relax-and-Recover
    Failed to source /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    Please report it at https://github.com/rear/rear/issues

@Bouncy-Handrail  
when you click on the \[New issue\] button on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)  
you should get a "Create new issue" popup  
where you can select "Bug report" which leads you to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new?template=1-bug\_report.yml](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new?template=1-bug_report.yml)  
which is a form where you can fill in the information we need  
to be able to understand our issue and ideally  
to see what went wrong in your case.

In particular I do not understand what you really did when

    use the "Portable Install" of ReaR, means we download a release file,
    extract it, symlink the /usr/sbin/rear file and run Rear.

Hm, somehow I managed to bypass the proper bug report. I'll create a new
one.
