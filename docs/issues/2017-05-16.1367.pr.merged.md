This is a minor backward incompatible change:

The new default.conf setting  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS="yes"  
rebuilds the initramfs/initrd in any case during "rear recover"  
in the recreated system to be on the safe side because  
ReaR cannot check/verify all possible reasons why the  
initramfs/initrd may have to be rebuild,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1321](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1321)

With  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS=""  
the old behaviour where "rear recover" rebuilds the initrd/initramfs  
only if some storage drivers changed can be still specified.

With  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS="no"  
the user can explicitly skip rebuilding the initramfs/initrd.

@gdha  
do you think this minor backward incompatible change  
should be postponed after the upcoming 2.1 release?

I think the new default.conf setting  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS="yes"  
should be included in the 2.1 release because it is  
intended to make "rear recover" work more fail-safe.

I think the '! is\_true' versus 'is\_false' is sufficiently explained  
so that I can merge it soon...
