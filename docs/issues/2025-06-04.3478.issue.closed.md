Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

Hi,

executing this on efi servers resolves in this error:

    sudo TMPDIR=/tmp /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    Failed to copy all contents of /lib/modules/5.14.0-570.el9.x86_64 (dangling symlinks could be a reason)
    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-252.so requires additional libraries
            libsystemd-shared-252.so => not found
    ReaR recovery system in '/tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/rootfs' needs additional libraries, check /var/log/rear/rear-exunxlvj19302.log for details
    Failed to 'rm -Rf --one-file-system /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp'
    Could not remove build area /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ (something still exists therein)
    Something is still mounted within the build area
      /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp/isofs/boot/efiboot.img (deleted) on /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp/efi_virt type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)
    You must manually umount it, then you could manually remove the build area
    To manually remove the build area use (with caution): rm -Rf --one-file-system /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ

I cannot remove it myself:

    rm -Rf --one-file-system /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp
    rm: cannot remove '/tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp': Permission denied


    sudo rm -Rf --one-file-system /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp
    rm: skipping '/tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp/efi_virt', since it's on a different device

But I umount `/tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp/efi_virt`.

In my opinion these lines in
`/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh` are responsable for
this:

            fi
            if ! rmdir $v "$BUILD_DIR" ; then
                LogPrintError "Could not remove build area $BUILD_DIR (something still exists therein)"
                mounted_in_BUILD_DIR="$( mount | grep "$BUILD_DIR" | sed -e 's/^/  /' )"
                if test "$mounted_in_BUILD_DIR" ; then
                    LogPrintError "Something is still mounted within the build area"
                    LogPrintError "$mounted_in_BUILD_DIR"
                    LogPrintError "You must manually umount it, then you could manually remove the build area"

                LogPrintError "To manually remove the build area use (with caution): rm -Rf --one-file-system $BUILD_DIR"
            fi
        fi
        Log "End of program '$PROGRAM' reached"
    }

It seems that the code is trying to remove the mount without trying to
umount it first?  
Did I miss here something or is this a bug?

Because of

    /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp/isofs/boot/efiboot.img (deleted) on /tmp/rear.qkdqeKaa0Ccz6BZ/tmp/efi_virt type vfat

this one is likely a duplicate of  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908>  
which I fixed first by  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909>  
only for OUTPUT=ISO  
and meanwhile both for OUTPUT=ISO and OUTPUT=USB by  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408>

ReaR 2.7 does not contain those fixes.

The issue is no bug in ReaR because nowadays  
a simple and straightforward sequence of commands like

    # mount /dev/something /mountpoint
    # cp /some/file /mountpoint
    # umount /mountpoint

does sometimes no longer work reliably because nowadays  
umount may fail in such cases with "target is busy", cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908#issuecomment-1378811748>

Via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3447>  
we at ReaR upstream try to make ReaR somehow deal  
with nowadays more and more unpredictable behaviour  
of low level basic system stuff, cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#dirty-hacks-welcome>

The correct fix would be that basic things like

    # mount /dev/something /mountpoint
    # cp /some/file /mountpoint
    # umount /mountpoint

work reliable.

My blind guess why it nowadays sometimes fails  
is something in the kernel area.  
Perhaps related to the VFAT filesystem because  
as far as I noticed from user reports here at ReaR upstream  
umount only fails when a VFAT filesystem is mounted.

@damm620  
I think the simplest "fix" in ReaR 2.7  
is when you add in  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
something like `sleep 3` or `sleep 1`  
before the 'umount' line so that it looks like

    # Copy files from staging directory into efiboot.img
    cp $v -r $TMP_DIR/mnt/. $TMP_DIR/efi_virt
    sleep 3
    umount $v $TMP_DIR/efiboot.img

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh#L46>

Cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397#issuecomment-2656838638>  
where `sleep` helped in the OUTPUT=USB case.

In this issue see also  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397#issuecomment-2685552225>

I wrote "fix" above because obviously `sleep` cannot  
actually fix the root cause - but when `sleep` helps  
to avoid the issue sufficiently well in practice,  
then such a band-aid is a "fix" to a certain extent.

Update:  
We found out, that our Realtime Antivirus Scanner interfered here with
the umount, so that the "target was busy".  
We are now thinking about a umount-loop in
`usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh` to try
umounting it until it is not busy.

@damm620

thank you for your interesting information!

Perhaps there is no bug at all and umount, kernel, VFAT filesystem,...  
all work as they should and all the cases where that umount failed  
in ReaR behave correctly.

It is important for us at ReaR upstream to better understand  
such issues as a whole i.e. including the whole environment.

For example when there is a Realtime Antivirus Scanner running  
it is its job to do continuous realtime scanning so mounted  
things will get scanned and they have to be scanned because  
the admin of the system explicitly wanted it to be this way.

So ReaR has no right for example to kill a non-ReaR process  
which got in its way, e.g. some realtime scanning process,  
to make ReaR's umount command succeed by brute force,  
because then ReaR would work against what the admin  
of the system had explicitly set up.  
Cf. my  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3447#issuecomment-2789658854>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3447#discussion_r2077472659>

See also  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3410>  
where CrowdStrike Falcon (used as AV solution) caused issues in ReaR  
where I wrote in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3410#issuecomment-2690634795>

    we should not even try to work around
    or against CrowdStrike Falcon in ReaR

When the admin of a system has set up things which cause issues in
ReaR  
then it is first and foremost the admin's task to find a solution  
but it is not ReaR's task to do "whatever it takes" in the admin's
system  
to enforce that ReaR succeeds.

Regarding a umount-loop to umount it when is no longer busy:

This would delay ReaR until it is no longer busy,  
unless the umount-loop is implemented as background process  
but then the umount-loop background process would get SIGKILL  
when ReaR finishes so it may not get umounted.

I think a lazy umount is better because (as far as I understand
things)  
a lazy umount is pending as long as needed until is no longer busy.

Well a `umount -l` would wait endlessly (or a very long time to say the
least) as the umount loop would try to umount and wait 1 second and this
10 times. So that will "only" delay 10 seconds max.  
Of cause this is not feasable for upstream, but in our environemnt this
does make a lot of sence in my opinion.

Thanks for your help here :)

Ah! Now I do better understand.

So the "umount-loop ... try umounting it until it is not busy"  
which loops unlimited "until it is not busy" changed into a  
limited amount of retries to umount it.

But what happens when the last umount retry still fails?

Is the issue then ignored (i.e. it will not get umounted)?

Or will then ReaR (because that loop is run by ReaR)  
"get angry" and do "whatever it takes" to get that thingy  
(i.e. what keeps the mount target in use) out of the way  
by more and more forceful strikes against that thingy,  
for example strikes like

-   SIGTERM to non-ReaR processes
-   SIGKILL to non-ReaR processes
-   system reboot ;-)
-   whatnot... ?

When a program runs as 'root'  
those who make that program have basically unlimited power  
what happens on the system of the user who runs their program  
so for those who make such a program this is mandatory:  
"With great power comes great responsibility"  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility>

Ob the other hand:  
A system admin (i.e. a user who can log in as 'root') can do  
whatever he thinks is appropriate in his specific case  
on his particular system.  
Therefore ReaR is intentionally written in the native language  
for system administration as shell (bash) scripts because  
ReaR is meant to be adapted and/or extended by the admin  
as needed to make things work for his specific use case.

If the umount loop still cannot umount the mount after 10 trys or so it
will continue with the "rest of the rear workflow". That will result in
the error when ReaR ends, but thats okay. Because when umounting it 10
times does not work, there should be a admin present checking on what
going on i think.

Yes, this looks very reasonable  
(at least for your particular use case).

Perhaps when the umount loop cannot umount  
do a lazy umount call as last thing and then  
continue with the "rest of the rear workflow"  
because this way it could umount "by the way"  
while the "rest of the rear workflow" is running  
so when ReaR ends it could be already umounted  
and the error at ReaR's end could be avoided.

I.e. when in your particular case  
your Realtime Antivirus Scanner finished  
while the "rest of the rear workflow" is running  
then a pending lazy umount should umount it  
so it could be umounted before ReaR ends.
