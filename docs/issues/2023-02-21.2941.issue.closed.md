In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
we state that bash 3 is the minimum required bash version.

What Linux distribution versions we support at ReaR upstream  
is documented in our release notes, e.g. for ReaR 2.7 see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L3814](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L3814)

    ReaR 2.7 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

    -   Fedora 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34
    -   RHEL 6, 7, 8, and 9
    -   CentOS 6, 7, and 8
    -   Scientific Linux 6 and 7
    -   SLES 12 and 15
    -   openSUSE Leap 15.x
    -   Debian 8, and 9
    -   Ubuntu 16, 17, and 18

Regarding SUSE and openSUSE products:  
SLES 12 SP 5 has GNU bash version 4.3.48  
SLES 15 and openSUSE Leap 15.x have even newer bash versions

@gdha @pcahyna @schlomo

could you please check what  
Fedora, RHEL, and Ubuntu versions provide bash 4.x

(no extraordinary efforts - just check what you have available)

several years ago I needed to test ReaR code in bash 3 and I needed RHEL
5 machines for that, RHEL 6 has bash 4.

About the list you give here @jsmeix I would like to suggest that ReaR
as upstream project needs only to support distros that are currently
being maintained. Specifically that reduces the list for the upcoming
ReaR 2.8 IMHO to the following:

-   Fedora 36, 37 see
    [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/eol/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/eol/)
-   RHEL 8, 9 see
    [https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata\#Life\_Cycle\_Dates](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#Life_Cycle_Dates)
-   CentOS 7 - see
    [https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/)
-   CentOS Stream 8, 9 - see
    [https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/faq-centos-stream-updates](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/faq-centos-stream-updates)
-   Scientific Linux - see
    [https://lwn.net/Articles/786422/](https://lwn.net/Articles/786422/)
-   SLES 12 and 15 - see
    [https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/\#product-suse-linux-enterprise-server](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#product-suse-linux-enterprise-server)
-   openSUSE Leap 15.x - seems like only till [November
    2023](https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime#:~:text=openSUSE%20Leap%2015.4%20%2D%20is%20expected%20to%20be%20maintained%20until%20end%20of%20November%202023)
-   Debian 11 - see
    [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases\#Production\_Releases](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Production_Releases)
-   Ubuntu 18, 20, 22 see
    [https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)

Everything older I would like to consider as "good luck" and point
people to the last ReaR release supporting those officially, which would
be ReaR 2.7.

There is much more to old software than just `bash`, with older distros
not support certain programs or having them in old versions that lack
features.

Here is one example where I check for `switch_root` which is required
for the ramdisk code:

    $ tests/run-in-docker : centos:5 -- "type switch_root"

And here is another example checking for JSON support in the `ip`
command, which is super useful to simplify the parsing of `ip` output:

    $ tests/run-in-docker debian -- "{ apt update ; apt install -y iproute2 ; } &>/dev/null ; ip -json link list dev lo"
    ********** debian:8                                 **********
    Option "-json" is unknown, try "ip -help".
    ********** debian:9                                 **********
    Option "-json" is unknown, try "ip -help".
    ********** debian:10                                **********
    [{"ifindex":1,"ifname":"lo","flags":["LOOPBACK","UP","LOWER_UP"],"mtu":65536,"qdisc":"noqueue","operstate":"UNKNOWN","linkmode":"DEFAULT","group":"default","txqlen":1000,"link_type":"loopback","address":"00:00:00:00:00:00","broadcast":"00:00:00:00:00:00"}]
    ********** debian:11                                **********
    [{"ifindex":1,"ifname":"lo","flags":["LOOPBACK","UP","LOWER_UP"],"mtu":65536,"qdisc":"noqueue","operstate":"UNKNOWN","linkmode":"DEFAULT","group":"default","txqlen":1000,"link_type":"loopback","address":"00:00:00:00:00:00","broadcast":"00:00:00:00:00:00"}]
    ********** debian:unstable                          **********
    [{"ifindex":1,"ifname":"lo","flags":["LOOPBACK","UP","LOWER_UP"],"mtu":65536,"qdisc":"noqueue","operstate":"UNKNOWN","linkmode":"DEFAULT","group":"default","txqlen":1000,"link_type":"loopback","address":"00:00:00:00:00:00","broadcast":"00:00:00:00:00:00"}]

For brevity sake only on Debian, and we see that Debian 8 and Debian 9
are too old for that, but we could use `ip -json` if we could decide to
only support Debian 10, 11 and newer with ReaR 2.8 and following.

As enterprise distros are in any case not very eager to update ReaR we
can make use of that and cut off more old tails and move forward a
little bit faster, making our development and testing efforts so much
easier.

Personally I fully agree that ReaR upstream *needs* only  
to support distros that are currently being maintained  
but some users may expect something different, e.g. see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2923](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2923)

ReaR upstream support is not and never was something  
that users can demand.  
ReaR upstream support is and always was voluntary  
"best effort" attempts.

For ReaR 2.8 I will overhaul the "Support" section  
in the release notes.

My current plan is to replace lists with version numbers  
by a generic text that does not need continuous maintenance  
to keep version numbers and such mostly meaningless data  
continuously up to date, i.e. similar like in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/16](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/16)

In our current ReaR 2.7 release notes  
I updated what I know about SUSE and openSUSE  
but I left all the other Linux distributions  
basically unchanged because I cannot spend time on  
non-SUSE Linux distributions specific things because  
SUSE does not pay me for that and what matters most for me:  
I will not spend SUSE customer's money who pay my salary  
for non-SUSE Linux distributions specific things.  
The crucial word is 'specific'.  
When e.g. a RHEL user reports an issue that is generic  
for Linux distributions I work on it because fixing it  
also helps SUSE and openSUSE users.  
I am even happy when it is e.g. a RHEL user who reports  
a generic issue because then I could have a fix  
or a workaround or at least I know about the issue  
before a SUSE or openSUSE user is hit by it.

BTW, maybe we should also consider going to a **3.0** release instead of
2.8 in order to clearly signal that we cut off support for older
distros.

Yes of course.  
Major backward incompatible changes  
require a different major version number.

For me '2.8' is currently only a placeholder  
for "the next" ReaR version.

After the ReaR upstream maintainers agreed to actually do  
major backward incompatible changes for "the next" ReaR version  
I will do the needed changes in GitHub to have  
'3.0' officially as "the next" ReaR version.

In light of the other discussion around deprecation, e.g. in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2944\#issuecomment-1439975174](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2944#issuecomment-1439975174),
would we try to use that for Bash 3 deprecation too or would we just
decide that the next ReaR version requires Bash 4?

I agree with changing to bash4 and ip. For my use case this would be
fine - this however may not be the case for other users. Especially on
slower updating/more stable distros like RHEL.

Please define "being maintained". Ubuntu LTS versions for example are
maintained for 10 years (half free and public, half paid). Our customers
for example require 10 years of support for any HW and SW. Which
normally means at least +2 more years until it is in the field.

@DEvil0000 I expect that "maintenance" doesn't mean getting the latest
greatest versions but getting support for actual bugs in the old version
that came with the distro so many years ago. So whatever we decide here
about the **upstream** ReaR shouldn't have any impact on the LTS
distros.

You mention the paid support for the long tail of Ubuntu LTS for
example, I'm sure that @gdha for example would be able to provide
bugfixes or whatever is required as part of the [ReaR Software
Subscription](https://it3.be/rear-support/index.html) if a customer
wants to cover ReaR improvements for their old LTS distro.

I agree, I do normally not need a newer rear version in a old system and
I am very hesitant to change it. This is due to the amount of testing
needed with all the different HW/SW/config combinations. Also I normally
have patched versions out there since PRs do not result in new versions
that fast - and well testing again.  
On the other side I of course would like to use a newer version of rear
after PRs got merged - also in older OS versions.  
As you see my issues are more with the release cycle and testing effort
(due to stability concerns). Otherwise I would love to go with newer
versions on older OS releases (till in theory to ubuntu 14.04 - in
reality ubuntu 20.04).  
He however would for sure not be happy patching big chunks just for a
few machines per OS version.

edit:  
Long story short: I am fine with the change but I can see how others may
not be fine with it.

About the slow releases, I agree. I was once thinking about
automatically doing a release after merging a PR so that we would make
that code much faster available to users.

also note that rear packaging of the distros is even slower since they
orient on github releases nowadays and if there is no release when they
check then there will be no new rear package in the distro.  
some distros may check automatically by scripts while others more
manually every few years in their release cycle.

edit:  
if some test with the release fails (if they test) then they skip
packaging the release.

Regarding

From my current point of view  
I would call the next ReaR version '3.0' and  
switch from bash 3 to bash 4 as minimum required bash version  
(i.e. error out when sbin/rear is run with bash 3).

My reasoning:  
We cannot verify with reasonable effort  
if code changes actually require bash 4  
or still also work with bash 3  
so arbitrary failures at arbitrary places will happen  
if we would still allow to run sbin/rear with bash 3.

Of course a user can manually change his sbin/rear and  
skip this error exit to let it still run with bash 3  
if that is OK for him for his particular use case.

@schlomo  
because in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847\#issuecomment-1440843109](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847#issuecomment-1440843109)  
you wrote (excerpt)

    ... teach shellcheck to consider Bash 4.1 as "reference" ...

I wonder if any "Bash 4" (in particular also Bash 4.0)  
could be perhaps a too low minimum requirement  
so actually it should be at least Bash 4.1?

According to  
[https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/bashver4.html](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/bashver4.html)

    Version 4.1 of Bash ... was primarily a bugfix update.

so it seems any "Bash 4" as minimum requirement  
is sufficient in ReaR.

Of course bugfixes are good in general but I wonder  
if we must enforce that in ReaR?

I would only check for the major version, like this:

    (( BASH_VERSINFO[0] >= 4 )) || echo "too old"

I would not call next ReaR version '3.0' - it is not a user-visible
change unless one uses a distro which still has bash 3 - and then it
falls under deprecation of older distros - which, IMO, should happen
continuously - i.e we should not announce a major release only because
Ubuntu 14.04 or RHEL 6 or whatever support got removed.

OTOH, I think releasing '3.0' as an opportunity fort incompatible
changes is a good idea, but that's a separate discussion (everyone might
have different opinions on what "incompatible changes" they would like
to make, if any).

For the Bash change I'd keep the major version of `2` and simply error
out if somebody runs it on very old distros.

For a `3.0` version I'd love to get rid of much more painful things like
supporting BIOS boot, all the older backup software (e.g. all CommVault
below GALAXY11) etc. For example, I had a look at `OUTPUT=ISO` for
`UEFI` boot and it seems to be a lot of complexity thanks to the
combined BIOS/UEFI boot in the same code path.

And yes, I know thanks to \#2944 that we will be keeping BIOS boot for
much longer. Maybe I'd be happy with splitting `ISO` into `ISO` for BIOS
boot and a new `EISO` or `UEFI-ISO` for just UEFI boot and use that to
simplify the code. And maybe that would also warrant a `3.0` version as
it would actually remove existing functionality from `ISO`, thereby
forcing users to check their setup when they upgrade.

One new Bash feature that we could make use of is the `lastpipe` option:

>          If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last
>          command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the
>          current shell environment.

it would simplify some constructs, but would require newer bash than 4
(RHEL 7 has bash 4.2.46(2), which supports this feaure, while RHEL 6 has
bas 4.1.2(1), which does not).

So we kind of decided to drop the hard Bash 3.x requirement towards a
Bash 4.x requirement, see

Dear @rear/contributors OK to use Bash 4 features like associative
arrays in new code? It would really help a lot and I don't see us
shipping the next ReaR version for really old distros.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2024-01-18 10:02](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2941#issuecomment-1898163781):

For me using Bash 4 features is in general OK  
even when old code is changed (bugfix or enhancement).

From my current point of view I would prefer  
that Bash 4 features are not "needlessly" used.  
It is of course questionable what "needlessly"  
means in each particular case.  
I think for example when something is possible with Bash 3  
but the code becomes simpler with Bash 4 features  
then Bash 4 features are not needlessly used.  
In contrast when something can be done with Bash 3  
as well as with Bash 4 features then Bash 4 features  
are needlessly used - at least for now.  
I think over time Bash 4 features (regardless if  
really needed) will be commonly used everywhere.

When also @gdha and @pcahyna agree that  
using Bash 4 features is OK in general  
I would add a check that errors out with BugError  
when Bash 3 or earlier is used so we get user issues  
when someone is using our current master code with  
Bash 3 or earlier.

@jsmeix @schlomo I'm okay with settling down with bash 4.

My example and why I want to switch to Bash 4:

`PPDM_ASSETS_AND_SSIDS[$asset_name]="$ssid"` is so much simpler instead
of having 2 arrays and working wih indices to refer to the corresponding
item. Here I need to match file system and backup ID.

In particular it makes the code much easier to understand  
(which makes the code much easier to maintain in the future)  
than a needlessly implemented RFC 1925 item 6a indirection  
(here "needlessly" because Bash 4 is "just there" nowadays).
