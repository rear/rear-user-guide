-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): latest

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): all

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"): n/a

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Was doing a DR exercise at a customer where the console of vSphere
    was not fitting the window, meaning the bottom-line was not visible,
    and it is there where the most typing happens.  
    Unfortunately the `clear` command was not part of the basic ReaR
    tool-set. Would like to include this.  
    The question is are there other little programs that you miss from
    time to time?

I do not miss other little programs from time to time.

@gdha  
feel free to add useful optional helper tools to the PROGS array  
and missing generic helper tools to the REQUIRED\_PROGS array  
up to any point that you think is reasonable.

With "missing generic helper tools" I mean tools that exist  
on all Linux distributions and that one (desperately) needs  
in this or that exceptional cases to save the day.

In general I prefer when ReaR users get by default  
a rather big and full featured ReaR recovery system  
that works in almost all cases, in particular on most  
(possibly different) replacement hardware.

I think those cases where the ReaR recovery system should be minimal  
must be explicitly specified by the user via COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
when he finds out that the default recovery system is too big in his
case.

My reasoning behind is that a by default big recovery system  
that works in almost all cases and on most hardware causes less  
severe issues compared to a by default minimal recovery system  
because a too big recovery system only wastes some space  
but when something essential is missing in the recovery system  
it is basically a dead end for the user during "rear recover".

I think with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2043](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2043)
merged  
this issue is fixed/solved/done - at least for now - because  
currently nobody is missing other little programs.
