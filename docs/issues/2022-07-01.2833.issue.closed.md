Hello,

I am posting this question on the Github issue tracker, because the
rear-users list is not working at the moment.

I think that my issue is more than likely a configuration issue on my
part, rather than a Rear issue.

I'm new to Rear. I currently have a working Rear backup to a local USB
drive using NETFS.

I want to integrate Borg into my Rear config.

I currently have Borg backup to the local USB drive working when I use
Borg directly.

The issue that I'm having is when trying to call Borg via Rear.

I've tried a number of different settings in the conf file and none have
worked

Here is an extract of the error from Rear

    $ sudo rear -C borg_backup mkbackuponly -v
    Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git

In an ideal world, if someone can see the error in my conf file, that
would be awesome.

Failing that, some troubleshooting suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank you

Vaughan

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help with  
Borg backup specific issues.

Do you know about our Borg backup documentation in  
doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc  
which is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)  
therein the section "ReaR with Borg back end"?

Your above posted site.conf or local.conf looks incomplete.  
I am missing generic things like

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://foo.bar.xy/mnt/backup/iso

or alternatively

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

Also without a complete "rear -D mkrescue"  
and/or a "rear -D mkbackup" debug log file  
we have basically no chance to imagine  
what is actually going on on your system.

@jsmeix

I have the following working configuration (but this doesn't use Borg)

I have been able to restore this backup. But I don't want to run this
daily.

    /etc/rear/basic_system.conf
    sudo rear -C basic_system mkbackup

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE=1000
    USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=10

Thanks for your post.

I have been using a different example as my template for the integration
of the Borg backup  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

After your comments, I had a closer look at the section of the user
guide which you refer to. And while I still don't have a working config
as I write. I have been able to correct the error with Rear being unable
to locate the Borg repository.

This is definitely progress.

Thanks!

Sometimes you just need a fresh set of eyes to provide a different
perspective.

I'll do some further testing tomorrow.

But the syntax looks OK to me?

The answer appears to be to change

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/*' '/opt/*' )

To this

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/' '/opt/' )

Which seems odd, because the default.conf includes examples like the
following

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' "$VAR_DIR/output/*" )

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help with  
Borg backup specific issues.

From what is see in the code it goes like this:

With `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/*' '/opt/*' )`  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
creates $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt which contains

    /home/*
    /opt/*

that is read by  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
into a `include_list` array which then contains  
the array elements `/home/*` and `/opt/*`  
and that array is used in the borg\_create() function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh  
in a `borg create` call like

    borg create ... "${include_list[@]}"

which evaluates to

    borg create ... /home/* /opt/*

which seems to let 'borg' fail with

    /home/*: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '*'
    /opt/*: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '*'

so it seems 'borg' does not do "globbing"  
i.e. what bash does as "pathname expansion"  
or something similar.

In contrast with `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/' '/opt/' )`  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
creates $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt which contains

    /home/
    /opt/

that is read by  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
into a `include_list` array which then contains  
the array elements `/home/` and `/opt/`  
and that array is used in the borg\_create() function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh  
in a `borg create` call like

    borg create ... "${include_list[@]}"

which evaluates to

    borg create ... /home/ /opt/

which works with 'borg'.

Tertium datur:  
With `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /home/* /opt/* )`  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
creates $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt which contains  
what bash pathname expansion results for `/home/*` and `/opt/*`  
i.e. what

    # echo /home/* /opt/*

outputs which is all files and directories in `/home/` and `/opt/`  
(but not recursively for files in directories and sub-directories)  
and then $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt is read by  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
into a `include_list` array which then contains  
all files and directories in `/home/` and `/opt/`  
and that array is used in the borg\_create() function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh  
in a `borg create` call like

    borg create ... "${include_list[@]}"

which evaluates to

    borg create ... [all files and directories in /home/ and /opt/]

which likely also works with 'borg'.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9fc626918dc61b855e796d38b7fcee579136e88c](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9fc626918dc61b855e796d38b7fcee579136e88c)  
there is now a a more generic description in default.conf  
about quoting to avoid bash pathname expansion  
and a better example

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /some/directory /path/to/some/file )

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-07-05 12:41](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2833#issuecomment-1175013847):

Note the subtle difference:

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /home/* /opt/* )

evaluates to all files and directories in /home/ and /opt/  
(but not recursively for files in directories and sub-directories  
and also not to the directories /home and /opt itself)  
like on my current system

    # echo /home/* /opt/*
    /home/johannes /home/rear /opt/containerd /opt/google

so a backup tool that is called as

    backup_tool /home/johannes /home/rear /opt/containerd /opt/google

will backup all in

    /home/johannes /home/rear /opt/containerd /opt/google

but it may not backup the parent directories

    /home /opt

(in particular owner group permissions of that parent directories)  
so restoring that backup may not restore those parent directories  
(but create them anew from scratch with some default settings).

So in general it is better to keep it simple and specify

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /home /opt )

(bash pathname expansion for '/home' and '/opt' results '/home' and
'/opt')  
to backup the directories `/home` and `/opt`  
with all what those directories contain.

I assume this issue is sufficiently answered so I close it.  
Further comments may be added regardless that it is closed
