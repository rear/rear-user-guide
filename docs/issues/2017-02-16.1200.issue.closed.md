-   Brief description of the issue: after booting the rescue system, no
    DNS resolving is possible because /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf is not
    copied. I checked backup.log and there is no entry for this file. I
    know support for dynamic resolvconf generation was added some time
    ago and I checked the content of
    /usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/300\_dns.sh where everything was
    fine, except the file is not copied. Are there hidden options
    elsewhere which deny copying files from /run/...?

-   Work-around, if any:

As a workaround for now use the  
COPY\_AS\_IS  
array to get things copied into the ReaR recovery system  
(see default.conf), i.e. like:

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" '/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf' )
</pre>

FYI:  
Regarding "I checked backup.log":  
Do not mix up what files get saved in the backup with what  
files are used (copied) to build the ReaR recovery system.  
Both are totally different things.

Whoops!  
I overlooked that you wrote about  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/300\_dns.sh  
where that file is already in the COPY\_AS\_IS array.

You need to inspect the ReaR log with full debugging  
to find out why it is not copied into the ReaR recovery  
system, i.e. run

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

and inspect the ReaR log file for entries about that file.

Additionally you may use  
KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes"  
so that ReaR's working area is not deleted  
when "rear mkbackup" finished so that you can inspect  
what there actually is in the rescue/recovery system.  
The ReaR working area is usually a directory  
of the form /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and  
therein there is in particular the rescue/recovery system.

I took a look into tmp/copy-as-is-filelist and
tmp/rear-vm-mherzog-test.log. The only thing which looks strange is a
tar error in copy-as-is-filelist. could you point me to the directoy
where exactly the rescue system is located?

I had a closer look into /tmp/rear.xxx/rootfs/run and also deflated
/tmp/rear.xxx/tmp/initrd.cgz which I think is integrated to boot ISO of
the recovery system.

/run/resolvconf:  
does exist in /tmp/rear.xxx/rootfs/  
does exist in deflated initrd.cgz from /tmp/rear.xxx/tmp/  
does NOT exist in the booted rescue environment

@mat156 the `resolvconf` command is used to regenerate a
`/etc/resolv.conf` file, therefore, the question should be what is the
content of `/etc/resolv.conf` ?  
The content under `/run/` is automatically generated by a running
system, and we should only foresee the directory structure, nothing
more. Copying files to it has no meaning as far as I understood it.  
Furthermore, I do not think `resolvconf` executable is copied to the
rescue image.  
Secondly, I think the next line is not correct:

    /usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/300_dns.sh:COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/resolv.conf /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/hosts /etc/host.conf )

Personally, I think it should be:

    /usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/300_dns.sh:COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolvconf /etc/hosts /etc/host.conf )

And we should also copy the `resolvconf` executable:

    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" resolvconf )

But, again, start with the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

the /etc/resolv.conf file shows

    # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
    #     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
    nameserver 192.168.30.50
    search eaalab.hpi.uni-potsdam.de epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de hpi.uni-potsdam.de

which is the automatically generated content by resolvconf. but these
entries are not taken to the rescue image to provide DNS resolving. is
there a way to override these (non existent) settings with variables
from a config file like the entries `ip_adresses` or `routes` in the
subfolder `mappings` in `/etc/rear `?  
Otherwise I would have to puppetize 100 systems /etc/hosts entries to
manually resolve the backup server's IP address.

@gdha  
regarding "we should also copy the resolvconf executable" in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1200\#issuecomment-280339702](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1200#issuecomment-280339702)  
I think there is a typo and you actually meant

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" resolvconf )
</pre>

@jsmeix thanks! You were right - that happens when you are busy with 3
things at a time...  
@mat156 Are you sure the `/etc/resolv.conf` file is not correct within
the rescue image? It will be copied.  
Or, are you saying the IP range is completely different in the rescue
image (vlan)?

in my rescue environment (tested it now on 3 different installations of
ubuntu 16.04: virtualbox, vmware ESX and physical host HP Proliant
DL580G7) I only see this:

no, ip range in rescue system is just the same as production. no vlans.

@mat156  
a question only out of curiosity (I am not a cifs user):  
Why can't you use the IP address like

<pre>
BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.168.100.1/public
</pre>

?

@mat156 interesting - the link to `/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf` works
nice during the `mkbackup` workflow and you will find the link (and the
file itself in the rescue image directory), but once you boot off the
RESCUE image ISO the `/run` directory will be empty again (as designed
by nature). Therefore, we should make sure `/etc/resolv.conf` file
contains the data and is not a link to another file (would be much
better)

@jsmeix  
point for you, could use that, works of course without DNS. but I
remember having problems mounting cifs shares in former versions (either
ReaR or Ubuntu). for now this is a workaraound.

@gdha  
this would be much much better...

The issue was already reported in \#520 - but the fix was not 100%
correct (only 50% I would say) - nobody seemed to bother to test it
fully afterwards (I'm guilty too)

no one's guilty... how do we proceed? I think this may be closed here
and \#520 reopened/continued?!
