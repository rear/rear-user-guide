### ReaR version

Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

ReaR fails with the error message in 'Error Message.txt'.This was run
from a Cron job. This happens occasionally, when I run the same command
from the command line it works OK. 'rear-Noble.log.txt' is the complete
log from the failing run. 'rear-Noble.log run with \_D.txt' run from the
command line ran OK.

@bhkolts Please try with latest snapshot (at
<https://github.com/rear/rear/releases>) as the protected IDs section
was complete rewritten between release 2.7 and 2.9.

gdha,  
My current version of rear was installed from Ubuntu package
2.7+dfsg-1.1  
I also down loaded the ubuntu-24-04.zip file from github which contains
a deb file.  
Is it safe to install the deb package over the Ubuntu package with  
sudo apt install ./rear\_2.9-git.5686.9b28f14f.master\_amd64.deb?  
Thanks,  
bhkolts

Yes - it is safe to overwrite the 2.7 with th 2.9 version as ReaR is
completely written with bash scripts.
