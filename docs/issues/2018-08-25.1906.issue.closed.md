-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): debian buster

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): amd64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): BIOS / GRUB2

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    When doing rear mkbackup, a "find" command will traverse trough all
    filesystems from the root, which is quite inefficient. (see line 42
    in rescue/GNU/Linux/500\_clone\_keyboard\_mappings.sh ) There
    doesn't seem to be "/usr/share/keymaps" or any other keymap
    Directory in Debian buster.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Set KEYMAPS\_DEFAULT\_DIRECTORY and KEYMAPS\_DIRECTORY to point to
    an Empty Directory.

@Lukey3332 line 42? Can you be a bit more specific please?

During rescue/GNU/Linux/500\_clone\_keyboard\_mappings.sh  
there is a needless delay of almost one hour (from 09:14 until 10:07).

@Lukey3332 are the keymaps perhaps under `/usr/share/console/lists/` ?

@gdha No, that doesn't exist either. But I did check with apt-file and
`/usr/share/keymaps` Is provided by the `console-data` Package which
isn't installed on my System. Still I think that rear shouldn't try to
search for a Keymap on the whole system if the directories already don't
exist.

@Lukey3332 I agree that it is a bit overkill, but as the code was
written by @jsmeix I leave the decision with him (when he is back from
holiday).

This is a bug that I will fix when time permits.

It was never meant to search the whole tree of filesystems.  
I failed to imagine what happens when `$keymaps_default_directory` is
empty.  
"Fortunately" (not really - I provide config variables for all stuff
intentionally ;-)  
there are config variables that can be used to avoid that issue.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1935](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1935)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.
