@rear/contributors

Only a nit, but is it intended to leave the first and last line of the
file empty?

In contrast to what I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3107\#issuecomment-1855783591](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3107#issuecomment-1855783591)

    With 'dmesg -n 5' in [skel/default]/etc/scripts/boot
    I do not get any kernel error or warning message
    during ReaR recovery system startup on my test VM
    so normally 'dmesg -n 5' is sufficiently quiet.

I tested this pull request on another VM  
with a rather minimal SLES15-SP5 system  
and there 'dmesg -n 5' in /etc/scripts/boot  
results a few systemd related kernel messages  
during ReaR recovery system startup  
and also a few systemd related kernel messages  
during "rear recover" but nothing that could  
really "pollute" the usual ReaR messages  
so 'dmesg -n 5' behaves as I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3108\#issue-2041555869](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3108#issue-2041555869)

    ... up to 'dmesg -n 5' i.e. up to warning messages
    there are almost no kernel messages so that level 5
    does not "pollute" the usual ReaR messages ...

Therefore I added

    DebugPrint "Setting dmesg level $dmesg_level"

so the user could see in debug mode why kernel messages  
appear now intermixed with ReaR messages on console  
but only on console and not eg. from remote via 'ssh', cf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3108\#issuecomment-1857527905](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3108#issuecomment-1857527905)  
which is a bit different behaviour on console  
than it had been before with 'dmesg -n1'.

@pcahyna  
probably unexpected but it is really intentional  
that I prefer to keep the first and last line empty.  
My explanation for that could become somewhat long-winded  
but I have some good reasons with personal experience  
for both cases (first line and last line).  
Technically there is no reason for that but only  
in theory, theory and practice are the same,  
in practice, they are not ;-)

@jsmeix I would now to recommend to squash the first three commits
together and force push. Then, when merging, use the usual procedure
(create a merge commit).

@pcahyna  
I simply merged with "Squash and merge" in the GitHub web frontend  
which squashed all commits into one single merge commit.  
The more I get used to it the more I like its simplicity.  
Meanwhile I think its drawback as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089\#issuecomment-1845130303](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089#issuecomment-1845130303)  
does not matter in practice in very most cases.  
I.e. I think the simplicity of "squash all into one"  
outweighs its possible drawback in very most cases.

Normally I use only the GitHub web frontend to implement changes  
so normally I cannot squash specific commits myself locally.

Normally I do not implement things on a local git checkout  
on my homeoffice laptop but I use the GitHub web frontend  
as much as possible (to a certain extent) e.g. for some  
really big changes I may prefer a local git checkout.

I test pull requests via git clone and git checkout  
on a test VM that runs on my homeoffice laptop.

My personal reasons are:

Since more and more "doing work" changes from  
doing one's own computing with one's own software  
to Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS), cf.  
[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html)

1.  I just try to adapt to the new fancy modern way  
    because I know how to do things the good old way  
    but I want to really try out that new way  
    and get some proper experience on my own  
    to be able to better understand the new way.
2.  I want to be independent of the particular computer  
    where I sit in front of as far as possible (to a certain extent)  
    so any computer with a browser should suffice.

My personal reason behind those reasons is  
that some years ago I had a (smaller) accident at my leg  
(it was about 2019 - i.e. before I changed to homeoffice)  
which forced me to sit at home with a "home"-computer  
that was not at all prepared to do my work.  
But I was able to do my work (I only could not walk)  
so I experienced how good it would be to be able  
to work on an arbitrary (trusted) computer  
with basically only a (reasonable) browser.
