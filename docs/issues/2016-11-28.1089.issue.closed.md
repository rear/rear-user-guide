#### Exit code in messages file improvement

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): v2.0
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): n/a

example:

    # grep DONE /var/log/messages
    Nov 25 17:20:45 client rear[14341]: DONE: rc=0

Would be better to see something like: `Workflow backup: rc=0`  
Are there any other (better) suggestions?

@gdha  
what does 'rc' mean here?

According to  
[http://superuser.com/questions/173165/what-does-the-rc-in-bashrc-etc-mean](http://superuser.com/questions/173165/what-does-the-rc-in-bashrc-etc-mean)  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/111611/what-does-the-rc-stand-for-in-etc-rc-d](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/111611/what-does-the-rc-stand-for-in-etc-rc-d)  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run\_commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_commands)  
usually 'rc' means "run commands" which cannot be meant here.

I guess here 'rc' could mean "return code" but this is not a function  
so that I would prefer to name it as what it actually is: "exit code"

I suggest the following in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
if test $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ; then
    LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"
else
    LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW failed with exit code $EXIT_CODE"
fi
</pre>

Note that I do not use "succeeded with zero exit code"  
to avoid false hope because a zero exit code does  
not necessarily mean that everything was o.k.

By the way:  
@gdha @schlomo  
do you know why the help workflow sets EXIT\_CODE=1  
in lib/help-workflow.sh?  
According to "git log -p usr/share/rear/lib/help-workflow.sh"  
that was implemented by Schlomo Schapiro in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f57be9070cb8ad8692497d0baedf364b47ac7a8d](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f57be9070cb8ad8692497d0baedf364b47ac7a8d)

With

merged  
the help workflow exits now with zero exit code.
