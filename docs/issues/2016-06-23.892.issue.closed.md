Current rear master.

The PROGS array in usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
lists so many basic tools (like bash grep cat) but there is no  
REQUIRED\_PROGS array in usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf

I wonder if it wouldn't be better to have  
the basic tools in an REQUIRED\_PROGS array?

There is a predefined REQUIRED\_PROGS array  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf that also contains  
things like bash and grep but e.g. no cat  
and no less ( cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755)
)

@jsmeix I don't believe this issue is a show stopper for a new release,
right? Perhaps, we better move the milestone?

This is certainly not a show-stopper for the 1.19 release.

pushing fwd to 2.5

I think with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961)
merged  
it is a good first step into the right direction, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961\#issuecomment-437352262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961#issuecomment-437352262)

I do not yet close this issue because I like to play around a bit more  
how ReaR behaves during "rear mkrescue" when basic programs are missing.

I had the dim feeling from the past that the checks  
that intend to verify all REQUIRED\_PROGS exist  
are messy in current ReaR and I was right:

With `REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" qqqq )` in local.conf  
things somewhat work but do not work really well.

There are two checks with same code, one in usr/sbin/rear and  
another one in prep/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
and both are not fully right because:

1.)  
In general there should not be duplicated code

2.)  
The check in prep/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
is too early for things like  
`REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" cryptsetup dmsetup )`  
in layout/save/GNU/Linux/260\_crypt\_layout.sh or  
`REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" "brctl" )`  
in rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
because the 'prep' stage runs before the 'layout/save' and 'rescue'
stages  
so that it won't error out during "rear mkrescue" when  
e.g. 'cryptsetup' or 'brctl' are required but do not exists.

3.)  
In case of 2. it errors out too late when the user cannot fix things  
during "rear recover" by the check in usr/sbin/rear

I will clean up the checks that verify all REQUIRED\_PROGS exist...

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1962](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1962)
merged  
I consider this particular issue sufficiently fixed for now.

In the future we may find out that more programs  
should be added to REQUIRED\_PROGS by default, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961\#issuecomment-437352262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961#issuecomment-437352262)

What we will need to improve is that specific scripts which result  
that specific programs will be called in the recovery system  
need to add those programs to REQUIRED\_PROGS.

For example I have an ext4 root filesystem and did

<pre>
# mv /usr/sbin/mkfs /usr/sbin/mkfs.away
# mv /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4 /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4.away
</pre>

and "rear -D mkrescue" did not error out (or show any kind of message)  
regardless that without mkfs and/or mkfs.ext4 in the recovery system

<pre>
# find /tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs | grep mkfs

/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.ext2
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.jfs
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.ext3
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.reiserfs
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.vfat
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.btrfs
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.xfs

# grep ext4 /tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/.../var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
# Filesystems (only ext2,ext3,ext4,vfat,xfs,reiserfs,btrfs are supported).
fs /dev/sda2 / ext4 uuid=aed8d81b-29bf-405e-9049-29a6c0e702d3 label= ...
</pre>

the ext4 root filesystem cannot be recreated.
