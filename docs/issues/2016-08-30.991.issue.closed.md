-   Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer OS\_VERSION=6
-   **Issue:** We define a custom `NETFS_UMOUNTCMD` variable in our
    site.conf, with a function that basically spits out a backup
    complete message, along with a timestamp and where the backup was
    stored so that we can insert that result into a database. The
    problem is that it seems during the
    `backup/NETFS/default/10_mount_NETFS_path.sh` script step, it is
    trying to run this above custom defined UMOUNT command instead of a
    stock MOUNT command, even though the `NETFS_MOUNTCMD` variable is
    not defined. See the **Mounting with** line below from my log.
    Besides failing to mount, since it is running the wrong command, it
    does not error out, and continues writing the tar.gz file to the
    /tmp/rear.xxxx directory, filling up the /tmp filesystem.

I even modified the `backup/NETFS/default/10_mount_NETFS_path.sh`
script, for debug purposes, to spit out the contents of all the MOUNTCMD
and UMOUNTCMD variables, and none of the UMOUNT variables contain
anything, so I don't know where its picking this botched mount command
up from.

    mkdir: created directory `/tmp/rear.9ttQqoQPAKL9Dq2/outputfs'

    ...
    umount: /tmp/rear.9ttQqoQPAKL9Dq2/outputfs: not mounted

It doesn't seem to matter if I set BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD or NETFS\_UMOUNTCMD
to my custom umount function, same result either way.

One other thought, we store both the ISO and BACKUP in the same spot on
our NFS server, but during the course of the rear mkbackup, the NFS
share is mounted and un-mounted 3 times, I believe. Is there any way to
let it stay mounted the whole time so only 1 mount and 1 un-mount is
required? The first 2 mounts and un-mounts work just fine, its only that
3rd / last mount, during the backup phase, that fails.

A better option (for us) would be a variable we could set that would run
at the very end, perhaps during
`backup/NETFS/default/98_umount_NETFS_dir.sh` script, to avoid having to
hijack the umount command in the way that we do. Does something like
that already exist? I didn't turn up anything obvious in my search.

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.

@gigawatts try running with the debug option turned on to see where it
goes wrong. To be honest I never used this option myself (I believe
@schlomo wrote this piece)

I debug this issue further and below are my observations.

// From backup/NETFS/default/10\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh  
\`  
mkdir -p $v "$BUILD\_DIR/outputfs" &gt;&2  
StopIfError "Could not mkdir '$BUILD\_DIR/outputfs'"

AddExitTask "rmdir $v $BUILD\_DIR/outputfs &gt;&2"

if \[\[ "$BACKUP\_MOUNTCMD" \]\] ; then  
BACKUP\_URL="var://BACKUP\_MOUNTCMD"  
fi

mount\_url $BACKUP\_URL $BUILD\_DIR/outputfs $BACKUP\_OPTIONS
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; this is where actual failure is triggered  
\`

So it means $BACKUP\_URL is not correct.

I added debug statement here and got below :

2016-09-14 04:37:53 amote var://BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD..
/tmp/rear.iAtsBx6RCk9ODs2/outputfs.. rw,noatime ......

It means $BACKUP\_URL is set to var://BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD which is causing
this issue.

Checking further, I see that BACKUP\_URL is set in below two places
which is relevant to our analysis :  
`[root@rhel7 rear]# grep -rn BACKUP_URL *  | grep var  backup/NETFS/default/10_mount_NETFS_path.sh:8:    BACKUP_URL="var://BACKUP_MOUNTCMD" backup/NETFS/default/98_umount_NETFS_dir.sh:4:    BACKUP_URL="var://BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD" prep/NETFS/default/05_check_NETFS_requirements.sh:17:    ### set other variables from BACKUP_URL`

I ran "rear -v mkbackup" command and observed logs from
/var/log/rear/rear-rhel7.log file. Along with this, I added debug
statement in other places as well.

When mkbackup command is run, it go through all below stages :

`2016-09-14 05:16:31 Running 'init' stage 2016-09-14 05:16:31 Running mkbackup workflow 2016-09-14 05:16:31 Running 'prep' stage 2016-09-14 05:16:31 Running DHCP client found, enabling USE_DHCLIENT 2016-09-14 05:16:31 Running 'layout/save' stage 2016-09-14 05:16:33 Running 'rescue' stage 2016-09-14 05:16:34 Running 'build' stage 2016-09-14 05:16:42 Running 'pack' stage 2016-09-14 05:16:59 Running 'output' stage 2016-09-14 05:17:05 Running 'backup' stage 2016-09-14 05:17:05 Running exit tasks.`

During 'prep' stage, I see that 98\_umount\_NETFS\_dir.sh is sourced and
that's where BACKUP\_URL gets set.

// from 98\_umount\_NETFS\_dir.sh , as we have set BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD in
site.conf file, if is true and then set BACKUP\_URL

`if [[ "$BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD" ]] ; then BACKUP_URL="var://BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD" fi`

Now during last 'backup' stage, 10\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh script access

To workaround this issue, I defined NETFS\_MOUNTCMD in site.conf file
and "rear -v mkbackup" is properly executed without any failure.

@gigawatts @ajitmote In the latest development release of ReaR we have
modified the exit messages so that the `NETFS_UMOUNTCMD` may be
unnecessary. Just give it a try.  
If it was just for me I rather see the `NETFS_UMOUNTCMD` and
`NETFS_MOUNTCMD` go away. It should be enough to use `BACKUP_URL`  
@jsmeix @schlomo Any comments or thoughts?

The initial comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/991\#issue-174101377](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/991#issue-174101377)  
reads

<pre>

with a function that basically spits out a backup complete message,
along with a timestamp and where the backup was stored
...
A better option (for us) would be a variable we could set

Does something like that already exist?
</pre>

I think one cannot expect that misuse of NETFS\_UMOUNTCMD  
has no unexpected side effects.

NETFS\_UMOUNTCMD is deprectated.  
nowadays it is BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD,  
see default.conf.

BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD is meant to be used together  
with a matching BACKUP\_MOUNTCMD.

To run arbitrary commands at the very end use  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT

To spit out a backup complete message see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022\#issuecomment-255323450](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022#issuecomment-255323450)

I think this issue is sufficiently answered via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022)  
so that I close it.
