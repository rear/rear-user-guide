Successful recovery of a RHEL 8.5 VM with BIOS without encryption, LVM  
or multipath with this patch applied and unsuccessful recovery of the
same  
machine without it. RHEL 8.5 has `os-prober` 1.74 and does not ship  
`grub-mount` binary.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Changes usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf

Older releases of `os-prober` (1.74 and below) use `dmsetup` as a
fallback  
solution for mounting when `grub-mount` is missing.

However, `dmsetup` was included in the rescue image if and only if
LVM,  
multipath or encryption were detected. Thus, BIOS machines that do  
not use these but still have `dmsetup` present, would block
indefinitely  
on the "Installing GRUB2 boot loader..." step.

GRUB2 installation is performed in a chroot after the data have
already  
been recovered. ReaR would call `grub-mkconfig` which calls
`os-prober`  
which then executes `dmsetup`. However, it would never receive the
response  
trough host's udev as the rescue system would not have `dmsetup`
present  
to send it.

EDIT: reworded the description (thanks @pcahyna for suggestions!)  
EDIT2: usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf is now being changed.

Similar problem was reported for another case outside the context of
ReaR where grub2-mkconfig is executed in a chroot with udev running
outside the chroot: the Debian installer. The result is the same: it
hangs forever when executing `os-prober`. See
[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=853927](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=853927)
[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860833](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860833)
. The root cause of the problem has never been properly understood and
the code in `os-prober` that executes dmsetup got eventually removed to
fix this problem:
[https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/os-prober/master/revision/419](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/os-prober/master/revision/419)
. Some distributions still have the problematic `os-prober` though.

In order to show the problem the system must not use any LVM, thus the
previous code did not include `dmsetup` in the rescue system. Note also
that the old message "Device mapper found enabled. Including LVM tools."
was a bit incorrect: LVM tools got included only if both device-mapper
and LVM were found, finding device-mapper enabled was not enough.

In general when programs are useful in any case in the recovery system  
shoudn't such programs be better added to PROGS in  
the generic usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf ?

@jsmeix I agree. This case of `dmsetup` has nothing to do with LVM,
really, although superficially it may appear related. So it belong to
another location, and `usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf` is a good
one. (Only a comment could be left here, explaining why `dmsetup` is not
being added here despite being related to LVM, or perhaps the current
code could be left as it is - I suppose that there is no problem with
adding a tool to `PROGS` twice?)

@jsmeix @pcahyna I've added `dmsetup` and `dmeventd` with explanation
for doing so to `usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf`.

There should be no problem adding something to PROGS or REQUIRED\_PROGS
several times  
because in build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
there is a `sort -u`

    local all_binaries=( $( for bin in "${PROGS[@]}" "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" ; do
                                ...
                            done 2>>/dev/$DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV | sort -u ) )
    ...
    copy_binaries "$ROOTFS_DIR/bin" "${all_binaries[@]}"

and even without `sort -u` copying something several times should not
cause harm.

When there are no objections I would like to merge it today afternoon.

I assume the description is OK now  
so I would like to merge it today in about one hour  
unless there are objections soon.

@lzaoral @pcahyna  
thank you for your deep analysis of the problem and for your fix!

I think I understand "something" but the main point is that one
understands  
"without it things could block indefinitely at 'Installing GRUB2 boot
loader...'"  
so better safe than sorry and have sometimes needed things in the
recovery system  
because after "rear recover" failed it is a bit late to add missing
stuff to the recovery system ;-)

Technically, this is not 100% true. You can copy dmsetup from the
restored chroot to the running rescue ramdisk and restart rear recover,
so this is one of the less disastrous errors that may happen (there are
other ways to add missing stuff to the ramdisk, even a forgotten backup
client can be added). But in this case the problem is really mysterious
and it took us days to even figure out that dmsetup is what one needs
(debian / ubuntu were never able to debug this problem in their
installer and they rather requested removal of the problematic code from
os-prober entirely), so it is very unlikely that one would find out the
workaround.  
Also, if you get a heart attack because the recovery of your broken
$CRITICAL\_SERVER failed, workarounds won't help you, as you are already
dead :-)
