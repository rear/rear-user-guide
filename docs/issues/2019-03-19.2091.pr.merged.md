#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087)

-   How was this pull request tested? Manually on PC with eMMC disk
    device (Z83-F).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: sysfs for
    (some?) eMMC disks recognises partitions, which are actually no
    usual partitions, but special areas on the eMMC. When trying to get
    the partition layout for such disks, ReaR exits with an error. This
    pull request contains enhancements to silently ignore these special
    partitions, so that ReaR no longer fails.

@fabz5  
thank you for your valuable contribution to ReaR  
that improves ReaR in a specific area for specific hardware  
where not "just anybody" could "just do" such improvements.
