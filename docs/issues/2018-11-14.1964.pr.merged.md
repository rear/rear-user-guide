-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    Basically no impact on usual systems where all those tools are
    installed  
    but high impact on systems where such tools are missing because  
    when specific required programs are missing on a system  
    better safe than sorry and error out during "rear
    mkrescue/mkbackup"  
    than "successfully" provide the user a recovery system that is
    useless.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my system with an ext4 root filesystem as in  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1963\#issue-380602044](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1963#issue-380602044)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Currently this is only a first step where I only added specific  
required `parted` and `mkfs.*` programs to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
in layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
and layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh  
depending on what there actually is in disklayout.conf

Further commits here will add more specific required programs  
in the 'layout/save' scripts as far as I can with reasonable effort  
(I am not an expert in all those various kind of storage stuff  
so that I cannot imagine what specific programs are required  
to recreate all those various kind of storage objects).

How it errors out if specific required mkfs.\* programs are missing:

<pre>
# mv /usr/sbin/mkfs /usr/sbin/mkfs.away
# mv /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4 /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4.away

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
...
ERROR: Cannot find required programs:  mkfs mkfs.ext4

Now specific required programs are added to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
in those scripts:

<pre>
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/240_swaps_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/250_drbd_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/260_crypt_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/270_hpraid_layout.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/280_multipath_layout.sh
</pre>

which means specific required programs are added to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
for those component keywords in disklayout.conf:

<pre>
disk part (via 200_partition_layout.sh)
raid (via 210_raid_layout.sh)
lvmdev lvmgrp lvmvol (via 220_lvm_layout.sh)
fs (via 230_filesystem_layout.sh)
swap (via 240_swaps_layout.sh)
drbd (via 250_drbd_layout.sh)
crypt (via 260_crypt_layout.sh)
logicaldrive smartarray (via 270_hpraid_layout.sh)
multipath (via 280_multipath_layout.sh)
</pre>
