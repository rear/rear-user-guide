Partition resizing changed slightly last week.

Can you post the output of

    # cat /sys/block/sda/size

in the rescue system?

And change the partition end to something slightly smaller and report
back the first value that works? It's most likely one or two sectors
off.

Another issue I can see is that the bios\_grub partition has been
resized, that also needs to be fixed.

I reduced it more, but if you like I can redo the exercise?

I tried a resize in VMware from a 6G virtual disk to a 5G virtual disk,
as in your case. No problems...

Can you post the output of

    # parted -s /dev/sda u b p

Or the sequence below in the rescue system (after code generation):

    RESCUE archrear:~ # cat /sys/block/sda/size 
    10485760

    RESCUE archrear:~ # parted -s /dev/sda u b p
    Model: VMware, VMware Virtual S (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 5368709120B
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: msdos

    Number  Start      End          Size         Type     File system  Flags
     1      32768B     98703871B    98671104B    primary  ext2         boot
     2      98705408B  5368709119B  5270003712B  primary               lvm

    RESCUE archrear:~ # grep parted /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh 
    parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 32768B 98703871B >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda set 1 boot on >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 98705408B 5368709119B >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda set 2 lvm on >&2

I need to know if it's the end or the start of the partition that's
giving problems.

The parted version would also be helpful.

Gratien,

If you indent a block (at least 4 characters) the block will be a code
listing block (with proportional font etc...) or if you prefer syntax
highlighting you can do what Jeroen does by using:

    ```bash
    bash code
    ```

I have been editing your notes in order to get the output cleaned up,
but I hope you could do it yourself in the future ;-)

Hypothesis: GPT disks also write a copy of the GPT table at the end of
the disk.

The new partition resizing actually works. The previous one left enough
space at the end of the disk for this to be unnoticed.

Before started the layout/recreate/default/20\_run\_script.sh ran I
checked the size:

    rear> cat /sys/block/sda/size
    10485760

And, show the original piece of code of
/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh (only the parted part):

    parted -s /dev/sda mklabel gpt >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart rear-noname 32768B 891402B >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda set 1 bios_grub on >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart ext4 892928B 525180927B >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda set 2 boot on >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda name 2 "ext4"
    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart rear-noname 525185024B 5368709119B >&2
    parted -s /dev/sda set 3 lvm on >&2

Started the recovery and we got the error back:

    +++ parted -s /dev/sda mkpart rear-noname 525185024B 5368709119B
    Error: You requested a partition from 525MB to 5369MB.
    The closest location we can manage is 525MB to 5369MB.
    2012-03-29 13:47:40 An error occured during layout recreation.

Via the shell option have a look at the parted layout:

    rear> parted -s /dev/sda u b p
    Model: VMware, VMware Virtual S (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 5368709120B
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags:

    Number  Start    End         Size        File system  Name         Flags
     1      32768B   891903B     859136B                  rear-noname  bios_grub
     2      892928B  525180927B  524288000B               ext4         boot

Quickly calculated we the size of the 3th partition should:
5368709120-859136-524288000=4843561984  
It seems that in the disklayout.sh code this is almost correct:

    part /dev/sda 4843562484 526385152 rear-noname lvm /dev/sda3

Changed it into:

    part /dev/sda 4843561984 526385152 rear-noname lvm /dev/sda3

And give it another try. However, in diskrestore.sh the line stayed the
same:

    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart rear-noname 525185024B 5368709119B >&2

But, still we get the error:

    +++ parted -s /dev/sda mkpart rear-noname 525185024B 5368709119B
    Error: You requested a partition from 525MB to 5369MB.

Changed the code into

    parted -s /dev/sda mkpart rear-noname 525185024B 4843561984B

The partition worked fine, but got an error on lvcreate:

    +++ lvm lvcreate -l 126 -n lv_root vg
      Volume group "vg" has insufficient free space (78 extents): 126 required.
    2012-03-29 14:16:08 An error occured during layout recreation.

But, that is less critical and can be changed easily by the end-user.

Please reopen if it wasn't.
