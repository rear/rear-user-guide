-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Hello, last week, I have tested rear tool as the following
    environment:  
    Rear : 1.19-2 and 2.00-2  
    OS : RHEL V6.7  
    HW : HPE Superdome X + 3PAR Storage  
    Boot Mode : UEFI  
    Boot : SAN Boot Storage(3PAR).

I had succfully done rear backup and recover by the above configuration,
but I have got to grub prompt "grub&gt;" after booting.  
I need your help about the reason and the solution of booting failure at
grub.  
I recreated bootloader by efibootmgr command, but this issue has
occurred again by the follwing command:

<pre>
# efibootmgr –c –d /dev/mapper/device-name –L “Redhat xxxxx” –l \EFI\redhat\grub.efi
</pre>

-   Work-around, if any: None

@gozora  
I dare to assign this issue to you because it is about UEFI.

I noticed that in this case there is "BOOT\_OVER\_SAN=y"  
together with "USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1" and  
I wonder if that is supported at all by ReaR?

@DongIn0916  
what exactly do you mean with

... this issue has occurred again by the follwing command:
# efibootmgr ...

@DongIn0916  
in general when after "rear recover" and reboot  
the recreated system cannot successfully boot,  
you should first redo "rear recover" but then do not  
reboot from the running ReaR recovery system  
but instead keep the ReaR recovery system running  
(where you are still logged in as 'root') and try to manually  
install the bootloader as you need it in your particular case.  
Within the running ReaR recovery system after "rear recover"  
the recreated system is mounted below "/mnt/local/" so that  
with appropriate "chroot /mnt/local/" commands you can  
manually install your bootloader in your recreated system.

@jsmeix thanks for trusting in UEFI skills so much :-).

@DongIn0916 my guess is that you've somehow lost grub.cfg. You can try
to locate it using GRUB shell.  
On my system following worked for me  
`grub> configfile (hd1,gpt3)/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`

or you can load kernel and initrd
[manually](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-rescue-non-booting-grub-2-linux)

Checking BOOT\_OVER\_SAN doesen't do really much:

    # 240_include_multipath_tools.sh
    # Boot Over SAN executables and other goodies

    [[ $BOOT_OVER_SAN != ^[yY1] ]] && return

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" multipath dmsetup kpartx multipathd scsi_id  )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/multipath/bindings /etc/multipath/wwids /etc/multipath.conf )

So I guess it is compatible with USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER ...

Tank you very much for your update.  
I run efibootmgr command after rear recover done and chroot
/mnt/local.  
and then I run reboot command. but this issue occurred again.

As UEFI and general booting noob I mainly listen here  
so that I may (hopefully) learn a bit.

As far as I meanwhile understand it  
"BOOT\_OVER\_SAN=y" together with  
"USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1" means that  
the disk wherefrom the system is booted is connected via SAN  
and on that boot disk UEFI is used.

efibootmgr will not help you much out of this!  
Did you try to load kernel and initrd from grub prompt?

No, I did not try to load them from grub.

I would like to know the root cause of this issue that does not
recognize grub bootloader with san boot environment.

@DongIn0916 you've told that your boot end up in grub shell. That means
that your boot loader is recognized ...

I agree with your information, but I do not know the root reason. I'll
try to anlyze about rear and efi san boot.

@jsmeix @gozora BOOT\_OVER\_SAN piece was added for a customer that
needed it to clone from internal boot disks to SAN boot disks.
Therefore, the code is rather small, and perhaps today it could be
removed and added by default?

now, the system is grub menu with grub&gt; normal and then the system is
normal booting.  
but I do not know the reason to drop grub commant prompt.

My detail steps are :

Step1 : I run grub-install and efibootmgr commands.  
Step2 : run "shutdown -r now" command  
Step3 : Drop to grub command prompt  
Step4 : run normal command  
grub&gt; normal <enter>  
Step5 : display grub menu  
Step6 : done normal booting

Because there was no further update since a long time here  
I assume this issue is meanwhile somehow sufficiently solved and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1264\#issuecomment-290619637](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1264#issuecomment-290619637)  
indicates there is at least some workaround how to get it booted.
