Gratien's observation seems correct to me.

And now I remember the reason why I used `attach` instead of `up`. Using
`up` did not work when the slave is not online yet. Did you test that
case? It looks to me like the only time you want to restore a master
(primary) is when both nodes are down.

When the slave is online, up also worked in my test enviroment, but I
get a split brain.

I tested it with two drbd nodes and one drbd device (active/passive) in
a vmware environment. The restore works well in all test cases.
