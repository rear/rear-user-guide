This is a precondition for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)

The very first step is some cleanup and enhancements  
of the messages output functions in \_input-output-functions.sh

Be patient - do not merge it yet - more needs to come here...

Meanwhile it seems to look o.k. for me when I run

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup 2>/dev/null

rear -d -D recover 2>/dev/null
</pre>

i.e. what is missing is to fix all the old deprecated usage of
'&gt;&8'  
cf.

By meditating over the weekend how I could  
fix all the old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8'  
I think now that I will fix it in two steps:

First setp (within this pull request)  
I will simply convert all old usage of '&gt;&8' into '&gt;/dev/null'  
because according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/874\#issuecomment-227135652](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/874#issuecomment-227135652)  
all old usage of '&gt;&8' results the same as '&gt;/dev/null'  
so that converting all old usage of '&gt;&8' into '&gt;/dev/null'  
does not change anything and I can proceed here  
towards getting this pull request in a state where  
it can be merged.

Second step via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887)  
As a second separated step I can step by step check  
each usage of '&gt;/dev/null' and clean it up or enhance it  
as appropriate, i.e.:  
usually things should go to the log file but sometimes  
things should actually still go to /dev/null, cf.

Manwhile this pull request has changed from my initial attempt to  
"Use generic ReaR functions for actually intended user input/output"  
to  
"Redirect both stderr and stdout into the log file  
but use the original fds for actually intended user input/output"  
which means it already solves  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)  
in a (relatively) simple way as follows:

In lib/\_input-output-functions.sh I do (excerpts):

<pre>
# Duplicate STDIN to fd6 ...
exec 6<&0
# Duplicate STDOUT to fd7 ...
exec 7>&1
# Duplicate STDERR to fd8 ...
exec 8>&2
</pre>

that is sourced before I do in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
# Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR into the log file.
...
exec 2>>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE"
...
exec 1>&2
</pre>

In all user input/output functions and in all scripts  
I use now fd6 for actually intended user input and  
fd7 and fd8 for actually intended user output.

To keep backward compatible behaviour  
all old usage of '&gt;&8' was converted into '&gt;/dev/null'  
where /dev/null usage in general can be cleaned up  
later via

Because it works well for me and I did not change  
real functionality but only whereto stdin and stdout goes  
I think this change cannot cause severe issues so that I merge it  
(of course if there are issues I will fix them).

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
I explained "What to do with stdout and stderr" when  
both stdout and stderr are redirected into ReaR's log file.

So should we revert it?

@schlomo  
please have a look at the actual current code what really would  
have to be reverted to get back the previous behaviour, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398\#issuecomment-311886920](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398#issuecomment-311886920)

From my point of view all the other changes in this pull request  
are valuable enhancements and code cleanup, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391\#issuecomment-311040948](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391#issuecomment-311040948)
