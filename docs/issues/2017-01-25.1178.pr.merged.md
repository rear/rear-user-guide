initrd creation during recovery.

@schabrolles  
many thanks for your careful looking at the code and fixing it!

FYI:  
I also found it while I am working on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1176](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1176)

PS:  
Such errors are an unfortunate effect  
of editors like 'vi' that have different modes  
together with interpreted languages where  
most errors are detected only during runtime.
