Yes, the problem is that by default when building SRPM version is
queried from [release-monitoring.org](https://release-monitoring.org),

indefinitely because of firewall configuration and the job is eventually
killed (without a proper clean-up, that's another issue to fix).

We are going to fix it ASAP, sorry for the noise.
