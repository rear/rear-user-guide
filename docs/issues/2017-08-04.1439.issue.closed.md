-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? Legacy
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Using external Manhattan SATA 3.5 " enclosure, USB3 interface
    connected to Intel Server USB2 interface. Intel S1200BC server
    motherboard. Unable to boot from external after creating Recovery &
    Backup.  
    Note: Smaller Sata disk (250Gb tried) works fine. Suspect Grub
    limitation (large number of cyl)? log has no errors.  
    Yet Centos can create bootdisk successfully on 1TB. Creates 2
    partitions though (LVM).
-   Work-around, if any:Use CDROM rescue media and backup to USB device.
    inconvenient but usable.

Hi @deonlinux,

Before we go any further; can you please try with configuration similar
to following:

    # USB testing
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

@deonlinux  
Did you format your disk with `rear format ....` command ?

Yes, drive was formatted with rear format cmd  
I have also used the suggestions specified previously
(USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 etc)  
Sadly still does not work.

You might have really hit some limits, so I can only guess from now
on.  
ReaR options I'd experiment with would be following:

    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt #default is msdos

or maybe try to create smaller partition on your disk using:

    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=20 #default is 100

Full list can be find in
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L320)

The suggestion of specifying gpt worked!!!  
Percentage did not.  
Great thanks gozora!  
We can close this now I guess

If this is really a size limit then we should warn the user that it
won't work.

Maybe we can default to GPT if this is an EFI system?

@deonlinux, you are always welcome.

Hi @schlomo we are already doing this. Excerpt from
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L332)
comment:

    # When UEFI is used the format workflow will create a GUID partition table in any case.

@jsmeix if I did not mention it earlier, thanks for your great
comments!!!

@gozora I am not sure about that. As far as I can understand
[300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/06951bbd96510bbd855668299bb216c185ef4b6b/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh)
there is no auto detect mechanism for `USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL`. If
`EFI` is set then it forces EFI mode.

I think that the code actually has two paths:

-   EFI (set by command line) creates an EFI System Partition and of
    course uses gpt
-   Otherwise it uses gpt or msdos to create a BIOS boot medium

So to make @deonlinux happy we probably should have two types of auto
detect here:

-   automatically use EFI mode for EFI systems (currently requires
    manual setting)
-   automatically use gpt, either on modern Linux distros or at least
    for large media.

@gozora  
the exact condition is in format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh

<pre>
if is_true "$EFI" ; then
</pre>

so that it depends on when "$EFI" has a 'true' value.  
It has a 'true' value at least when the user specifies it  
when calling 'rear format' e.g. as in

<pre>
rear -v format -- --efi --force /dev/sdX
</pre>

Note the mandatory '--' before the format workflow specific  
options ('-v' is the generic rear option).  
Without that the format workflow specific options won't work.  
For details read the getopt documentation.

My apologies - used the wrong disk enclosure (250Gb).  
The 1TB drive still does not boot even after the gpt setting :-(  
Again sorry for giving false hope.  
What else can we try?

@deonlinux I think you should try to narrow down the issue that you see.

-   Can you boot the 1TB device on any other system? (try the mdos, gpt
    and EFI if you have any)
-   Can you create a bootable disk without ReaR and without using LVM,
    preferably with a similar disk layout at ReaR chooses?
-   Does your BIOS offer different ways of accessing the disk (USB hard
    disk, USB floppy), does any of that work?
-   Would the ReaR boot disk boot over another connection like SATA?
    That will also give you a much higher performance.
-   Is there a BIOS update available? Does it help?
-   Do you have an USB2 harddisk enclosure to try? Google seems to show
    a lot of hits on "USB3 boot issues"

Just some ideas of what I would be trying. BTW, restoring 1TB over USB2
will take a while...

Hi Schlomo. I did some further tests:

1.  Using an enclosure from another manufacturer (Coltech, USB3) I get
    the same results with the 1TB drive. Tried gpt as well, same result.
2.  I am trying to locate a USB2 enclosure but it seems they are quite
    scarce here now.
3.  I tried installing Mint 8.1 on the drive. Mint complains with the
    following message: "The partition /dev/sda1 assigned to /boot starts
    at an offset of 3584 bytes from the minimum alignment on the disk
    which will lead to very poor performance." It suggested I go back
    and create a new one which will correct this. Unfortunately it does
    not and whatever I try I cannot move beyond this.
4.  I tried with Ubuntu server 16.04. It does not even detect the USB
    drive as a target to install to. Perhaps it does not allow it, never
    tried Ubuntu in this fashion.
5.  Gparted interestingly says the first 8 Mb is not allocated (sectors
    0 to 16383).
6.  Placing the 1TB drive in the system using the SATA interface the
    device boots.

So, unless I locate an USB2 enclosure I cannot conclude that it is USB3
related. Despite all the technical docs on these enclosures saying the
will work with up to 3TB drives!  
All is not lost. We can swop the drives for 500Gb ones and continue.
Most sites data would fit on it.

I will report back if I have some more news.

If it works with a SATA connection then I would suspect the BIOS in your
server. Can you use SATA instead of USB for your production use case? If
the server has an eSATA connector then I would even recommend that
(although you might have to invest some effort into ensuring that the
recovery happens to the internal disk and not the external one) for
performance reasons.

The alignment errors are likely the result of different tools (parted,
sfdisk ...) used by different distros.

Finally, could it be that you happen to have a [4k
drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Format#How_to_determine_if_HDD_employ_a_4k_sector)?

Yes indeed the Seagate Baracuda 1TB does have 4k sectors.  
I will attempt to reformat the drive manually and see if that fixes it.
We can use SATA directly but that would entail sending a techie out to
the customer site opening the servers and involve downtime of at least 8
hours. Something I was hoping to avoid.  
Today is a public holiday for us so will only test this on Thursday.

Wow, first time ever that I hear about someone with such a drive. Would
be interesting to see if the problem goes away if you find a 1TB drive
with 512b sectors.

If it is really the 4k issue then it might indeed be an issue at the
BIOS level. Does that server also support UEFI? You might have more
success using UEFI boot in such a case.

I have finally managed to obtain an enclosure with a USB2 interface.
.The issue persists so it is definitely related to the 4k issue. Tested
the default and gpt. I am not that familiar with setting up boot
structures on drives. My attempt to format the drive with gparted and
then just copied the different files across did not work. Attempting to
use syslinux to install to the disk fails - it says it needs a FAT
partition. Perhaps there are other methods/cmds I can try? Trying to
understand the rear scripts is mindblowing! Much more complex that I am
used to!

One more thing. The bios does support UEFI but does not offer it for the
drive. I expect it does not detect the drive as being UEFI capable? The
BIOS was updated but the last time Intel released a bios update for this
motherboard was in 2011.
