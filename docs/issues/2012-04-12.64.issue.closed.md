As reported on the mailinglist, iscsi can be supported already by using:

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /var/lib/iscsi /etc/iscsi )
    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" iscsiadm iscsid )
    LIBS=( "${LIBS[@]}" libaio* )

You will also have to edit */etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf* to change the path
to iscsid once you boot the rescue system.

But we would like to include iscsi automatically when used.

I see this tagged as an enhancement request. Any progress in this area,
or additional docs for those who would like to perform a bare-metal
restore of a Linux server attached to iSCSI storage? Thanks for your
help.

Re-open this issue when we found a sponsor to implement this missing
feature
