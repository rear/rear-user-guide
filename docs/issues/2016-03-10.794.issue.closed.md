Hi,

i commented already on issue \#703 but am not sure if anybody will read
that.

REAR version: 1.17.2 (newest deb)  
OS version: Linuxmint Debian (rolling release with latest updates)

Today i wrote a config file like this /etc/rear/site.conf:

> OUTPUT=USB  
> BACKUP\_PROG=rsync  
> BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( '/dev/' '/proc/' '/sys/' '/tmp/' '/run/'
> '/mnt/' '/media/\*' '/lost+found' )  
> BACKUP=NETFS  
> BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( '/' )  
> MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES  
> BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
> GRUB\_RESCUE=1

When the backup finished i found a modified /boot/grub/grub.cfg and a
new entry /etc/grub.d/01\_users.

The output at the end of rear.log on the USB HD (backup medium):

When i booted my computer ALL menu entries in the grub menu were
protected with "username" and "password". When i tried to access an
entry with username "rearadmin" and password "REAR" i get the message

> Failed to boot both default and fallback entries.

Therefore i cannot access any of the different OS entries in my system!

Booting with a rescue CD and removing /etc/grub.d/01\_users and
restoring the backup copy /boot/grub/grub.cfg.old to grub.cfg didn't
help. (Because of a different os on the CD i couldn't chroot and run
grub-config). Only the REAR entry in the Grub menu is removed.

When i read
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords)
i get the impression that something is wrong with the line

> password\_pbkdf2 rearadmin REAR

in /etc/grub.d/01\_users (it should be an encrypted password).

What can I do to get access to my computer again??

According script `/usr/share/rear/output/default/94_grub2_rescue.sh` you
should pass:

    if [[ ! "${GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD:0:11}" == 'grub.pbkdf2' ]]; then
        StopIfError "GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD needs to be set. Run grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 to generate pbkdf2 hash"
    fi

Was this set correctly to a hashed password? Or, what went wrong?

Thank you for your response, gdha.

The newly created /etc/grub.d/01\_users has been:

> \#!/bin/sh  
> cat &lt;&lt;EOF  
> set superusers="rearadmin"  
> password\_pbkdf2 rearadmin REAR  
> EOF

No hashed password

@shoodle I see then the author (@sanderu in ipull request \#589) of the
script made a mistake in the sense when *password\_pbkdf2* is used it
must be a hashed password, or am I wrong?

That is what i read from  
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords\#Password\_Encryption](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords#Password_Encryption)

But for me the main problem is: How can i get rid of the protection of
grub?

Deleting the files as described above did not help.

Ok, i could help myself to restore a not protected Grub with the right
rescue CD.

But i hope nobody else runs into the same problem with a wrong
configuration in REAR.

@shoodle Glad you could resolve it! In the meantime we fixed the issue
