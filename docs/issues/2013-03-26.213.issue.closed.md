If you are referring to the OpenSuse Build Service then I'm afraid you

oh, yes I'm reffering to OpenSuse Build Service....  
I'm not to have a clue from this service, but i need testing the new

Rear is a importend application and the test are importend.  
Without the packages, the test are delayed ;-(
