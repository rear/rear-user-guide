-   Description

Backups fail prematurely due to incorrect target disk size calculations.
As of right now (2.4), the corresponding script (
`backup/RSYNC/default/450_calculate_req_space.sh` ) simply looks at the
`df` output of local partitions, disregarding any excluding items from
the config files. The script doesn't even take into account any
reasonably default locations for partitions;  
e.g. `udisks2` uses `/run/media/username/` to auto-mount trivial
partitions. These should be excluded by default. <s>What's even worse,
there is no way to exclude this at the moment at all, as evidenced by my
attempt to exclude items in `/run/*`</s>. Consequently, rear fails with
errors

    ERROR: Not enough disk space available on remotesrv:/extrdisk/host112 ...

-   Workaround

For the time being, there is an option to exclude these by using the
`EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS()` option in the config file.

@ILMostro  
I am not a `BACKUP=RSYNC` user but I notice  
it seems there are errors in your etc/rear/local.conf

As far as I know `OUTPUT=BACKUP` is not supported in ReaR,  
see "man rear"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE works different,  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

To the actual issue:

In usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/450\_calculate\_req\_space.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/450\_calculate\_req\_space.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/450_calculate_req_space.sh)  
you get the $RSYNC\_PROTO=ssh case.

When you know you have sufficient space you could as another
workaround  
perhaps simply skip that script (add a `return 0` line at its
beginning).

Alternatively you may switch to the $RSYNC\_PROTO=rsync case  
by using a bit different BACKUP\_URL syntax as described in the comments
of  
usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/default/100\_check\_rsync.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/default/100\_check\_rsync.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/default/100_check_rsync.sh)  
that reads (excerpt):

    #### OLD STYLE:
    # BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST:PATH           # using ssh (no rsh)
    #
    # with rsync protocol PATH is a MODULE name defined in remote /etc/rsyncd.conf file
    # BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST::PATH          # using rsync
    # BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using rsync (is not compatible with new style!!!)

    #### NEW STYLE:
    # BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using ssh
    # BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]::/PATH  # using rsync

But that is all from plain looking at the files.  
I am not a `BACKUP=RSYNC` user so I could be wrong.

@ILMostro  
I assume your thumbs up emoji at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2221\#issuecomment-527521698](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2221#issuecomment-527521698)  
means the issue is sufficiently solved for you so that I close it
accordingly.

If you find a more reliably working way how to determine the available
disk space  
we would appreciate a GitHub pull request with such an enhancement from
you.
