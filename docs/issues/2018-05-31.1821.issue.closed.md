Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.00
-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): RHEL 7.3
-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

BACKUP\_PROG=tar  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS="nfsvers=4,nolock"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/var/crash')

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine): HyperV
-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:

Boot from recovery ISO fails! See screen shot...  
[hvxdevrt019 - rear recovery iso fails to
boot.docx](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2058137/hvxdevrt019.-.rear.recovery.iso.fails.to.boot.docx)

Also the rear mkbackup unexpectedly includes libraries from the
application that is installed on the server, installed in file system
/opt/Axway. Entries from rear-hvxdevrt019.log...

/opt/Axway/apigateway/platform/lib/libpcre.so.1 to LIBS  
2018-05-31 11:39:09 Adding required

2018-05-31 11:39:09 Adding required
/opt/Axway/apigateway/platform/lib/libz.so.1.2.5 to LIBS

Is the iso boot failure and the above connected?

Also /opt/Axway which in NOT a file system in vg\_root, is included in
the tar backup! Again which I did not expect. Other none vg\_root files
are not included in the backup. From the log...

-   Work-around, if any:

Unable to work around the boot from iso failure.

Adding "ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( vg\_root )" into local.conf stops the
/opt/Axway file system being included in the tar backup. Didn't expect
to have to do this!

@NevLawrence  
I know nothing at all about HyperV.

In general regarding `Virtual machines`  
and `Recovery medium compatibility`  
you may have a look at those sections in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding your `hvxdevrt019 - rear recovery iso fails to boot.docx`:

It contains (excerpt):

<pre>
/init: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
... Kernel panic ... Attempting to kill init!
</pre>

This indicates your issue is same or similar as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494)  
which is fixed since the ReaR 2.3 release.

Simply put:  
With ReaR before the ReaR 2.3 release  
as soon as some special libraries configuration is used,  
the libraries in the recovery system had been likely inconsistent  
and when a library is involved or missing where init is linked with,  
the recovery system fails to boot with kernel panic because init fails.

For a possible workaround with your ReaR version 2.00 see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494\#issuecomment-330192635](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494#issuecomment-330192635)  
i.e. specify an appropriate

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /directory/of/missing/libraries/ )
</pre>

to get missing libraries into the recovery system  
for example something like

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/ )
</pre>

gets the whole /lib64/ content into the recovery system  
(which makes the recovery system ISO image bigger).

I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in older ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

A request for the future:  
Normally I will not even try to read any kind of proprietary data format
like doc or docx  
(even if it is possible with "monstrous" desktop applications like
LibreOffice).  
If possible provide information in simple and commonly usable file
formats,  
preferably plain ASCII for text only information and JPEG or PNG for
images  
up to even PDF if needed for complex documents.

Accoding to "no news is good news" I assume  
my above analysis was right and this issue is fixed  
when using current ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

Hi Johannes

Thanks for the analysis and apologies for not replying sooner with an
update.  
I have passed the testing of the 2.3 code to a colleague (ccâ€™d) to prove
it fixes our issue.  
We will confirm once tested.

Hi Johannes

we have successfully tested 2.3 and it has resolved the issue.

Thanks for your help.

@NevLawrence  
thanks for your explicit positive feedback.  
It helps (at least me) a lot to have an explicit feedback  
that there is no possibly other still unknown issue in ReaR.
