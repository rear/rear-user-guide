Got the following errors when trying to restore:

Further down in the logs, we saw the following:

The strange thing is that we were able to restore to this same system
and it worked before.

We wanted to add more customization in the Rescue system (original
system) and restore the backup to the same system so we don't know why
it doesn't work anymore.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

@suseusr168  
in your eniesdbd101\_restore.txt there is (excerpt)

<pre>
ERROR: Mount command 'mount /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER /tmp/rear.Ogqve80B29D23eG/outputfs' failed.
Some latest log messages since the last called script 060_mount_NETFS_path.sh:

</pre>

which indicates the root cause is likely a wrong config variable
value,  
probably for the BACKUP\_URL or OUTPUT\_URL config variable  
but I never used BACKUP\_URL=iso://... myself so that  
offhandedly I don't know the right way how to set up this.

The `md5sum: ./dev/.SRC-Semaphore: No such file or directory` can be
ignored  
because it is false alarm.  
I noticed already once such a md5sum failure for a strange file in
/dev/.  
I need to exclude md5sum checking by default for files in /dev/  
cf. "EXCLUDE\_MD5SUM\_VERIFICATION" in
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
how you could exclude such things manually for now.

Meanwhile I think it is not a wrong config variable value  
because in case of the `iso` URL scheme the mount\_url function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh does

<pre>
        (iso)
            if [[ "$WORKFLOW" = "recover" ]]; then
                mount_cmd="mount /dev/disk/by-label/${ISO_VOLID} $mountpoint"
            else
                return 0
            fi
            ;;
</pre>

i.e. the mount command is basically hardcoded  
so that it does not depend on config variable values.

Currently I don't know why `mount` complains in this case  
because usually on can "just mount" an ISO image and the  
filesystem type `iso9660` is autodetected by the mount command  
...  
wait!  
...  
I think I remember something - see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)  
where mounting an ISO in the recovery system failed for me  
with `mount: unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'`.

The reason behind was missing kernel modules in the recovery system.

With ` MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` you get all kernel modules  
into the recovery system to be on the safe side agains possibly  
missing subtle kernel module dependencies, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355)

But on POWER but that may result a too big initrd  
which could cause arbitrary other strange issues there, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724)  
that was also a reason for the md5sum verification

The restore consistently fails on this lpar but using the same rear
backup image on a different lpar works sometimes. I have been successful
in restoring this image to another lpar but if I restart the install to
that same lpar with the same image it will fail. I will attach files for
each scenario. Each file contains a screen capture and the log file
appended to the end. Another anomaly I've found is that the ethernet
adapters are discovered differently during the various attempts at
restoring.

Boot from the same rear backup image to the same destination lpar with
different results

@dewagner1  
an initial question only out of curiosity:  
Do you work together with @suseusr168 on the same system  
or happens your issue on a different system?

Your eniesdbd101\_restore\_fail1.txt contains (excerpts)

</pre>

I.e. when it fails the cause is during "Configuring Relax-and-Recover
rescue system" that  
`ln: failed to create symbolic link '/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER': No such file or directory`  
but currently I don't know what the root cause for that is.

usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh  
contains

<pre>
# On Ubuntu we have received many reports of a missing /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER link
# and therefore during recovery the cdrom was not found automatically - details are in #326

# check if the symbolic link exist? Yes - just return
[[ -h /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER ]] && return

if [[ -h /dev/cdrom ]] ; then
    ln -s  /dev/cdrom /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
elif [[ -b /dev/sr0 ]] ; then
    ln -s /dev/sr0 /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
else
    echo "Did not find a cdrom device. Recover might fail."
fi
</pre>

which points to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326)

O.k. - seems to be just another "udev does not behave consistenty"
issue  
which matches perfectly your observation that it "works sometimes".

For more debugging what exactly happens while 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh
runs  
you would need to run 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh with `set -x` debugging
output.

To run the recovery system setup scripts one by one with `set -x`
debugging output  
you must add in the recovery system boot menue the kernel command line  
option `debug`.

Because you use GRUB2 to boot the recovery system the recovery system  
GRUB2 boot menue seems to be in your eniesdbd101\_restore\_fail1.txt

<pre>
                             GNU GRUB  version 2.02

 |                                                                            |

      Use the ^ and v keys to select which entry is highlighted.
      Press enter to boot the selected OS, `e' to edit the commands
      before booting or `c' for a command-line.
</pre>

where you should be able to use `e` to edit the kernel command line  
and append the option ` debug` to it.

Then during "Configuring Relax-and-Recover rescue system" you need to  
confirm running each recovery system startup script with the Enter key  
and each script would show `set -x` debugging output.

The `set -x` debugging output of the 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh  
should help to find out what the reason is why  
`ln: failed to create symbolic link '/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER': No such file or directory`

From the 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh code it seems the reason is  
that there is neither a /dev/cdrom nor a /dev/sr0 device node.

Perhaps on POWER LPAR the device node where the ISO is attached to  
could be something different (e.g. /dev/sr1 or whatever)?

If there is whatever device node where your ISO is attached to  
on your particular POWER LPAR system, you can manually create  
the missing symbolic link as a workaround before you run "rear recover".

If there is not any device node where your ISO is attached to  
on your particular POWER LPAR system, I don't know what to do.

I am not a POWER user so that I don't know how a POWER LPAR system
behaves  
but @schabrolles is a POWER user and I assume he can explain what goes
on  
in this particular case here.

Yes, we work together. I am trying to clone two systems using rear. I  
have not been able to restore the system that the problem was
originally  
opened for. It fails every time. However, when I tried to restore the  
second system, it worked. So I then tried the second system again and
it  
failed.

Also, the ethernet adapters are numbered differentlly almost everytime
I  
try a restore.

I will try to follow your instructions to gather more information.

I am not at all a networking expert but as far as I know  
one cannot rely on the numbering of traditional network interface
names  
(i.e. eth0 versus eth1) because the network interface numbers  
depend on when each network interface hardware becomes available  
so that eth0 matches those network interface hardware that became  
first available to the kernel and eth1 is the next one and so on.  
In the end it depends on hardware timing randomness, cf.

Correction:  
In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891\#issuecomment-410984210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891#issuecomment-410984210)  
I wrote

<pre>
From the 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh code it seems the reason is
that there is neither a /dev/cdrom nor a /dev/sr0 device node.
</pre>

After a bit closer looking at the code in 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh  
I think now the reason is that there is no /dev/disk/by-label/
directory  
where 'ln' could create the symbolic link
'/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER'  
because I can reproduce it this way:

<pre>
# ln -s /etc/doesnotexist /tmp/doesnotexist/issue
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/tmp/doesnotexist/issue': No such file or directory

# ln -s /etc/doesnotexist /tmp/issue

# file /tmp/issue
/tmp/issue: broken symbolic link to /etc/doesnotexist
</pre>

Currently I have no idea what the root cause is  
when there is no /dev/disk/by-label/ directory.  
I guess it is related to systemd/udev...

We have never seen this behavior using rear 2.1 on sles 11 sp4. The  
ethernet adapters are always consistently eth0 and eth1.

yes, please - we need the debug output to be able to move forward

which means there is a /dev/cdrom  
but it does not show the reason behind why `ln` failed.

Currently I have no good idea what to do next.  
Therefore now only some blind shot in the dark:

@dewagner1  
when you are logged in as root in the recovery system  
(i.e. without running "rear recover"), what do the commands  
`ls -l /dev/disk` and `ls -l /dev/disk/*` show?

If they show nothing, wait one minute and retry.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891\#issuecomment-411025148](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891#issuecomment-411025148)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891\#issuecomment-410996942](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891#issuecomment-410996942)

There is no /dev/disk/by-label/ directory.

And it even indicates that there is not any kernel device node for any
kind of  
CDROM-like device (i.e. a device node where the ReaR ISO image is
attached to).

It seems there are only device nodes for normal disks 'sdX'  
and normal disk partitions 'sdXN'.

@schabrolles  
can you perhaps help here to find the root cause why  
in the running ReaR recovery system there is no device node  
where the ReaR ISO image is attached to.

I am puzzled because the ReaR recovery system was booted  
from an attached ReaR ISO image (i.e. GRUB2 can access it)  
but it seems from within the running ReaR recovery system  
that same ReaR ISO image is no longer accessible.

For comparison how it looks on my KVM x86\_64 system  
from within the running ReaR recovery system see

Ok thanks @dewagner1

As @jsmeix says the issue is mainly the fact that `/dev/disk/by-label`
directory does not exist on your system. So `67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh`
failed to create the link.

If you need to restore your image, you can manually create the directory
`/dev/disk/by-label` and manually create the link
`ln -s /dev/sr0 /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER`.  
Then try a rear recover.

@jsmeix we should be able to make `67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh` a bit
more dynamic by using `blkid` and be sure that `/dev/disk/by-label`
directory is created.

@schabrolles  
do you have an idea why sometimes the /dev/disk/by-label directory is
not created  
and sometimes it is created (when things work) - i.e. why things do not
behave  
consistently (of course except the generic answer that since
systemd/udev  
things do no longer behave consistently ;-)

@dewagner1  
thanks for confrmation how to make "rear recover" work in this case.  
Now we can enhance that 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh to make it work more
fail safe.

FYI:  
You can automate such manual workaround hacks via  
a PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for example in your case something like (untested):

<pre>
PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( 'if ! test -h /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER ; then mkdir -p /dev/disk/by-label ; ln -s /dev/sr0 /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER ; fi' )

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1894](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1894)
merged  
this issue should be sufficiently fixed.

"Sufficiently fixed" means that it cannot magically heal it when in the
recovery system  
there is no block device with filesystem label $ISO\_VOLID
(RELAXRECOVER)  
but now "rear recover" shows a user dialog in this case where the user
can fix things  
(e.g. attach a CDROM with the RELAXRECOVER labeled ReaR ISO).

But when there is a device with filesystem label $ISO\_VOLID
(RELAXRECOVER)  
things repair automatically when the /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
symlink  
does not point to that device or when there is no such symlink.

See

@suseusr168 and @dewagner1

If you like to try out our latest ReaR GitHub upstream code  
that contaions all fixes and enhancements up to now  
on your SLES12-SP3 PPC64LE system:

I provide the latest ReaR GitHub upstream code as of today  
in my RPM package rear23a via the public openSUSE build service  
wherefrom you could download the currently latest built RPM package  
rear23a-2.3.a-2.1.ppc64le.rpm (the RPM release number 2.1 varies) from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/SLE\_12\_SP3/ppc64le/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/SLE_12_SP3/ppc64le/)

Regarding what latest fixes and enhancements  
that rear23a RPM package actually contains  
see at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/rear23a](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/rear23a)  
my rear23a.changes file  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/home:jsmeix/rear23a/rear23a.changes?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:jsmeix/rear23a/rear23a.changes?expand=1)

The openSUSE build service is not an official repository for RPM
packages  
that are officially supported by SUSE for SUSE Linux Enterprise
products  
so that in particular any RPM packages from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/)  
are not officially supported by SUSE, cf.  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:jsmeix](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:jsmeix)

But this way you could right now try out what is intended to become  
the officially provided rear23a package for SLEHA15 SLEHA12 and
SLEHA11  
provided no further serious issues appear with it.

I would very much appreciate it if you try out and test and verify
whether or not  
my currently latest updated rear23a RPM package actually works  
for you on your particular system in your particular environment  
and provide feedback to us here at ReaR upstream.

Many thanks in advance for testing it!

but I still cannot find out what its root cause is, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1883\#issuecomment-409867612](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1883#issuecomment-409867612)

I think as long as GRUB2 can load kernel and recovery system initrd  
(i.e. as long as GRUB2 can boot the recovery system)  
you could ignore that GRUB2 `error: unrecognized number.`

I think to find the root cause of the GRUB2
`error: unrecognized number.`  
a GRUB2 expert who can imagine what each GRUB2 config setting results  
would have to analyze the GRUB2 config of the recovery system  
to (hopefully) find something that is not fully right therein.

But I am not a POWER user and I don't know how booting with GRUB2
happens  
on PPC64LE PowerVM LPAR (in general I am not at all a bootloader
expert)  
so that I cannot really help in this area.
