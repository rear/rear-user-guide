On  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)  
when I click on \[New issue\]  
I do no longer get our  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

Instead I get only an empty input field.

For me the whole GitHub web frontent has a somewhat changed layout  
since some days or since a few weeks - I didn't pay attention when  
it changed because it basically still "just worked" for me,  
except now when I made my first \[New issue\] this year  
some minutes ago.

As the feedback during our ReaR meet-up meetings was positive so far we
can close this issue.
