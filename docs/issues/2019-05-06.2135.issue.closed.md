-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4-snapshots

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): SLES 11 (SP1-SP4) and RHEL/CentOS 5

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): i585 and x86\_64

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
    on **openSUSE Build Service** the rear snapshots fail to build and
    break on the following:

    that level.

Currently only a blind guess:  
Perhaps this is because of the disabled BuildRoot since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2819c071681a19fc3382aa84bfaf1654508a64aa](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2819c071681a19fc3382aa84bfaf1654508a64aa)

My blind guess was incomplete:

Actually both changes in

With disabled

@jsmeix I can confirm that the OBS builds succeeded successfully last
night.

What Linux distributions we build ReaR packages for and  
what Linux distributions we declare as "supported" by ReaR  
are related but different things.

In general we build ReaR packages for more Linux distributions  
than what we declare as "supported" Linux distributions.  
I listed some examples at the end.

I can be discussed if it makes sense to build and provide ReaR
packages  
for Linux distributions that are not also declared as "supported"  
i.e. for Linux distributions where we at ReaR upstream "dropped official
support"  
according to our current ReaR upstream release notes - also avialable
here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L2524](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L2524)  
but the actual source of our release notes is there  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-6.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-6.md)

I think the release notes describe (somewhat indirectly)  
why we build and provide ReaR packages also for  
Linux distributions where we "dropped official support".  
See the release notes starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L2552](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L2552)  
that read (excerpts):

    ReaR-2.6 may still work for SLES 11 and openSUSE Leap 42.x or even earlier
    openSUSE versions but it is no longer sufficiently well tested there so
    arbitrary regressions could appear.

    ReaR 2.6, ReaR-2.5, and ReaR-2.4 (and probably also some earlier versions)
    are known to no longer work reasonably well for the following Linux based
    operating systems:

      o RHEL 5 (and probably also CentOS 5): See issue #1766
      o SLES 9 and 10: See issue #1842

    If you require support for unsupported Linux operating systems you must
    acquire a ReaR support contract.

Neither
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1766](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1766)  
nor
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1842](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1842)  
look hopeless to make latest ReaR work even on older Linux
distributions  
in particular for specific use cases where specific workarounds could
help.

Building and providing ReaR packages also for  
Linux distributions where we "dropped official support"  
it intended to help users with older Linux distributions  
who may need latest ReaR bugfixes or features and  
who can help themselves to adapt newest ReaR to make it  
still work on older Linux distributions as they need it  
in their specific environments.  
And if they cannot can help themselves to adapt ReaR  
to make it work as they need it in their specific environment  
those ReaR upstream authors who offer ReaR support contracts  
could (hopefully) more easily make some money.

Bottom line:  
The idea behind why we build ReaR packages also for  
Linux distributions where we "dropped official support" is  
to make latest ReaR "just available" for older Linux distributions  
so that users who need latest ReaR for older Linux distributions  
can more easily try out how far it works for their specific use cases.

A side note:  
I know that a noticable part of users prefer to have usual packages  
(e.g. RPM packages) instead of what I described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
But I don't know about their reasons behind.  
Perhaps it is because the upstream GitHub master code is a moving
target?  
But one could always checkout a specific git commit to stay at a fixed
state.  
Perhaps it is mostly because they are used to deal with e.g. RPM
packages,  
perhaps in particular in restricted business/managed environments?

Examples where we build ReaR packages for more Linux distributions  
than what we declare as "supported" Linux distributions:
