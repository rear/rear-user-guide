Currently I have no idea how we at ReaR upstream could fix

    ... RPM failed: error: unpacking of archive failed: cpio: Bad magic

which looks like some RPM packaging error of the  
openSUSE build service where that RPM is built.

I see that the first error is

    rpmlib(PayloadIsZstd) <= 5.4.18-1 is needed by rear-2.6-1.ppc64le

and I guess that leads to the `unpacking of archive failed`.

Off the top of my head I don't know hoe to get the missing requirement  
`rpmlib(PayloadIsZstd)` installed.  
In particular I don't know about special things on POWER architecture.

As a workaround you may do what I described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Alternatively (not tested by me) it may work to install that RPM  
built for another architecture (e.g. built for x86\_64) because what you
get  
are only bash scripts (plus documentation) that are not architecture
dependant.

E.g. the RPM from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE\_12\_SP1/x86\_64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_12_SP1/x86_64/)

Note that this RPM is built for SLE12 while in contrast yours is built  
for "latest greatest newest best" openSUSE Factory.

@viper1986 when you `git clone` the ReaR sources you can try to
`make rpm` and see if that works fine... Perhaps OBS has a rpm
requirement it cannot fulfill? If that is the case then the problem is
with OBS, but wait and see if you can build a rpm yourself.

I just make my own RPM package on similar system and try to install on
my target machine.  
Installation is working.

@gdha  
the actual issue as far as I see is that ReaR for SLES12 is not built
for PPC64LE  
so @viper1986 used ReaR from openSUSE Factory where it is built for
PPC64LE  
but the RPM built for openSUSE Factory uses a newer compression method  
that his `rpm` program on SLES12 does not support so unpacking the RPM  
that was built for `rpm` in openSUSE Factory fails with `rpm` on
SLES12.  
Therefore as far as I see the solution is to build ReaR for SLES12 also
for PPC64LE  
so that the built RPM can be unpackaged with the `rpm` program on
SLES12.

@jsmeix According
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE\_12/ppc64le/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_12/ppc64le/)
it is there for quite a while (don't mind the timestamp). I just enabled
PPC64LE on the branch *Rear:Snapshot* for all SLES12 and higher version
too (that was not always the case).

On
[https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
I enabled `ppc64` and `ppc64le` for SLES where possible  
(i.e. where build succeeds for `ppc64` and/or `ppc64le`)  
and now ReaR 2.6. is available for POWER architecture as follows:

    # osc results Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.6 | grep ppc
    openSUSE_Leap_15.2_PowerPC ppc64le    succeeded
    openSUSE_Factory_PowerPC ppc64      succeeded
    openSUSE_Factory_PowerPC ppc64le    succeeded
    SLE_15_SP3           ppc64le    succeeded
    SLE_15_SP2           ppc64le    succeeded

    SLE_12_SP5           ppc64le    succeeded
    SLE_12               ppc64le    succeeded
    SLE_11_SP4           ppc64      succeeded
    PowerKVM_3.1         ppc64le    succeeded
    Fedora_33            ppc64le    succeeded

@viper1986  
the built RPMs for SLES12 PPC64LE are now available at  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE\_12/ppc64le/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_12/ppc64le/)

@gdha  
by the way I simplified / cleaned up the openSUSE and SLE Repositories
at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
e.g. I kept only oldest SLE12 and newest SLE12-SP5  
and removed the other SLE12 service packs in between.  
In the end all `rear` RPMs should install the same files  
so all those different kind of RPMs are mostly "cosmetic"  
except serious exceptions that e.g. some newer RPMs  
cannot be installed on older systems like this issue here.
