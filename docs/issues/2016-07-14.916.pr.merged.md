Check what BACKUP methods are mentioned  
in the form BACKUP=method in default.conf  
and error out when a BACKUP method is not found  
this way in default.conf to ensure that the user cannot  
specify a non-working BACKUP in /etc/rear/local.conf  
and to ensure that each implemented BACKUP method  
is mentioned in default.conf to have a minimum documentation  
about what BACKUP methods are implemented in rear  
see
