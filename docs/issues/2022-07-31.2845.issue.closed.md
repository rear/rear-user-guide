-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I'm unable to perform off-site Borg backup via ssh using ReaR.

I can perform an off-site Borg backup via ssh using Borg.

Using the same remote host, I can perform an off-site ReaR backup
(NETFS) via sshfs. So the remote access via ssh is generally working and
Borg is working on the remote host.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    None at this stage

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

To paste verbatim text like command output or file content,  
include it between a leading and a closing line of three backticks like

So I create the Borg repo and first archive manually to confirm that it
works via Borg

    sudo borg init --encryption=repokey-blake2 bbox3.zeb.net.au:/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site

    sudo borg create --verbose --filter AME --list --stats --show-rc --compression zlib,9 --exclude-caches --progress bbox3.zeb.net.au:/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site::BorgOffsite_1 /home/

I then try creating the next Borg archive via rear, which fails

I am using a non-standard SSH port on the remote host. But I have
updated ssh\_config accordingly, and as a result I don't need to specify
the non-standard port when using Borg directly.

I have also tried using: BORGBACKUP\_PORT=3333 in the conf file, but it
has made no difference

The reason this is failing is not due to the non-standard SSH port as I
changed the config to use port 22 and the behaviour is identical.

Is there a way to configure ReaR to show the Borg command that is being
used?

I think it would be helpful to see the Borg command that ReaR is trying
to execute.

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help with  
Borg backup specific issues.

In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:  
Usually we at ReaR upstream do not use third-party backup tools  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.  
Nevertheless we try to help as good as we can from plain looking at the
code.

The Borg error message

    Borg: Remote: usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] ...

seems to indicate that the executed Borg command  
fails because of a syntax error - in particular because  
the `-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy` therein looks strange  
(but I don't know about Borg command details).

Regarding "show the Borg command that is being used":

Run ReaR in debugscript mode with the '-D' option like

    rear -D mkbackup

See "man rear" - currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

    GLOBAL OPTIONS

    ...

    -d
    debug mode (run many commands verbosely
    with debug messages in log file - also sets -v)

    -D
    debugscript mode (log executed commands
    via 'set -x' - also sets -v and -d)

    ...

    -v
    verbose mode
    (show messages what ReaR is doing on the terminal)

After `rear -D mkbackup` failed  
check the ReaR log file what is shown after the line

    Including prep/BORG/default/300_init_archive.sh

@jsmeix  
Thanks for your advice.

I have been able to identify the issue after obtaining the debug logs.

There were two errors.

If you were to closely compare the following logs, with the previous
logs, you would note a difference in case in part of the path to the
Borg repository. Very annoying. I have fixed that.

However there also appears to be an issue with the ReaR Borg syntax.

Here is the extract from the ReaR logs

The leading "@" in front of the fqdn is the issue.  
@bbox3.zeb.net.au rather than bbox3.zeb.net.au

It seems having a valid BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME set is mandatory.

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
why do you have

    # BORGBACKUP_USERNAME="zen"

i.e. no BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME set?

The 'Borg -&gt; SSH' section in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)  
shows in its 'Example local.conf' (excerpt)

    BACKUP=BORG
    BORGBACKUP_HOST="foo.bar.xy"
    BORGBACKUP_USERNAME="borg_user"
    BORGBACKUP_REPO="/mnt/backup/client"
    BORGBACKUP_REMOTE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/borg"

Regardless that it does not explicitly tell  
what settings are mandatory, but when deviating  
from the syntax in the example and then things  
do no longer work, it becomes clear in practice  
that having a valid BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME set is required.

@jsmeix

I think in this case the example conf file is wrong.

In the section that you refer to you will also notice the following
statement  
*Setup ssh key infrastructure for user that will be running backup.
Issuing following command must work without any password prompts or
remote host identity confirmation*

If you want to make a password-less connection, you don't include a user
in the connection string. And you also need to configure the ssh key,
which I have done. Because Borg is working, password-less, it's just not
working via ReaR

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
the section you refer to reads

    Borg -> SSH

      Setup ssh key infrastructure for user
      that will be running backup. Issuing following
      command must work without any password prompts
      or remote host identity confirmation:

      ssh <BORGBACKUP_USERNAME>@<BORGBACKUP_HOST>

so the documented example is with BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME  
not without it so the documented and implemented functionality  
is using Borg with BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME.

Again:  
I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help  
with Borg backup specific issues.

So if you could contribute to ReaR with a GitHub pull request that  
enhances ReaR to make Borg in ReaR working also password-less  
I would have a look at your pull request and review it  
as good as I can from plain looking at the code  
and if it looks OK I would merge it.

"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in

The only code place where BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME is evaluated is in  
usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100\_set\_vars.sh

    if [[ -n $BORGBACKUP_HOST ]]; then
        borg_dst_dev=ssh://$BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_PORT
    else

so perhaps things might already work for  
password-less Borg backup with something like

    if [[ -n $BORGBACKUP_HOST ]]; then
        if [[ -n $BORGBACKUP_USERNAME ]]; then
            borg_dst_dev=ssh://$BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_PORT
        else
            # To make a password-less ssh connection, you don't include a username
            # in the connection string (i.e. BORGBACKUP_USERNAME is empty)
            # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2845
            borg_dst_dev=ssh://$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_PORT
        fi
    else

(this is only a totally untested offhanded idea).

@jsmeix

I'm willing to look into trying to get this working and then sharing the
necessary updates.

However I'm new to Linux and I still consider myself a newbie.

So I would like to be sure "of the facts" before embarking on this
exercise.

I added the BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME to the conf file as a test, and as I
expected I was then prompted for the user's credentials during the
execution of the script.

However what concerns me is that the ReaR generated Borg list command
still didn't work.

The command that was created was

    borg list ssh://zen@bbox3.zeb.net.au:3333/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site

And on my system that statement still generates an error

On my system, the syntax needs to be

    borg list bbox3.zeb.net.au:/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site

It concerns me that the required Borg syntax is substantially different
to the syntax that is currently being generated, and I'm wondering why?

Because I'm thinking that the Borg code must have been tested by someone
in the past.

Was the existing ReaR Borg code developed/tested with an earlier version
of Borg?

If that is the case, then the issues that I'm observing now could well
make sense. But if ReaR has been developed/tested with Borg 1.2.0, then
I'd like to try and understand why I'm observing all of these issues.

I guess what I'm asking, is it possible to review this issue with one of
the other dev's, to at least sanity check this issue, before I start
look at trying to essentially patch the current release to get it
working with Borg the way that the documentation implies that it should.

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
I think you should experiment with the 'borg\_dst\_dev' setting in  
usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100\_set\_vars.sh

For example as a test you may use a selfmade  
usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100\_set\_vars.sh  
script that contains only (this is the full script):

    borg_set_vars

    borg_dst_dev='bbox3.zeb.net.au:/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site'

i.e. with a hardcoded 'borg\_dst\_dev' setting  
as you need it in your specific case  
only for a test to see how far then  
password-less Borg backup via ssh  
works or still fails for you.

@jsmeix

Tried hard-coding borg\_dst\_dev as suggested

Also removed the following from the conf file

    BORGBACKUP_PORT
    BORGBACKUP_USERNAME  

Quick test produced the following

    + source /usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/300_init_archive.sh
    ++ has_binary borg
    ++ for bin in $@
    ++ type borg
    ++ return 0
    ++ StopIfError 'Could not find Borg binary'
    ++ ((  0 != 0  ))
    ++ borg_additional_options=()
    ++ local borg_additional_options
    ++ is_true no
    ++ case "$1" in
    ++ return 1
    ++ borg_archive_cache_create
    ++ borg_list
    ++ borg list ssh://@bbox3.zeb.net.au:22/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site
    ++ rc=2

So it looks like at least in my case I'll need to identify where
borg\_dst\_dev is being altered.

I'll have a go at that tomorrow

Thanks for your help

As far as I see borg\_dst\_dev is nowhere altered:

    rear.github.master # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs egrep 'borg_dst_dev=|borg_dst_dev+='

    usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100_set_vars.sh:
        borg_dst_dev=ssh://$BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_PORT
    usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100_set_vars.sh:
        borg_dst_dev=$BUILD_DIR/borg_backup

accordingly borg\_dst\_dev is only set in  
usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100\_set\_vars.sh

With some hackery in ReaR  
`return 0` at the beginning of prep/BORG/default/200\_prep\_borg.sh  
and in particular with

    # ln -s /usr/bin/true /usr/bin/borg

I can somewat run ReaR with

    BACKUP=BORG
    BORGBACKUP_HOST="foo.bar.xy"
    BORGBACKUP_USERNAME="borg_user"
    BORGBACKUP_REPO="/mnt/backup/client"

and with a  
usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/100\_set\_vars.sh  
(complete script)

    borg_set_vars
    borg_dst_dev='bbox3.zeb.net.au:/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site'
    return 0

I get

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Exiting rear mkrescue (PID 7757) and its descendant processes ...

    # grep 'borg list ' var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log

@jsmeix

I've got it working by making a few changes as suggested plus some
changes in the conf file.

It's late here now, I'll document tomorrow.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62083231?v=4" width="50">[ZENAdmin-Ops](https://github.com/ZENAdmin-Ops) commented at [2022-08-03 00:20](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2845#issuecomment-1203343535):

@jsmeix

Here are the changes that I made to: 100\_set\_vars.sh

    if [ "$BORGBACKUP_HOST" == "bbox3.zeb.net.au" ]; then 
       borg_dst_dev='bbox3.zeb.net.au:/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site'
    fi

I need to make the setting of borg\_dst\_dev conditional, as I'm also
performing a local Borg backup to a USB device and hardcoding
borg\_dst\_dev broke that configuration

I also needed to change below statement to stop borg\_dst\_dev from
being modified

    if [[ -n $BORGBACKUP_HOST ]]; then
    #    borg_dst_dev=ssh://$BORGBACKUP_USERNAME@$BORGBACKUP_HOST:$BORGBACKUP_PORT
         sleep 1   # do something
    else
        # shellcheck disable=SC2034
        borg_dst_dev=$BUILD_DIR/borg_backup
    fi

The conf file looks like this

    this_file_name=$( basename ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} )
    LOGFILE="$LOG_DIR/rear-$HOSTNAME-$WORKFLOW-${this_file_name%.*}.log"

    BACKUP=BORG
    BORGBACKUP_HOST="bbox3.zeb.net.au"
    # BORGBACKUP_PORT=3333
    # BORGBACKUP_USERNAME="zen"
    # BORGBACKUP_REPO="/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site"
    BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX="BorgOffsite"

    # BORGBACKUP_UMASK="0002"
    BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE="yes"
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/' )

    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_KEEP_DAILY=7
    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_KEEP_WEEKLY=5
    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_KEEP_MONTHLY=13
    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_KEEP_HOURLY=24
    BORGBACKUP_PRUNE_KEEP_YEARLY=2
    BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION="zlib,9"
    BORGBACKUP_ENC_TYPE="keyfile"

    COPY_AS_IS_BORG=( "$ROOT_HOME_DIR/.config/borg/keys/" )
    export BORG_KEYS_DIR=( "$ROOT_HOME_DIR/.config/borg/keys/" )

    export BORG_PASSPHRASE='some secret string'
    export BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="yes"
    export BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="yes"
    # export BORG_REMOTE_PATH="/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site"

The key changes are

    # BORGBACKUP_PORT=3333
    # BORGBACKUP_USERNAME="zen"
    # BORGBACKUP_REPO="/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site"
    # export BORG_REMOTE_PATH="/media/zen/REAR-000/Borg_Off-site"

The BORGBACKUP\_PORT is not specified here, because borg 1.2.0 doesn't
like the ssh port being included in the command string. So to set the
ssh port we use the ssh\_config file which I have shown below.

The BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME is not specified, because we don't want to be
prompted for a password when connecting to the remote borg host.

The BORGBACKUP\_REPO is not specified, because we're now specifying that
in borg\_dst\_dev

We don't export BORG\_REMOTE\_PATH because this was somehow interfering
with borg\_dst\_dev in later ReaR script processing.

ssh keys need to be configured for password-less connection. As part of
that exercise you need to configure: ssh\_config

Here is my ssh\_config file

    Host bbox3.zeb.net.au
            Port 3333
            ServerAliveInterval 15
            IdentityFile /home/zen/.ssh/rear_private_key
            IdentitiesOnly yes

I am using a non-standard SSH port, so here it is set to 3333. By
default, it would be 22.
