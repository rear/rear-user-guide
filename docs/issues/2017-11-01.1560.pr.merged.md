This allows the "broken\_binaries" code to properly detect \*.so files
that have relative paths. Prior to this change, executables which had
relative paths to their \*.so files would result in "not found", thus
adding those executables to the $broken\_binaries array. This caused
problems for one executable in FDR/Upstream version 4.0.

I've tested that this works properly, but I'd appreciate it if somebody
could take a look at the code change and let me know if you see any
problems. This is code that gets used by all ReaR users, not just
FDR/Upstream customers.

@rowens275  
please add an explanatory comment into the code  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so that at any time later others understand why  
that "overcomplicated" looking way via 'bash' is  
needed here instead of "just calling ldd directly",  
cf.

I looked into this more and see I made a mistake. You are correct, it is
over complicated. I was seeing errors that I mistakenly attributed to
the code in 980\_verify\_rootfs.sh.

I have a question. When ldd is run in 980\_verify\_rootfs.sh, any 'not
found' messages cause ReaR to fail with "ERROR: ReaR recovery system in
'/tmp/rear.xxxx/rootfs' not usable". But when ldd is run in
linux-functions.sh, 'not found' messages do not cause failure. Why is
that?

I can modify linux-functions.sh to handle relative paths for ldd, but
since it is only causing error messages and not real failures, I'm not
sure if I should bother.

In general when build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
fails for particular third-party backup software  
(like FDR/Upstream version 4.0 in this case)  
have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533)  
which is the same kind of issue for TSM.

Usually third-party backup software needs special handling  
in ReaR which is in general expected for third-party software.  
I assume also FDR/Upstream needs additional special handling  
since the test in build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh is there.

@rowens275  
I do not yet fully understand what the actual issue is  
because I do not have this issue on my systems  
(probably because I do not use third-party backup software)  
and currently I fail to imagine what goes on on your system.  
Can you provide an example of \*.so files that have relative paths  
on your system together with a 'ldd' output on your system  
with that relative paths.

The old SharedObjectFiles() function had some  
inexplicable additional weird code that called "readlink"  
that I removed in the new RequiredSharedOjects() function, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3973399cbf79c51fb9901ade8039a34740418ef8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3973399cbf79c51fb9901ade8039a34740418ef8)  
because after too mucht time I gave up to try to understand  
what that code does and even more important what the  
reason behind that code could be.  
Perhaps your issue can now explain what the reason  
behind that code was?

Regarding your question:

I used the ldd call in the RequiredSharedOjects() function  
in lib/linux-functions.sh basically as it had been "since ever"  
in ReaR which was before in the SharedObjectFiles() function  
and there the function was copied from mkinitrd off SUSE 9.3  
(I guess it was "just copied as is").

But I do not know the history why those function did not  
error out in case of "not found" shared objects mainly  
because - as usually - there was not any explanatory  
comment WHY that function behaves this way.

I assume it was not intended to error out the whole  
running "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" program  
only because the SharedObjectFiles() function  
detected one single "not found" shared object.

And I agree with that assumtion.  
I.e. I think that also the current RequiredSharedOjects() function  
should not abort the whole "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
only because of a single "not found" shared object.

But both the old SharedObjectFiles() function  
and the new RequiredSharedOjects() function  
report "not found" shared objects in the ReaR log  
so that one can (hopefully) easier debus issues  
with "not found" shared objects.

Reasoning:

In general a function call should not abort its caller program  
unless it is really hopeless to proceed in any way.  
For the fun of it (actually no fun) you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5143](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5143)

In particular the RequiredSharedOjects() function is  
only intended to determine all required shared objects  
but it is not intended to also verify if what it found by  
'ldd' is really all required shared objects so that  
a "not found" shared object by 'ldd' is not a reason  
to assume it is really hopeless to proceed in any way  
because later in the ReaR recovery system that  
by-ldd-not-found-shared-object will be actually missing.

For example the user may know about that special  
by-ldd-not-found-shared-object and get it explicitly  
copied into the ReaR recovery system via an  
appropriate COPY\_AS\_IS config variable, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533)

Therefore to actually verify whether or not there are really  
all required shared objects in the ReaR recovery system  
a well separated test is implemented in  
build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
that can be tuned as needed independent of the  
RequiredSharedOjects() function implementation, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562)

FWIW regarding "well separated":  
I do prefer to Keep Separated Issues Separated ( KSIS ;-)  
cf. RFC 1925 item (5)

Thank you for the detailed response. The by-ldd-not-found-shared-object
in my case is already copied in by COPY\_AS\_IS\_FDRUPSTREAM. So I think
I will not make any changes to linux-functions.sh, and I will simplify
my changes to 980\_verify\_rootfs.sh as you suggested. This will make
ReaR work with FDR/Upstream, but will show some error messages in the
log. That is ok with me.

I can't supply you with a binary without going through an approval
process over here. But I will give you an example of what my original
problem was:

</pre>

Note the three lines which start with ./  
Those are the relative paths I was talking about. ldd works ok if you
are in the /opt/fdrupstream directory. But if you are in another
directory, ldd generates errors:

</pre>

linux-functions.sh logs these 'not found' errors, but does not cause a
failure. 980\_verify\_rootfs.sh, however, logs the errors and does cause
a failure.

I know what I have to do to simplify my fix. What is the best way
forward, git-wise? Do I cancel this pull request and generate a new one,
after I have reverted these changes and made new changes? Or does
updating my InnovationDataProcessing:ldd\_relative\_paths branch
automatically update this pull request?

@rowens275  
many thanks for your explanatory description how  
things look on your system - it helps me so much  
to understand the root cause of this issue!

Accordingly the right way to solve this issue is  
to enhance the 'ldd' test in 980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
and if you provide explanatory comments in  
whatever code you need in 980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
to make it work escpecially with FDR/Upstream  
I look forward to "just accept" your changes  
(provided you did not really break something in ReaR)

OK, changes have been uploaded and I see that the pull request
automatically detects the new changes. (I am relatively new to git, so I
was unsure what to expect).

I re-read your comments. My testing of this code on CentOS 7 shows no
difference whether using --login or not, but I will include it because I
see that it is probably safer that way. Perhaps it will make a
difference on some distributions.

After the 'bash --login -c', is it preferable to specify the full path
to executables or not? Specifically: '...ldd $binary' or '.../bin/ldd
$binary'?

@rowens275  
according to my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862\#issuecomment-274068914](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862#issuecomment-274068914)  
I think in case of 'bash --login -c' one should call executables  
as one would call them in a normal working shell.

One should call programs by their basename without path  
so that calling programs works independent of where each  
particular Linux distribution installs the programs as long as  
the program is in one of the directories in $PATH.

Only special programs where their directory is not in $PATH  
must be called with their full path but that is then also  
the same as one would call such special programs  
in a normal working shell.
