Due to an error when trying to recover, I get a menu giving me several
options, one of which is to view the log. If I try, it gives me an
error. Turns out that it's trying to show me a logfile that has my
server's FQDN instead of shortname.

I think the shortname is what's supposed to be used (conf/default.conf
sets HOSTNAME to "$(hostname -s)"). But it seems
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup has this line:

       (1) less /var/log/rear/rear-`uname -n`.log;;

I think it should be using $HOSTNAME instead of `uname -n`.
