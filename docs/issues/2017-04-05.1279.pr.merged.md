brief description of changes:

Added excludes of SSL private keys in
**/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf**

This code has been tested on RHEL/CentOS where curl has NSS support
`/etc/pki/*`. SLES/opesSUSE and Debian/Ubuntu are ok with not including
(/etc/ssl/private).

@didacog  
Wow! That was fast - in particular with your testing!  
Many thanks for your contribution.

Probably would be nice to document the behavior somewhere, together with
the explanation how to get the private keys back into the rescue media
for those who actually do use client certificates.

In default.conf there is REAR\_CAPATH (added by @didacog )  
where the comment looks as if that one is meant for  
such certificates (but I am not at all a certificates expert).

@jsmeix

Correct, by default`/etc/rear/cert`. There can be stored certs or keys
that should be used by rear.

We store there the DRLM server certificate for HTTPS communication
between ReaR & DRLM:

    # curl --capath $REAR_CAPATH ...
    for keys could be used:
    # curl --key $REAR_CAPATH/key.pem ...

on the other hand, being more purist: `$REAR_KEYPATH=/etc/rear/private`
could be created if required.  
Regards,
