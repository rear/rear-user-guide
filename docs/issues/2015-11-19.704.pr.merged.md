Use wipefs when available to clean up disk partitions  
before creating filesystems there,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/540](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/540)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649\#issuecomment-148725865](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649#issuecomment-148725865)

Currently "when available" means that on has to manually add it  
to the rear recovery system in in /etc/rear/local.conf via  
REQUIRED\_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED\_PROGS\[@\]}" wipefs )

Making wipefs automatically available to the rear recovery system  
when it is available in the original system is a next step.

@jsmeix I leave it up to you when to code is ready to pull into the
upstream. Just thinking why not use a prep script to add `wipefs` to the
`REQUIRED_PROGS` array, or when absent foresee a kind of alternative
function (or script to be added in the `skel` tree)?

@gdha  
regardless that the curent code is not yet feature-complete  
it is ready to be pulled into upstream.

I have tested the current code  
on a SLES12-SP1 KVM/Qemu virtual machine  
with 2.5TB virtual harddisk using SUSE's special 'gpt\_sync\_mbr'  
and SLES12-SP1 default btrfs and xfs for /home

Both "rear --debugscripts xv mkbackup"  
and "rear --debugscripts xv recover"  
still "just work" for me.

I would appreciate if you pull the curent code into upstream.

This particular pull request is done (i.e. "fixed")  
but the whole issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/540](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/540)  
is not yet completely implemented.
