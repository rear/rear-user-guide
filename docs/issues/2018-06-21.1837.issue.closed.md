-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When trying to install the REAR 2.3 rpm for RHEL 5 its not getting
    installed .  
    It requires Genisoimage.  
    There is no package genisoimage available for RH5.  
    Is there any workaround available to make it work.

Error: Missing Dependency: genisoimage is needed by package rear-2.3-185.git.0.d642b65.unknown.el5.i386 (/rear-2.3-185.git.0.d642b65.unknown.el5.i386)
 You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem

I am not a RHEL user but I would ignore that yum error  
(i.e. force yum to install it nevertheless).

What you need is a 'genisoimage' compatible program  
on your RHEL system installed but it does not matter  
from which RPM package name it comes.

A 'genisoimage' compatible program is ususually called during  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" when the ReaR recovery system  
ISO image is made (i.e in case of `OUTPUT=ISO`).

You can specify your particular 'genisoimage' compatible program  
via ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN (see its description in default.conf).

Since

and its  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a3bf4b6e08272f6247e5e8d821c53e9b51b9a8cd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a3bf4b6e08272f6247e5e8d821c53e9b51b9a8cd)  
there is in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)

<pre>
### On RHEL/Fedora the genisoimage packages provides mkisofs
%if %{?centos_version:1}%{?fedora:1}%{?rhel_version:1}0

which is probably incompatible with RHEL5.

@nirmal21s  
what is the RPM package name on RHEL5  
that provides the 'genisoimage' compatible program?

From the above rear.spec excerpt I guess in RHEL5  
the 'genisoimage' compatible program is 'mkisofs'  
and its RPM package name is also 'mkisofs'  
but we need to be sure what there actually is on RHEL5  
(I assume no ReaR developer still uses that somewhat old system).

@nirmal21s @jsmeix Indeed in RHEL5 it was **mkisofs** that was
required.  
To get rear installed on RHEL5 do not use `yum`, but first download
(using `wget`) the rpm and then use the command:

    rpm -Uvh --nodeps rear-2.3-185.git.0.d642b65.unknown.el5.i386.rpm

A last comment about RHEL5 - it is unsupported by RedHat since March
2017, so do not expect any fixes in our rear.spec file for it anymore.
You can still use the latest rear version, but you need to install it
via the work-around given above.  
Therefore, I remove the label 'minor bug' and replace it with
'support/question'

@gdha  
but ReaR still supports RHEL5 because current  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
reads (excerpts):

<pre>
ReaR-2.4 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:
...
* RHEL 5, 6 and 7
...
ReaR-2.4 dropped officially support for the following Linux based operating systems:
...
* RHEL 3 and 4
</pre>

Perhaps we should drop official support for RHEL 5 in Rear 2.4?

@jsmeix We will kick it out in ReaR 2.5 as it is still usable with the
work-around to given above. We can add it in the release notes (as an
add-on).

@gdha  
anything about RHEL is o.k. for me  
(because I am not a RHEL user ;-)

FYI:  
I had dropped official support for SLES 10 ReaR 1.17  
regardless that even current ReaR should still work with it  
because I do not want to get "officially blamed" in any way  
if by some change ReaR may no longer work with SLES10, cf.

I assume with

@gdha  
I tried this option "rpm -Uvh --nodeps
rear-2.3-185.git.0.d642b65.unknown.el5.i386.rpm"  
It got installed and created ISO image.  
But not yet tested.  
Hope this works!
