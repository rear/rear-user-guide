Hello REAR community,

We have VM's running Linux where we need to resize (increase the size)
the /boot partition.

/boot is in /dev/sda1  
LVM disk is /dev/sda2

Our Plan: Create a new VM with a larger root disk and restore the REAR
backup by editing the diskrestore.sh file.

Questions:

1.  In the restore screen rear shell can we enable ssh login? It is very
    difficult to edit files in the VMWARE console. So if we can have a
    way to ssh using putty to this system it will be great.

2.  Can we resize the disk layout and increase the /dev/sda1 using this
    method in the first place?

Thank you,  
Regards,  
Niranjan

Hello Support,

I was able to resize boot using REAR. Wow ... That is something I have
never seen in the past. REAR is great. So I got the answer to my second
question.

@IT-Guy-1973 Answer to the 1st question is defining
`SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD=?????` in your `/etc/rear/local.conf` file. In the
rescue image a **sshd** will be started this variable has been defined.
