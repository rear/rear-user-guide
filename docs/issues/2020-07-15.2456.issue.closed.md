Error during restore from Rescue CD

URL: [https://ibb.co/swPt6FM](https://ibb.co/swPt6FM)

Please check the screenshot. The path is wrong. Lack of R in
RELAXRECOVER name of USB.  
Maybe it is because I've created ISO with backup inside and then use
Rufus to write it to USB.  
For now, I have to do this in that way - I mean save as ISO and write to
USB stick  
instead of writing directly to USB.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Yes, create a hard link between RELAXRECOVE and RELAXRECOVER

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

There are certain length limits for such labels and RELAXRECOVE is 11
characters  
so in your case there is a maximum lenght of 11 characters of that
label.

E.g. "man e2label" tells

    Ext2 volume labels can be at most 16 characters long

same as "man mke2fs".

In contrast "man mkfs.fat" tells

    The volume name can be up to 11 characters long.

So I assume you have a FAT or VFAT filesystem  
where its label can be at most 11 characters long.

Is that possible to change this label in some REAR settings in order to
avoid this issue?

Argh!

@matekubi in your initial  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2456\#issue-657127254](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2456#issue-657127254)  
you had falsely written

    create a hard link between REARRECOVE and REARRECOVER

and I had searched all ReaR files for `REARRECOVER`  
but did not find anything because there is no `REARRECOVER`.

Now I see that it is actually about `RELAXRECOVER`  
and this one exists in the ReaR files

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ doc -type f | xargs grep -l 'RELAXRECOVER'
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/410_restore_backup.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh
    doc/rear-release-notes.txt

In particular usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf even explains  
this issue here:

    # Default ISO label:
    # When the backup is split on multiple ISOs (cf. ISO_MAX_SIZE below)
    # the first ISO 'rear-HOSTNAME.iso' has the label $ISO_VOLID
    # and subsequent ISOs 'rear-HOSTNAME_01.iso' 'rear-HOSTNAME_02.iso' ...
    # get the labels ${ISO_VOLID}_01 ${ISO_VOLID}_02 ... respectively.
    # The default value RELAXRECOVER is too long to fit a FAT32 volume label
    # so that the actual FAT32 volume label on the medium is truncated
    # which lets 'rear recover' fail because ReaR cannot mount it with
    # the RELAXRECOVER volume label so that in case of FAT32 or any other
    # filesystem that only support short volume labels the ISO_VOLID value
    # must be appropriately specified in /etc/rear/local.conf
    ISO_VOLID="RELAXRECOVER"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L665](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L665)

And we have had some issues with that label, for example  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326)  
and in particular (same as this issue here)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565)  
with an explanation why we cannot change such default values  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565\#issuecomment-342449263](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565#issuecomment-342449263)

@matekubi  
right now I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457)  
and I need you to test if that works in actual real world, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457\#issuecomment-658752233](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457#issuecomment-658752233)

To test it replace in your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
the existing `ISO_VOLID="RELAXRECOVER"`  
with `ISO_VOLID="REAR_ISO"`  
and recreate your ReaR ISO via "rear mkbackup" and  
recreate your FAT bootable USB stick exactly as you did before and  
then try out if "rear recover" works with your new created USB stick.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.
