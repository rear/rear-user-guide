-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): rear-2.2
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): rhel6
-   Brief description of the issue:

On RHEL6 systems, the network configuration of the system cannot be
generated properly, typically when bridges are used. This is due to "ip
link" not supporting "bridge" type. In such case "brctl" may be used
instead.  
Also "readlink" only accepts 1 file name on RHEL6, and network devices
do not have "lower\_\*" nodes in /sys/class/net/*<netdev>*/

PR \#1605 fixes all this.  
Sorry for not having noticed that before.
