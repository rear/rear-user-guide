-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19 git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Arch x86\_64
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat

OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/sdb1  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=cifs://192.168.1.4/sys  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS="username=dan,pass=xxxxxxxxxxxx"

-   Brief description of the issue

I have Arch x86\_64 installed onto a single XFS partition on sda1. I
installed rear git from the AUR:

[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/relax-and-recover-git/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/relax-and-recover-git/)

Installation went fine but I noticed the rear PKGBUILD doesn't have
samba as a dep so I also installed samba as I want to backup and restore
to/from a cifs share so I presumed samba would be required. The rear
format, mkrescue and mkbackuponly commands all seemed to work fine under
Arch so after backing up I formatted my HD.

My recovery USB stick booted OK but when it came to recovery, rear
failed using both the manual and auto recovery modes as it seemed to be
unable to mount the samba share. Note that this is exactly the same
samba share that I managed to recover (mostly) Ubuntu MATE from last
week. I have attached screenshots of the errors.

Although I've not properly investigated this yet nor do I really have
anything to back up my hypothesis, I suspect this mount error will be
caused because either samba isn't being installed onto the recovery USB
drive or it isn't getting started successfully in time for the mount
command but I'm just guessing.

@danboid  
First, I really love your screenshots :-)  
In
[screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1429783/20388341/42cbc698-acbc-11e6-8066-ddd793f88865.jpg)
you have `mount error (101): network is unreachable`.  
So my best guess is that ReaR recovery system failed to setup network
(it can happen now and then).  
So executing
`ifconfig <network_device_name> inet <ip_address> netmask <netmak>` and
`rear recover` should help.

Hi Vlad!

Glad you like the screenshots! :)

I'll try that ifconfig command when I get home. I only tried booting the
recovery USB and restoring twice but bringing up the network must've
failed on both attempts because both auto and manual recovery failed.

If the ifconfig command fixes recover, could some code be added to rear
somewhere to make bringing up NICs more reliable under Arch? Activating
interfaces seems to work OK for Ubuntu.

Hello @danboid,  
If manual bring up devices helps, check \#951 especially
[comment](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/951#issuecomment-239210196)
about NETWORKING\_SETUP\_COMMANDS option ...  
It might help you to setup network manually when automatic setup fails.

Note that during development I had renamed  
NETWORKING\_SETUP\_COMMANDS into  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS

In general see  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for what can be set in a particular ReaR version.

Woohoo!

I just did my first successful rear recovery and it was Arch on XFS via
Samba using the above config.

All I had to do was boot the recovery USB in manual recovery mode then
run:

`dhcpcd eth0`  
`rear -v recover`

I'd like to change this bug report into a feature request / suggestion.
There should be no need for me to have to add `dhcpcd eth0` into the
local.conf options because I expected rear to assign itself an address
on eth0 via DHCP when I chose automatic recovery. Instead, DHCP should
be used, just on eth0, by default in the auto recovery mode and a new
option should be added to prevent DHCP via eth0 if thats not what you
want but I imagine most users will be using DHCP and would appreciate
this.

Congrats @danboid to your successful restore!  
I wish you least number of OS restores in life as possible.  
I'm not using dhcp much, but reading
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

    # Say "y", "Yes" (or any not empty string) to enable the DHCP client protocol
    # which lets the rescue/recovery system run dhclient to get an IP address
    # instead of using the same IP address as the original system:
    USE_DHCLIENT=

So maybe try to set USE\_DHCLIENT=yes in your */etc/rear/local.conf*

Or `NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS="dhcpcd eth0"` should work fine as
well.

Hi Vlad

I knew there was at least one way to activate DHCP in local.conf but why
is it that Ubuntu MATE's auto-restore worked (I was assigned an address)
whilst with Arch I had to run dhcp manually? With both OSs I was using
DHCP before running `rear mkbackup` and I used the same config file,
same router/DHCP server and same samba server for both. Hence its only
logical I should expect rear to act the same with both distros.

I can be certain its not a case of missing software from the recovery
disk now. Maybe Ubuntu defaults to USE\_DHCLIENT=yes whilst Arch
defaults to USE\_DHCLIENT=no?

Might as well close this now.

I may open another ticket if there is irregular DHCP behaviour going on
when recovering different distros.

@danboid  
in general do not expect too much automated magic from ReaR,  
cf. the section "Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

What I use on my SUSE systems is (in local.conf)

<pre>
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

which makes network setup via DHCP plus  
remote access via ssh "just work" for me, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)  
and the sub-section "First steps with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

When things in ReaR do not work o.k. for you with  
your particular system in your particular environment,  
see the sub-sections  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover",  
"How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover", and  
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If you like to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover  
in particular for Ubuntu and Arch Linux, have a look at

I thought I should give a quick update to say that I gave rear another
go with Arch last night using the following local.conf:

    # Create a USB recovery drive
    OUTPUT=USB
    # Be sure to set the device correctly!
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdb1
    BACKUP=NETFS
    # Path to the samba share
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.168.1.4/sys
    # Username and password of a samba/AD user with access to the share
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="username=dan,pass=xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    # Use DHCP to get an address before recovery
    USE_DHCLIENT=yes

Thanks to using `USE_DHCLIENT=yes` this time, auto recovery mode 'just
worked' - yay!

I'd like to see my commented config added as an example that comes
included with the rear sources because none of the included examples use
USB for the recovery device or a samba share as the backup target. I
would call the file USB-and-samba-example.conf

I should've mentioned it before but the rear man page recommends using a
credentials file for using samba shares but I failed to get that to
work, hence why I had to give the username and password in the backup
options.

@danboid if you want to add your config to ReaR upstream, easiest way
(IMHO) is to create pull request ...

I tidied up my config a bit, made it more generic, improved the comments
and submitted a pull request.
