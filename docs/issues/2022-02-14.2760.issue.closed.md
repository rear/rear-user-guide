-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

`ERROR: Not enough disk space available ...`  
on RSYNC target server

I need to backup only a few FS with max capacity 15 GB  
On target i have 45 GB free space  
How can i set the rear to ignore calculate ALL local space ?  
so only the desired FS can be copied not all the server

-   Workaround, if any: No

I am not a RHEL user so I cannot comment on RHEL specific issues.  
If you have a support contract with Red Hat you may better ask there.

In general (regardless that this issue is about RHEL) you may have a
look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover"

@jsmeix  
thank you for your answer ,  
my question was not related to space specifically  
When I run the backup the exact data I choose to backup is 14 GB  
The target server directory have 45 GB ( enough space for backup )  
the rear application is calculating all VG space ( used and not used :
14 GB used and 114 GB not used )  
Please how can I set the rear config file to check only space used
really and not all the VG ?

Thank you

@ramadan222 See script
`/backup/RSYNC/default/450_calculate_req_space.sh` where the magic
happens. You could replace `StopIfError` with `LogPrintError` and that's
it. Or, introduce a variable in the default.conf file to skip the error
in this script. You may propose a pull request for this and we will
guide you ;-)

I had also the same problem with `Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git` on my
openSUSE 15.3:

    Estimated size of local file systems is 1924210 MB
    Calculating size of localhost:/automnt/external_2tb/rear/
    Not enough disk space available on localhost:/automnt/external_2tb/rear/ (1952558172 < 1970391348)

With this `site.conf`:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=rsync://root@localhost/automnt/external_2tb/iso/
    BACKUP=RSYNC
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://root@localhost/automnt/external_2tb/rear/
    ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/' '/boot/efi' '/boot/grub2/i386-pc' '/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi' '/home' '/home/birgit/.VirtualBox' '/home/thomas/.VirtualBox' '/home/thomas/MediathekView' '/home/thomas/Music' '/opt' '/srv' '/usr/local' '/var/cache' '/var/crash' '/var/lib/libvirt/images' '/var/lib/machines' '/var/lib/mailman' '/var/lib/mariadb' '/var/lib/mysql' '/var/lib/named' '/var/lib/pgsql' '/var/log' '/var/opt' '/var/spool' '/var/tmp')
    BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE="yes"

All my filesystems/partitions have this size in M (not all are included
in rear-backup!):

    /dev/sda1 | 5
    /dev/sda3 | 66665
    /dev/sda5 | 195141
    /dev/sdb1 | 1156521
    /dev/sdc1 | 34
    /dev/sdc10 | 39080
    /dev/sdc2 | 137
    /dev/sdc3 | 1369
    /dev/sdc4 | 10
    /dev/sdc5 | 10
    /dev/sdc6 | 10
    /dev/sdc7 | 54096
    /dev/sdc8 | 55206
    /dev/sdc9 | 314128

765G are available on my backup-medium, my backup-data on backup-medium
is currently 1.1T overall. But not all data must be backupped "on top"
on every run! So this should really not stop ReaR from working. A
warning should be enough in my opinion. Every backup-"admin" should take
care to have enough backup-(free-)space available. Or is the calculation
misleading because 1.1 T is the maximum amount to be backupped because
this are already 1.1 T backupped and 765 G still are free. I really
don't have sooooo much changes/updates (100s of G) every day on my home
computer 😲

So, what's the problem for ReaR? 🤔

This would be good enough as a "plan b". But this won't fix the root
cause.

*Update:  
After the "Fix" in 450\_calculate\_req\_space.sh there's still 762G
(before: 765G) available after a successfull backup on my
backup-medium.*

like a "bug" 🐛

I am not a rsync user so cannot comment on rsync specific issues.

I like to make only a general comment regarding things as in  
backup/RSYNC/default/450\_calculate\_req\_space.sh

As far as I see we do not do such tests for other backup methods  
(i.e. whether or not there is enough space where the backup will be
stored)  
so I wonder why we do it for BACKUP=RSYNC  
(but then only when RSYNC\_PROTO is 'ssh').

In general regarding ReaR and backup methods see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Accordingly I suggest to drop the whole  
backup/RSYNC/default/450\_calculate\_req\_space.sh  
script and leave it to the user to ensure there is enough space  
where the backup will be stored in his particular case  
as we do it for all other backup methods.

Again: I am not a rsync user so cannot comment on rsync specific
issues  
so things would be different if there is a reason why BACKUP=RSYNC  
requires to have such a test in ReaR.

I think we are missing a PR or do you @jsmeix take care of this being
taken out of the right scripts? Both would be fine for me, but before
making a PR I wait for an answer from you. Thanks a lot so long.

According to

    # git log --follow -p usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/450_calculate_req_space.sh

the script backup/RSYNC/default/450\_calculate\_req\_space.sh  
originated by @gdha via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2e226ebaec332200ced582f091d025e43b2f84c5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2e226ebaec332200ced582f091d025e43b2f84c5)  
so it is @gdha who should decide here.

merged  
this issue should be avoided so I consider this issue to be done.

@gdha , can you also be make this RPM available for/in
[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/openSUSE\_Leap\_15.3/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/)
?

I'm stuck with this version:

And a downloaded version from CentOS repo won't work:

@thomasmerz There is a RPM available under
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/openSUSE\_Leap\_15.3/x86\_64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/x86_64/)
I see and I was able to download it.

TL;DR:  
there has been a bogus version in previous version(s) which made me
curios:

    🦎🖥  thomas@merz-nimbus:~/Downloads [0/1595]

vs. your newly added version:

"Version: 1625557278.1053e0e5" seems to be totally nonsense. I used the
"--oldpackage" parameter with "zypper install" and tested:

Currently I'm far away from running out of disk space, so I couldn't
provoke this message before (and even after), but **rear ran fine
without any errors or anomalies and as good as it did before** 👍🏻

@gdha thanks, I believe that commenting out the code was a good idea, I
prefer to avoid such special code that assumes one can ssh to the rsync
server, if possible.
