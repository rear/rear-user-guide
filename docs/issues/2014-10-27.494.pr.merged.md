hi:  
this patch fix two problems:

1.  drbd use /dev/vg/lv device as backend. with enhanced
    get\_device\_name function it can translate correctly to
    /dev/mapper/vg-lv
2.  it can handle multiple volumes with single resource correctly. and
    still maintain compatibility with older drbd versions which didn't
    know anything about volumes. to maintain compatibility the layout is
    not perfect but workable.
