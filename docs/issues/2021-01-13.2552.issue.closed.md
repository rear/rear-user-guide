-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.6

In certain cases REAR backup might fail while propagating the the EFI
boot partition contents:

    [..]
    cp: error writing '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/elilo.conf': No space left on device
    '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/mnt/./EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg' -> '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg'
    cp: error writing '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg': No space left on device
    '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/mnt/./EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg' -> '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg'
    cp: error writing '/tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg': No space left on device
    umount: /tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA/tmp/efi_virt (/dev/loop1) unmounted

The cause for the issue seems to be the calculated amount of the of EFI
virtual image blocks as done in:

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh
    [..]
    efi_img_sz=( $( du --block-size=32M --summarize $TMP_DIR/mnt ) )
    [..]

The Amount of blocks here is calculated to small for the data to fit in:

For more Detail:

    du --summarize --block-size=32M tmp/mnt
    7       tmp/mnt
    /tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA # du --summarize tmp/mnt
    229348  tmp/mnt
    /tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA # echo $((7 * 32 * 1024))
    229376
    /tmp/rear.PXM8Jei7m8TJjSA # echo $((229376 - 229348))
    28

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh

should probably check if the amount of blocks that is used is enough for
the data to  
to be stored and if not, allocate another block?

Or would it be save to allocate one block more, just for safety
($efi\_img\_sz++)  
I lack required information about UEFI/EFI if this could cause any
issues.

im happy to provide PR, but i dont know about the background. Is it of
any issue if the image size is just one block bigger? If not, the fix
would be quite simple.

@abbbi As long we do not go beyond the borderies I'm ok with that.  
@jsmeix @gozora What is your opinion on this matter?

Hey @gdha,

Surprisingly I've faced similar issue on couple (maybe 10-15 out of
~1000) of my servers.  
This issue seems to hit systems with certain size of *$TMP\_DIR/mnt.*  
I did not had time to investigate this issue further so I just applied
"the rule of thumb" and applied quick and dirty patch:

    # diff -ruNp /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/70_create_efibootimg.sh /repository/custom/rear/70_create_efibootimg.sh

    @@ -8,7 +8,8 @@ is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return
     # The du output is stored in an artificial bash array

At first I've suspected some timing issue so I've added `sleep 5`. But I
guess it is not necessary for this workaround.

Hope it helps.

@gozora  
as far as I understand (as EFI noob) it your workaround in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2552\#issuecomment-769757174](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2552#issuecomment-769757174)

    efi_img_sz=$(( $( du --block-size=32M --summarize $TMP_DIR/mnt | awk '{print $1}' ) + 2 ))

by adding 2 more 32MiB blocks in any case aswers the question from

Hello @jsmeix

> "Is it of any issue if the image size is just one block bigger?"

It is some time since I've dealt with this issue, but I guess I've added
2 blocks, just to be on safe site ;-).

I proposed
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2562](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2562)

@abbbi  
could you test if the change in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2562](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2562)  
works for you?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2562](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2562)
merged this issue should be avoided.

@abbbi  
thank you for your issue report and for your analysis  
of the exact code part where things failed.
