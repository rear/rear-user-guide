I'm pretty confident in saying that the philosophy of the rear devs is
that rear should be as easy to use as possible and operate in the most
obvious and straightforward way, which is why I decided to file this
rather nitpicky suggestion regarding the first menu the user is
presented with when they run `rear recover`.

I would expect that the most common use case for rear is when a user is
restoring a backup onto the same machine with the same (disk) config
versus restoring the backup onto the same machine with a slightly
different disk config or another machine entirely. I would imagine this
is how it gets used the majority of the time and so in that case, when
the user is restoring a rear backup onto the same machine with the same
disk config, the option they most likely want to pick from the first
`rear recover` menu is awkwardly option \#2, "Confirm identical disk
mapping and proceed without manual configuration" so my first suggestion
is that this should be moved to option \#1 because its the most likely
option the user wants and so should logically be the first suggestion
and menu item, ie the "default" option.

Another reason I'm suggesting this tweak is that I presumed option 1 was
what I should be using on my first few goes with rear and not only does
option 1 make `rear recover` more complicated than it needs to be in
most cases, it doesn't currently doesn't work for me and so I'll be
opening a separate ticket for that.

My other suggested tweak for this menu is changing the wording of what
is currently the first option (which I think should be the second
option)- "Confirm disk mapping and continue `rear recover`". What does
"continue rear recover" mean to the new user? Not very much. How does
this option differ from ""Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed
without manual configuration" - it is not made clear from the options
current label. I think this option should be called something more like
"Confirm disk mapping and configure recovery options."

I think you are talking about the user dialog  
which looks like

    Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    n/a
    Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    Abort 'rear recover'

or

    Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration
    Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    Abort 'rear recover'

This dialog is implemented in  
layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
which is in our current GitHub master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh)

This dialog only appears in so called "migration mode"  
because the whole layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
script is skipped if not in migration mode

    # Skip if not in migration mode:
    is_true "$MIGRATION_MODE" || return 0

The second choice of this dialog

    Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration

only appears when in migration mode ReaR autodetects  
that the proposed disk mapping is an identical mapping  
for example like

    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/sda => /dev/sda
      /dev/sdb => /dev/sdb
      /dev/sdc => /dev/sdc

in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh via

        is_completely_identical_layout_mapping && choices[1]="Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration" || choices[1]="n/a"

where the is\_completely\_identical\_layout\_mapping function  
in lib/layout-functions.sh only checks that  
in /var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings  
all syntactically valid lines have  
same "source" and "target" disks.

This means the is\_completely\_identical\_layout\_mapping function  
returns 'true' when no disks get interchanged by the mapping.  
For example in

    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/sda => /dev/sda
      /dev/sdb => /dev/sdc
      /dev/sdc => /dev/sdb

/dev/sdb and /dev/sdc get interchanged by the mapping.

BUT:

When no disks get interchanged by the mapping  
it does not mean that  
all target disks on the replacement hardware  
(i.e. on the hardware where "rear recover" is running)  
are identical compared to each source disk  
on the original system (where "rear mkbackup" was run).

In other words:  
When no disks get interchanged by the mapping  
it does not mean that nothing is migrated  
(i.e. it does not mean "all is the same")  
which matches that this dialog only appears  
in "migration mode" (i.e. the mode when  
something has changed regarding the disks).

The usual cases when in "migration mode"  
no disks get interchanged by the mapping  
is that some disk size(s) changed like

      /dev/sda 110 GiB => /dev/sda 110 GiB
      /dev/sdb 120 GiB => /dev/sdb 120 GiB
      /dev/sdc 130 GiB => /dev/sdc 131 GiB

or when there are several target disks with same size like

      /dev/sda 110 GiB => /dev/sda 110 GiB
      /dev/sdb 120 GiB => /dev/sdb 120 GiB
      /dev/sdc 120 GiB => /dev/sdc 120 GiB

The difference between

    Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'

and

    Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration

is that after

    Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'

several subsequent "migration mode" user dialogs appear  
while after

    Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration

those subsequent "migration mode" user dialogs do not appear  
in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh via

        case "$choice" in
    ...
            (${choices[1]})
                if is_completely_identical_layout_mapping ; then
                    # Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration:
                    MIGRATION_MODE='false'

i.e.  
after

    Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration

the "migration mode" is switched off.

@danboid  
personally (I cannot speak for other ReaR developers)  
I would like to ask you to avoid "well intentioned advice" like

    rear should be as easy to use as possible and
    operate in the most obvious and straightforward way

My personal reasoning:

Personally I feel a bit treated as if I was an idiot  
when someone tells me such things because of course  
I do not intend to make ReaR so that it is hard to use or  
that it operates in obscure ways in a roundabout fashion.

BUT:

Often (basically always from my personal experience)  
what is the obvious and straightforward way  
from an end-user point of view  
becomes a maze of traps and snakepits  
when one implements it because at code level  
"obvious intents" are no longer obvious to implement.

From my personal experience the general root cause is  
that there are too many cases "out there in the wild"  
so there is no such thing as "the use case" and  
accordingly there is no such thing as "the implementation".

Surely the use case / purpose for rear is backing up and restoring Linux
based systems? That's what it is supposed to do right? If I'm mistaken
then please correct me.

Given that migration mode is often a source of problems, to me it also
seems preferable to offer the option that leads to switching it off,
i.e.
`Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration`,
as the default. The question is, when this is not present (because the
disk mapping is not identical), the default must be something else - is
that ok?

Yes, that makes perfect sense to me.

@pcahyna  
I disagree with your reasoning.  
Perhaps I misunderstand what you meant?

My arguments:

(1)  
Regarding "migration mode is often a source of problems":

As far as I implemented it (or at least I tried to implement it)  
migration mode is never the actual source of a problem.  
Actually it is the opposite:  
Because of a "source of a problem" ReaR enters migration mode  
and ReaR enters migration mode to give the user the chance  
to avoid bad consequences because of the actual problem.

(2)  
Switching migration mode off by some automatism would be  
a contradiction in itself because when ReaR enters migration mode  
there is a "source of a problem" so switching migration mode off  
means to ignore that "source of a problem" by some automatism.

(3)  
Switching migration mode off by some automatism would be  
in itself a source of possibly severe and fatal problems.

Did you understand that an identical disk mapping  
does not mean "all disks are same as on the original system"?

The standard example where  
"Confirm identical disk mapping and 'just proceed'"  
leads to a final disaster is:

-   Original virtual machine with 20GiB virtual disk /dev/sda  
    for the system plus additionally attached 20GiB  
    virtual disk /dev/sdb for ReaR with OUTPUT=USB.

-   Replacement virtual machine with 20GiB virtual disk  
    for the system plus the above 20GiB ReaR disk.

When on the replacement virtual machine  
the virtual disk for the system is /dev/sda  
and the ReaR disk is /dev/sdb  
all is well.

BUT:

When on the replacement virtual machine  
the virtual disk for the system is /dev/sdb  
and the ReaR disk is /dev/sda  
then  
"Confirm identical disk mapping and 'just proceed'"  
will recreate (the storage layout) on the ReaR disk  
which leads to a final disaster  
by destroying the backup on the ReaR disk  
unless WRITE\_PROTECTED\_IDS (fortunately) avoids it.

In migration mode I would prefer to not rely blindly  
on even more automatisms like WRITE\_PROTECTED\_IDS.

Instead in migration mode I prefer explicit user confirmation  
on which disk "rear recover" will recreate, in particular  
for cases like

    Ambiguous disk layout needs manual configuration
    (more than one disk with same size used in '.../disklayout.conf')

    Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration
    (more than one with same size found)

cf. layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh

(4)  
A generic note:

Recently I see more often that the wish appears here  
to make ReaR again "bindly proceed automatically"  
which was how ReaR had behaved about 10 years ago  
when I became acquainted with ReaR.  
At that time my personal user experience was horrible.

Since that time I worked primarily to make ReaR behave better  
(primarily more fail-safe) for SUSE's ReaR users who are  
experienced system admins at SUSE customers  
who in the end pay my salary.

I assume also Red Hat customers prefer when ReaR  
behaves by default fail-safe (as far as possible  
with reasonable effort).

As far as I see things work OK for me  
with automated user input via

    USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS="2"

I had a 20 GiB sda system disk  
and an empty (unused) 1GiB sdb disk on the original machine.

The original machine and the replacement machine are VMs.

I did one test with a 20 GiB sda and 1 GiB sdb  
plus an additional 20 GiB sdc on a replacement machine  
so there is an identical disk mapping  
/dev/sda 20 GiB =&gt; /dev/sda 20 GiB
