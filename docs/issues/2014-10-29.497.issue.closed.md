indeed `/mnt/local/var` does not exist on the target volume. This is the

hi,

on a closer look im missing the mount command with the subvol ID after
creating the subvolume vor var/tmp/, doing it this way on the command
line:

    rear> btrfs subvolume list /mnt/local/var/tmp/
    ID 257 gen 10 top level 5 path .snapshots
    ID 259 gen 11 top level 5 path var/tmp
    rear>  mount -o subvolid=259 /dev/sda2 /mnt/local/var/tmp/

works out.

also creating the next volume works out just fine:

    rear> btrfs subvolume create /mnt/local/var/spool
    Create subvolume '/mnt/local/var/spool'
    rear> btrfs_id=$(btrfs subvolume list /mnt/local/var/spool | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}')
    rear> mountopts=" -o subvolid=${btrfs_id}"
    rear> mount$mountopts /dev/sda2 /mnt/local/var/spool

could this be some kind of timing issue?

Nor rear 1.16.1 nor the github version of rear support currently the
btrfs filesystem on SLES12.  
However, in the meantime ('till support has been added and tested into
the mainstream track of rear) you could use
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/rear116](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/rear116)
version of SuSe. However, bear in mind, if you have problems with
rear116 version do not submit an issue with the original rear
maintainers as you're using a fork of rear.

The RPM package rear116 from my openSUSE build service home project
home:jsmeix contains a SLE12-btrfs-example.conf file (that gets
installed as /usr/share/rear/conf/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf). Use this as
starting point for your /etc/rear/local.conf file. Furthermore regarding
btrfs in general and the sophisticated btrfs structure on SLE12 see
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
there in particular the "Fundamentals about Relax-and-Recover
presentation PDF".

I think that I could change my adaptions and enhancements for the
sophisticated btrfs structure on SLE12 in

[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/home:jsmeix/rear116/adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:jsmeix/rear116/adaptions_for_btrfs_for_SLE12.diff)

into something that works generically for any btrfs structure.

As far as I see the only thing that I used which makes my current
adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff specific for SLE12 is that I used
the SLE12 btrfs default subvolume name '/@' in a hardcoded way.

If I could change it to deal with the btrfs default subvolume in a
generic way, I hope it could work for any btrfs structure.

I think there is nothing really special regarding btrfs on SLE12. I
assume such kind of sophisticated btrfs structure as on SLE12 could be
also created with any other recent Linux distribution.

Therefore I think it would not work well when for each Linux
distribution there is separated code that deals with btrfs.

When time permits I will try to change my current btrfs stuff for SLE12
into a more generic way how to deal with btrfs.

But first of all there is Christmas time... ;-)

Hi Johannes,

thanks a lot - I think that you really know a lot about btrfs. Maybe
you  
can make the SUSE-style subvolume structure optional - and the /@ part  
configurable? That way also simple btrfs setups would work.

Kind Regards,  
Schlomo

Also have a look at issue \#233 as I've taken out the mount part
(containing the btrfs specific points) out of the
`usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13_include_filesystem_code.sh`
script and moved it into
`layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13_include_mount_filesystem_code.sh`

The /@ part does not need to be configurable.

The '/@' is just the default btrfs subvolume. Any btrfs has a default
subvolume - the one that gets mounted by default when no subvolume is
specified when mounting a btrfs. Usually the default subvolume is the
btrfs root (called "FS\_TREE" by btrfs).

I think (and hope) that all I need is generic support for any btrfs
default subvolume.

Because openSUSE 13.2 has the usual btrfs subvolume, my current
adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff cannot work there which is a good
reason for me to clean it up so that is also works on openSUSE.

FYI:  
Yes - unfortunately I had to learn something about btrfs the hard way -
by trial and error :-( which means I am not a real btrfs expert - only
one who had learned something about it...

Gratien,

I cannot estimate when I have time for it - any customer issues always
come first (in particular any printing issues - my main working area).

Therefore do not wait for me. Just release when it can be released.

My personal gut feeling is that it will take a longer time until btrfs
is really well supported.

FYI:  
btrfs subvolumes can be nested:

E.g. on openSUSE 13.2:

As far as I know my current adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff even
supports nested subvolumes which means the higher-level subvolumes must
be created first, then the nested subvolumes...

Interestingly my current adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff even
works correctly for nested subvolumes that are not mounted:

On the original SLES12 system a /usr/local/mysubsubvol is created (it is
nested in the /usr/local subvolume) but it is not mounted:

<pre>
# btrfs subvolume create /usr/local/mysubsubvol
Create subvolume '/usr/local/mysubsubvol'
# echo mysubsubvol >/usr/local/mysubsubvol/mysubsubvol.echo

In the disklayout.conf output above the long first btrfs line is folded
and the other disabled btrfs lines are cut.

During "rear recover" the "mysubsubvol" will be created and mounted in
the rear recovery system because my current

Currently I don't know if it also works when not all subvolumes are
mounted in the rear recovery system. Perhaps all subvolumes must be
mounted so that the files can be restored there.

After rebooting in the recovered system it is no longer mounted:

The subvolume IDs are different in the recreated system but this should
be o.k. because the btrfs subvolume structure is the same - except there
are admins who use the subvolume ID in selfmade scripts or programs that
store subvolume IDs somewhere.

The above example shows that I cannot keep the subvolume IDs in gerenal
because I cannot recreate the snapshot subvolumes so that the ID of the
in the original system late created mysubsubvol cannot be the same in
the recovered systems where mysubsubvol is created at system install
time.

But I could perhaps keep the subvol IDs of those subvols that are
created during system install time of the original system to mitigate
possibly unexpected bad side-effects when subvol IDs are different in
the recreated system.

Gratien, Schlomo,

the more I think about it how to cleanly implememt it the more I would
like to really clean it up by introducing a new type of component called
"btrfs" or "btrfssubvol" in the disklayout.conf file.

Reason:

A current "fs /dev/sda2 / btrfs ..." entry in disklayout.conf has the
"fs"="filesystem" component type and that means in compliance with all
other "fs" entries a whole btrfs filesystem and not a subvolume of a
btrfs filesystem.

In my opinion mixing up whole filesystems with parts of whole
filesystems (a.k.a. subvolumes in case of btrfs) in one same component
type "fs" leads to an endless mess of awkward workaround-like code that
nobody understands and nobody can maintain (of course except the one
magician who made such code ;-)

If you agree to introduce a new component type to deal with btrfs
subvolumes, I would like to get some general advice from you, how I
should make it - in particular what scripts I should first and foremost
adapt when implementing it.

By the way:

I am missing a component type "mount" that tells what is mounted where.
I think the current assumption that each component type "fs" has a
mountpoint is not always true.

If there would be a new component type for btrfs subvolumes, that would
also need mountpoints for the mounted subvolumes which means there are
at least two component types where mountpoints are defined which makes
it more complicated to see what is mounted where.

I think it would be cleaner to have separated things in separated
component types - something like:

"part" only for creating partitions  
"fs" only for creating filesystems  
"btrfssubvol" only for creating btrfs subvolumes  
"mount" only for creating mountpoints and mount stuff there

What do you think?

@jsmeix @abbbi @rear/owners The script
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/23_filesystem_layout.sh` is the
first part that needs to be fixed as it read it input from the `mount`
command.  
As far as I can remember `fs` was always referring to a mounted file
system, which in case of btrfs is not required anymore(?). I'm afraid
I'm a btrfs novice (for the moment) so I'm a bit confused (which is
normal in my case :)  
However, besides that I think `btrfssubvol` component might be a good
way to proceed. Around the `mount` component I need advise from our rear
maintainers.

After sleeping on it I think what I will try to implement is:

I will keep the "fs" component type as is also for btrfs and have all
what belongs to btrfs subvolumes in a separated component type
"btrfssubvol" with sub-types "defaultsubvol", "snapshotsubvol", and
"normalsubvol"or I may even use separated comonent types
"btrfsdefaultsubvol", "btrfssnapshotsubvol", and "btrfsnormalsubvol".

This should result the following clean and fail-safe behaviour:

A "fs" component type for btrfs would only create the btrfs filesystem
and its mountpoint "mp" parameter would mount the whole btrfs filesystem
(i.e. the btrfs root subvolume) there by using the mount option "-o
subvolid=0".  
For this I must make sure that only one "fs" component will be created
for each whole btrfs filesystem (i.e. no longer "fs" components for
btrfs subvolumes).

This way users who use plain btrfs without any kind of special subvolume
(i.e. on their btrfs the btrfs default subvolume is the same as the
btrfs root subvolume which is the btrfs filesystem root and they do not
have any other subvolume) only get a "fs" component type for btrfs which
is in full compliance with any other "fs" component type (e.g. for the
ext\* filesystems).

Any special btrfs subvolume stuff is specified via "btrfs\*" component
type(s).

For example if the user has a special btrfs default subvolume that is
not the btrfs root subvolume, then the default subvolume would be
created (the btrfs root subvolume is already mounted, see above) and the
btrfs filesystem would be re-mounted so that the default subvolume gets
mounted at a mountpoint that is specified in the "btrfs\*" component
(which could be the same or a different mountpoint than what is
specified in the "fs" component) so that the backup restore would fill
in the fils at the right place in the mounted filesystem tree.

When a user uses btrfs with special btrfs subvolume stuff in his
original system but he disables the "btrfs\*" components in his
disklayout.conf file, then he should get in the recreated system a plain
btrfs mounted at the mountpoint specified by the "mp" parameter (usually
this would be '/') and even the backup restore would "just work" because
the paths in backup.tar.gz do not "know" something about btrfs
subvolumes.

In the end what I like to get is "KSSS" (one more 'S' instead of the
'I'):  
"Keep Separated Stuff Separated" ;-)

In the original system I need to find out the "real reality" about an
existing btrfs to be able to re-create it.

I think that I will have to mount the btrfs root subvolume  
to be able to find out the "real reality" about a btrfs.

I think in the original system I will do something like the following
that I did on SLES12:

First run findmnt to get what is mounted where.

Then mount the btrfs root subvolume to get the "real reality" of the
whole btrfs via that mount point.

Hi,

-   Why *findmnt*, not just normal *mount* or `/proc/mounts`? For
    example SLES11 util-linux does not seem to contain findmnt.
-   Why mount it again, when it is already mounted?

In the following setup (its actually sles11sp3) we have one btrfs
filesystem, mounted at `/` and its subvolume `/osbackup` is mounted at
`/hana/osbackup`, (i.e. its visible in two places, `/osbackup` and
`/hana/osbackup`)

    #grep btrfs /proc/mounts
    /dev/sda4 / btrfs rw,relatime,space_cache 0 0
    /dev/sda4 /hana/osbackup btrfs rw,relatime,space_cache 0 0

    ID 256 gen 273280 top level 5 path @

pavoldomin,

just tell me how normal mount shows what btrfs subvolume is mounted
where.

Preferably provide a diff (e.g. for 23\_filesystem\_layout.sh or
whatever files you changed in your particular case) that "does the right
thing" in your case so that I can see what you actually did to make it
work in your particular case.

FYI on my SLES12:

<pre>
# man 8 mount
The listing.
The listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility only.
For more robust and customizable output use findmnt(8),
especially in your scripts.
</pre>

Of coure I will be backward compatible as far as possible but this may
mean that I cannot correctly detect what btrfs subvolume is mounted
where. Therefore I will use findmnt when it is available.

oh, ok, so you can actually have even the root btrfs volume magically
auto-mounted without /proc/mounts entry? My problem with temporary
mounts to check anything is, that they often tend to be difficult to
umount than (some process likes to open them). But if there is no other
way, well..

I really do not like mounting btrfs when "rear mkbackup" is run because
it changes the original system (mounting is much more than only read
something from the running system).

I really appreciate any better way how to get that information out of a
btrfs that can be more or less arbitrarily mounted from my current point
of view.

On the other hand "rear mkbackup" mounts already something (e.g. the NFS
share whereto a backup can be stored) so that having additinoal stuff
munted while "rear mkbackup" runs is not a totally new thing.

I should mount the btrfs root subvolume read-only to be more on the safe
side.

pavoldomin,  
many thanks for your comment - at least it made me thinking a bit more
about how to mount something safely (the third 'S' in KSSSS ;-) when it
is only to read some information!

It seems it is not possible to mount the btrfs root subvolume read-only
(perhaps because it is already mounted otherwise read-write?).

On my SLES12 system:

I have a first tentative implementation of generic btrfs support  
see

[https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=908854\#c3](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908854#c3)

I have tested it only on SLES12 with btrfs where it seems to work for
me.

Testing on other Linux distributions with btrfs is needed.

My tentative implementation should fail if there are "weaved btrfs
subvolume mounts", for details see  
[https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=908854\#c3](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908854#c3)

I will try to address "weaved btrfs subvolume mounts" in 2015.

For now:

Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

I have a general question regarding bash syntax:

At least down to GNU bash version 3.2.51 "man bash" reads:

<pre>
case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
</pre>

which means the patterns can be in a pair of parenthesis like

<pre>
case $var in
  (this) echo foo ;;
  (that) echo bar ;;
  (*) echo default ;;
esac
</pre>

I would like to use leading parenthesis for the cases to have pairs of
matching parenthesis in the scripts.

Hello Gratien,  
very many thanks for all your efforts to integrate my patch  
into the mainstream of rear and for your testing!

Of course my further work will be based on the mainstream of rear.

Regaring Fedora:

I will try to change your current fix for Fedora into a generic
solution.

I think I know what is different in Fedora's btrfs setup  
that my code which is intended to be generic support for btrfs  
currently does not work on Fedora:

I have installed Fedora-Live-Workstation-i686-21-5.

During its setup I selected Fedora's btrfs default partitioning scheme.

I got the following:

The crucial difference is that on Fedora what is in the running system
mounted at the root of the filesystem tree (i.a. at the '/' mountpoint)
is NOT the btrfs default subvolume but the btrfs subvolume "root".

This is shown in /etc/fstab.

Accordingly instead of testing for Fedora's btrfs way via a hardcoded
subvolume name "root" by

<pre>
if test "$subvolume_path" = "root" ; then
</pre>

a more generic solution to test for Fedora's btrfs way should be to
inspect /etc/fstab what is mounted at the '/' mountpoint and write that
information to $LAYOUT\_FILE.

The required information is already provided by my current code:

On SLES 12 I have in disklayout.conf (excerpt):

<pre>
# Format: btrfsdefaultsubvol device mountpoint btrfs_subvolume_ID [btrfs_subvolume_path]
btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda2 / 257 @
...
# Format: btrfsmountedsubvolume device subvolume_mountpoint mount_options btrfs_subvolume_path
btrfsmountedsubvolume /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache @
</pre>

On SLES 12 the btrfs default subvolume is '@' and this one is mounted at
the mountpoint '/' (as expected according to how a btrfs default
subvolume is meant to be used).

On openSUSE 13.2 I have in disklayout.conf (excerpt):

<pre>
# Format: btrfsdefaultsubvol device mountpoint btrfs_subvolume_ID [btrfs_subvolume_path]
btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda2 / 5
...
# Format: btrfsmountedsubvolume device subvolume_mountpoint mount_options btrfs_subvolume_path
btrfsmountedsubvolume /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache /
</pre>

On openSUSE 13.2 the btrfs default subvolume is the btrfs root subvolume
'/' (empty btrfs\_subvolume\_path for btrfsdefaultsubvol) and that one
is mounted at the mountpoint '/' (as expected according to how a btrfs
default subvolume is meant to be used).

On Fedora 21 I have in disklayout.conf (excerpt):

<pre>
# Format: btrfsdefaultsubvol device mountpoint btrfs_subvolume_ID [btrfs_subvolume_path]
btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda3 / 5
...
# Format: btrfsmountedsubvolume device subvolume_mountpoint mount_options btrfs_subvolume_path
btrfsmountedsubvolume /dev/sda3 / rw,relatime,seclabel,space_cache root
</pre>

On Fedora 21 the btrfs default subvolume is the btrfs root subvolume '/'
(empty btrfs\_subvolume\_path for btrfsdefaultsubvol) but that one is
not mounted at the mountpoint '/' instead the btrfs subvolume 'root' is
mounted at the mountpoint '/' (in contrast to how a btrfs default
subvolume is meant to be used).

Accordingly I think I only need to enhance
13\_include\_mount\_subvolumes\_code.sh to deal with the (unexpected)
case when not the btrfs default subvolume is mounted at the mountpoint
'/' but another btrfs subvolume is mounted there.

I am not a btrfs expert but from my point of view it looks like a
misconfiguration (a.k.a. bug) in Fedora 21 how they set up btrfs. I
think Fedora should specify as btrfs default subvolume what is mounted
at the '/' mountpoint.

Regardless if it is really a misconfiguration or not - I like to have
rear working fail-safe because regardless what a Linux distribution does
by default, an admin could manually create such an awkward btrfs setup
and when then rear does not work it is of course a bug in rear ;-)

I am testing rear git201501071534 version on Fedora 21  
with special adaptions for generic btrfs support on Fedora  
via rear-1.16.1-git201501071534.btrfs\_generic\_fedora.diff  
in my openSUSE build service home project "home:jsmeix"  
therein source package "rear1161git201501071534btrfsFedora"  
that results RPMs rear1161btrfs-1.16.1.fedora-N.M.noarch.rpm

I had two minor issues with Fedora21 that I reported as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/531](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/531)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/532](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/532)
but basically recovery with generic btrfs support worked for me on
Fedora21.

Now I need to re-test if it still works on openSUSE and SLES12...

I think this issue is now fixed via my last  
commit 548965e045ac33c8aa02d5d284d590e7c0846ac9  
"Implement basic support for btrfs in a generic way"

Note the "basic support".

Currently recovery works btrfs filesystem by btrfs filesystem.

Therefore it probably fails if there are  
"interwoven btrfs subvolume mounts" which means

-   a subvolume sv1 on a btrfs on /dev/sdXn  
    is mounted at a mountpoint directory  
    that belongs to a btrfs on /dev/sdYm
-   a subvolume sv2 on a btrfs on /dev/sdYm  
    is mounted at a mountpoint directory  
    that belongs to a btrfs on /dev/sdXn

In particular when the mountpoint directories are no plain directories  
but also subvolumes sv3 and sv4 on any of the btrfs filesystems.

FYI

Regarding "full btrfs support" (even for "interwoven mounts"),  
see what I above "commented on 10 Dec 2014" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497\#issuecomment-66448475](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497#issuecomment-66448475)  
regarding a well separated component type "mount".

Currently recovery works $device by $device e.g.  
first everything is done for /dev/sda  
then everything is done for /dev/sdb.

But in case of "interwoven mounts" between /dev/sdXn and /dev/sdYm  
this $device by $device recovery may fail.

Therefore for "full btrfs support" recovery should be done different:

1.  first "part" (creating partitions) on all devices,
2.  then "fs" (creating filesystems) on all partitions,
3.  then as needed "btrfssubvol" (creating btrfs subvolumes) on all
    btrfs filesystems,
4.  then if needed "btrfsdefaultsubvol" (setting btrfs default
    subvolume) on all btrfs filesystems,
5.  finally "mount" (creating mountpoints and mount stuff) for all
    filesystems and subvolumes.

As the current btrfs implementation works on Fedora, SLES and OpenSuSe I
declare this version ready for shipping with rear-1.17.
