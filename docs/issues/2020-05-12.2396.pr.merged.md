-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    High impact on POWER architecture to avoid false usage.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Cannot be tested by me because I do not have a POWER system.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

New `prep/USB/<non-i386-arch>/350_safeguard_error_out.sh`  
safeguard scripts to let "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" error out  
in case of false usage of OUTPUT=USB on non PC-compatible  
(non-i386/x86/x86\_64) architectures because with OUTPUT=USB  
on those architectures the USB medium cannot be booted  
(for those architectures there are no scripts that install a
bootloader)  
so OUTPUT=USB on those architectures does not provide  
what the user expects (cf. the "OUTPUT=USB" section  
in default.conf what the expected behaviour is)

I will sleep over it and if there are no objections I would like  
to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

42 lines of comments for one line of actual code  
might be even a new all-time record ? ;-)
