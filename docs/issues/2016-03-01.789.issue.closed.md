-   Brief description of the issue:  
    rear -v mkbackup went successfully but nothing is copied to NFS
    share.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    When trying to use -S option with rear, I could see the size of the
    archive getting bigger and bigger, but in the end nothing
    remained!  
    Note that I tried with and without
    BACKUP\_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock", same result.

In the log file I saw:  
`2016-03-01 14:14:09 Command line options: /sbin/rear -v mkrescue` ??
