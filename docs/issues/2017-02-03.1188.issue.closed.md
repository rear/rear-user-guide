centos 7.2  
Relax-and-Recover 2.00-git201701271258 / 2017-01-27

during a recovery job  
network is pulling 80MB/s, after 1 day still pulling 80MB/S , but
nothing appears to be going out to disk  
after 183gb of a 700 gb job

restoring just shows  
"restoring for xyz seconds"

nothing in error logs, no feed back...

@razorfish-sl did you check the network latency? Perhaps you were on
half-duplex instead of full-duplex?

Nope...... 1000 Base T that works for every other program.  
*Might* be due to the MTU... (restore to a VM)

or perhaps some sort of virtual block device?

That said: some sort of *Debug* option to increase feedback during file
recovery would be very helpful.

The verbosity you request is already present for **tar** see:

    ./conf/default.conf:BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="--anchored"
    ./conf/default.conf:BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS_CREATE_ARCHIVE=""
    ./conf/default.conf:BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS_RESTORE_ARCHIVE=""

just add what you need in your `/etc/rear/local.conf` file

@razorfish-sl Any feedback or was your question answered sufficient?

sorry not to get back sooner.  
ok checked it out and resolved the issue.

Network was on full duplex  
I picked it up on other cross country Rsync jobs  
it is something related to synology backup devices and the Rsync daemon.

Switching it to NFS it is speeding along now, i can max out the NIC on
single large files now.

@razorfish-sl  
your initial description was too terse for me to imagine  
what might go on on your particular system.  
Because of your latest "single large files" snippet perhaps my  
comments in restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
might be also of interest for you therein in particular my  
comments regarding 'tar --verbose' messages that point to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1116\#issuecomment-267065150](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1116#issuecomment-267065150)  
which concluded that

<pre>
during restore of huge files there is no useful 'tar' output
and that leads to useless progress 'Restored' values.
</pre>

I guess for 'rsync' the same may happen so that perhaps  
there are currently no good ReaR progress messages  
while huge files are stored or restored via rsync?

Yep sorry,  
when i find a problem, I log it then expand the details as i get more
info from other systems.  
by huge I mean single files of anything from 2-100gb (VM image files)
over a 100base T  
The receiving end was using an Rsync server, it must not have been
threaded correctly.

MY main issue was that during a large transfer, short of looking at
switch traffic there is no feed back other than the "seconds counter" of
rear.
