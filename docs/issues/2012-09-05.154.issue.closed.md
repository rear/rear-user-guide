Can you share the /etc/rear/local.conf file please?

Here we go;

I noticed this is a relative old release. We have improved the handling
of tar in the meantime due to an issue *you* reported before (\#119). Is
there a reason why you insist on using this older release ?

No, I don't have any reason to use the old one. But I downloaded it from
ReaR website.  
Please let me know how to get the new one.

Try:
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)
and use the latest snapshot release !

As I know, when I recover the os, I have to clean up boot area using dd
command.  
Can I have any way to skip this procedure?

I do not understand what you are talking about. What do you mean with
boot area ? And why should you clean it up ?

I assume @cwnam14 means the MBR area:

    ./layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10_include_partition_code.sh
    dd if=/dev/zero of=$disk bs=512 count=1

That's right.

I,d like to skip this procedure.

Why do you have to clean up the MBR ? It should not be necessary to
manually use dd on the MBR.

Please **show** us **what** you are doing and explain **why** you are
doing this, I do not want to make assumptions in order to help you. In
fact, I prefer to do other things rather than help you *if* you insist
on making it hard for me to grasp what you need help with. Sigh...

@gdha Feel free to handle this issue if you can see through the
vagueness.

Is this issue still open? If yes, run once `rear dump` to view your
current setup and paste it here. As @dagwieers already mentioned there
is no need to run manually a MBR.  
By the way, did you format the USB disk before running
`rear -v mkbackup` ?

Let me close this issue. Thanks.
