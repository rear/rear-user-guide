I've tried with regular usb drives and ssd external drives and after I
do mkrescue and mkbackup and even checklayout it doesn't boot. There is
a flash where I see the syslinux info but it never boots. I have legacy
boot enabled.

I've just tried fedora 23 and USB mkbackup - the recovery system boots
fine from the USB device.  
Did you format the USB device before using it?
`rear format /dev/<usb-dev>`  
My `/etc/rear/site.conf` looks like:

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"

If the above doesn't help, please explain in detail what you did and
show me the config.

It seems that instead of using fdisk or parted using rear format  
everything worked out and it booted up just fine. I must of missed
that  
in the man pages.

Thanks!
