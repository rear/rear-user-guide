-   Impact: **Normal**
-   Reference to related issue (URL): partially \#2648
-   How was this pull request tested?

tested output usb with:

1.  USB\_BOOTLOADER=
2.  USB\_BOOTLOADER=grub  
    on apu2 board (coreboot/seabios) - no efi

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    added option to write grub bootloader to usb (no efi)  
    it may not be perfect but a good starting point

@DEvil0000  
thank you for this very much missing enhancement!

I appreciate the new USB\_BOOTLOADER config variable  
because - at least for me - it was an endless confusion  
what "install a bootloader" actually means in ReaR  
because in ReaR there are two separated bootloader install actions:

Installing the bootloader of the ReaR recovery system during "rear
mkrescue"  
versus  
(re)-installing the bootloader of the recreated system during "rear
recover".

With clearly named config variables like USB\_BOOTLOADER  
it is now at least clear what bootloader will be used  
for the ReaR recovery system when it is made with OUTPUT=USB

@DEvil0000  
if you like and if you agree  
I could do my requested changes  
directly in your pull request code here.

feel free to do changes.  
Do you need write access to the branch at PR source?

I have write access - this is why I asked you for permit.  
I have write access because the pull request sources  
are already within the ReaR upstream GitHub area,  
e.g. one of your commits has URL

    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2655/commits/249a977119251d0ce766aca7bf84514c301acca2

so the pull request sources already belong to  
`github.com/rear/rear` where I have write access.

Strange.  
I can no longer change pull request code via the GitHub web interface.  
I know I could do this in the past.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it as is tomorrow
morning and  
then I will further adapt and enhance things via a subsequent pull
request from me.

Because USB\_BOOTLOADER is a new config variable  
we are free to implement how it should behave.

Currently I am thinking about something like:

-   USB\_BOOTLOADER empty or unset (the default): Automatism what USB
    bootloader is used
-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="extlinux": Enforce using syslinux/extlinux as USB
    bootloader
-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="grub": Enforce using grub2 as USB bootloader
-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="efi": Enforce EFI boot for USB

This is currently only some offhanded idea...

keep in mind that efi is not very specific - it may be used with
different bootloaders and efi payloads and so on.

Yes, I have had a look at
output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
and because of what I saw there I intentionally proposed the unspecific

-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="efi": Enforce EFI boot for USB

to basically run output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh as is.

If needed we may later further enhance things like

-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="efi": Enforce EFI boot for USB (automatism what
    bootloader is used)
-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="efi grub": Enforce EFI boot for USB with grub2 as
    bootloader
-   USB\_BOOTLOADER="efi elilo": Enforce EFI boot for USB with elilo as
    bootloader

I think EFI boot setup and BIOS boot setup  
would normally exclude each other  
but I fail to see how  
output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
and  
output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
exclude each other.

What I can see is that output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
is only run when USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is true  
but I fail to see how output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
is not run when USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is true.

So - as far as I can currently see from plain looking at the code - it
seems  
output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
is run in any case - in particular also on systems with UEFI firmware.

I wonder if that makes sense?

I did not test or change that configuration combination / path in
software.

There may be good reasons for this. In case of elilo.efi it does not run
the grub config part in `100_create_efiboot.sh` what makes me believe
this case needs some syslinux/extlinux config then.  
Also there is still the option of creating a boot device which can boot
from legacy bios and efi method but I think thats not what was intended
here. I am however not familiar with this.

@DEvil0000  
in your output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_grub.sh there is

    USB_REAR_DIR="$BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$USB_PREFIX"
    if [ ! -d "$USB_REAR_DIR" ]; then
        mkdir -p $v "$USB_REAR_DIR" >/dev/null || Error "Could not create USB ReaR dir [$USB_REAR_DIR] !"
    fi

but it seems USB\_REAR\_DIR is nowhere used  
so I would like to know why that directory is created there  
i.e. what the reason behind is why that directory is created?

USB\_REAR\_DIR also appears in
output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
but there it is used to write syslinux things there.

Is creating USB\_REAR\_DIR in
output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_grub.sh  
perhaps only an obsolete leftover from some copy&paste?

Maybe the directory USB\_REAR\_DIR should be created elsewhere but it is
used to store the kernel and initrd later as well as parts of syslinux
config if syslinux is used. For one of the following scripts it needed
to exist.

@DEvil0000  
thank you for the info!

What a mess that old USB related code is!  
The global looking variable USB\_REAR\_DIR is not used globally  
but the `$BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$USB_PREFIX` directory is needed  
so for now I at least explained things via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2659/commits/b20858a41d6a3d709bbfe34633915e9ac070223e](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2659/commits/b20858a41d6a3d709bbfe34633915e9ac070223e)
