-   Brief description of the issue:  
    During `rear recover` partition size is incorrectly calculated with
    mawk.  
    Following code is executed by *400\_autoresize\_disks.sh*

<!-- -->

    new_size=$(echo "$partition_size $resizeable_space $available_space" | awk '{ printf "%d", ($1/$2)*$3; }')

With gawk values are correct:

    echo '8333033472 8333033472 39473643520' | awk '{ printf "%d", ($1/$2)*$3; }'
    39473643520

With mawk however, values are maxed to 0xFFFFFFFF (2147483647)

    echo '8333033472 8333033472 39473643520' | awk '{ printf "%d", ($1/$2)*$3; }'
    2147483647

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Change of awk conversion specification format:

<!-- -->

    - new_size=$(echo "$partition_size $resizeable_space $available_space" | awk '{ printf "%d", ($1/$2)*$3; }')
    + new_size=$(echo "$partition_size $resizeable_space $available_space" | awk '{ printf "%.0f", ($1/$2)*$3; }')

Or maybe use bash arithmetic expansion ?

    - new_size=$(echo "$partition_size $resizeable_space $available_space" | awk '{ printf "%d", ($1/$2)*$3; }')
    + new_size=$(( ($partition_size/$resizeable_space)*$available_space ))

I do very very much appreciate it whenever  
needless external tool calls are replaced  
by native bash 3.0 functionality to  
Keep the Implementation Simple and Straightforward.

Furthermore I personally prefer when spaces  
are used when possible to aid readability like

<pre>
new_size=$(( ( $partition_size / $resizeable_space ) * $available_space ))
</pre>

which at least helps my elderly eyes ;-)  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

For me with GNU bash version 3.2.51 on SLES11 32-bit  
bash arithmetic evaluation and expansion works with your values

<pre>
# partition_size=8333033472 ; resizeable_space=8333033472 ; available_space=39473643520 ; new_size=$(( ( $partition_size / $resizeable_space ) * $available_space )) ; echo $new_size
39473643520
</pre>

According to  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117280/what-is-the-rationale-for-the-bash-shell-not-warning-you-of-arithmetic-overflow](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117280/what-is-the-rationale-for-the-bash-shell-not-warning-you-of-arithmetic-overflow)  
I tried what the maximum value is for my GNU bash version 3.2.51  
on SLES11 32-bit and it is 2^63 - 1

<pre>
# max=$(( 2**63 - 1 )) ; echo $max
9223372036854775807

# max=$(( 2**63 )) ; echo $max
-9223372036854775808

# echo '2^63 - 1' | bc -l
9223372036854775807

# echo '2^63' | bc -l
9223372036854775808
</pre>

and I get same results with GNU bash version 4.2.47  
on openSUSE Laep 42.1 64-bit:

<pre>
# max=$(( 2**63 - 1 )) ; echo $max
9223372036854775807

# max=$(( 2**63 )) ; echo $max
-9223372036854775808
</pre>

so that I conclude that in practice the maximum value for  
bash arithmetic evaluation is 2^63 - 1 = 9223372036854775807  
which is 8388608 GiB - 1 so that we can use bash arithmetic  
for disks up to 8388607 GiB.

@gozora  
I think in layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh

<pre>
    start=$( echo "$start" | awk '{printf "%u", $1+4096-($1%4096);}')
</pre>

is also a place where mawk could fail because I think  
the partition start values in ReaR use bytes as unit  
so that on bigger disks it could overflow with mawk.

Good catch @jsmeix, I'll rewrite this one as well.

No problem, it just somehow happens that I keep finding those bugs :-)

I fear the whole

<pre>
start=$( echo "$start" | awk '{printf "%u", $1+4096-($1%4096);}')
</pre>

is plain wrong - or I do something wrong here:

<pre>
# start=$(( 4096 * 1234 ))
# echo $start
5054464

# rounded_start=$( echo "$start" | awk '{printf "%u", $1+4096- $1%4096);}')
# echo $rounded_start
5058560

# echo $(( rounded_start / 4096 ))
1235
</pre>

I.e. even for a exact matching start value, the current code  
recalculates it to a new start + 4096 value.

I guess nobody notices a change of 4096 bytes in practice  
but it would be a major bug in ReaR when it does not recreate  
the partitioning exactly as it was before when possible.

If I am right the above is perhaps the cause of the mysterious  
changes of partitioning after "rear recover" that you detected  
during your tests with your BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE  
in particular for Windows NTFS partitions, cf.

The more I try to understand it the less I understand it.

I cannot reproduce it in practice on my original system:

<pre>
# parted /dev/sda unit B print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 21474836480B
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start        End           Size          Type     File system     Flags
 1      1048576B     1562378239B   1561329664B   primary  linux-swap(v1)  type=82
 2      1562378240B  21474836479B  19912458240B  primary  ext4            boot, type=83
</pre>

and after "rear recover"

<pre>
# parted /dev/sda unit B print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 21474836480B
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start        End           Size          Type     File system     Flags
 1      1048576B     1562378239B   1561329664B   primary  linux-swap(v1)  type=83
 2      1562378240B  21474836479B  19912458240B  primary  ext4            boot, type=83
</pre>

but when I try the current code with my /dev/sda2 partition  
start value it calculates a wrong new start value:

<pre>
# start=$(( 1048576 + 1561329664 )) ; echo $start ; echo $(( start / 4096 ))
1562378240
381440

# rounded_start=$( echo "$start" | awk '{printf "%u", $1+4096-($1%4096);}')

# echo $rounded_start ; echo $(( rounded_start / 4096 ))
1562382336
381441
</pre>

Am I mad or what goes on here?

@gozora  
only a side note FYI if you work on 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
and do not like the hardcoded '4096' guess of  
"most device's block size":  
You may have a look at the current  
USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE  
implementation in 300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh

Hooray!  
Even with GNU bash, version 3.1.17 on SLES10  
bash arithmetic evaluation works up to 2^63 - 1  
at least on x86\_64:

<pre>
# cat /etc/issue
Welcome to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4  (x86_64)

# bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release (x86_64-suse-linux)

# max=$(( 2**63 - 1 )) ; echo $max
9223372036854775807

# max=$(( 2**63 )) ; echo $max
-9223372036854775808

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269\#issuecomment-290006467](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269#issuecomment-290006467)

Therefore we can use bytes 'B' as unit for parted  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1270](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1270))  
up to disk sizes of 9223372036854775807 bytes  
i.e. up to 8589934592 GiB minus one byte  
or 838861 TiB minus one byte  
or 8192 PiB minus one byte  
or 8 EiB minus one byte  
which looks sufficiently future-proof  
(at least from my current point of view).

@jsmeix For GNU Bash 4.4.12 x86\_64 the bash arithmetic resize code
fails at least for each situation where $resizeable\_space is larger
than $partition\_size.

> ( $partition\_size / $resizeable\_space )

    $ echo $(( (2/3)*9999 ))
    0

Failing workaround: Mimicking the example by first multiplying fails
because bash is not able to correctly multiply 20G with 30G.

Summary from what we learned above  
and in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1307](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1307)

When a tool calculates correctly for numbers up to 2^N  
one can in practice only use it for input numbers up to 2^(N/2)  
when a single multiplication of such numbers should work  
because 2^(N/2) \* 2^(N/2) = 2^N

This means when bash can calculate up to 2^63 - 1  
we can use in practice bash only for input numbers  
up to something about 2^31 - 1.

Inputs of 2^32 - 1 do not work in general:

<pre>
# echo '2^32 - 1' | bc
4294967295

# echo '4294967295 * 4294967295' | bc
18446744065119617025

# echo $(( 4294967295 * 4294967295 ))
-8589934591
</pre>

Multiplication works in general up to 2^31 - 1

<pre>
# echo '2^31 - 1' | bc
2147483647

# echo '2147483647 * 2147483647' | bc
4611686014132420609

# echo $(( 2147483647 * 2147483647 ))
4611686014132420609
</pre>

Some bigger special cases may still work  
like (2^31 - 1) \* (2^32)

<pre>
# echo '2^32' | bc
4294967296

# echo '2147483647 * 4294967296' | bc
9223372032559808512

# echo $(( 2147483647 * 4294967296 ))
9223372032559808512
</pre>

but nothing more

<pre>
# echo '2^31' | bc
2147483648

# echo '2147483648 * 4294967296' | bc
9223372036854775808

# echo $(( 2147483648 * 4294967296 ))

@gozora My source OS (Arch Linux) has no `bc` tool installed (by
default).

Despite all your effort for fixing the `mawk` (Mike Brennan's AWK
speedup by using a bytecode compiler) issue, the result is that a broken
`awk` now introduces an additional dependency for ReaR to work properly:
`bc`.

I would love a solution that leaves the old code in place, and extend
that for the cases where `(m)awk` will fail. For instance change '`awk`'
to explicitly use '`gawk`'. And for the users that haven't got `gawk`
installed, fall back to `bc` for math calculations.

@ProBackup-nl how can we be sure that `awk` will be installed (by
default) on your Arch next time?

@gozora We can never be sure. However at the moment the `gawk` package
is **required** by, for example:

-   [archboot](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archboot/)
-   [hwdetect](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/hwdetect/)
-   [mkinitcpio](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/mkinitcpio/)
-   [and 26 more Arch Linux
    packages](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/i686/gawk/)

Simply put:  
One cannot use any kind of 'awk' or any kind of  
traditional tool for calculations nowadays.

All those tools have usually certain limitations  
that hit us in this or that way when calculating big numbers.

For example using usual floating point arithmetik also leads  
to wrong results when calculating big integer numbers.

We need a tool that is known to work for big numbers.

E.g. 2^100 + 1 - 2^100 must result 1 and never ever 0:

<pre>
# echo '2^100 + 1 - 2^100' | bc -l
1

# awk 'BEGIN{print 2^52 + 1 - 2^52 }'
1

# awk 'BEGIN{print 2^53 + 1 - 2^53 }'  || echo fail
0
</pre>

I do not even want to know why my 'awk' fails at 2^53  
and not at things like 2^31 2^32 2^63 2^64 and why  
my 'awk' even does not show its calculation failure  
with a non-zero exit code or an error message.

All what matters is that tools like 'awk' cannot be used  
because calculations just have to be correct - always.

Accordingly ReaR cannot be used on systems without  
a tool that is known to work for big numbers.

FWIW:  
I was 'awk' (more precisely 'gawk') package maintainer  
some time ago and - guess what - every now and then  
on the <bug-gawk@gnu.org> mailing list issues were reported  
by this or that gawk user that "awk calculates wrong"  
in this or that particular unexpected way.

A link to a [2013 bug submission by gratien....@gmail.com for the lack
of large integer support in mawk / incorrect output of %d
format](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/original-mawk/issues/23) and the
quoted response:

> This is a known limitation: mawk's format for %d is limited by the
> format.  
> The limitation is done to improve performance.

> You can get more precision using one of the floating formats (and can

Does ReaR need this kind of large integer precision here?  
Or can the math in ReaR work with a floating point calculation that is
converted to an integer?

@ProBackup-nl using different conversion type was discussed already (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269\#issue-217646048](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269#issue-217646048))
and we decided to use `bc` instead ...

In case the choice for `bc` decision will be reconsidered, floating
point gawk returns the expected output for gratien's example:

    # echo '26341277696 26341278720 47819259904' | gawk '{ printf "%.0f", ($1/$2)*$3; }'
    47819258045
    # gawk -V
    GNU Awk 4.1.4, API: 1.1 (GNU MPFR 3.1.5-p2, GNU MP 6.1.2)

@ProBackup-nl ReaR will always require some software that might not be
installed by default on some Linux distro. Therefore we check for it
with `REQUIRED_PROGS` and also include those packages in the distro
packages.

I therefore see absolutely no value in writing code that supplements
`bc` instead of requiring `bc` to be present.

If you are an Archlinux user then I would kindly ask you to help ReaR by
making sure that the Archlinuc package also includes such required
tools.

Specifically to this point about `gawk` or `bc` I see that the current
`PKGBUILD`
[file](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/arch/PKGBUILD)
already includes a hard dependency on `gawk` which we could easily
extend to also include `bc`:

    depends=(lsb-release iproute2 parted cpio openssl gawk)

@schlomo As long as `bc` isn't an **optional** dependency, I don't feel
any need.
