Hello!  
This is a P2V restore using ReaR, the original server is a RHEL8 X86
server, the destination server is a VMware Virtual Machine. This is the
step by step procedure to recover the Physical Server in the destination
virtual server...

1.  Boot the VM with ReaR ISO backup file.
2.  Assing IP ADDRESS and ROUTER information from the command line.
3.  Starting the MULTIPATH Daemon from command mode: \#modprobe
    dm-multipath and \# /bin/multipathd
4.  Reconfigure the /etc/multipath.conf file with the WWID of every
    available VMDISK
5.  Reconfigure the multipath: \# multipath reconfigure
6.  Run ReaR with manual recover (selecting every destination VMDisk)
7.  ReaR fails during the mapping process, the LOG message: Remove ioctl
    on mpathc1 failed: device or resource busy.  
    Please your help.

Note: Physical server has multipath enable.

@pcahyna  
because this issue is about RHEL  
could you have a look here  
as far as time permits?
