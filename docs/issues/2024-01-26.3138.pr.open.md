@rear/contributors Please have a look, I'd like to do the last fixes on
Monday and merge because that is the limit for the Dell lab where I can
run tests.

Second impression: please do not mix formatting changes and actual
functionality changes in the same commit.
24c122798406e0d62887e0e2909bb942d44a88dd is about "Ensure minimum Bash
version ", but it contains hundreds of unrelated changed lines.  
I also have the impression that many of the formatting changes should be
avoided, as they make the code look worse (and less in line with the
examples in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
).

Thanks @pcahyna for helping us to be better contributors, you are right
in both points.

Im actually unhappy with

because it mixes in all the backup methods into a single file instead of
using our directory based overlay architecture to separate the concerns
for each backup software. If it is OK with @rear/contributors then I'd
gladly pull this code apart by introducing a new
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH_ADDITIONS` variable that can be set for every backup
tool.

The reason why I didn't do that is that I cannot test this change for
all backup tools so that we would have to rely on eyeball inspection and
later tests by others.

Another thought: I added a feature to backup and restore the ESP because
PPDM doesn't backup `vfat` filesystems. I'm wondering if I should change
this code to be more generic so that it would either happen
automatically for any recovery that doesn't restore the ESP or that it
can be activated for those commercial backup tools that can't backup the
ESP themselves.

In my test case the ESP was ~7MB, not much at all.
