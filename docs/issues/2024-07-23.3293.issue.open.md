See

The current code related to the find\_duply\_profile function  
and the DUPLY\_PROFILE\* variables looks rather messy.

At least at first glance I cannot make sense of it.

@rear/contributors  
it should be verified before the ReaR 3.0 release  
if third party code could be sourced here  
or if all is reasonably safe.

Duply is a wrapper around duplicity.  
It is up to the end-user to enter his/her password in the configuration
file of duply. We advise **never** to write passwords in plain text
files, but rather use secure key pairs.
