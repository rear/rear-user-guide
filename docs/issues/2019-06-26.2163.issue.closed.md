-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    VM, however i've had this issues on a standard PC and somehow the
    issue went away.

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    BIOs

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    NAS

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    First, i've had this issue before I thought the solution was to
    change my encryption option from -aes-256-cbc to -aes256, that was
    not the reason. It is clear to me now i just got lucky with
    something which i don't know wha. However, if I comment out all the
    Crypt settings, everything works fine and I will see the "Archived
    file counter" showing how many files been archived and at what rate.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    unless you know one.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):  
    Here is the command rear -v mkbackuponly &gt; test2.log

You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.I1DbZaO30tGzKwQ

Which looks good, but the backup file outpiut is 8 bytes.

@chumunga  
we need a debug log file from you for "rear -D mkbackuponly"  
plus the separated backup log file which is usually named `backup.log`  
that gets also output where the backup and ISO are,  
i.e. to the BACKUP\_URL network location.

Does it perhaps work with "rear -D mkbackup"?  
I have the dim feeling that the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT stuff  
may only work with the full "mkbackup" workflow  
but not with the shortened "mkbackuponly" workflow.

I wonder why you wrote `Backup.iso 0 bytes` because I think with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS

you should get two separated files `backup.tar.gz` and `HOSTNAME.iso`  
but not a `Backup.iso` file?

Hi jsmeix

We can resolve this ticket linking to  
`Backup tar file 0 bytes if encryption enabled with empty openssl password`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2157\#issuecomment-506496775](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2157#issuecomment-506496775)

Sorry for reopening, I didn't know I could actually reopen a closed
ticket.

For future readers, the issue in this case was the password started with
a $SomePassHere, which was being interpreted as a variable an empty one
at that. Thus openssl was passed a blank password and it will create a
file with 0 bytes. see link above for more details.
