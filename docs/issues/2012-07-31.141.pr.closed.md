Older versions of asciidoc stop with the error  
asciidoc: ERROR: relax-and-recover-user-guide.txt: line 9: malformed
author: Dag Wieers and Jeroen Hoekx  
The patch is a workaround to avoid such errors.

We prepare the tarball with the documentation included so that packagers
should not need asciidoc. Asciidoc should only be needed for people who
want documentation and are using a source tree. This way we keep the
build requirements to a minimum and avoid problems with specific
versions of asciidoc on older distributions.

OK, that's clear now.  
Questions:

-   Why is the man page (doc/rear.8) under version control (which is
    normally not the case for generated files)?
-   The implementation of the dist target in the Makefile doesn't
    generate html-versions of the doc\[/user-guide\]/\*.txt files and
    they are therefore not part of the tarball. Shouldn't they be part
    of the tarball?

-   For the same reason we don't want packagers to require asciidoc as a
    dependency (remember it would pull python too etc...) But it could
    be sufficient to have it part of `make dist` instead.
-   Yes, that's something we will do once the documentation is of
    acceptable quality, that's also the reason why the documentation is
    not yet up on the website...
