    ARM device):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I spent multiply hours the last days getting a rescue system as either a
rawimage (to later dd(1) onto a usb device) or directly on a usb device
that would boot on my laptop.

The (almost silent, i.e. no WARNING prefix being logged before) skipping
of some steps made it more difficult for me to find out, what/where the
issue is, until I found (ok, I admit, read) a relevant line in the rear
-v mkrescue output.  
(In my defense, the verbose output contains a lot of lines, and the
important ones are not prefixed with a big WARNING or similar.)  
I just saw the empty /dev/sdb1 (efi partition)

I looked through default.conf and saw

    # USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER
    #
    # UEFI (Secure booting) support is partly available in ReaR (at least for Fedora, RHEL)
    â€¦
    # The next variable can explicitly specify whether or not an UEFI bootloader should be used:
    # USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=   means let ReaR try to find it out by itself (default)

I ignored it, because it adds `(Secure booting)`, which is not what I
want.  
Now I feel that by default rear should make a EFI bootable usb device,
at least if there is a 'REAR-EFI' partition, which is created by rear
format -- --efi /dev/sdb, which kinda states intent to boot this on an
EFI compatible computer.  
This is what I would expect what 'finding out by itself' means.  
It seems, that's not what it actually does.  
Only explicitly setting `=1` passes this check (If I understand this
code correctly) :  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/40cbaaf50b689b73be77b9a12b4321a787db6681/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh\#L20-L25](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/40cbaaf50b689b73be77b9a12b4321a787db6681/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh#L20-L25)

Anyways, I also found

    # Bootloader used for the USB medium.
    # At the moment only empty/unset and "grub" is supported.
    # USB_BOOTLOADER="grub" uses GRUB2 as bootloader for USB with BIOS. GRUB Legacy is not supported.
    # Default is using GRUB2 for EFI other then elilo, extlinux for ext, syslinux otherwise:
    USB_BOOTLOADER=

The last comment line seems not to be correct english, which made it
guess what it means.  
One (wrong) thing I understood is rear creates a EFI bootable rescue USB
device by default.  
Since that is wrong, I would suggest to explicitly mention that
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` needs to be set.

The [user
guide](https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/basics/configuration.html)
states

> OUTPUT=RAWDISK: Create a bootable raw disk image on as
> rear-$(hostname).raw.gz. Supports UEFI boot if syslinux/EFI or Grub
> 2/EFI is installed. Supports Legacy BIOS boot if syslinux is
> installed. Supports UEFI/Legacy BIOS dual boot if syslinux and one of
> the supported EFI bootloaders are installed.

which again sounds to me like the rescue system will be UEFI-bootable if
the relevant packages are installed.

Looking at some other issues about UEFI this does not seem to be a
priority usecase. But I'd be happy if you update the docs so other
people don't have to loose as much time with this as I did.

@castilma  
because of your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3361](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3361)  
I assume you use Artix Linux also here.

The whole booting setup of the ReaR recovery system  
has become a mess of various pieces and methods  
that has grown over a long time  
BUT  
we at ReaR upstream do not have the manpower  
to properly clean it up and overhaul it  
SO  
things stay "as is" as long as noone finds the time  
to contribute what is needed to substantially  
improve things.

With careful manual configuration  
things can be made working as needed  
for one's specific use case.

In general regarding Artix Linux:

Artix Linux is not one of the known to be  
supported Linux based operating systems, see  
"Supported and Unsupported Operating Systems" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

In particular we at ReaR upstream do not use Artix Linux.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artix\_Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artix_Linux)  
reads

    Artix does not use systemd,
    instead opting to provide OpenRC, runit, s6, and dinit,
    in its place.

This calls for problems because ReaR does not support  
any other init system than the nowadays usual systemd  
and to some extent SysVinit but this is no longer tested.

So likely your ReaR recovery system may fail  
to boot and/or fail to startup because currently  
ReaR has no support to setup the init system for  
the ReaR recovery system when on the original system  
OpenRC, runit, s6, or dinit is used as init system.

FYI  
in general you may have a look at the section  
"Inappropriate expectations" in

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d5b48f30e299049c9e6d5df1d1a19b74b3b8bdcf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d5b48f30e299049c9e6d5df1d1a19b74b3b8bdcf)  
I improved the USB\_BOOTLOADER description in default.conf  
to make it clear that for UEFI with GRUB2 also  
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER must be set appropriately,
