/Hello,

The initial code for REAR integration with Veeam Backup Agent for Linux
has been commited.  
WeÂ´ve updated rear/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf with BACKUP=VEEAM
option, for Veeam support.  
Some additional variables have to be specified like:

-   Hostname of the Veeam VBRServer from which we want to restore our
    data  
    VBRSRV=

-   IP Address of our Veeam VBRServer  
    VBRADDR=

-   Specify a username which has the role to register a host to the
    Veeam VBRServer (Veeam Restore Operator)  
    VBRUSR=

-   Password for the Veeam Restore Operator Role user to register  
    VBRPASSWD=

-   Domain is mainly used for Veeam VBR Server registration, joined to a
    windows active directory domain. If no domain is used, leave the
    field blank  
    VBRDOMAIN=

In order to register the veeam linux agent to the veeam vbrserver, we
need to have a veeam user with the role "Veeam Restore Operator".  
Detailed information on how the procedure works can be found in the
rear/usr/share/rear/restore/VEEAM/default/500\_restore.sh script

Please let us know if this is okay, or any changes should be done.

Regards,  
Andreas
