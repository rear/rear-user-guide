-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Automounted NFS filesystems will cause rear process to hang
    indefinitely if the NFS server becomes unavailable while mount point
    still exists. The problem appears to be due to
    rear/prep/default/400\_save\_directories.sh collecting info about
    mount points that are owned by the automounter, which in my opinion
    is unnecessary (automount daemon creates these mount points, so why
    include them in a backup?).

For example:

    # mount | grep /apps/unixengdev
    uxengnas1:/export/unixengdev on /apps/unixengdev type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.0.2.15,local_lock=none,addr=28.97.76.59)

Walking through the 400\_save\_directories.sh code manually:

    # USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL='REAR-000'
    # BUILD_DIR=/tmp/foo
    # excluded_fs_types="anon_inodefs|autofs|bdev|cgroup|cgroup2|configfs|cpuset|debugfs|devfs|devpts|devtmpfs|dlmfs|efivarfs|fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon|fusectl|hugetlbfs|mqueue|nfsd|none|nsfs|overlay|pipefs|proc|pstore|ramfs|rootfs|rpc_pipefs|securityfs|sockfs|spufs|sysfs|tmpfs"
    # excluded_other_stuff="/sys/|$BUILD_DIR|$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL"
    # mountpoints="$( mount | grep -vE "type ($excluded_fs_types) |$excluded_other_stuff" | awk '{print $3}' )"
    # echo $mountpoints
    / /boot /vagrant /vagrant /home/vagrant/workspace /apps/unixengdev

If uxengnas1 NFS server has actually failed at this point, the
subsequent `stat ...` loop waits indefinitely for the NFS server to
respond.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    In my opinion, better behaviour would be for the script to exclude
    mount points managed by the automounter, which isn't all that
    difficult to achieve because automount creates an `autofs` mount
    table entry for the parent of all of its potential mount points, eg.
    for the /apps/unixengdev example above there is an entry for /apps:

<!-- -->

    # mount | grep /apps
    /etc/auto.apps on /apps type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=17,pgrp=1082,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,indirect,pipe_ino=29508)
    uxengnas1:/export/unixengdev on /apps/unixengdev type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.0.2.15,local_lock=none,addr=28.97.76.59)

So we can exclude all mount points that are direct descendants of all
autofs parents, eg. like this:

    local excluded_automounts=$(mount |awk '
      $5 == "autofs" { i++; mp[i]=$3 }
      END {
        if (i > 0) {
          line="^("mp[1]
          for (j=2;j<=i;j++) {line=line"|"mp[j]}
          print line")(/|$)"
        } else {
          print " "
        }
      }')
    local mountpoints=$( mount |awk -v x="$excluded_automounts" '$3 !~ x' | grep -vE "type ($excluded_fs_types) |$excluded_other_stuff" | awk '{print $3}' )

Repeating the above example:

    # mount | grep /apps/unixengdev
    uxengnas1:/export/unixengdev on /apps/unixengdev type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.0.2.15,local_lock=none,addr=28.97.76.59)
    # mount | grep autofs
    systemd-1 on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=34,pgrp=1,timeout=0,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=13393)
    /etc/auto.misc on /misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=5,pgrp=1082,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,indirect,pipe_ino=29495)
    -hosts on /net type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=11,pgrp=1082,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,indirect,pipe_ino=29504)
    /etc/auto.apps on /apps type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=17,pgrp=1082,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,indirect,pipe_ino=29508)

    # excluded_automounts=$(mount |awk '
    <snip>
    # echo $excluded_automounts
    ^(/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc|/misc|/net|/apps)(/|$)

    # mountpoints=$( mount |awk -v x="$excluded_automounts" '$3 !~ x' | grep -vE "type ($excluded_fs_types) |$excluded_other_stuff" | awk '{print $3}' )
    # echo $mountpoints
    / /boot /vagrant /vagrant /home/vagrant/workspace

@hicksdc  
thank you for your issue report and your proposed solution!

I am not at all an autofs and/or NFS expert so I may misunderstand
things.

As far as I understand it the issue is that what `mount` shows as
`type autofs`  
is already automatically excluded but not their descendants  
in particular not descendants that are mounted via NFS  
as in your example the NFS share  
`uxengnas1:/export/unixengdev on /apps/unixengdev type nfs4`

I wonder if it isn't simpler and more straightforward to add  
what `mount` shows as `type nfs*` to the `excluded_fs_types` variable  
instead of some rather complicated `awk` scripting?

According to what `man 8 mount` shows on my oenSUSE Leap 15.2 system  
it seems the only `type nfs*` values are `type nfs` and `type nfs4`.

By the way:  
I wonder if also other network file system types like `cifs` `smbfs`
`ncpfs`  
that are mentioned in `man 8 mount` should get excluded?

Thanks for the quick response @jsmeix !

I did also think about excluding all `nfs*` mounts as a simpler
approach, but assumed that would be unpopular because it would also
exclude those mounts that are not being managed by automount, eg. an
explicit /etc/fstab entry for a permanent NFS filesystem, for which I
assume you would want to include the mount point stat in the backup?
(Perhaps this comes down to a misunderstanding on my part of the purpose
of this particular script, which is that it is simply attempting to
capture details of all mount points that would need to be recreated when
restoring the system...?)

The awk solution was just meant to show a working example really, I
agree that its not pretty and am certain there is a far cleaner way (I'm
no developer! ;) ). But yes, as you say, the key point is that the
descendants of the `type autofs` entries should be excluded *regardless
of their type*, which leads on to your final point...

Other network filesystems could presumably cause a similar problem, but
I think they should simply be subject to the same logic as I've just
discussed - if their mount points are permanent and not being managed
separately by a service eg. automount, then details of those mount
points should be included in the backup.

In general I prefer to let others who already did the work  
do it again for me instead of implementing it again from scratch  
so I think I would prefer to let `findmnt` show parent with its
descendants like

    # findmnt -R -M $parent_mountpoint -n -o TARGET --raw

instead of a selfmade `awk` script.

@hicksdc  
does

    # parent_mountpoint=/apps
    # findmnt -R -M $parent_mountpoint -n -o TARGET --raw | tr -s '[:space:]' ' '

show the right parent with its descendant mountpoints in your case?

I made a preliminary proposal that is not yet at all tested by me via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2613](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2613)

@hicksdc  
could you test if my proposed code there works in your case?

FWIW:  
My implementation got more complicated than I had expected  
so it does not look much simpler than your `awk` scripting.

I wonder if all that additional rather complicated code  
is worth the effort only to avoid that "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
does not hang up when a NFS server becomes unavailable  
while its NFS share mountpoint still exists?

I think any other program that tries to access that NFS share  
would also hang up - so I wonder why exceptional code in ReaR  
to avoid NFS issues outside of in ReaR?

I think only when it makes in general no sense to save and recreate  
any mountpoints below mountpoints of "type autofs"  
then such mountpoints should be excluded.

So the crucial question for me (I am not an autofs expert) is:  
Are any mountpoints below mountpoints of "type autofs"  
always owned by the automounter?  
Or in other words:  
Are all mountpoints below mountpoints of "type autofs"  
always created by the automount daemon?

> Are any mountpoints below mountpoints of "type autofs" always owned by

Yes, or at least they exist on an ancestor mount point that definitely
*is* owned/created by the automounter, ie. it is possible to create a
submountpoint on an automounted mountpoint, but the fact that the
submountpoint is not local means it should be excluded from the backup.
For example:

    # mount /dev/mapper/rootvg-crashvol /apps/unixengdev/path/to/mnt

    # mount | grep /apps
    auto.apps on /apps type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=5,pgrp=1909,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,indirect,pipe_ino=28889)
    uxengnas1:/export/unixengdev on /apps/unixengdev type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,port=0,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=28.97.72.19,local_lock=none,addr=28.97.76.59)
    /dev/mapper/rootvg-crashvol on /apps/unixengdev/path/to/mnt type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)

    # findmnt -RT /apps
    TARGET                           SOURCE                       FSTYPE OPTIONS
    /apps                            auto.apps                    autofs rw,relatime,fd=5,pgrp=1909,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,indirect,pipe_ino=28889
    └─/apps/unixengdev               uxengnas1:/export/unixengdev nfs4   rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,port=0,timeo=600,retrans=2
      └─/apps/unixengdev/path/to/mnt /dev/mapper/rootvg-crashvol  xfs    rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota

.../apps/unixengdev/path/to/mnt was not created or mounted by automount
despite being below /apps, but from a backup point of view we're not
interested in it because the mountpoint is not a local file that would
need to be reproduced.

I have tested your [PR 2613](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2613)
code (with my `findmnt -T` syntax suggestion) against this scenario and
it correctly excludes /apps/unixengdev/path/to/mnt.

So, going back to this discussion:

> still exists?

The NFS failure scenario was just an example intended to add some
gravitas to the argument for excluding all autofs managed mountpoints,
which is what I hope we are now agreeing should be implemented by your
PR?
