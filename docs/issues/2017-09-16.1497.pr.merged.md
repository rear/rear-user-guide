[\#1497 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1497) `merged`: Fix btrfsmountedsubvol exclusion and dependency management

This PR closes the existing gap between 'fs'-type file systems and
mounted btrfs subvolumes (type 'btrfsmountedsubvol').

-   It allows mounted btrfs subvolumes to be excluded like other
    components, for example:

<!-- -->

    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "btrfsmountedsubvol:/mnt/dir" )

-   It enables dependency management for mounted btrfs subvolumes
    (making sure that file systems containing btrfs mount points are
    recreated as well).

Related: \#1496

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS

@OliverO2  
as far as I see this is basically an additional enhancement  
where no existing btrfs behaviour in ReaR could be changed.  
From plain looking at the code the cleanup of the 'lvmdev' and  
'swap' cases into the 'fs|btrfsmountedsubvol|swap|lvmdev' case  
does not change any behaviour in ReaR.  
If I am right, I would "just merge" it.

@OliverO2  
I also see and I do very much appreciate it  
that you replace meaningless, misleading, and confusing  
names like the dummy read variable 'done' (it hurts my eyes  
when I see a variable named e.g. as a shell keyword ;-)  
with a proper name. Many thanks for that!

If there are no objections I will merge it soon...

I have tested that a ReaR recovery still works  
with the SUSE SLES12-SP2 default btrfs structure.

This pull request introduced another regression via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/72810e9594d121ee12b5d8394c9fc9daa31ce749](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/72810e9594d121ee12b5d8394c9fc9daa31ce749)  
in the generate\_layout\_dependencies() function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh via this change (excerpt)

<pre>
-                done < <(grep "^fs" $LAYOUT_FILE)
+                done < <(awk '$1 ~ /^fs|btrfsmountedsubvol$/ { print; }' $LAYOUT_FILE)
</pre>

On SLES11 with btrfs and separated boot partition the  
disklayout.conf file can contain a (correctly) commented entry like:

<pre>
#btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda3 / rw
</pre>

that matches the above new oversophisticated `awk`-ward code  
so that during "rear recover" in the diskdeps.conf file  
something like the following false dependency appears

<pre>
fs:/boot #btrfsmountedsubvol:/
</pre>

but because the correctly commented `#btrfsmountedsubvol` component  
will never be created and because `fs:/boot` (i.e. the filesystem
creation  
of the 'boot' partition) now falsely depends on that
`#btrfsmountedsubvol`  
component the filesystem of the 'boot' partition gets also not created
and  
"rear recover" fails in layout/prepare/default/600\_show\_unprocessed.sh
with

<pre>
No code has been generated to recreate fs:/boot (fs)
To recreate it manually add code to diskrestore.sh or abort.
</pre>

The right (and minimal - i.e. KISS) change should have been

<pre>
-                done < <(grep "^fs" $LAYOUT_FILE)
+                done < <(egrep '^fs |^btrfsmountedsubvol ' $LAYOUT_FILE)
</pre>

so that no such false `#btrfsmountedsubvol` dependency would be
created  
because commented entries in disklayout.conf would no longer match.

@OliverO2  
could you verify if things still work for your particular use case with

@jsmeix Cannot test it right now as I've removed docker from the
installation.

However, I've looked at your change and commented there.
