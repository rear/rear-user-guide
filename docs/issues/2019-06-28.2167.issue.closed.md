Not really an issue, but may I ask why there are two identical files of
each version under [releases](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases) ?  
E.g. you find an entry called "2.5" and another one called "rear-2.5",
"2.4" and "rear-2.4" and so on.  
Checksum and content of the linked files seem to be completely the same?

Is this a github thing?

@malvinas2  
I don't know about the magic details behind  
but from looking at the tag names at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases)  
e.g. `2.5` and `rear-2.5`  
I guess this is because of

    Tag version in master branch:

    git tag -s -a rear-2.xx -m "Rear release 2.xx"
    git tag -s -a 2.xx -m "Rear release 2.xx"

in our `Release process` description at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

I assume the two tags with different names  
for the same thing (i.e. for the same git commit)  
like `2.5` and `rear-2.5` are intentional.
