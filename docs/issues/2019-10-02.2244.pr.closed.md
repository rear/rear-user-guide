-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    Normally there should be no impact but in certain cases  
    the impact could be high because now more filesystems  
    are automatically excluded which could cause regressions  
    for some users (e.g. when someone has /tmp mounted  
    and wants that to be included).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Enhanced AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH in default.conf  
    from only AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH=( /media )  
    to AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )

I need to test what happens  
when one has /tmp on a separated normal filesystem, cf.
