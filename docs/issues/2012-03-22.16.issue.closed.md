dosfslabel returns error output to stdout, so we cannot filter it out
(this happens when eg. there are differences between boot sector and its
backup). This corrupts the label= output for VFAT filesystems in this
case.

The workaround is to only consider the last line from the dosfslabel
output, assuming that errors are *always* printed before the label is
printed. An alternative solution is to depend on vol\_id or blkid.
Workaround implemented in 4976a19b7b05b0d3466c5a8d316181c03439fdfc

Jeroen decided this was sufficient, I am not convinced. So make sure
your FAT file system is not broken ! :-)
