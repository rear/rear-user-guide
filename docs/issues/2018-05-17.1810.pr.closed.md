-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal** /

-   

On some systems (for example centos6 and/or ubuntu) REAR backup with
Backup type SESAM  
fails during verify of the rootfs due to missing libraries:

    /opt/sesam/bin/sesam/Crypto.Hash._SHA256.so requires additional libraries (fatal error)
    libpython2.7.so.1.0 => not found
    /opt/sesam/bin/sesam/cPickle.so requires additional libraries (fatal error)
    libpython2.7.so.1.0 => not found
    ERROR: ReaR recovery system in '/tmp/rear.LyKD3Rt2V4XgYs2/rootfs' not usable

these libraries are part of the Sesam client integration itself but
unfortunately are not found  
due to the sesam installation directory not beeing part of
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH.

For TSM an alike issue has already been fixed as TSM sets the
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:

    ./usr/share/rear/prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh:# Find gsk lib diriectory and add it to the TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ./usr/share/rear/prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh:      TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$gsk_dir

This patch does the same for the sesam client, installation directory is
used from the  
configuration file and not hardcoded.

@abbbi  
in usr/share/rear/prep/SESAM/default/400\_prep\_sesam.sh  
you set a global (i.e. global for all ReaR scripts and all programs
called by them)

<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SM_BIN_SESAM
</pre>

which could have weird unexpected bad side-effects.

I fear setting such a global SESAM-specific LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
for all programs in all ReaR scripts that run after  
usr/share/rear/prep/SESAM/default/400\_prep\_sesam.sh  
might lead to unexpected side effects like described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533\#issuecomment-336622504](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533#issuecomment-336622504)  
because libraries via LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH have  
precedence over the "normal" ones, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562\#issuecomment-342111737](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562#issuecomment-342111737)

See in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562)  
the initial commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562/commits/a9d837027cf4c86d8971eff7a88d932ae8863800](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1562/commits/a9d837027cf4c86d8971eff7a88d932ae8863800)  
how it was tried initially via a global LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH export  
and in contrast the final state  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2938c334a37853bf1d0ec978d89d2806fd4c4d54](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2938c334a37853bf1d0ec978d89d2806fd4c4d54)  
that was actually merged into the ReaR master code at that time.

I suggest to do it for SESAM in the same way as it was actually done for
TSM via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2938c334a37853bf1d0ec978d89d2806fd4c4d54](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2938c334a37853bf1d0ec978d89d2806fd4c4d54)
