-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

2.7

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

Ubuntu 20.04

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Its not currently mentioned in the rear quickstart guide but since rear
2.6 (I think?) users backing up to USB must add the line:

    USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"

To their `rear.conf` for `mkrescue` and `mkbackup` to work, otherwise
rear prints the error:

    ERROR: No nameserver or only loopback addresses in ..., specify a real nameserver via USE_RESOLV_CONF

Surely if the user has set `OUTPUT=USB` rear should know to default to
`USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"` ?

If there is a reason why `USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"` can't be made the
default for `OUTPUT=USB`, making it unnecessary to add in the extra line
to rear.conf, then that option should be added to the example rear.conf
in the quickstart guide:

[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

Otherwise users will get an error on their first attempt at using rear
which isn't a good first impression.

@danboid  
I do not understand how USE\_RESOLV\_CONF is related to OUTPUT.  
As far as I understand it both are totally different things.  
Please explain how USE\_RESOLV\_CONF is related to OUTPUT  
at least in your specific use case and preferably  
how USE\_RESOLV\_CONF is related to OUTPUT in general.

If `OUTPUT=USB` then the user is backing up to and restoring from USB so
there should be no need for networking and DNS to be configured and
hence no need to configure `USE_RESOLV_CONF`.

you can have a USB bootable medium and backup on network. (BACKUP and
OUTPUT are mostly unrelated.)

Right, so the way I should've phrased this is could we have it so that
when BACKUP=usb:///something rear defaults to `USE_RESOLV_CONF=no`?

I would prefer to fix the actual problem. Why does ReaR fail with
`ERROR: No nameserver or only loopback addresses in ..., specify a real nameserver via USE_RESOLV_CONF`
and what is `...` in this message, are there literally three dots?

No, thats me being too lazy to type out a long path to a file.

I should note that this test machine wasn't connected to the internet
when being backed up so resolv.conf may have been missing /
unconfigured.

FYI:  
This is an old issue on Ubuntu that  
there special nameserver stuff is used  
where ReaR's automatisms do not (yet?) work,  
see my USE\_RESOLV\_CONF description in default.conf

I am not an Ubuntu user so I cannot fix ReaR  
when there are Ubuntu specific issues and  
we do not have a ReaR upstream maintainer for Ubuntu.

OK so it looks like the resolution to this is to update the rear.conf in
the quickstart guide with a note that Ubuntu (and Debian too, maybe?
Maybe is caused by netplan which is specific to Ubuntu) users may have
to add the `USE_RESOLV_CONF` option.
