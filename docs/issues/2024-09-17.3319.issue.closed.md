sourcing via '.' in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/dhclient-script and  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
originate from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/38d5bd280654dd4e05a8a408daad8e08925c3ab0](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/38d5bd280654dd4e05a8a408daad8e08925c3ab0)  
which has only this commit message

    Added DHCP client support to rear. Sponsored by J&J.

but this commit is also where  
usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh  
originated and this contains

    +# set of functions that will be used by our own implementation
    +# of dhclient-script, but these can/could be used by other
    +# scripts as well
    +#
    +# Most of the functions are coming from the fedora dhclient-script

So I guess that also  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/dhclient-script and  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
came from Fedora at the time of that commit  
i.e. on Dec 10, 2010

On the one hand this indicates that this code in ReaR  
could be OK (because we may assume Fedora code is OK).

On the other hand this code in ReaR is rather old  
(more than 13 years meanwhile) and I assume  
possible (security) bug fixes at Fedora  
were not backported into ReaR.

This code in ReaR should be checked if it is considered  
to be still sufficiently OK for what ReaR needs  
(DHCP client support in the ReaR recovery system)  
so I filed

I would like to use some more sophisticated parser to identify this use
of `.`, but I have not started this yet.

If you want to make sure that no `.` is used and `source` is used
instead, `enable -n .` is your friend. The `bash` manual says about `.`
that "This builtin is equivalent to ‘source’.", but they can be enabled
or disabled separately:

    $ cat print_foo 
    echo foo
    $ enable -n .
    $ source print_foo 
    foo
    $ . print_foo 
    bash: .: command not found

Regarding

    usr/share/rear/restore/GALAXY/default/400_restore_with_galaxy.sh:
           . ./GxCmd

From plain looking at the code I cannot make sense of it.  
In particular 'GxCmd' appears only in  
usr/share/rear/restore/GALAXY/default/400\_restore\_with\_galaxy.sh  
(excerpts)

    # GxCmd checks for $# and calls the GxCmdLine script if there are any cmdline args.
    ...
            . ./GxCmd
    ...
            ./GxCmd -cmd restore ...

so it seems GxCmd (and GxCmdLine) belong to  
the BACKUP=GALAXY software.  
In this case it is probably OK to source GxCmd  
because the BACKUP=GALAXY software can be trusted.  
Nevertheless it should be verified whether or not  
my above assumption that '. ./GxCmd' can be trusted  
actually holds so I filed

All cases that I found and listed in this issue  
are now done so I close this issue as done.

@pcahyna  
regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319\#issuecomment-2355033810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319#issuecomment-2355033810)  
in particular the part about `enable -n .`

'man bash' reads

    enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name ...]
      Enable and disable builtin shell commands.
      Disabling a builtin allows a disk command
      which has the same name as a shell builtin
      to be  executed ...

Could it be ever possible that a disk command  
named '.' can exist?  
I think it cannot because '.' is the current directory  
but I don't know for sure.

In ReaR we use already in  
usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

    # Make sure nobody else can use trap:
    function trap () {
        BugError "Forbidden usage of trap with '$*'. Use AddExitTask instead."
    }

which seems to also work:

    # function . () { echo "Forbidden usage of '.'" ; }

    # type -a .
    . is a function
    . () 
    { 
        echo "Forbidden usage of '.'"
    }
    . is a shell builtin

    # . print_foo
    Forbidden usage of '.'

    # builtin . print_foo
    foo

Perhaps it is better to use a '.' function?  
In both cases one can still call the shell builtin '.'  
via 'builtin':

    # unset -f .

    # type -a .
    . is a shell builtin

    # enable -n .

    # type -a .
    bash: type: .: not found

    # builtin . print_foo
    foo

I think it is better to use a '.' function  
instead of `enable -n .` because with a function  
we can implement what should happen when '.' is used  
(e.g. BugError or whatever else we like).

I tested with current GitHub master code  
if '.' is used in my personal test case  
by adding at the beginning of sbin/rear

    function . () { echo "Forbidden usage of '.'" ; exit 99 ; }

My personal test case etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.178.66/nfs

    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )
    PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="5"
    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE=''

on a SLES15-SP6 test VM with 15 GiB disk and default btrfs structure.

I tested the following workflows

-   mkbackup
-   recover (on another test VM)
-   help
-   checklayout
-   dump
-   savelayout
-   shell
-   validate

All worked for me in my personal test case.  
Of course this cannot check if '.' is used for other use cases.

While thinking about  
using a '.' function to forbid usage of '.'  
it crossed my mind  
that we could also use a 'source' wrapper function  
so normal usage of 'source' in scripts  
calls our 'source' wrapper function  
so we get a central place in ReaR  
where we keep control over what is sourced  
and where we could implement what we need  
like path-based checks or whatever else  
(e.g. log details in debug mode).

Of course this is not for ReaR 3.0  
but for a ReaR version after ReaR 3.0.

What I will never ever do again is to  
manually search in a clumsy and annoying way  
through all our code where something is sourced.

I did a quick proof of concept  
with current GitHub master code  
by adding at the beginning of sbin/rear

    function source () { echo "Sourcing '$*'" 1>&2 ; builtin source "$@" ; }

on the same SLES15-SP6 test VM  
with 15 GiB disk and default btrfsstructure as above and  
"rear -D mkrescue" worked for my particular test case.

Redirection to stderr is mandatory in the 'source' function  
otherwise things badly error out in 400\_copy\_modules.sh  
which happens - as far as I see at first glance - because of  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/220\_load\_modules\_from\_initrd.sh

    # Fedora, Red Hat & new SUSE uses dracut
    if test -s /etc/dracut.conf ; then
        MODULES_LOAD+=(
            $(
                add_drivers=
                source /etc/dracut.conf
                for s in /etc/dracut.conf.d/*.conf ; do
                    source $s
                done
                echo $add_drivers
            )
        )
    fi

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2244555297](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244555297)

So stdout of 'source ...' gets added to MODULES\_LOAD  
which makes 400\_copy\_modules.sh error out with

    Copying only currently loaded kernel modules (MODULES contains 'loaded_modules') and those in MODULES_LOAD
    ERROR: Sourcing loaded or to be loaded but no module file?

when 'Sourcing' appears on stdout of the 'source' wrapper function.

By the way:  
I found the reason why 400\_copy\_modules.sh errors out  
rather fast and easily via

    # grep '^Sourcing ' var/log/rear/rear-localhost.log | grep -v 'usr/share/rear/'
    Sourcing '/root/rear.github.master/etc/rear/local.conf'
    Sourcing '/etc/dracut.conf'
    Sourcing '/etc/dracut.conf.d/10-persistent_policy.conf'
    Sourcing '/etc/dracut.conf.d/99-debug.conf'
    Sourcing '/etc/dracut.conf.d/ostree.conf'

i.e. the /etc/dracut.conf\* files are the only ones  
we 'source' which look "suspicious" ;-)
