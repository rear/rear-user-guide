I am aware of \#2416. It just does not work for me.

#### Use Case

I invoke `rear mkrescue` without options. An unexpected problem occurs.
I cannot see what went wrong precisely, because relevant error messages
are missing in the log file.

Edit: As @pcahyna has correctly pointed out, this does not apply to
`rear recover` which runs in verbose mode by default.

#### Suggestion

Please do not suppress `stderr` globally. The extra output in the log
file seems way more acceptable than seeing a clean log file when
actually something bad had happened.

The only workaround right now would be to always invoke rear with
verbose or debug options. This seems like overkill as in most case just
the normal stderr would give a reasonable indication what the problem
might have been. Also, increased verbosity makes ReaR harder to use as
more lines appear on the terminal, burying possible important messages.

When there are spots which routinely pollute the log file with expected
output looking like errors, such spots could be cleaned up individually.

Note that `rear recover` is verbose by default.

@pcahyna You are right. This does not apply to `rear recover`. I have
corrected the issue description accordingly.

Seems like I was trained by repeated invocations of `rear mkrescue` with
missing log information that I did not even look into the log file of
`rear recover` as I was not expecting it to contain anything useful.

A practical example. This example is a bit primitive, because in this
case ReaR directly uses an `Error` statement. When we are not that
lucky, the error case would not be checked by ReaR at all, but would
surface sometime later when a follow-up error occurs.

1.  With `stderr` completely suppressed, as is now the case, it looks
    like this:

        $ sudo usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
        ERROR: Mount command 'sshfs maintenance@backup-hub.example.com:/nonexistent /tmp/rear.jIL8Nfe59j0uBjo/outputfs -o rw,noatime' failed.
        Some latest log messages since the last called script 100_mount_output_path.sh:
        2021-06-03 22:28:12.395891117 Including output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh
        2021-06-03 22:28:12.406362038 Mounting with 'sshfs maintenance@backup-hub.example.com:/nonexistent /tmp/rear.jIL8Nfe59j0uBjo/outputfs -o rw,noatime'
        Aborting due to an error, check /home/oliver/Repositories/open-source/rear/var/log/rear/rear-juliet.log for details
        Terminated

    -   So a `Mount command ... failed`. Why that? User not existing?
        Host name misspelled? Permission denied? Something else?

    -   The last action logged was `Mounting with...`, then afterwards
        (we do not know whether immediately or several statements later)
        "an error" occurred.

    -   ReaR tells me to check the log file for details, but there is no
        further information than what is shown above, followed by
        `Exiting rear mkrescue...`.

2.  With `stderr` going to the log file, it looks like this:

        $ sudo usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
        ERROR: Mount command 'sshfs maintenance@backup-hub.example.com:/nonexistent /tmp/rear.IeoteOoHosexvDi/outputfs -o rw,noatime' failed.
        Some latest log messages since the last called script 100_mount_output_path.sh:
        2021-06-03 22:26:07.247867501 Including output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh
        2021-06-03 22:26:07.258859399 Mounting with 'sshfs maintenance@backup-hub.example.com:/nonexistent /tmp/rear.IeoteOoHosexvDi/outputfs -o rw,noatime'
        maintenance@backup-hub.example.com:/nonexistent: No such file or directory
        Aborting due to an error, check /home/oliver/Repositories/open-source/rear/var/log/rear/rear-juliet.log for details
        Terminated

    -   This immediately shows the root cause of the problem:

            maintenance@backup-hub.example.com:/nonexistent: No such file or directory

    -   The log file contains the above information (including the root
        cause), plus a stack trace, showing the line numbers of all
        statements which were executed at the time, followed by
        `Exiting rear mkrescue...`.

Only a quick initial note:

I implemented  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498)  
intentionally as I did it because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2473](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2473)  
therein in particular because of how users experienced it as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2473\#issuecomment-670483657](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2473#issuecomment-670483657)

I do not want to spend any more minute of my precious time with  
possible further issue reports where users who call `rear` or
`rear -v`  
misunderstand some message from some program as an error of ReaR.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498)  
we (i.e. the ReaR developers) control what users see up to `rear -v`.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498)  
the user must explicitly request to also get "low level 'debug'
messages"  
and then he is hopefully experienced enough to not misunderstand  
arbitrary messages from programs (where we have no control what  
a particular program may show under what specific curcumstances)  
as an error of ReaR.

Personally I always use `rear -D` because I need that during
development.

I think users who are interested what goes on "behind ReaR's surface"  
must use at least `rear -d`.

@OliverO2  
is there a reason why you can't use `rear -d`?

Should it perhaps be better documented that  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498)  
what goes on "behind ReaR's surface" is intentionally hidden  
to make the content in the log less confusing for users  
unless 'debug' messaging was explicitly requested?

1.  I understand that you don't want to answer repeated enquiries about
    stderr messages which are just part of ReaR's normal operation. The
    underlying problem should definitely be fixed.

2.  Globally suppressing errors is considered an unsafe development
    practice. This is based on a long history of failures. If we'd go
    down that route, we will experience missing substantial error
    messages over and over again, on the console and in log files. It is
    impossible to foresee all conditions which might result in an
    important error. I/O errors and out-of-memory errors, for example,
    can occur at any time.

3.  I generally invoke `rear mkrescue` without any options as I need to
    focus on the task. What's the task?

    -   The task is getting a reliable rescue medium.
    -   The task is *not* to learn about ReaR's internal operations.
    -   The task is *not* to debug ReaR.

    So on the console and in the log file, I want *substantial
    information only*, not more, not less. Each additional (unimportant)
    line of output distracts me, wastes my time and risks that I
    overlook something important.

    Now look what happens:

    -   `rear mkrescue` already outputs three lines, none of which is
        important for me, but I can live with that:
            Ignoring non-existing btrfs subvolume listed as mounted: /var/lib/docker/btrfs
            Symlink '/lib/modules/5.8.0-55-generic/build' -> '/usr/src/linux-headers-5.8.0-55-generic' refers to a non-existing directory on the recovery system.
            It will not be copied by default. You can include '/usr/src/linux-headers-5.8.0-55-generic' via the 'COPY_AS_IS' configuration variable.

    -   `rear -d mkrescue` outputs 112 lines, all about ReaR's internal
        considerations, none of which is important for me. This puts an
        unnecessary cognitive load on me ("What if I miss some important
        information in between?") and distracts me from my task. As a
        user, I feel disrespected when I have to bear this:

        function Log() {
            echo "LOG: $*" > /dev/tty
        }

        function expect_stderr() {

            if [[ "$VERBOSE" ]]; then
                { stderr_output=$("$@" 2>&1 1>&9-) ;} 9>&1
                exit_status=$?
                [[ -n "$stderr_output" ]] && Log "[THIS MESSAGE IS EXPECTED] $stderr_output"
            else
                "$@" 2>/dev/null
                exit_status=$?
            fi
            return $exit_status
        }

        function has_binary() {
            for bin in "$@"; do
                expect_stderr type $bin 1>/dev/null && return 0
            done
            return 1
        }

        echo "***VERBOSE unset"
        for x in /bin/bash /bin/basxh; do
            has_binary $x && echo has $x || echo no $x
        done

        echo ""

        done
