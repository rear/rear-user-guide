-   How was this pull request tested?

On a SLES15-SP6 VM "rear mkrescue" plus "rear mkbackuponly"  
and then on another VM "rear recover" worked for me  
with some artificial sourcing via '.' as a test  
in etc/rear/local.conf

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Avoid the regression that I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259\#issuecomment-2730011077](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259#issuecomment-2730011077)

    With https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424 merged
    there will be regressions when third-party scripts
    use '.' for sourcing because currently sourcing via '.'
    is always forbidden in ReaR.

This is a regression so it is a bug in ReaR because  
'source' is not POSIX compliant because  
'.' is the POSIX standard command  
so ReaR must not forbid using '.' in any case  
but allow it when really needed.

To implement trusted sourcing via '.'  
in \_framework-setup-and-functions.sh  
an additional '.' wrapper function is implemented  
to enforce trusted sourcing via '.' for exceptional cases  
for files which are specified in TRUSTED\_SOURCING\_VIA\_DOT  
plus the needed adaptions in sbin/rear for that and  
the TRUSTED\_SOURCING\_VIA\_DOT description in default.conf

I will do some more testing today and tomorrow  
as needed and as time permits.

I did some more tests with various changes for  
TRUSTED\_OWNERS TRUSTED\_PATHS TRUSTED\_SOURCING\_VIA\_DOT  
and all worked for me as I expect it  
(which may not mean very much because I cannot  
perform really unexpected tests for my own code).

As always sleeping on an issue helps!

The implementation in this pull request is nonsense  
because its implementation idea is false because  
the idea behind to forbid '.' in general is false.

Reasoning:

Because '.' is the POSIX standard command  
POSIX compliant third party software rightfully uses '.'  
so ReaR must not enforce an environment where '.' is  
forbidden in general.

Assume ReaR calls some tool which has various shell scripts  
which use the POSIX compliant '.' (e.g. dracut is such a tool)  
then ReaR must not enforce an environment where the user  
would have to specify each script that uses '.' to be allowed.

The right solution:

The right solution is a '.' wrapper function which enforces  
that '.' is not used in a ReaR script or in a ReaR config file  
but which allows '.' in any non-ReaR files.

What ReaR still can enforce is an environment  
where all what is executed via 'source' or '.'  
is checked to be trustworthy, i.e. for each  
file that is executed via 'source' or '.'  
its owner must be one of the TRUSTED\_OWNERS and  
it must be located below one of the TRUSTED\_PATHS.

I.e. ReaR can enforce an environment where ReaR  
decides what files ReaR will directly or indirectly  
execute via 'source' or '.' but ReaR must not  
enforce an environment where ReaR decides that  
executing via the POSIX compliant '.' is forbidden.

FYI:

I have something in the works (unfinished, barely tested) in my
