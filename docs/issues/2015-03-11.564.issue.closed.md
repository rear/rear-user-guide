[\#564 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564) `closed`: Exit codes
===========================================================================

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `discuss / RFC`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/432453?v=4" width="50">[clausa](https://github.com/clausa) opened issue at [2015-03-11 14:22](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564):

We are running "/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue"
from cron.

If EXIT\_CODE gets set to a non-zero value anywhere in the code,
/usr/sbin/rear writes "WARNING rc=$EXIT\_CODE" to syslog. That triggers
a logcheck script to notify our monitoring system - so someone can look
into this.

However, if there is a change in the layout, EXIT\_CODE is set to 1, in
order to trigger mkrescue to run.

Unfortunately that also result in a WARNING in syslog, which creates a
false alarm.

Any suggestions, on how to "fix" this?

EXIT\_CODE=1 must be kept for the cron entry so that mkrescue is getting
triggered.  
We could have different exit codes. e.g. EXIT\_CODE=2 for serious
errors...  
*Proposal:*

-   EXIT\_CODE=0 : no issue found
-   EXIT\_CODE=1 : layout changed (needed to trigger mkrescue). I would
    like to see this logged as well in syslog, but how to formulate
    this? `NOTICE: rear layout changed - trigger mkrescue` or something
    like that?
-   EXIT\_CODE&gt;1 : serious error that should get logged in syslog

@gdha  
why must it be "EXIT\_CODE=1" for cron?

I think in general the exit code value '1' is used for "anything
wrong"  
and not to indicate a specific outcome.

In rear-1.17.0 in usr/sbin/rear I don't see a reason why the EXIT\_CODE
value for cron cannot be something else.

In particular in usr/sbin/rear it seems "EXIT\_CODE=1" is already used
for "ERROR: The specified command '$WORKFLOW' does not exist !"

If my understanding is right I would like to suggest something like:

EXIT\_CODE=0 : no issue found

EXIT\_CODE=1 : default value for "anything wrong"

EXIT\_CODE=2 ... EXIT\_CODE=9 : reserved for specific fatal errors.

EXIT\_CODE&gt;9 : reserved to indicate a specific outcome

in particular currently used:

EXIT\_CODE=11 : layout changed

For background info what I have in mind see the exit codes of CUPS
backends and see CUPS filters how messages are prefixed there, see  
"Exit Codes" at  
[http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.7/man-backend.html](http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.7/man-backend.html)

I am actually against using exit codes as an official interface. My
favourite bad example are the [rsync exit
codes](http://wpkg.org/Rsync_exit_codes) Where 24 means that all is fine
but some source files disappeared between scanning and transferring. The
result is that whereever I use rsync in a script I must check the exit
code and add code to handle 24 like 0.

Therefore I suggest to use exit codes &gt; 0 only as a signal to tell
the outside world that we could not do our job as expected. More
advanced stuff should be done via an explicit interface so that you can
write something like this

    res=$(rear something) || deal_with_error
    if [[ "$res" == *need-new-rescue-image* ]] ; then
        do_something_else
    fi

IMHO that is much more legible than for example

    rear something
    res=$?
    if (( res == 11 )) ; then
        do_something
    elif (( res > 0 )) ; then
        deal_with_error
    fi

For the case of creating a cron job to run ReaR if the layout changed I
would always opt to add stuff to rear to keep the conditionals out of
the cron job. Within ReaR we have much more detail and context infos
available to make decisions.

In this specific example I would rather extend ReaR to support something
like

    rear mkrescue --if-layout-changed

so that you can rely on ReaR to do the right thing. And if the exit code
is &gt;0 then you know for sure that there was a problem.

@schlomo

when exit codes are used as an interface I agree that the ranges of
error exit codes and non-error exit codes must be strictly separated.

If I understand you correctly you propose some special stdout (or
perhaps also stderr) messages as an official interface.

Currently I don't have an opinion if this is good or bad.

But couldn't that conflict with other output when e.g. "rear -v" is
used?  
For example accidentally "rear -v" might output something like "No
layout change -&gt; skipping need-new-rescue-image". What I mean is: If
some special messages are an official interface every contributor to
rear must carefully avoid to output something that matches the special
messages by accident.

Only a quick idea:

What about using specific prefixed lines on stdout as official interface
like:

<pre>
$ rear --very-verbose something
Hello,
my name is rear!
How are you?
INFO: I do now 'something' for you:
DEBUG: Init 'something'
Hello, my name is something!
DEBUG: Cheking whether or not need-new-rescue-image
INFO: Found new device /dev/sdX mounted as /dev/sdX9 at /foo
disk layout has changed => need-new-rescue-image
INTERFACE: need-new-rescue-image
I am fine!
ERROR: failed to read /etc/fstab
Oops!
I am no longer fine!
I abort now... 
$ echo $?
1
</pre>

I would rather think about defining call backs. That means that you have
to specify a program that will be called if ReaR has to tell something.
Could be something as simple es `echo >special_file` or something that
talks to a central ReaR management service.

@schlomo

Do I understand your "defining call backs" correctly that this is
another different interface how rear could communicate with "the outer
world"  
because I think "defining call backs" does not match what you wrote in
your example above "res=$(rear something)".

If I understand it correctly there are now three proposals for an
interface how rear could communicate with "the outer world":

-   Using exit codes
-   Using stdout/stderr messages
-   Using call backs

I think this particular issue has revealed a general issue in rear that
currently it is not yet well defined how rear would communicate with
"the outer world".

Perhaps a new separated issue should be created for the general issue
how rear would communicate with "the outer world" and this issue here is
only about how rear could tell when the disk layout has changed (or when
in general a new rescue image is needed, e.g. also when kernel drivers
have changed).

You are right. This is a topic which should be discussed in greater
detail. What I meant is that if to go beyond a simple single reply on
stdout then I would rather opt for a call back system.

So far we use echo and read to communicate with the user. I think that
this should be moved to a library that could then be customized to use a
call back.

To go back to the original issue as opened by @clausa, I think that it
would be enough to simply add a `rear mkrescue --only-if-changed`
feature or something similar. @clausa, could you please comment what
would be the most simple solution to your problem?

@schlomo being able to just call something like
`rear mkrescue --only-if-changed` would definitely solve our 'problem'.
So +1 from here.

I just had a look. May way to implement this would be to take a checksum
of the layout and gracefully exit if the checksum did not change after
saving the layout.

@schlomo  
regarding a "rear mkrescue --only-if-changed" feature:

Perhaps I am overanxious and I do not have sufficient overview knowledge
of the whole rear but I fear such a feature could become a nightmare to
implement and to keep it working correctly.

I think "rear mkrescue --only-if-changed" promises the user that he will
get a new rear recovery system image when anything has changed that
requires a new recovery system.

This means when any such change is by accident not recognized and later
recovery fails because the recovery system is outdated, then the user
rightfully complains that rear is guilty.

Without such a feature it is left to the user to decide if he needs a
new recovery system (i.e. in case of doubt he would just make it anew).

In contrast a specific feature like "rear mkrescue
--if-disklayout-changed" is perfectly o.k. from my point of view because
it can be documented that this means any change in the disklayout.conf
file (nothing more, nothing less).

When several such specific "rear mkrescue --if-this-changed", "rear
mkrescue --if-that-changed" features are implemented, a general "rear
mkrescue --if-changed" feature could be just a simpler way to call "rear
mkrescue --if-this-changed --if-that-changed" but this would not mean
the user gets a new recovery system image when anything has changed that
requires a new recovery system.

So your concern is mostly about the wording? No problem.

In any case, if I would implement this then I would not change any
existing behaviour but extend mkrescue (and possibly mkbackup) to drop
out quickly if nothing relevant changed.

In any case there would be some remaining risk involved. Imagine a
server beeing set up and getting OS updated over 5 years. In many cases
the disk layout would not change in those 5 years. But the ReaR version
and the kernel would change.

To successfully recover this system on *new* hardware you would really
need the recent ReaR version and OS kernel from all those updates. But
since you never created a new Rescue Image you will try to recover your
system with a Linux and ReaR that is 5 years old.

I actually believe that this example covers a majority of use cases in a
data center.

Coming back to the original issue of @clausa I can think of the
following:

-   Why don't you create a new rescue image every day, week or month?
    Why try to optimize this point? How much money or time does this
    optimization actually save you?
-   Provide a Pull request to optionally disable logging to syslog
-   Provide a Pull request that makes rear not log a warning if there
    was no Error (Maybe it is indeed a bug that we log a warning there)

Looking at 7820c992 where that behaviour was added I see a reference to
OVO which was apparently used somewhere to collect infos about ReaR.
@gdha, could you please try to remember what was the background there?
Is it really necessary to log **any** exit code != 0 to syslog as a
warning? Or maybe it would be enough to log the actual Errors?

Bottom line, after looking at everything I start to believe that it
would be more "logical" that an exit code != 0 should be logged to
syslog as info and not as warning. After all, it can be part of regular
operations.

@schlomo Indeed it was added on request of an important customer (who
actually pay for writing code) for picking it up via OVO as there are
thousands of Linux systems and nobody seemed to know how many failures
there where on a weekly basis. So, what @clausa does not want to see, is
not what my customer wanted... To be honest I believe it is good
practice if you see a warning to always do a quick check of the log
file. Better one check too many then a failed recovery afterwards...

@gdha, are you 100% sure that your OVO customer actually needs the
WARNING line in syslog for all cases where the exit code was != 0? Or do
they more care about catching the ERROR lines which are generated by our
Error function?

Could you talk to the OVO customer about the cases where a non-0 exit
code is actually the desired behaviour? Maybe now they have some filters
in their monitoring to remove those "false positives" and maybe they
could also benefit from improving this topic?

significantly.

@gdha That sounds great! IMHO we should drop the WARNING line
altogether. A WARNING is in my experience totally useless. Either I
treat it as an error and live with a lot of false positives or I ignore
it and only care about errors.

I would rather like to improve ReaR to throw an Error if we think that a
human should check and not bother humans in all other cases.

@schlomo  
interesting information! On the one hand I fully agree with your
reasoning why warning messages are useless but on the other hand I would
like to be able to show warnings as a programmer when there are issues
where I can continue the program in a reasonable way but with an
uncertain feeling if this is what the user actually wanted.

For example:

<pre>
# /bin/showsomething --output-mode=color
WARNING: output-mode=color unsupported on this terminal, using fallback output-mode=ASCII
</pre>

in contrast to using the fallback silently or abort.

Perhaps for rear it could be a special case that there is nothing in
between success and failure for a disaster recovery tool?  
If yes, would this mean that rear must abort for any kind of issue?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) commented at [2015-03-26 10:25](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564#issuecomment-86441426):

In my experience the wish for "warnings" is actually an expression of
not trusting the software. As a software program, emitting a "warning"
means that you want to shed the responsibility to actually decide if
this is an error or not.

But the only thing you achieve as a program is to make your human waste
time on false positives.

That is why I am against warnings. A program should call my attention to
something only if I must take action as a result.

Your example with the color mode is perfectly showing my point: There is
actually no action the user can take right now, the user can only accept
it as it is. The only real "action" the user could possibly take is to
use the program in a different way (from a color terminal). But since
the user happens to use the program from an ASCII terminal, he probably
has a reason for doing so and the warning does not help at all.

Therefore in your example the warning is a false positive because there
is nothing one can do about it. I would really prefer your showsomething
program to either issue an info message or - even better - to just shut
up about this. If I miss the color output I will start myself to look
into it. For that purpose a verbose or debug message would be much
better suited.

Or put different: Warnings are only useful for people who want to run
their environment manually. For those who build automation all kind of
warnings are a curse.

Many thanks for your great explanation!

In particular your "emitting a 'warning' means that you want to shed the
responsibility to actually decide if this is an error or not" describes
exactly what at least my motivation as programmer is in such cases - as
I wrote "uncertain feeling".

Your "issue an info message" is also an interesting point that makes
things very clear.

The issue is not that a program must run either silently successfully or
abort with an ERROR message,  
the issue is only that WARNING messages are useless.

If I understand it correctly the following would be o.k.:

<pre>
# /bin/showsomething --output-mode=color
INFO: output-mode=color unsupported on this terminal, using fallback output-mode=ASCII

# echo $?
0

# /bin/showsomething --output-mode=color 2>/dev/null

# echo $?
0

# /bin/showsomething --debug --output-mode=color
DEBUG: TERM=ibmmono
INFO: output-mode=color unsupported on this terminal, using fallback output-mode=ASCII

# echo $?
0

@jsmeix

Thanks for the heads-up. I'm pretty sure this change will bring the
issue raised in this ticket. (as "failed" in logfiles will also raise an
alarm in our systems).

I might be wrong, but IIRC the issues is merely related to how non-zero
exit codes are being used. A change in the disklayout is IMHO not a
failure, but it will be logged as "rear checklayout failed with exit
code 1" as RC has been set to 1 in order to notify/trigger "mkrescue"

As far as I see the root cause that  
usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500\_compare\_layout.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/510\_compare\_files.sh  
set EXIT\_CODE=1  
if disk layout or config files have changed  
is still not solved.

Therefore one cannot distinguish between a real failure  
where a non zero exit code is right and the misuse of  
a non zero exit code to signal something.

With the new syslog messages you see at least the workflow  
so that you can implement special "failure" handling when  
the checklayout workflow ends with non zero exit code.

I think I cannot solve it in a backward compatible way.  
Therefore I think I will "just add another special case hack"  
to usr/sbin/rear when the checklayout workflow ends.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1133](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1133)  
I implemented special case syslog message  
when the checklayout workflow exits with exit code 1.  
Now in /var/log/messages it look like

<pre>
rear[13332]: 12759: rear checklayout finished with zero exit code
</pre>

versus (when the checklayout workflow exits with exit code 1)

<pre>
rear[11460]: 10888: rear checklayout finished with exit code 1 (layout or config changed)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1133](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1133)
merged  
I consider this issue to be again fixed.

The root cause "misuse of non-zero exit codes"  
is not yet solved and will not be solved for ReaR 2.0
