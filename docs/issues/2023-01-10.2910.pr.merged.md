-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I cannot test it because I don't have PPC hardware.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
remove the  
"mount --bind &lt;proc|sys|dev&gt; at TARGET\_FS\_ROOT"  
section because that is meanwhile done generically in  
finalize/default/110\_bind\_mount\_proc\_sys\_dev\_run.sh  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045)

But there the file  
finalize/Linux-ppc64le/...\_install\_grub2.sh  
was accidentally forgotten  
(see its initial description).

and therein see the change for  
finalize/Linux-i386/...\_install\_grub2.sh  
which we supplement now also for  
finalize/Linux-ppc64le/...\_install\_grub2.sh

At a quick glance it looks good to me, but I have not tested it either.
