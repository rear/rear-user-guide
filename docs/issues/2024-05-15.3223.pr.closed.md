I added my somewhat unrelated looking improvement  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223/commits/2a65eab4c254eae4c405836eaad4f09541497575](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3223/commits/2a65eab4c254eae4c405836eaad4f09541497575)  
just here "by the way" because while debugging it in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-2112594449](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-2112594449)  
I got a bit confused because it was not clear to me  
if ReaR's TMP\_DIR was used versus the system's TMPDIR  
so I inspected the code in usr/sbin/rear which was

        if ! [[ "$RECOVERY_MODE" || "$PORTABLE" ]] ; then
            ...
                tmpdir_debug_info="Setting TMPDIR to '$TMP_DIR' (was unset when ReaR was launched)"
            ...
        else
            ...
                tmpdir_debug_info="Setting TMPDIR to '$TMPDIR' (was unset when ReaR was launched)"

i.e. same message text like

    Setting TMPDIR to '/var/tmp' (was unset when ReaR was launched)

for two different cases so it was not possible  
to see from the message text which case it was.  
The '/var/tmp' indicates it was the second case  
but that is not 100% clear.  
So that I had to reverse-engineer things  
to understand what actually goes on.  
With the improvement it looks like

    Setting TMPDIR to ReaR's '/var/tmp/rear.3pc7RyD4Ki2uoMC/tmp' (was unset when ReaR was launched)

versus

    Setting TMPDIR to '/var/tmp' (was unset when ReaR was launched)

@rear/contributors  
I would be happy if one of you could review it  
because I would like to merge it today afternoon  
i.e. before the long Pentecost weekend  
which starts already tomorrow for me.

Good catch, can I suggest putting that "create recovery dir" topic into
a very early (potentially new) script in the prep stage and not into the
script that currently is the first one to require it?

It seems the whole  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/400\_save\_directories.sh  
needs to be moved to a 'layout' stage because  
usr/share/rear/prep/README reads (excerpt)

    You should not put scripts into this 'prep' stage that modify things
    in ROOTFS_DIR or in VAR_DIR/recovery and VAR_DIR/layout because
    scripts for ROOTFS_DIR belong to the 'rescue' stage and scripts
    for VAR_DIR/recovery and VAR_DIR/layout belong to the 'layout' stages.

This is something for later...

The problem is that what 400\_save\_directories.sh implements  
does not belong to what is meant with "disk layout"  
(i.e. storage volumes, partitions, filesystems, mountpoints)  
so 400\_save\_directories.sh should not be in a 'layout' stage.

Next week - as time permits - I will try to make  
a proper fix that obsoletes this one.

An offhanded thought:

Perhaps what 400\_save\_directories.sh implements  
could even belong to what is meant with "disk layout"  
(i.e. storage volumes, partitions, filesystems, mountpoints)  
because when "mountpoints" belong to "disk layout"  
then "basic system directories" (i.e. FHS directories)  
could also belong - in a broader sense - to "disk layout".

In particular because 400\_save\_directories.sh  
first and foremost saves directories  
that are used as mountpoints at least those belong  
to "disk layout" even in the narrow sense  
so 400\_save\_directories.sh could sufficiently well  
belong to the 'layout/save' stage.

An even further offhanded thought:

When what 400\_save\_directories.sh implements  
belongs to what is meant with "disk layout"  
then what its counterpart 900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh  
implements could also belong to recreating "disk layout".

So 900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh could be moved  
from after the backup was restored  
to the earlier layout/recreate stage  
and renamed into e.g. create\_basic\_directories.sh  
(and save\_directories.sh renamed into save\_basic\_directories.sh)  
where both ensure that all mountpoint directories  
and all FHS directories get properly recreated  
before they get used, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-2114478980](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-2114478980)  
where /mnt/local/tmp was created with wrong permissions  
because of plain

    mkdir -p /mnt/local/tmp

in diskrestore.sh

I think there is another reason to move it: `prep` scripts run also
during mkbackuponly, but we need to save directories only during the
rescue image creation, not backup creation.

There is prior art for saving and restoring such "fixups" (information
that may be missing in backup) to the restored files.

For example rescue/NETFS/default/610\_save\_capabilities.sh (saves
capabilities, restored by
restore/NETFS/default/510\_set\_capabilities.sh ) . I am sure I saw some
other, but I don't remember them now. Some common approach would be
great.

IMO, this won't work. You need to create mountpoints before they are
used, but after the containing filesystem is created. E.g. if `/var` and
`/var/tmp` are separate filesystems, you can't create `/var/tmp` as a
directory in the empty root file system. You need to create it only
after the `/var` filesystem has been created and mouted. Therefore
moutpoint creation needs to be interspersed with filesystem creation and
mounting in diskrestore.sh.
