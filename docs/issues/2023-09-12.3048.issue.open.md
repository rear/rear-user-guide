Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git

Is there a way to selectively purge previous backups, say by date/age?

On all my systems using `rear` for backup, I use external media: USB
thumb, USB drive, etc. After running backups several times, I eventually
fill up the media and get that dreaded "no room" error message. I don't
know how `rear` stores/structures its backup sets so I never go poking
around in the backup media. I don't want to break a recovery. My
"solution" when running out of space has been to reformat the backup
media before running a backup session. This works but is not ideal as I
lose all previous backups.

Is there a way - *even manual!* - to go in to where the backup sets are
stored and remove one or more that are older/oldest to free up space for
the next backup?

Simplest solution from my point of view  
in particular with flash memory based storage  
like USB sticks or USB SSDs:

Never use one same medium for more than one backup.  
Never use a medium with a recent backup that you may need  
to store one more backup on it.  
For each backup use a separated clean medium.

Reason:  
When a medium gets broken all the backups on it will be lost.  
When you store another backup on a medium where a recent backup  
already is, something could get wrong and both backups get lost.

In particular flash memory based storage  
can all of a sudden become no longer accessible.  
I had this once with a SSD that "just disappeared" during normal  
usage - i.e. the SSD drive was suddenly no longer recognized  
neither by the operating system nor by the computer's firmware.  
The system had worked stable and reliably until that happened.  
Tons of "well-intended advice" out there in the Internet  
what one could do were useless.  
That SSD had a sudden death.

Alternatively:  
Save money and store several backups on one medium  
and pay with a higher risk of a final disaster.

If you perfer that higher risk of a final disaster,  
have a look at "USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR" in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

How to manually clean up old backups for OUTPUT=USB:

The USB disk which is made by ReaR is a normal (bootable)  
Linux disk with normal partitions (and bootloader setup)  
and filesystems that can be normally mounted under Linux  
so you could manually change things as you like.

What exactly there is on a ReaR USB disk  
depends on your ReaR configuration  
and if you use BIOS or UEFI.

In general see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular those excerpts

    ReaR is neither a backup software
    nor a backup management software
    and it is not meant to be one.
    ... 
    ReaR only calls an external tool that does the backup of the files
    during "rear mkbackup" ... (by default that tool is 'tar').
    ...
    It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent ...
    ...
    there is basically nothing in ReaR that deals in any further way
    with what to do with the backup
    ...
    After a "rear mkbackup" run the user has to do on his own
    whatever is appropriate in his particular environment
    how to further deal with the backup
