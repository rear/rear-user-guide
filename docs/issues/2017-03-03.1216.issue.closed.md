I would like to implement a new variable  
FIRMWARE\_FILES  
where the user can specify which firmware files  
get included in the ReaR recovery system.

This enhancement is based on the experience in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142\#issuecomment-276015345](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142#issuecomment-276015345)

<pre>
It seems more than the half of ReaR's initrd
on my x86_64 system is used for firmware.
</pre>

and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142\#issuecomment-283324917](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142#issuecomment-283324917)

<pre>
After removing /usr/lib/firmware contents
except for /usb/lib/firmware/rtl_nic ...
I ended up with ...
initrd.xz with xz lzma compression (48327540 bytes)
</pre>

In particular an explicit FIRMWARE\_FILES variable  
that is documented in default.conf gives the user the final power  
to decide what gets included in the ReaR recovery system.  
Regarding "give the user the final power" cf.  
"too much secretly working 'magic automatisms' in ReaR" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-282252947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-282252947)

Furthermore the FIRMWARE\_FILES variable could be  
a good template case for variables have ternary semantics, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212\#issuecomment-283698753](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212#issuecomment-283698753)

My currently planned ternary semantics for  
FIRMWARE\_FILES will be:

FIRMWARE\_FILES=""  
means "whatever reasonable automated behaviour"

FIRMWARE\_FILES="yes" (or any explicit 'true' value)  
means "include all firmware files in the ReaR recovery system"

FIRMWARE\_FILES="no" (or any explicit 'false' value)  
means "include no firmware file in the ReaR recovery system"

Finally the FIRMWARE\_FILES variable might become  
also a template case for variables that have multiple semantics:

For example in addition to the ternary semantics above  
the FIRMWARE\_FILES could also be an array  
of explicitly listed firmware files that will be included in the  
ReaR recovery system and/or filename globbing patterns  
that are used as '-iname' arguments for 'find' calls to find  
firmware files in the /lib/firmware/ directory that will get  
included in the ReaR recovery system.

Regarding variables that can have multiple semantics  
cf. how UEFI\_BOOTLOADER can be specified since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212)  
is merged (see the current default.conf).

With a FIRMWARE\_FILES variable  
that gives the user the final power to decide  
what gets included in the ReaR recovery system  
it may then even work on ppc64le in BareMetal Mode (PowerNV)  
with yaboot, cf.

I did clean up my firmware directory to just over 92K.

I think I'd rather see a warning message during rescue creation, in case
firmware is relative large, as a reminder to clean up the firmware
folder on that (new) machine too.

On second thought, this feature is actually quite usable: I don't need
networking to restore my system from the USB drive. So I don't need any
firmware at all copied into the initrd file.

ReaR will not do things like "clean up the firmware folder".

In general ReaR must not change any existing file  
of the original system.  
The only thing what happens during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
on the original system is that ReaR creates its working directory  
where ReaR builds its rescue/recovery system ISO image  
(cf. TMPDIR in default.conf).

The only exception that I know about where ReaR can change  
even crucial files of the original system is GRUB\_RESCUE  
but that functionality is disabled by default (cf. default.conf).

During "rear recover" ReaR should not change the recreated system.  
During "rear recover" ReaR should recreate the system as much as  
possible as it was before (except in case of bigger new harddisk  
where ReaR will try to adapt the partitioning to the new harddisk  
by its so called "migration mode").  
During "rear recover" ReaR will restore the files of the original  
system as they were saved in the backup during "rear mkbackup"  
and there is the special BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY  
functionality that does nothing by default (see default.conf).

I will use the variable name FIRMWARE\_FILES  
(instead of my initial idea REAR\_INITRD\_FIRMWARE)  
to have this variable name in compliance with  
the existing variable name KERNEL\_FILE.

Some more experience is shared. Even after cleaning up the host machine
its firmware directory,

> Finished running 'build' stage in 21 seconds

of running `mkrescue` workflow, which finishes in 31 seconds in total.

With 68% of time in the build stage, that phase is longing for speed
improvements.

Like excluding certain copy paths in
[build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh),
a variable where a more advanced user can specify exclusions like for
example:

    /lib/modules/*-ARCH/kernel/drivers/net/
    /lib/modules/*-ARCH/kernel/fs/cifs/
    /lib/modules/*-ARCH/kernel/net/ 

When not needing networking in the rescue system, exclude SSH
permissions adjustment from
[build/GNU/Linux/150\_adjust\_permissions.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/150_adjust_permissions.sh)

@ProBackup-nl  
regarding what kernel modules get included in the recovery system see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)  
and regarding what I intend to improve there see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202\#issuecomment-284377443](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202#issuecomment-284377443)  
but all this happens "as time permits" for me which currently means  
it has to wait because currently I have to work on other areas  
which is currently mainly printing related stuff, cf.
