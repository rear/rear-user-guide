-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    rear-1.17.2

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL-7.2 Server

-   Brief description of the issue  
    There are no information about run of backup creation if user
    started rear with command `rear mkbackup` and others options
    (mkrescue, etc.). User would appreciate to see that ISO was created
    and path to it. Maybe more information.

-   Example:

    No information about rear run.

<!-- -->

    # rear mkbackup
    #

Information about rear run in verbose mode, user can see what was done
and path to output rescue image and backup. This mode is more talkative.

    # rear -v mkbackup
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-rearclient.log

-   Expected result:

    Output between run default and verbose mode.

    At least what was created and place where it is saved (and there can
    be more information than I specified):

<!-- -->

    # rear mkbackup
    Wrote ISO image: /var/lib/rear/output/rear-rearclient.iso (111M)
    Creating tar archive '/tmp/rear.M58WbZYxasPHrZs/outputfs/rearclient/backup.tar.gz'

And information that backup and rescue image was saved to server
$IP\_ADDRESS.

This is intended since version 1.11.0.

doc/rear-release-notes.txt reads:

<pre>
Version 1.11.0 (May 2011)
...
The rear command is by default quiet, which means
if you want the same behavior as in previous versions
you need to add the verbose option (-v) with the rear
command
</pre>
