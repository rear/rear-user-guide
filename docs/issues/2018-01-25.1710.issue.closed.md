#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / Git

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux Server release 7.4 (Maipo) (it is RHEL 7.4 for
    ppc64 LE)

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    OUTPUT\_URL=file:///home/backups4  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? no. we have petitboot loader

-   Brief description of the issue: The backup works fine for both the
    iso and the tar file. The restore of the iso, however, boots and
    runs for a little bit but then stops at "Relax-and-Recover rescue
    system is ready", followed by "\[OK\] Found device /dev/hvc0\]" and
    finally followed by "\[OK\] Started Initialize Rescue System" where
    it hangs forever.

-   Work-around, if any: none at this time...

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide on this issue.

@schabrolles  
could you have a look what goes on here?

In particular I know nothing at all about "petitboot loader".  
I guess the bootloader of the original system  
is not related to this particular issue here.

@mmeier9 could you confirm you are running RHEL 7.4 on a Power BareMetal
?  
If yes, I'll try to replicate your setup to see if I got the same issue?

Hi,  
Yes, we are running RHEL 7.4 ppc64 le on a Power8 BareMetal which uses
Petitboot v1.4.4 loader.

@mmeier9,

I've reproduced the issue with CentOS 7.4 LE (should be the same for
RHEL).  
There some issue during startup when starting DBUS... (don't know why it
failed in BareMetal, but not with PowerVM/KVM guest).

I need more time in order to find the root cause (and may some help
around systemd/dbus)

@schabrolles, That's great you were able to reproduce the issue with
CentOS 7.4 LE. I hope you find the root cause and a way to make the
restore of the iso rescue system work. Thanks for your ongoing efforts.

@jsmeix  
I finally finally succeed to make dbus working in recovery.  
We just need to be sure that dbus user and group are created inside the
recovery image.  
=&gt; Systemd is now working properly and can detect and startup the
serial console automatically.

I just added the following in my `local.conf`

    CLONE_GROUPS=( "${CLONE_GROUPS[@]}" "dbus" )
    CLONE_USERS=( "${CLONE_USERS[@]}" "dbus" )

I think we should add the dbus user/group by default if they exisit...
may be in `usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/280_include_systemd.sh`. What
do you think ?

@mmeier9, just wait a bit before trying on your system... I found
another bug related to grub2 when running in baremetal. (see PR \#1742)

@schabrolles adding **dbus** is a great idea (do it by default I would
say)

@gdha, thanks for your feedback

Do you mean we should add dbus user directly in
`/data/scripts/Linux/rear/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf` ?  
Is it safe to add it here? I just wonder what happens if the user dbus
is not present on the system?

@schabrolles if the account is not present it will be skipped - as
simple as that.

@mmeier9 ,

Any news? Could you please check if the new version of rear solves your
issue?  
thanks.

Hello, I'm trying to get some downtime for our Power8 system to test the
REAR utility that I just downloaded from the github master website.
Thanks for your efforts. Will let you know how it goes once we get some
time to test.

Hi, I was able to test successfully with the new updated rear, on the
Power 8 Baremetal server booting from the iso created by the rear
mkrescue command.

I did not have the backup tar file available (lack of time to do this)
to test the rear recover but I imagine that part will probably work.

One question...once the server booted from the Rear rescue iso file, I
got the system prompt and logged in as root. When I issued "df -k" I did
not see the filesystems as before...is that expected and will the
filesystems/partitions something the rear recover execution would set
up?

Thank you for your efforts and for solving the issue with the rescue iso
not booting correctly!!

@mmeier9 thanks for the feedback and having close this issue.

`df -k` should show the bootable media fs, not the FS on your real
disk...  
Those FS (your FS) will be recreated by rear during the recovery
(`rear recover`). Then the recreated layout will be mounted in
/mnt/local and data will be restored. At the end of the process, you can
have access to the /mnt/local FS in order to manually change some files
(if needed) before rebooting.
