In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/463a2651af982723f843beccdf33f71a0352fa53](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/463a2651af982723f843beccdf33f71a0352fa53)  
the fix for  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/95\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
made the REQUIRED\_PROGS test therein work again  
but the same code in usr/sbin/rear was not fixed  
(with this pull request it gets fixed at both places).

But 'declare -a MISSING\_PROGS' contradicted the intent  
that is explained in the comment above in the code.

An empty array does not work with 'set -u'  
(here on my SLES11-SP4 system with GNU bash, version 3.2.57):

<pre>
# declare -a arr

# set -u

# echo $arr
-bash: arr: unbound variable

# echo ${arr[*]}
-bash: arr[*]: unbound variable

# echo ${arr[@]}
-bash: arr[@]: unbound variable

# echo "${arr[@]}"
-bash: arr[@]: unbound variable
</pre>

'declare -a arr' is the same as 'arr=()'.

One must have an array with at least one (empty) member.

@gdha @gozora  
I set you as reviewers mainly FYI  
so that you could also have a look here because I think  
this is an interesting example how complicated things  
could get if one likes to use bash arrays with 'set -u'  
cf.

I like to merge it because in its current form  
it works both with and without 'set -ue'  
but now both code parts are in sync and  
work as described in their comments  
so that this pull request is at least a "cleanup".

But I removed the "enhancement" label because of
