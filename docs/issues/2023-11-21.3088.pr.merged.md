In example.conf files use

    { SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='...' ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

(i.e. with SECRET\_OUTPUT\_DEV)

@pcahyna  
ah - yes - thank you for the hint about squashing commits.

I like to be able to see the history how things were developed  
(and the overall result is visible in the merge commit)  
so normally I don't like squashing commits so that  
I am not used to think about squashing commits.

But in this case it would be better to squash them.

This was my very first try to use "Squash and merge"  
in the GitHub web frontend - let's see what the result is...

...ah!  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7c5c9bc83db5202fb515cbaa803efcd18d9fcd1e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7c5c9bc83db5202fb515cbaa803efcd18d9fcd1e)  
shows me that I also have to manually squash the merge commit message.  
Next time I (hopefully) remember that and do better.

@jsmeix I usually squash only commits that I need manually using
`git rebase --interactive --autosquash` and I force push. This allows me
to squash only commits that I want to have squashed and adjust the
commit messages. For example, in this case, I would have squashed both
commits Update SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf together, both
Update SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf commits together etc. but maybe not
all commits together.
