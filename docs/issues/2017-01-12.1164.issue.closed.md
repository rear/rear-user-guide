When one uses

<pre>
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://nfs_server_IP/directory
</pre>

one gets the backups in one same fixed directory  
so that an existing backup.tar.gz file gets overwritten  
by a new backup.tar.gz file.

In contrast when one uses

<pre>
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

one gets separated full backups in separated timestamp  
directories via the default settings for BACKUP\_URL=usb.

This inconsistent behaviour results inconsistent user experience  
for multiple backups and incremental/differential backups, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160\#issuecomment-272194526](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160#issuecomment-272194526)

In particular with BACKUP\_URL=nfs multiple backups  
and incremental/differential backups "just work" while  
with BACKUP\_URL=usb defaults neither multiple backups  
nor incremental/differential backups work.

To make multiple backups or incremental/differential backups  
work with BACKUP\_URL=usb special setup is needed, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145)

I wonder what the right default behaviour of BACKUP\_URL=usb  
should be:

Shouldn't by default BACKUP\_URL=usb  
behave same as BACKUP\_URL=nfs  
to get consistent user experience in ReaR?

Hello @jsmeix

I just have tried BLOCKCLONE backup on USB, (I know that I should be
writing documentation but it is not fun :-( ) so I had a chance to have
a quick look on USB workflows. In general the logic there seems to be a
bit different.

Differences I've noticed:

1.  When booting from ISO it is quite straightforward as all files for
    ReaR rescue/recovery system are in one same location (that
    particular ISO). USB on the other hand can have multiple ReaR
    rescue/recovery systems. Basically every time
    `rear mkrescue/mkbackup` is run new environment is created. At
    syslinux boot screen you can decide which environment will be
    booted.

2.  As you already mentioned:

> one gets separated full backups in separated timestamp  
> directories via the default settings for BACKUP\_URL=usb.

Archive to restore is being chose not only by BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE
defined in local.conf but also by user query for particular timestamp.

On one hand I agree with you that user experience should be same, but
somehow I have a feeling that USB is implemented as it should be.

What do you think should be changed?

I slept over it, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145\#issuecomment-272217150](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145#issuecomment-272217150)  
and now I have an idea how all this can be solved:

This issue here is the actual root cause.  
When I solve this issue,  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145)  
get automatically solved.

I know that for BACKUP\_URL=usb the syslinux bootloader stuff  
is recreated anew but currently this is o.k. for me.  
Basically it matches that for each ISO image its bootloader  
is also created.

The main issue for now for me is to implement a fixed  
backup directory also for BACKUP\_URL=usb.  
When a fixed backup directory is used for BACKUP\_URL=usb  
then one can later think about whether or not in this case  
it is needed to receate the syslinux bootloader stuff anew  
each time. But that is a minor issue because it also works  
when the syslinux bootloader stuff is always recreated.

My current idea how to implement a fixed backup directory  
also for BACKUP\_URL=usb in a backward compatible way:

I need to be able to distinguish between the current default case  
(i.e. multiple timestamp backup directories) and the new  
fixed backup directory case.

I cannot distinguish when USB\_PREFIX is set in local.conf  
because when that variable is set I cannot know later at  
arbitrary places in the code if it was set as a default  
or if it was set deliberately by the user.

Therefore I need another new config variable to specify  
the backup directory for BACKUP\_URL=usb.

Because the USB\_PREFIX value must currently  
start with rear/$HOSTNAME cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160\#issuecomment-272119383](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1160#issuecomment-272119383)  
the new config variable can only specify the trailing part  
of the backup directory for BACKUP\_URL=usb.

I think I will name that new config variable  
USB\_SUFFIX

When USB\_SUFFIX is unset or empty, BACKUP\_URL=usb  
will work in its current default mode which means  
USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/$( date +%Y%m%d.%H%M )"  
and multiple timestamp backup directories plus  
automated backups cleanup via USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR.

When USB\_SUFFIX is set,  
USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/$USB\_SUFFIX"  
and then BACKUP\_URL=usb will work in compliance  
with how BACKUP\_URL=nfs works which means  
a fixed backup directory and no automated backups cleanup.

This way the user gets back direct easy control, cf.  
[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)  
Of course ReaR is free software where the user can change the code  
but I prefer when full user control is already built-in and
ready-to-use.

In particular when the user specifies in local.conf  
USB\_SUFFIX="$( date +%Y%m%d.%H%M )"  
he will get same multiple timestamp backup directories  
but without automated backups cleanup.

For now I will implement alignment of  
BACKUP\_URL=usb with BACKUP\_URL=nfs  
only as far as currently needed.

A long-term general goal for ReaR could be to align  
all those various grown differences in ReaR carefully  
and step by step - but that is something for the future  
and only if really needed, cf. "Dirty hacks welcome" in

I have just tested that with the current git version and can confirm
that everything works as expected and flawless. @jsmeix many thanks for
your valuable work!
