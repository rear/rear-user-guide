-   How was this pull request tested?

On my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system I did "rear -D mkrescue" and  
still got the same files in the recovery system as before this changes  
with this etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.122.1/nfs
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
    PROGRESS_MODE=plain
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS=3
    KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now the `RequiredSharedObjects` function skips running `ldd`  
for non-regular files, kernel modules, firmware files and  
in particular for files that are not owned by 'root'  
to mitigate possible ldd security issues  
(see the comments in the code).

Additionally I added at several places

    2>>/dev/$DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2024](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2024)  
which reduced the "rear -D mkrescue" log file size  
from about 5 MiB to about 2 MiB.  
Without that the rear -D mkrescue" log file size  
with the changes here would "explode" to about 17 MiB  
(from about 5 MiB before the changes here)  
because with the changes here `ldd` is run separatedly  
for each file in `RequiredSharedObjects` so we would get  
additional tons of `set -x` output for each `ldd` call.

What about files owned by a system user, like `bin`?

@pcahyna  
currently I test numerical owner ID  
and skip all files wher the owner ID is not 0  
which skips all files owned by non-root system users.

So I think I need to better check for owner user names  
because names should be same on various Linux distributions  
and I think I need a new config variable where the by default trusted  
owner names are listed so that the user could add his additionally  
trusted owners.

I will enhance this pull request soon...

Now it skips `ldd` for files that are not owned by a user  
in the new TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS config array.

@pcahyna  
FYI when you need full debug output to see  
what `RequiredSharedObjects` actually does  
you must use `--debugscripts x` e.g. as in

    usr/sbin/rear --debugscripts x mkrescue

Another note: It might be (I haven't researched this) that some backup
method integrated into ReaR pulls in executables and/or libraries with
their own user ids, say something like `bacula`. In that case there
would be a regression potential, as these will no longer be checked for
dependencies, correct?

@OliverO2  
yes this regression potential exists.

The manual solution for a particular user is in his etc/rear/local.conf

    TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS+=( 'my_backup_prog_owner' )

The long-term solution at ReaR upstream is code like

    test "$BACKUP" = "my_backup" && TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS+=( 'my_backup_prog_owner' )

and/or additional backup specific config variables in default.conf  
that define additional backup specific trusted users that need  
to get added to TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS with similar code.

Fortunately (actually intentionally)
build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
has become meanwhile rather good and should in very most cases  
detect when there are executables in the recovery system  
without required libraries.

`build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh` uses `ldd` in the same way as the
original copy-as-is, so it would need the same protection against
accidental root-execution as well, right?

@OliverO2  
you are right - I had falsely assumed all files in the recovery system  
are owned by root because that is the only user in the recovery system  
but in fact the files in the recovery system preserve owner group and  
permissions from what they have on the original system.

So I need to implement that also for 'ldd' in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh

The problem is that files from an unprivileged user may be executed with
root privileges. It would not help if these files became owned by root
due copying as their origin would still be unprivileged.

So retaining user ids actually saves you a lot of effort. Otherwise
you'd have to remember the original user id of each file copied and
things would become even more complex.

Have you thought about using `objdump` instead of `ldd`, which would be
the recommended safe solution? Yes I know that would involve doing
recursive checks but the overall effort seems less than what is
currently required.

I meant if all files in the recovery system were owned by 'root'  
I could not have tested for ownership to get the trusted ones  
so I had no idea what to do for 'ldd' in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh.

From our glibc experts at SUSE I learned that  
at least since SLES11 (probably even before) our 'ldd' is a  
modified version that does not directly execute the program  
so from a SUSE point of view there is no need to change anything here  
and I also learned that objdump would be preferred over ldd but  
even more I perfer to do things step by step and  
most of all I prefer to keep ReaR 2.x backward compatible  
(as far as possible with reasonable effort) which means  
to not cause regressions by changing things in a rush  
or by changing several things at once.

In particular because I am not at all an expert in this area  
I must change the currently working things in careful little steps.  
There are so many subtle interdependencies in ReaR that  
I cannot imagine what may break when I change something.  
My little step by little step way is my attempt to get a bit better  
understanding how things actually work in ReaR while I am doing  
those little steps so that I can a little bit better avoid
regressions.  
If I understood all ReaR code I would...

My next step is to use TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS to check  
all files before they are copied into the recovery system  
or directly after they were copied into the recovery system  
(depending on what works better or is simpler to implement).

Since my last commit here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286/commits/450447b9349472785a04fb8947de489c587b9dcd](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286/commits/450447b9349472785a04fb8947de489c587b9dcd)  
Log messages are explicitly appended to the log file to ensure  
that `Log "some log message"` actually appears in the log file  
even inside `{ ... } 2>>/dev/$DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV`  
that is now used more often since my first commit here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286/commits/1b11a296a1ba813e265f8219247889aa09f2e454](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286/commits/1b11a296a1ba813e265f8219247889aa09f2e454)

From my point of view what this pull request intends to do  
`Do not ckeck untrusted files for missing libraries`  
is now implemented (but not more)  
and it works for me  
so that I would like to merge it tomorrow  
unless there are objections.

My next step is to use TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS to check  
all files before they are copied into the recovery system  
or directly after they were copied into the recovery system  
(depending on what works better or is simpler to implement)  
which will be done via a separated pull request (as time permits).

With my latest  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286/commits/8343ba60ab0a713232bc7ba936dbe1fbe7b8a0ed](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286/commits/8343ba60ab0a713232bc7ba936dbe1fbe7b8a0ed)  
things even look good to me on the terminal:

    # usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue
    ...
    Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.JHPrACQMdwXn5Oo/rootfs contains a usable system
    Skipped ldd test for '/home/JohnDoe/.xinitrc.template' (owner 'JohnDoe' not in TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS)
    Skipped ldd test for '/home/JohnDoe/bin/parted' (owner 'JohnDoe' not in TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS)
    Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd initrd.cgz with gzip default compression
    ...

    # usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    Skipped ldd test for '/home/JohnDoe/.xinitrc.template' (owner 'JohnDoe' not in TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS)
    Skipped ldd test for '/home/JohnDoe/bin/parted' (owner 'JohnDoe' not in TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS)
    #

so the user cannot say he was not informed when later his  
special `/home/JohnDoe/bin/parted` does not work  
because it needs a special `/home/JaneDoe/libparted.so.666`.  
Perhaps a bit technical message but I prefer technically correct
messages  
over convenient to read but technically vague messages and  
I do not like to sound patronizing by telling the user what to do  
via whatever `you should` or `please do` phrases.
