@jhoekx could you verify the fixes and confirm that I didn't forgot
something?

I have no test environment nearby. If you tested it, I believe it will
work :-) I can't see any problems with it.

I prefer a commit title that is more descriptive than 'fixes issue
\#xxx' though. Something like 'Replace spaces in disk labels by 0x20'.

Unfortunately via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2540c7a2319791b58fa2b9c87fdefbe3c5341b4c](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2540c7a2319791b58fa2b9c87fdefbe3c5341b4c)  
the duplicated quoting to make parted work via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/316b5f8d5aa5bb96b8aa037266912a59e6cda046](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/316b5f8d5aa5bb96b8aa037266912a59e6cda046)  
got removed (I assume because no comment explained why that
overcomplicated  
looking duplicated quoting is actually needed), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-358965623](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-358965623)  
and subsequent comments.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706)
merged  
this issue should be again fixed to a currently reasonable extent  
which means: Currently it fails for UTF-8 encoded strings  
so that UTF-8 encoded GPT partition names  
are not (yet?) supported.
