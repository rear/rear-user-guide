In current GitHub master code there is

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'fat=16'

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh:
    mount $v -o loop -t vfat -o fat=16 $TMP_DIR/efiboot.img $TMP_DIR/efi_virt >&2

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ia64/200_mount_bootimg.sh:
    mount $v -o loop -t vfat -o fat=16 $TMP_DIR/boot.img $TMP_DIR/mnt >&2

On my openSUSE Leap 15.2 system 'man 8 mount' reads (excerpts):

    Mount options for fat
      (Note: fat is not a separate filesystem, but a common part
       of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems.)
    ...
    fat={12|16|32}
      Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat.
      This overrides the automatic FAT type detection routine.
      Use with caution!

This indicates that `-o fat=16` is not actually needed  
and could be even wrong in some cases.  
I think relying on "the automatic FAT type detection"  
seems to be the more fail-save way  
so I suggest to remove the `-o fat=16` option setting  
in the above mount commands.

We at SUSE got an issue report that reads (excerpts):

    noticed when running "rear mkbackup" the line
    "FAT-fs (loop0): "fat=16" option is obsolete, not supported now"
    is shown in /var/log/messages

    /var/log/messages
    2021-02-18T11:54:42.061371+01:00 ... kernel: [ 2415.490068] FAT-fs (loop0): "fat=16" option is obsolete, not supported now
    2021-02-18T11:59:32.535396+01:00 ... rear[3641]: rear mkbackup finished with zero exit code

    Removing -o fat=16 makes the message disappear.
    So far no negative impact found by doing that.

On my SLES11 test system  
'man 8 mount' also reads

    Mount options for fat
    (Note: fat is not a separate filesystem,
     but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems.)
    ...

      This overrides the automatic FAT type detection routine.
      Use with caution!

Regarding "I wonder if -F 16 is actually needed for mkfs.vfat ?" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576\#issuecomment-785893981](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576#issuecomment-785893981)  
on my SLES11 test system  
'man mkfs.vfat' also reads

    -F FAT-size
      Specifies the type of file allocation tables used (12, 16 or 32 bit).
      If nothing is specified, mkfs.fat will automatically select between
      12, 16 and 32 bit, whatever fits better for the filesystem size.

So it seems it is safe at least down to SLES11  
to remove both `-F 16` for `mkfs.vfat`  
and `-o fat=16` for `mount -t vfat`

Specifying a mount option for parameters which can be read from the file
system itself (like `-o fat=16`) seems always questionable, if it makes
sense at all.

Regarding `mkfs.vfat` there is this comment section in
`usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280_create_bootable_disk_image.sh`
summarizing my research on the issue:

    # Note: Having a small EFI System Partition (ESP) might introduce problems:
    # - The UEFI spec seems to require a FAT32 EFI System Partition (ESP).
    # - syslinux/Legacy BIOS fails to install on small FAT32 partitions with "syslinux: zero FAT sectors (FAT12/16)".
    # - Some firmwares fail to boot from small FAT32 partitions.
    # - Some firmwares fail to boot from FAT16 partitions.
    # See:
    # - http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/principles.html
    # - http://lists.openembedded.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2012-January/055999.html
    # As there seems to be no silver bullet, let mkfs.vfat choose the 'right' FAT partition type based on partition size
    # (i.e. do not use the '-F 32' option) and hope for the best...

@OliverO2  
thank you for your explanatory comment (in your source code)!  
It helps a lot.

I think relying on mkfs.vfat to choose the 'right' FAT partition type  
(based on whatever mksf.vfat implements for that e.g. based on size)  
is currently also the 'right' thing in ReaR.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576)
the code gets explanatory comments  
so users could see why things are currently as is and easily adapt it if
needed  
for exceptional cases.

When more issues appear because of this (i.e. the FAT partition type of
mkfs.vfat  
was not the 'right' one for the UEFI firmware) we can introduce
something like a  
`ESP_FAT_TYPE` config variable so that the user can specify what he
needs.

Mainly for direct documenation here what the links in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2575\#issuecomment-786602931](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2575#issuecomment-786602931)  
contain:

[http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/principles.html](http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/principles.html)  
reads (excerpt)

    The ESP should officially use a FAT32 filesystem,
    although some (especially older) Linux distributions
    place a FAT16 filesystem on this partition.
    (This choice can cause problems for Windows 7,
     which will accept only a FAT32 ESP.
     At least one EFI implementation, Gigabyte's Hybrid EFI,
     also seems to be allergic to FAT16 ESPs.) 

I.e. the ESP should officially use a FAT32  
and it seems for "Linux" (perhaps actually GRUB is meant) also a FAT16
ESP works  
but some EFI firmware may have issues with a FAT16 ESP  
so having a FAT32 ESP should be right in any case (in theory)  
BUT:  
[https://www.openembedded.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2012-January/055999.html](https://www.openembedded.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2012-January/055999.html)  
reads (excerpts):

    Do not force FAT32 on all images, it violates the FAT specification
    ...
    forcing the use of FAT32 with "-F 32" to mkdosfs.
    The FAT specification is clear on cluster count being the determining
    factor for FAT size (even if the fs string is set to FAT32, go figure).
    Syslinux follows this spec, and rightly so, resulting in a failure
    on core-image-minimal:
      syslinux: zero FAT sectors (FAT12/16)
    Drop the "-F 32" from mkdosfs to allow it to select the appropriate
    FAT size based on cluster count.
    ...
    -    mkdosfs -F 32 -n ${BOOTIMG_VOLUME_ID} -S 512 -C ${IMG} ${BLOCKS}
    +    mkdosfs -n ${BOOTIMG_VOLUME_ID} -S 512 -C ${IMG} ${BLOCKS}

so in the end not enforcing FAT32 for the ESP seems to be  
"the right thing" in practice.

FYI when `mkfs.vfat` automatically switches from FAT16 to FAT32:

On my openSUSE Leap 15.2 system  
with `mkfs.vfat` from `dosfstools-4.1`  
`mkfs.vfat` automatically uses FAT16 up to 511 MiB  
and automatically switches to FAT32 at 512 MiB:

Because mkfs.vfat uses FAT16 up to 511 MiB and FAT32 starting at 512
MiB  
our current default

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="400"

results a FAT16 ESP by default which may cause issues with certain UEFI
firmware.

So I think we should increase our default ESP size to

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="512"

to get by default a FAT32 ESP to be in compliance that  
"the ESP should officially use a FAT32 filesystem"  
to avoid possible issues with certain UEFI firmware.

I increased USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE from 400 MiB to 512 MiB via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576/commits/c38e61db066196c90e6118cab8887b76df58b20a](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2576/commits/c38e61db066196c90e6118cab8887b76df58b20a)

On my openSUSE Leap 15.2 x86\_64 system  
I get a 336M ISO that contains a 326M initrd with the defaults  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' ) and FIRMWARE\_FILES=()  
i.e. including all kernel modules and all firmware files:

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Copying all kernel modules in /lib/modules/5.3.18-lp152.63-default (MODULES contains 'all_modules')
    Copying all files in /lib*/firmware/
    ...
    Created initrd.cgz with gzip default compression (341002623 bytes) in 55 seconds
    Making ISO image
    Wrote ISO image: /root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/output/rear-linux-h9wr.iso (336M)

so the current default USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE="400" is rather limited  
when in particular the firmware files get more and more  
(on my openSUSE Leap 15.2 system I have 496M in /lib/firmware/).
