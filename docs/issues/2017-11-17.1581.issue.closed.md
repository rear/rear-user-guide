-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.2
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): ubuntu 16.04
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): BACKUP=BAREOS
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue: after recovery mkinitrd failed due
    to missing /tmp directory
-   Work-around, if any:  
    Edit script
    `/usr/share/rear/prep/default/400_save_mountpoint_details.sh` and as
    last line add:

<!-- -->

    echo "tmp 1777 root root" >> "$VAR_DIR/recovery/mountpoint_permissions"

Perhaps it would be enough to change the default entry in
`conf/default.conf` from (for ReaR 2.3):

    DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER=( )
    to
    DIRECTORY_ENTRIES_TO_RECOVER=( '/tmp 1777 root root' )

Thoughts?

Any missing standard FHS directory is unexpeced because in  
prep/default/400\_save\_directories.sh  
I intentionally implemented (at least I tried to)  
that all standard FHS directories are always recreated.

@gdha  
could you inspect your "rear mkrescue" and "rear recover" logs  
why the standard FHS directory 'tmp' is not automatically  
recreated in this case.

@jsmeix Fair enough - for ReaR 2.3 it is fixed then (via
`prep/default/400_save_directories.sh`), but the script was different in
rear-2.2.  
But, the work-around I gave is good enough for now. Thanks for the
feedback and I will close it again

@gdha  
if you find the time I would appreciate it  
if you could verify that it is really fixed  
with current ReaR master code.
