bugfix to honor KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR

Pavol, I don't get why adding the `-n` fixes a problem? With or without
should be identical in both bash and coreutils test. Care to elaborate?

Okay, this is embarrassing, but I now cannot reproduce the problem we
thought we fixed with `-n` in the morning: we've just seen temporary
dirs polluting `/tmp`, with the NETFS backup, default `KEEP_BUILD_DIR`
and no obvious error in log. I would swear, there was even
`You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear....` message in log, but I cannot
prove that anymore.

I close the request. I'll try to be more careful next time.
