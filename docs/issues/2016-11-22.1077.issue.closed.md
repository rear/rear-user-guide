We cannot fix it for ReaR 2.0 - it is too late now  
which means Bareos support in current ReaR will  
not be as good as possible.

Hello @jsmeix and @gdha , sorry for my late reply.

I've seen the workaround by @amtuannguyen, which looks like a good
approach.  
With Bareos 16.2 the 'old' way of using a configuration file is
supported as well as the new layout, which uses subdirectories. I fear,
that the above commit does not solve all situations, as it only fixes
the requirement checking part, while the parts with program calls (like
starting the fd) still use hardcoded "-c /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf" for
example.

As bareos-fd and bconsole don't require a "-c" parameter, I suggest to
leave it away. Both binaries will

1.  check, if the default configuration file is present (
    /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf for fd) is present
2.  check if there is a configuration in the according subdirectory  
    So there is no need to specify it and it will work with old and new
    layout this way.

Unless someone is using another config-filename, in this case an
additional option would be needed (but that case wasn't covered anyway).

For the requirement checking I recommend to use -t, as it will check, if
a configuration exists and can be loaded.

@aussendorf Hi Maik - thank you for your insight into this matter (as
SME). If you can improve the code do not hesitate and prepare a small
pull request.

Ok, I've also replaced greps in configfiles by calls to the program with
-xc, which dumps the config.  
A first shot (UNTESTED) is here:  
[https://github.com/aussendorf/rear](https://github.com/aussendorf/rear)

I've no testing environment at hand right now, so I will probably not be
able to test it before next week.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1169](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1169)  
is merged this issue should be fixed.

@aussendorf  
many thanks for your valuable contribution to ReaR!  
In particular for the various different external backup methods  
ReaR depends on contributions from pepole who are experts  
in the individual backup methods.

Hi,  
This error still exists for SLES 11 SP4 (rear-2.00-1.i586.rpm)  
Creating with mkrescue or similair works fine. However, restores exits
with missing bareos-fd.conf.

@ivveh  
the fix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1169](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1169)  
is not in ReaR 2.0 see my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1077\#issuecomment-270129226](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1077#issuecomment-270129226)

You need the current ReaR upstream master code.

How to test the currently newest ReaR GitHub master code  
independent of an already installed ReaR software:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and then  
configure and run it from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

(note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/").

@jsmeix  
Hello, I realized that and got the latest snap instead and everything
worked out fine.  
Sorry for the trouble!

@ivveh  
no worries!  
I appreciate your prompt feedback that it works well  
with current ReaR upstream master code.

Such explicit positive feedback helps us a lot  
to know things actually do work well because  
in particular I do not use third-party backup tools.

I always think I should have a look at third-party backup tools  
but I never find the time to actually do it - perhaps I find time  
when there are no issues directly in ReaR left... ;-)

@jsmeix  
No worries. I must say I'm quite impressed over the automatic restore
implementation with rear and bareos.  
Just from installing the rpm/deb (tested with both ubuntu 16.04 & sles11
sp4) on a client and with the bareos client with just 4(?) lines of
variables in the rear config file I was able to make an iso to a nfs
share and restore it fully automated.
