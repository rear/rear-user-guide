-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not yet tested by me in any way and  
    I cannot test all those affected code parts,  
    in particulart not the changes for TSM and NBU.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Some general cleanup for ReaR 2.6. in all scripts  
    by removing '2&gt;/dev/null' where it makes sense  
    and replacing '&&gt;/dev/null' by '1&gt;/dev/null' where it makes
    sense  
    or also removing '&&gt;/dev/null' where that seems to be better,
    see

@schabrolles  
could you please - if time permits - have a look at my changes in  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
and ideally verify that TSM still works for you with my changes?

@cge77  
could you please have a look at my changes in  
usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
and ideally verify that NBM NetBackup still works for you with my
changes?

Hi jsmeix.

Where is your
"usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh"?
I do not know how I can see it.

Regards.

I "just merged" it so that things can be tested right now  
as long as ReaR 2.6 is still under development.

Please report if there are regressions so that I can fix them,  
ideally each one as a new and separated GitHub issue.

Hi jsmeix.

I checked the script
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/bd51a4c001dfa1b9934c1e15c3716056fdf8d6cc/usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/bd51a4c001dfa1b9934c1e15c3716056fdf8d6cc/usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/390_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh)
but it is very different to my script. Sorry, but I cannot help much in
this topic...

Best regards.
