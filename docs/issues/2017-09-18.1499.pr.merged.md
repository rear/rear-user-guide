This PR makes sure that a btrfs subvolume actually exists before trying
to recreate it.

See \#1496.

@OliverO2  
from plain looking at the code everything looks perfect!

I only wonder about the reason behind  
why you added a new lib/btrfs-functions.sh script  
and did not add your btrfs\_subvolume\_exists function  
to the existing lib/filesystems-functions.sh script?

@jsmeix

Yes, I had considered `filesystems-functions.sh` but somehow decided
against it. I agree that the content of `btrfs-functions.sh` could just
go there. Would be simpler and more logical.

If there are no objections I will merge it soon...

@jsmeix  
While we're dealing with btrfs code, would you mind stripping the
`#btrfssnapshotsubvol` comments from `disklayout.conf`?

Over here, disklayout.conf contains 268 lines, 213 of them (86%) are
`#btrfssnapshotsubvol` comments. That makes it difficult to review and
edit the file, especially if done via a console with limited screen real
estate.

What about just putting just a comment about the number of snapshot
volumes encountered in disklayout.conf and put the snapshot paths in the
log file only?

@OliverO2  
for SUSE I have the btrfs snapshot subvolumes intentionally  
listed in disklayout.conf but disabled from recreation.  
At SUSE we can boot from a btrfs snapshot subvolume  
when it was made by the SUSE tool 'snapper' - i.e. each  
snapper btrfs snapshot subvolume could be used as  
the subvolume that gets mounted at the '/' mountpoint.  
Therefore I would like to have them listed in disklayout.conf.

In your case according to your valuable explanation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1496\#issuecomment-329824117](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1496#issuecomment-329824117)  
"We snapshot each volume every 5 minutes"  
you get tons of btrfs snapshot subvolumes which fill up  
the disklayout.conf file with mostly useless information.

I suggest to provide another config variable so that the  
user can specify if he wants to have btrfs snapshot subvolumes  
listed in disklayout.conf  
or  
your existing support for EXCLUDE\_RECREATE for btrfs  
could be somehow enhanced to be also used to get btrfs  
snapshot subvolumes completely ignored  
e.g. via something like

<pre>
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "btrfssnapshotsubvol:all" )
</pre>

where a special qualifier like 'all' could mean that all btrfs  
snapshot subvolumes get completely ignored  
or  
whatever else you like.

I only like that by default btrfs snapshot subvolumes  
are still listed (but disabled) in disklayout.conf.

I have tested that a ReaR recovery still works  
with the SUSE SLES12-SP2 default btrfs structure.
