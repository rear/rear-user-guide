This is a fix for issue \#610  
There is a new function in usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh
that is used to find the yaboot binary. It's stored in a different place
on SUSE based systems.  
There was also some needed changes in
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/30\_create\_yaboot.sh and
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/80\_create\_isofs.sh.  
These were necessary since the yaboot binary from SLES is compiled to
look for the kernel in the same directory, unlike the versions in Red
Hat-type distros.
