##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **New Feature**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   Tests were based on current ReaR master
        (d7b587cb5b7a14432e7c4f9e5f4d94e50abea740) on Ubuntu 18.04.2
        LTS:
    -   Tested booting recovery systems in these configurations:
        1.  Legacy Boot
        2.  EFI Boot via syslinux (Secure Boot disabled)
        3.  EFI Boot via Grub 2 (Secure Boot disabled)
        4.  EFI Boot via Grub 2 (Secure Boot enabled)
    -   Tested TCG Opal 2 PBA disk unlocking with Secure Boot enabled.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR adds Secure Boot support to the RAWDISK output format.

This in turn enables Secure Boot in conjunction with the PBA (pre-boot
authentication) system required to unlock TCG Opal 2-compatible
self-encrypting disks. (BTW: AFAIK there is no other solution available
supporting Secure Boot with TCG Opal 2 SEDs on the market.)

As is the case with other output formats within ReaR, Secure Boot
support has to be explicitly enabled. On Ubuntu, the following line must
be added to the configuration:

    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi"

That's all.

Some remarks:

The proposed code change works as good as previous Grub 2 UEFI booting -
it just adds the Secure Boot capability.

What I'm not yet entirely satisfied with is the Plymouth boot splash
integration on desktops for the pre-boot authentication system asking
for the disk unlock password. Ideally, Plymouth should present a
centered password prompt and hide all startup console messages. However,
Plymouth reacts differently depending on the boot loader (Grub 2 or
syslinux) and the graphics hardware (Intel or nVidia) involved. With
Grub 2, it resorts to just a simple text mode prompt and does not hide
console log messages. It's all usable, but does not yet look as nice as
it should.

I have experimented a bit but got mixed results so far, e.g. a nicer
look but the password prompt only coming up after pressing `ESC`.
Whenever a better solution comes up, I'll post an update.

@jsmeix Yes, I have noticed it, sorry for the delay on my side. When I
get back to this, would it be OK to respond to your comments in this PR
so that the discussion stays is in one place?
