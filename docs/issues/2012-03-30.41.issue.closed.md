Reboot on Ubuntu or RHEL rescue media fails to work. We probably miss
some script or config for upstart.

Did not work with upstream master on 6/6 on RHEL6.2 :-(

I tested my RHEL 6.2 VM again. Everything is working great there.

I need more info. `initctl list` will show which services are running.
Can you also try to reboot after you've enabled logging (
`initctl log-priority debug` )? The console will show what upstart is
trying to do.

Tested it today on a VM, and it did work. However, it did not work
previously on my laptop (after a real recovery). I can try later to do a
reboot (without a recovery) on my laptop in GRUB rescue mode. If that
works, I propose to reclose the issue ;-)

Cannot reproduce on bare-metal. It's likely my migration was not using a
tree with this fix in it. Let's keep an eye on this in the future, and
reopen if this is experienced again. Sorry for the confusion.
