With current ReaR 2.0 using multiple backups  
is not supported for things like

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

because one gets the backups in different directories  
on the REAR-000 medium, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158\#issuecomment-271604297](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158#issuecomment-271604297)  
which is essentially the same issue as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145)

In contrast to support for advanced backup features  
like BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential  
I am much more interested in getting support  
for multiple backups also for BACKUP\_URL=usb.

@dwerner1  
currently I am playing around with this change in  
usr/share/rear/prep/USB/default/060\_set\_usb\_device.sh  
(excerpt)

<pre>
# Set USB_PREFIX fallback if not specified:
test "$USB_PREFIX" || USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/$(date +%Y%m%d.%H%M)"
</pre>

and then in etc/rear/local.conf (excerpt)

<pre>
USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME"
</pre>

which results after

<pre>
usr/sbin/rear -C basic_system -d -D mkbackup
usr/sbin/rear -C home_backup -d -D mkbackuponly
</pre>

this on the REAR-000 medium (excerpt)

That looks very interesting! I have just read a bit deeper this document

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](url)

.. which I have just been flying over before. The idea of splitting the
environment in basic, home, opt etc is doubt free a tempting and
reasonable way!

Currently with the above "rear recover" fails  
with the already known issue

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear -C basic_system -d -D recover
Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-e205.log

730: NOTICE: Will do driver migration
730: Select a backup archive.

#?
</pre>

but when I put a plain

<pre>
return
</pre>

as very fist line in  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
both

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear -C basic_system -d -D recover
</pre>

and a subseqent

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear -C home_backup -d -D restoreonly
</pre>

just work for me :-)

This means that from my current point  
the issue is already basically solved.

Does not yet work for "mkrescue" because e.g. after

<pre>
usr/sbin/rear -C basic_system -d -D mkrescue
</pre>

the backups are gone and one has on the REAR-000 medium  
only a new recovery system but without the old backups:

rear/e205/initrd.cgz

Same problem after a subsequent run of

<pre>
usr/sbin/rear -C basic_system -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

which removes all existing old backups so that  
afterwards the existing backup-home\_backup.tar.gz  
is no longer there.  
Only the new backup-basic\_system.tar.gz exists then.

I think I found the reason why existing backups got deleted:  
It is in default.conf USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=2  
plus the matching code for USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR in  
output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158\#issuecomment-271518391](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158#issuecomment-271518391)

I use now in local.conf  
USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=999  
and then existing backups are not deleted.

Summary what hacks make it work for me:

Code changes  
(I run it in a current GitHub master code clone):

Config settings:

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"
USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=999
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

USB\_PREFIX must start with rear/$HOSTNAME  
because in current code there are hardcoded places  
where rear/$HOSTNAME is used. E.g. with plain  
USB\_PREFIX="mybackupdir" the ReaR recovery  
system won't boot (syslinux setup goes wrong then).

Now I need to find a not too ugly way how to integrate that  
into current ReaR master code in a backward compatible way,  
then I will make a GitHub pull request...

In the meantime:  
@dwerner1  
please test how far my above described changes also make  
it work for your particular use case and provide feedback here  
what goes wrong and/or what is missing for your use case.

The syslinux menu labels get ugly when things like  
USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"  
is set, e.g. in my rear/e205/fixedbackupdir/syslinux.cfg  
I have "menu label fixe-db-ac up:di"

<pre>
label e205-fixedbackupdir
    menu label fixe-db-ac up:di rescue image
    say e205-fixedbackupdir - Recover e205 rescue image (fixedbackupdir)
...
label e205-fixedbackupdir
    menu label fixe-db-ac up:di rescue image - AUTOMATIC RECOVER
    say e205-fixedbackupdir - Recover e205 rescue image (fixedbackupdir)
</pre>

The reason is that current code works under the assumtion  
USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/$(date +%Y%m%d.%H%M)"  
i.e. things like "rear/e205/20170110.1618" would result  
"menu label 2017-01-10 16:18"

I can confirm that everything works as expected with current git version
and this `etc/rear/local.conf`:

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"
    USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=999
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-DATA

In `usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` I have set

    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=5

@dwerner1  
many thanks for the prompt feedback!

For clarification:  
I assume you meant that everything works as expected  
with current git version plus my above described hacks.

I am astonished that even  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-DATA  
works now because I never tested that.

Regarding changes in default.conf,  
see the initial comment in default.conf:

<pre>
# Here we define and describe all configuration variables and set them to a default.
#
# Do not change them here. Set them in your site.conf or local.conf file as needed.
</pre>

i.e. set

<pre>
USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt
USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=5
</pre> 

in your local.conf file and leave default.conf unchanged.

Sorry, I had not read your comment proper enough, I had not recognized
that the changes in the files have to be done by me, I assumed they were
already coming with the actual git code! I'll test again right away!

OK, with the current git version, your above mentioned changes and
local.conf like

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"
    USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=999
    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=5
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-DATA

old copies are obviously overwritten

On partition /dev/sdb1 labeled REAR-000, the folder
`/mnt/rear/debianrear/fixedbackupdir` looks like

With things like  
USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"  
existing backup.tar.gz files get overwritten  
(i.e. replaced by a new backup.tar.gz file), cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that describes this behaviour for BACKUP\_URL=nfs

This is the intended bahaviour when using one single  
fixed directory where the backup gets written to.

This behaviour is the same as when you use  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://nfs\_server\_IP/path

This behaviour is a prerequirement both for using  
multiple backups and incremental/differential backups  
also with BACKUP\_URL=usb because now one  
can have all backup files in one same directory  
also with BACKUP\_URL=usb.

I.e. now one can make it with BACKUP\_URL=usb  
work the same as with BACKUP\_URL=nfs where  
multiple backups and incremental/differential backups  
do already work.

In both cases all backups must be in one same directory,  
cf. my comment regarding BACKUP\_TYPE in default.conf.

When you neither use multiple backups nor  
incremental/differential backups then this feature is not useful  
for you - in this case leave the defaults and do not set  
USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"

But according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1141](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1141)  
I thought you like to use incremental/differential backups  
with BACKUP\_URL=usb, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145\#issuecomment-272129606](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1145#issuecomment-272129606)

Summary:

Either  
have separated full backups in separated timestamp directories  
via the default settings for BACKUP\_URL=usb  
or  
use multiple backups or incremental/differential backups  
for BACKUP\_URL=usb but then all backup files must be  
in one same directory and then you need special additional  
setup like USB\_PREFIX="rear/$HOSTNAME/fixedbackupdir"  
and USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=999

Sorry, I had lost \#1145 out of view! I'll change my setup and do
further tests later on!
