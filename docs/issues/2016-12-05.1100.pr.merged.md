Remounting with async option is not needed  
when systemd is used because when systemd  
is used remounting with sync option is skipped and  
to aviod needless operations remounting with async  
option is also skipped, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1097](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1097)  
and
