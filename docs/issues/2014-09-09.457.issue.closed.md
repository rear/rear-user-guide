Hello  
I’m having issues recovering an Oracle Linux server with Rear and NBU.  
I have no issues recovering this same Oracle Linux server with Rear and
Netfs but when I try with NBU the recover process seems to work (see
below)

08:36:06 (67385.001) chmod 555 /mnt/local/usr/share/empty to reset
permissions.  
08:36:07 (67385.001) chmod 511 /mnt/local/var/run/cups/certs to reset
permissions.  
08:36:07 (67385.001) chmod 600 /mnt/local/var/opt/VRTSsfmh/vea to reset
permissions.  
08:36:07 (67385.001) chmod 600 /mnt/local/var/opt/VRTSsfmh/veaintf to
reset permissions.  
08:36:21 (67385.001) INF - TAR EXITING WITH STATUS = 0  
08:36:21 (67385.001) INF - TAR RESTORED 139769 OF 139769 FILES
SUCCESSFULLY  
08:36:21 (67385.001) INF - TAR KEPT 0 EXISTING FILES  
08:36:21 (67385.001) INF - TAR PARTIALLY RESTORED 0 FILES  
08:36:22 (67385.001) Status of restore from image created 08/26/14
15:34:39 = the requested operation was successfully completed  
08:36:24 (67385.xxx) INF - Status = the requested operation was
successfully completed.

But when I go to reboot the server it does not boot with the below
errors.

There is no console login prompt after the reboot and can’t ping the
server so it doesn’t seem to restore networking etc.  
Has anyone seen this before?

I’m running  
rear-1.16.1-1  
Netbackup server 6.5.5  
Netbackup client 6.5  
Oracle Linux Server release 5.7

Also tried it on:  
Netbackup server 7.5  
Netbackup client 7.0  
using rear-1.16.1-1  
and has the same result.

Here is my local.conf  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NBU  
COPY\_AS\_IS\_NBU=( /usr/openv/bin/vnetd /usr/openv/bin/vopied
/usr/openv/lib /usr/openv/netbackup /usr/openv/var/auth/\[mn\]*.txt )  
COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_NBU=( "/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/*"
"/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpjava\*" "/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/xbp" )  
PROGS\_NBU=( )  
PROGS=( "${PROGS\[@\]}"  
lsof  
ssh-keygen )

I’m trying to recover from a Netbackup full backup including /boot and
/.  
I have also tried performing the backup using “ALL\_LOCAL\_DRIVES” and
/boot which exhibits the same problem.  
I can restore single files onto this client through bprestore so I know
netbackup is working as it should.  
One thing I have noticed is that there is no relabeling performed when I
recover with NBU compared to Netfs which always performs a relabel on
initial reboot after the recover.  
Not sure if this should be the case or not?  
Any help will be appreciated as I don’t think I will get anywhere with
Symantec as they will try and push me to use their BMR which is too
complicated and cumbersome compared to Rear.

Thanks.

Hi - see issue \#454 to get some insight in the problems you have
encountered. I believe they are the same. Is there any reason why you
added NBU stuff into the `local.conf` file? That is not necessary as
rear should have sufficient knowledge what to pull in. If not, then let
us know.

Hi,  
Thanks for your reply but unfortunately i don't think issue 454 is the
problem here.  
There are no incrementals setup for the policy i am using to restore
from, only full backups are performed.  
In regards to the NBU stuff in my local.conf i added that in one of the
attempts to get this thing to work so will remove as it made no
difference.  
Rear works great over netfs on both my test servers but i just can't get
it to work with Netbackup on two different versions 6.5 and 7.5.

Hi,

the server cannot start all the needed services. But it does boot
partially. So there should be a /var/log/messages file containing hints
what it is missing. Could you boot the machine from some Live CD and get
the messages log file from the servers disk.

@kichoc You could use the rear iso to boot from to further investigate
your `/` file system. Inspect the log file of rear to find out if
selinux tagging was performed or not?

Hi,  
Haven't have a chance to run this again and check the logs today but i
can tell you that there definitely was NO selinux tagging occurring as
this requires an extra reboot after the recover. I wrote this in my
initial post as i asked the question should it occur on both NBU and
netfs recovers as it only occurs with netfs here.

Tested this again and no .autorelabel file is created under /mnt/local
as there is with netfs.  
Created one after the netbackup restored completed but still didn't work
but would not boot at all.  
Giving up with using NBU and will stick with netfs.
