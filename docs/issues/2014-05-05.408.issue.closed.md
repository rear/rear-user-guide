Hi

During migration with ReaR I noticed that there was not layout
generation code for my root filesystem which is btrfs. Also, because of
the disk dependency system of ReaR, /boot was also not created (which I
could fix by commenting out my root fs from the disklayout.conf file).

I am not sure what the problem is. When I need to migrate (or restore)
once again in the future I will further investigate this issue. For now
I could fix it by writing the section for the root fs myself.

Also I noticed that ReaR was not able to handle a swap partition, which
is encrypted (and created) with a random key on each start. ReaR would
have to do nothing more than to create a partition (which is then setup
by dm-crypt on startup). The creation (mkswap) is not needed. Maybe
possible to add a test for this.

@ypid interesting. The file for `/` in `disklayout.conf` was missing?
Perhaps it would be nice to run `rear -vdD savelayout` so we can see
why??

ok thanks - I noticed in

the *UUID* is a bit malformed...

@ypid could you paste the output of the command
`btrfs filesystem show /dev/dm-0` please?

I can confirm that the problem still exists with
b19c28e883836188a220ae55eb44c0ea44086fdb although the uuid is now
correctly extracted.

@ypid how does the disklayout file looks now? And were does it block for
you (during recover)?

@ypid Were you able to test rear-1.17.0 already on Debian with btrfs?
Does it work now or is it still an issue?

I might be able to test this in a few months as I donâ€™t have rear setup
currently.

No further feedback sinde more than one year and  
meanwhile I implemented generic support for btrfs  
so that it should basically work (at least it works  
for the relatively comlicated SLES btrfs structure).

I think we can close it as "fixed".  
If needed it can be reopened.
