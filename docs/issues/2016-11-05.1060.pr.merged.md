In case we are running `MANUAL_INCLUDE` mode, there is no need  
to add volumes, NOT explicitly excluded via `EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS`.

This will only add volumes added to `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE` to
`backup-include.txt`.

As this change is made in
`backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh`, this change
will also affect backup types BORG and RSYNC, as these also link to this
file.
