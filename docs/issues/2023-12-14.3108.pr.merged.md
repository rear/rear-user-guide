-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?

I tested various 'dmesg -n \[1-7\]' during "rear recover"  
and up to 'dmesg -n 5' i.e. up to warning messages  
there are almost no kernel messages so that level 5  
does not "pollute" the usual ReaR messages.  
In contrast level 6 (notice messages) shows some more  
kernel messages which could be considered as disturbing  
and with level 7 (info messages) it really gets too much.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In \[skel/default\]/etc/scripts/boot set

    dmesg -n 5

to limit console logging for 'dmesg' messages to level 5  
so that kernel error and warning messages appear  
(intermixed with ReaR messages) on the console  
so that the user can notice when things go wrong  
in kernel area which helps to understand problems.

Unfortunately the console log in CI is not useful to see the result
after successful recovery. The console log is limited to 64 kB, and
successful recovery reboots multiple times (due to SELinux relabeling),
so the console messages from the recovery run get scrolled into the
memory hole.

Regardless whether or not the kernel ring buffer  
is useful for debugging CI problems,  
I like 'dmesg -n 5' in general because  
it is much better than 'dmesg -n1', see

right, and it actually is useful, see

@rear/contributors  
unless there is a critical objection  
I would "just merge" it today afternoon  
because I think nothing could get actually wrong  
with 'dmesg -n 5' compared to 'dmesg -n1' before.  
I think at most some unwanted kernel messages  
could appear intermixed with ReaR messages  
on the console - but only on the console  
so when "rear recover" is not run on the console  
e.g from remote via 'ssh' then no kernel messages  
appear on the remote terminal where 'ssh' is run.
