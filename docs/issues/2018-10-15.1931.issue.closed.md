That is my code in
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh

<pre>
    ### Find an extended partition if there is one
    if [[ "$disk_label" = "msdos" ]] && [[ "$has_logical" ]] ; then
...
        while read partition_nr size start type flags junk ; do
            (( $partition_nr > 4 )) && continue
...
            # Replace currently possibly wrong extended partition size value
            # by the value that parted reports if those values differ, cf.
            # https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733#issuecomment-368051895
            # In SLE10 there is GNU Parted 1.6.25.1 which supports 'unit B'
            # that is documented in 'info parted' (but not yet in 'man parted').
            # Example of a parted_extended_partition_line:
            #   # parted -s /dev/sdb unit B print | grep -w '3' | grep -w 'extended'
            #    3      1266679808B  1790967807B  524288000B  extended                  lba, type=0f
            # where the size is 524288000B i.e. parted_extended_partition_line[3]
            parted_extended_partition_line=( $( parted -s $device unit B print | grep -w "$partition_nr" | grep -w 'extended' ) )
            parted_extended_partition_size="${parted_extended_partition_line[3]%%B*}"
            if test $size -ne $parted_extended_partition_size ; then
                 Log "Replacing probably wrong extended partition size $size by what parted reports $parted_extended_partition_size"
                 sed -i /^$partition_nr\ /s/\ $size\ /\ $parted_extended_partition_size\ / $TMP_DIR/partitions
            fi
...
</pre>

I had misinterpreted the initial `if` that here only extended partitions
happen  
but actually all first four partitions on a 'msdos' labeled disk that
has  
a logical partition are examined here so that also primary partitions  
happen here and for them $parted\_extended\_partition\_size becomes
empty  
so that the subsequent test fails with 'unary operator expected'  
but nevertheless (stinking self-praise for my fail-safe programming
;-)  
the result is still right even in this case because nothing gets
changed  
when it is no extended partition.

I will make that behaviour more explicit in the code.

@mailinglists35  
check whether or not the partition size values are correct in your  
disklayout.conf file (usually in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf),  
for the disklayout.conf file syntax see the "Disk layout file syntax"
in
