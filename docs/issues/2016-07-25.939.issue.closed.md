There are no packages for Ubuntu 16.04 at Open SuSE Build Service. Looks
like somebody hast to add the new build target there. It would be
helpful to have Ubuntu packages this week, since I have to finish a book
this Friday where ReaR is described.

I do neither use Ubuntu nor do I know how to make  
packages for Ubuntu so that I cannot help here.

But it seems you use Ubuntu and therefore I ask you  
to contribute what is missing for your purpose.

I asked Schlomo to fix it OR to give me access to the rear project at
Open SuSE Build Service. I would love to fix it in just 10 seconds. Just
add pheinlein to the OBS project as maintainer. Schlomo asked me, to
open a ticket here instead.

What is missing? A simple click at Ubuntu 16.x repo in the settings of
the Rear project at OBS.

+1 for maintainer access to pheinlein on OBS. They already contributed  
major code several years back.

@heinlein-support  
hooray!

With great pleasure I added you right now to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/users/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/users/Archiving:Backup:Rear)

I also blindly added the repository named "Ubuntu 16.04" at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
but because I am not a Ubuntu user I cannot fix things here  
if it fails to build for that repository or if it builds but  
the result does not run well on Ubuntu 16.04.

According to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
all rear\* packages built successfully for "xUbuntu\_16.04".

Therefore I consider this issue to be fixed.

I also added 'pheinlein' as maintainer to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/users/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot](https://build.opensuse.org/project/users/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot)

I also added the Ubunto 16.04 repository to  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot](https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot)

FYI:  
Currently rear in Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot  
fails to build for all repositories because there  
are no sources rear-&lt;version&gt;tar.gz  
but that is a different issue.

@heinlein-support @jsmeix has the fix been imported into the master tree
of rear as well? And, what was required to fix the build? Just as a
curiosity... btw thanks for the fix üëç

@gdha  
as far as I understand it this issue here is only about  
to enable building rear also for Ubuntu 16.04  
which means this issue here is only about to  
activate Ubuntu 16.04 in the openSUSE build service.

Is your question perhaps meant for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/940](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/940)  
which is about to fix something inside rear  
cf.

Indeed I guess so as I had no clue what was done to fix it :)

Only an addendum FYI regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/939\#issuecomment-234862890](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/939#issuecomment-234862890)

To get arbitrary packages fixed in the openSUSE build service  
you do not need write access for the project or the package itself.

In the openSUSE build service you can branch any package  
to get your own copy and do your changes on your copy  
and then file a so called "submitrequest", cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package\_maintenance](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_maintenance)

In short:  
The openSUSE build service works like GitHub:  
Changing his own copy plus "submitrequest"/"pull request".
