Up to ReaR version 1.18 when using TSM  
there is no way for the user to explicitly specify  
what TSM should save in the backup (during "rear mkbackup") and  
what TSM should restore from the backup (during "rear recover")  
when the default behaviour is not what he actually needs.

Ideally TSM should support already existing "BACKUP"  
options in default.conf as far as applicable, e.g.

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE
or
EXCLUDE_BACKUP
EXCLUDE_RESTORE
</pre>

For details see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821)

I set "looking for sponsorship" for this issue because  
there is nothing at all what I could do regarding  
issues with third-party backup tools (or any other  
third-party software) that I do not have on my  
systems (i.e. where I cannot test anything).

In short:

This issue needs to be implemented by someone  
who uses rear with TSM on his systems.

To anybody who uses ReaR with TSM on his systems:

Just be courageous and enhance the curently rather  
poor TSM support in ReaR - it cannot get worse ;-)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/833](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/833)
mitigates the problem where the btrfs subvlums are  
not restored by default via TSM.

Now by default both 'fs' and 'btrfsmountedsubvol' entries  
in disklayout.conf are used to generate the default TSM  
filespaces to include in a restore.

This mitigates
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821)  
because now a better default is used but this does  
not yet implement
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)  
because the user still cannot explicitly specify what to backup  
and restore with TSM when the default behaviour is not  
what he actually needs.

@schabrolles Could you have a look at this issue and tell us if it makes
sense? If not, then we better close this issue, no?

@gdha

I start an implementation in \#1348  
Currently, it only provides a list of Directories or FS to add to the
TSM backup. (From `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE`).  
=&gt; This allow to backup only part of the system (only "systemvg" for
example with ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "systemvg" )). In that case, only the
FS part of SystemVG will be included into the TSM backup.

But, It is more difficult to add an exclude list (there is no option in
the dsmc cli)

By default, TSM uses special files (include exclude files) which tell
what to backup and what to exclude.  
But changing those files from ReaR seems a bit dangerous... I would
prefer let the user modifying directly those files.

@schabrolles  
I fully agree to not overdo the TSM support in ReaR.

When TSM has its own files how to configure TSM backup (and restore)  
ReaR should never ever change those TSM config files because  
in general all files on the original system are sacrosanct for ReaR.

But in case of BACKUP=TSM  
ReaR may tell the user when he has (non-empty) settings in  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
EXCLUDE\_BACKUP  
EXCLUDE\_RESTORE  
that are ignored by TSM and that such things  
must be set in TSM own config files  
or at least this should be described in  
the "BACKUP=TSM" section in default.conf

In current default.conf the EXCLUDE\_BACKUP description  
looks like a globally available config option, cf.  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-January/003276.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-January/003276.html)  
which is basically the same kind of issue for NSR.
