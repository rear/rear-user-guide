ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
2.7

If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you can't
upgrade:

OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
/etc/rear/os.conf"):  
RHEL8

ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
/etc/rear/local.conf"):

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://myserver/backups
    ISO_DEFAULT=automatic
    # ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended

Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hello,

I am attempting to create a ReaR recovery environment  
to perform automated disaster recovery with ISO output and NFS share.  
I want to fully automate the recovery.  
If I use ISO\_DEFAULT when booted from that ISO  
it will automatically trigger the recovery  
but at the end there is a prompt  
on how one wants to proceed  
(Enter rear recovery shell, reboot).  
So this is not fully automatic.  
If I use ISO\_RECOVER\_MODE=unattended it automatically reboots  
but one is caught in an infinite reboot loop  
if the ISO CD Rom is the first boot device.

I know I can handle that at the automation layer  
with Ansible and the ILO/Vsphere API logic.  
But ideally I am looking for something like  
ISO\_RECOVER\_MODE=poweroff,  
which would just shut off after recovery.  
I know I could always sed the corresponding bash script  
after installing the rear package so it does a poweroff  
instead of a reboot.  
But I would like to avoid that to keep support by Red Hat.

1.  Is there a way to configure this behaviour already?
2.  Or do I need to create a PR for this?
3.  Would it also be merged back to rear 2.6 and repackaged?

Thank you very much for your hard work.  
I did around 40 rear recovery across physical,  
virtualized, RHEL7 and RHEL8 and all worked like a charm.

My first totally offhanded idea is  
whether or not it could be sufficiently simple  
to enhance the current hardcoded behaviour of

    ISO_RECOVER_MODE="unattended"

by optionally something like

    ISO_RECOVER_MODE="unattended=COMMAND"

so that optionally COMMAND could be run after successful 'rear
recover'  
instead of the current hardcoded 'reboot' that is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L200](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L200)

Or alternatively (perhaps easier to implement and more versatile  
as a separated variable where its value is not a kernel argument)  
an additional new config variable like

    ISO_RECOVER_MODE_COMMAND="COMMAND"

or

    RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND="COMMAND"

?

`ISO_RECOVER_MODE_COMMAND="COMMAND` sounds like a great suggestion. With
that you could even register your client to a server (for example
subscription-manager or start a monitoring agent like Zabbix or Splunk).
The default value could be reboot for backwards compatibility.

@GitarPlayer  
to do some additional things after "rear recover"  
had recreated the system (just before "rear recover" exits)  
you can use POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT or POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS,  
see its description in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3494](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3494)

What I mean here is only specifically what (simple) command  
should be called after "rear recover" had exited  
to automatically reboot the recreated system  
or alternatively do something else.

After looking at the code in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
I decided (at least for now as far as I understand things)  
to implement a simple and generic `RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND`  
in particular because `ISO_RECOVER_MODE="unattended=COMMAND"`  
would be specific for ISO but we also have PXE\_RECOVER\_MODE  
and I do not like to mess around with possibly complicated  
kernel command line arguments with options and values like  
`ISO_RECOVER_MODE="unattended='COMMAND -option1 --option2=value'"`  
and in general I like to Keep Separated Issues Separated "KSIS"  
(i.e. the recover mode versus its "reboot" command),  
cf. RFC 1925 item (5)

    It is always possible to aglutenate [sic]
    multiple separate problems into a single
    complex interdependent solution.
    In most cases this is a bad idea.

@GitarPlayer  
I would appreciate it if you could have a look  
at my currently offhanded and untested proposal  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070)

Perhaps you could even test it?  
You could manually change your  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
as shown in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070/files)  
but only the RECOVERY\_REBOOT\_COMMAND changes  
(i.e. not the SECRET\_OUTPUT\_DEV stuff)  
and then specify in your etc/rear/local.conf

    RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND="poweroff"

redo a "rear mkbackup" and test if "rear recover"  
does an automated 'poweroff' in 'unattended' mode.

many thanks @jsmeix that worked like a charm.  
I did your suggested changes and I think it would be a great addition.

Pardon my ignorance, but what about setting

    POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS+=( 'echo "powering off in 30 seconds" sleep 30 poweroff' )

Of course your proposed solution is much nicer  
but this would work just fine as interim solution  
until your PR is merged and released to RHEL8?  
Or am I missing out something obvious?

@GitarPlayer  
thank you so much for your test!

Calling 'poweroff' in POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
happens while "rear recover" is still running  
so 'poweroff' will terminate this running 'rear' process  
which works likely OK in practice because at that state  
"rear recover" had done its job (i.e. the system is recreated).

But it is cleaner to let the running 'rear' process finish  
regularly on its own which does in particular

    LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"

see in current GitHub master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L759](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L759)  
so with 'poweroff' in POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
one would no longer get that syslog message  
which could make an important difference  
for some users in some cases.

thank you very much for pointing out the exact difference. LogToSyslog
could be very useful for Event Driven Ansible indeed.

Hi @GitarPlayer

I think there are two ways to approach the problem. You can have manual
intervention before the start of the recovery, or after it. In the first
case, you can remove `ISO_DEFAULT=automatic` and select the appropriate
entry in the ReaR boot menu manually when the CD boots. I believe the
default entry chainloads the first hard drive without manual
intervention, so this way the reboot loop is avoided.

If after the recovery, you need to change the boot order after the
recovery has completed and the system has rebooted. The new
`RECOVERY_REBOOT_COMMAND="poweroff"` will help with the reboot loop, but
you still have to change the boot order next time when you power the
machine back on. Since we can't change the boot order from inside the
system, there is no way around the problem (except maybe putting "eject"
into `POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS`, but even then I suspect the BIOS will
load the CD-ROM tray back before attempting to boot from it).

Note that the problem is specific to BIOS machines. On machines with
smarter firmware (UEFI, Open Firmware) we restore the original boot
order, which means that next time we will boot into the recovered system
and not the recovery medium.

Thanks everybody for *not* doing `KEY=VAL=CUSTOM` stuff...

I guess you could manage to start a delayed poweroff via
`POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS` but it is not very intuitive as ReaR tries
really hard to collect all subprocesses.

\#3070 will provide a nice solution.

KEY=VAL=CUSTOM would be really quite ugly and at the same time
inflexible.

With

this issue should be solved.
