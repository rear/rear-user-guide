Failed to load ldlinux c32 when i tried to load rescue (iso) image in my
vm.  
I am using rsync to backup. I have done a backedup from my physical
machine.  
I tried to restore it in my VM. But is was throwing error like

    Failed to load ldlinux.c32
    Boot failed. Press a key to retry.

Please help me on this.

@cvijayvinoth

In general regarding system migration with ReaR  
(e.g. from physical to virtual hardware):

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also a virtual machine)  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
that would do the annoying legwork for you.

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before.

Additionally ReaR supports to migrate a system  
but here "supports" means that ReaR provides a lot  
that should help you to get such a task done  
but it does not mean that it would "just work" without  
possibly laborious manual settings and adaptions  
with trial and error legwork until you made things work  
for you in your particular case.

Why does the message mention ISOLINUX if it is on UEFI? I thought that
in case of UEFI, ReaR uses GRUB2, not ISOLINUX. And it does not even
seem to run under UEFI, because in that case it should mention
`ldlinux.e64`, not `ldlinux.c32`, no?

In particular, migrating bootloader form BIOS to UEFI (and probably also
vice-versa, if this is what the OP tried to do) is not supported, cf.
\#1601

@pcahyna  
I added `UEFI ISOLINUX` to the subject line of this issue because  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2471\#issue-673534538](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2471#issue-673534538)  
reads `Firmware ...: UEFI and GRUB` and the screenshot  
[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/426209/89417444-51ea0900-d74c-11ea-8b00-10b628ae659e.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/426209/89417444-51ea0900-d74c-11ea-8b00-10b628ae659e.png)  
contains `ISOLINUX` so we have some `UEFI and GRUB and ISOLINUX` issue
here.

I am always confused which bootloader is used in which circumstances.

For details what exactly happens during "rear -D mkrescue" see

I am not at all an expert in the ReaR recovery system bootloader area  
so I could totally misunderstand things but I think the root cause might
be  
that usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300_create_isolinux.sh)  
calls its functions in any case in an unconditioned way  
i.e. also in case of UEFI + GRUB as recovery system bootloader

    # egrep ' source |GRUB2 modules to load|ldlinux\.c32|Created isolinux configuration' rear-harish.log
    ...
    + source /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh
    ++ LogPrint 'GRUB2 modules to load: ext2 fat part_gpt'
    ...
    + source /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300_create_isolinux.sh

It seems some cleanup bug fixing is needed  
in the ReaR recovery system bootloader area.

Could the root cause be that the ISO was created on an UEFI system and
booted on a BIOS system? In that case, success is not expected, but the
behavior seems a bit strange.
