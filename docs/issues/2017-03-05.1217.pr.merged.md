@ProBackup-nl  
many thanks for your contribution!  
In general I agree with what you did.

I have two issues left:

Please also document the new "lz4 default -1 compression"  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf at the place where  
REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION is described e.g. like

<pre>
# With REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lz4"
# an initrd.lz4 with lz4 default -1 compression is created (fast speed but less compression).
</pre>

I do not understand the meaning of the following test in  
usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh

<pre>
test "$USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE" -eq "$USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE" || ...
</pre>

because I think it always evaluates to 'true'  
so that the code after the '||' will never be run.

@jsmeix The
`test "$USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE" -eq "$USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE"`
should not equate to true when $`USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE`
contains a floating point and not an integer.

This check is the test for "is $USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE an
integer value?", in case it is not, fall back to the default value (of
8).

    # test "1.5" -eq "1.5" || echo "Not equal"
    -bash: test: 1.5: integer expression expected
    Not equal

Hmm, hould I add some piping to hide/redirect the error, or should I
better keep the message?
