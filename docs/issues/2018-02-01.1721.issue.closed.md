Currently ReaR does not support non-ASCII characters in values.

For example currently "rear recover" even fails in case of  
a non-ASCII character in a GPT partition name, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-360816342](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-360816342)  
and subsequent comments.

The only encoding that makes sense nowadays for non-ASCII characters is
UTF-8.
