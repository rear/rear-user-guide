Hi,

I just tested the todays master branch and built a rear debian package,
backupd up and restored a system successful.

But the initrd is somehow different. Although the md5sum is the same,
the initrd (after recovery and reboot) has a huge number of additional
drivers installed (and loaded), such as Qlogic, Adaptec, Broadcom, DRBD
and other stuff, that is not needed within a virtual machine (and has
not been used before the restore)

Can you confirm (or explain) this behavior?

I think it is related to this:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh\#L47](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh#L47)

So somehow it doesn't detect udev ?  
Can you check ?

It looks like, that rear mkbackup detects, that a *current* systemd is
running and "systemd-udev" should be used. But the script
`/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh`
seems to search for the *special* rear udev rule to activate udev. But
this file has not been generated, because it previously detected, that
systemd-udev should be used (this is in script
`/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/60_verify_and_adjust_udev.sh`.

But...anyway..if "systemd" does not work within the rescue system...this
is one thing, but why does it not seem to work after a restore?

I will check again.

Hmm...ok. Maybe I was wrong, when I said, that the initrd file are the
same....i was wrong. The original initrd is not the same initrd, that is
running after a recovery. I will further check

@rpasche I suppose this is a Debian 8 (again)? Did you try the latest
rear snapshot? systemd should be working on debian8 - I'm not sure I
understand the issue at this very moment... need some more coffee

Maybe the recover log will help you.
[https://gist.github.com/rpasche/38e740d25f0a882e47aa](https://gist.github.com/rpasche/38e740d25f0a882e47aa)

The problem seems to be, that the magic rear udev rule 00-rules has not
been created and because of that, all storage modules get loaded. Later,
the loades modules get compared against the ones stored before and
initrd gets patched (updated)

I think, this
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh\#L8](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh#L8)
is the main reason. Because of this failing on debian 8 with systemd
(00-rear rules has not been generated), the modules get loaded the
*normal* way and thus, the modules *needed on this recovery hardware*
are patched into initrd.

Ah.....just saw another issue...but this is only because of *this*
error. After I successfully recovered a backup with rear, I just wanted
to test the `ONLY_INCLUDE_VG` setting and start another backup. But
because the initrd is still *poluted* with all storage drivers (from
last recovery), all following `rear mkbackup` fail, because needed
programs are missing

    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.1 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-deb-prod-test.log
    ERROR: Cannot find required programs: drbdadm drbdsetup drbdmeta
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-deb-prod-test.log for details
    Terminated
    root@deb-prod-test:~#

But again, as I said already, when *this* issue is fixed, that error
mentioned in this comment should be gone.
