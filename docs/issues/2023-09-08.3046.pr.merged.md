and the recovered system has backup files:

    # find /etc -name \*.rearbak
    /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices.rearbak
    /etc/lvm/lvm.conf.rearbak
    /etc/fstab.rearbak

showing that the creation of backups still works.

@pcahyna  
only by the way FYI:  
I think we have very many other code places  
with unnecessary curly braces in var expansion  
so it is basically hopeless to try to fix them all.  
But if one detects them by chance while working on some code  
it could make sense to also clean up unnecessary curly braces.

@jsmeix indeed that's what did here: the new code in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3043](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3043)
had this problem copied from
finalize/GNU/Linux/260\_rename\_diskbyid.sh, so now I fixed the source
for consistency.
