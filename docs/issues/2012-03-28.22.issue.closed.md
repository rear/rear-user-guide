[\#22 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/22) `closed`: Adjust /dev/disk/by-id/\* after rear recover
===========================================================================================================

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783473?v=4" width="50">[jhoekx](https://github.com/jhoekx) opened issue at [2012-03-28 06:55](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/22):

From
SF\#[2736744](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2736744&group_id=171835&atid=859455).

In the current SLES 10 SP2 at systems with e.g. HP smart array
controller disks are mounted by persistent storage device names instead
by device name, e.g.

/dev/disk/by-id/cciss-3600508b1001841554353423058520009-part1 /boot

instead of

/dev/cciss/c0d0p1

If REAR is used to recover a backup of this system to a almost identical
system with a new hard drive (e.g. in case the disks are failed and
replaced) the first reboot will fail because the persistent storage
device names are not matching to the new disk.

REAR is aware of this and shows a message that you have manually adjust
the settings in /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst to match the new
ID's.

Could you please add a feature that this settings are done by REAR after
restore and before reboot?

proposal:

before Backup

-   save current fstab and menu.lst

-   change fstab and menu.lst to old style (/dev/disk/by-id/cciss-xxxx
    to /dev/c0d0px)

    run REAR mkbackup

    after restore prior first reboot

-   check wether ID has changed or not

-   if yes, ask customer if he want to update the ID's to match new
    hardware or not

-   if, yes, run script and change fstab and menu.lst with new ID's

-   if no, leave old style dev/cciss/c0d0px

I think it's safer to make Rear understand by-id entries and have them
replace entries in /etc/fstab and /etc/grub.conf on-the-fly only during
recovery. Rewriting by-id names to real devices is changing how a
configuration is done on similar systems, and the proposal adds a
separate interactive step which is unwanted.

Rear should *do the right thing* and make the configuration work in a
similar setup it was working (in this case any reference to the old uuid
should be replaced by the new uuid). A single search-and-replace by uuid
would be safe enough (although I would add the relevant directories just
as a safeguard ;-))

Or we just add mapping these kind of device names together with the
disk  
mapping. Might need some specialized handling for different distros as
the  
udev scripts are not standardized everywhere.

IMHO this would be the most user-friendly option.

@schlomo: AFAIK This has been addressed with  
dr/GNU/Linux/10\_describe\_diskbyid\_mappings.sh  
finalize/GNU/Linux/16\_remove\_diskbyid.sh  
in 1.7.22d  
But somehow those files went lost while integrating Heinlein P2V
patches???

Yes, the merge process back then was a little bit messy. Please submit
any  
missing parts via our bug tracker, that would really help us a lot.

The best way is to either create them as a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/) and reference them here or add them to
your github Rear fork and submit a pull request.

@hreif did you mailed the RPM to Jeroen??

@jhoekx were you able to inspect the diskbyid scripts? Are these usable?

I briefly scanned them, but I don't remember them. I'll forward the mail
to you.

Looks to me we can close this issue, no?
