Since capabilities are not backuped with tar I implemented a file based
backup using getcap and setcap.This commit was tested on SLES12 and
RHEL7. Both use capabilities instead of SUID for ping, arping, etc.

Hi @mattihautameki,

thanks a lot for this pull request! This is indeed a missing feature and
thanks a lot for providing us with a first implementation.

I went through the code and left some detailed comments. IMHO only the
following are real blockers:

-   rename BACKUP\_CAP
-   Use quotes for setcap
-   parse the capabilities file in a more robust way, e.g. with this
    example:
    `while IFS="=" read file cap ; do file="${file% }" cap="${cap# }" ; declare -p file cap ; done <<<'/some file with blanks and " = some_cap,other_cap'`

Kind Regards,  
Schlomo

Regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/771\#discussion\_r52848923](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/771#discussion_r52848923)
"REQUIRED\_PROGS is not working correctly":

Also in my opinion REQUIRED\_PROGS is not working correctly, see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755\#issuecomment-171603580](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755#issuecomment-171603580)
and subsequent comments.

But I still do not know under what exact circumstances rear should fail
with an error if something in REQUIRED\_PROGS is missing so that I
cannot decide if REQUIRED\_PROGS currently works as intended or not.

Hi!  
I implemented the suggested improvments to the best of my belief.

-   Changed BACKUP\_CAP to NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES and moved it to
    the NETFS Section in `default.conf`.
-   Use quotes for filename and capabilities.
-   I adapted the MISSING\_PROGS check in`95_check_missing_programs.sh`
    since the `Error` function is not called even if all binaries from
    REQUIRED\_PROG are missing.

I also moved the block which is collecting the capabilities
`41_save_capabilities.sh` to the **resuce** section of **NETFS**. This
is because `/var/lib/rear/recovery/capabilities` is not in the ISO from
the actual mkbackup-run. When `rear mkbackup` is run a second the file
will be included to the ISO because it is already present on the
filesystem.  
I am not familiar with the whole code of rear so let me know if there is
a better way.

Kind Regards,  
Markus

@mattihautameki looks OK to me. Thank you for the new (missing) feature.
