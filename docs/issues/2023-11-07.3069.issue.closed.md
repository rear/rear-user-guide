-   Description of the issue:

I ( @jsmeix ) would like to report an issue with BACKUP=NSR  
that a SUSE customer reported to us.

Regarding BACKUP=NSR:  
In general there is nothing what I could do  
in case of issues with third-party backup tools  
because I do not have such software  
so I can neither test nor reproduce anything.

A SUSE customer is using ReaR version 2.7

The customer got the following issue:

With BACKUP=NSR "rear checklayout" always results exit code 1  
even if nothing of the disk layout has changed.  
So "rear checklayout" would create a new ISO every day  
even if this is not necessary.

The customer found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
that tells (excerpts):

    So IMHO removing the line
    NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    from the script 650_check_iso_recoverable.sh in the existing code
    will not harm the execution of the NSR workflow

and

    Log "NSRSERVER ($NSRSERVER) was defined in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf"

The customer does not want to set a fixed NSRSERVER in local.conf  
because NSRSERVER is dynamically determined via "rear mkrescue"  
and stored in /var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr\_server,  
see rear/rescue/NSR/default/460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
there were 2 proposed workarounds:

    Proposed workaround(s):
    In 650_check_iso_recoverable.sh comment in the line as follows
    #NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    or
    use the more sofisticated code snippet taken from 400_verify_nsr.sh instead:
    [...]

    if [[ ! -z "$NSRSERVER" ]]; then
        Log "NSRSERVER ($NSRSERVER) was defined in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf"
    elif [[ -f $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server ]]; then
        NSRSERVER=$( cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    else
        Error "Could not retrieve the EMC NetWorker Server name. Define NSRSERVER in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf file"
    fi

    [...]

The first workaround was implemented but it causes that now  
with BACKUP=NSR "rear checklayout" always results exit code 1  
even if nothing of the disk layout has changed.

The customer tried the second workaround which works as expected.  
In particular with the second workaround it works again as before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)

Furthermore the customer just linked it

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default # ls -l
    total 4
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 ... 400_verify_nsr.sh -> ../../../../verify/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ... 650_check_iso_recoverable.sh

which also works for the customer  
so this could be a third possible workaround.

So the questions are:

Is the customer right, that the second workaround should be used?  
If yes, could ReaR be fixed this way?  
Or would the second workaround cause other unwanted side effects?  
Or could the third possible workaround be the best solution?

The customer would prefer the third possible workaround  
provided this does not cause unwanted side effects.

-   Workaround:

Create  
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh`  
as relative symlink that points to  
`../../../../verify/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh`

@hpannenb @gdha @viper1986  
could you please have a look here.

In particular I would be interested to know if reverting the fix

@jsmeix I guess to verify potential fixes and to evaluate the right
approach somebody will need to run some tests on a system with NSR
installed.

If a personal and direct interaction with this SUSE customer is possible
to do so, then please reach out to @gdha or me as this might yield the
fastest results.

Do I understand correctly that upstream ReaR already behaves well and
you are now looking for a potential back-port for SUSE?

@schlomo  
current upstream ReaR does not behave well  
because it contains the change  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af)  
of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)

ReaR from before that change behaved well for what  
our customer needs but that does not behave well  
for what @viper1986 needs according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162\#issue-460949301](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162#issue-460949301)

Our customer has already a workaround for his needs in place.

This issue is about to get a proper ReaR upstream fix  
that makes things behave well for both use cases,  
the one our customer has and the one @viper1986 has.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162\#issuecomment-541343374](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162#issuecomment-541343374)  
@hpannenb proposed two "workarounds"  
where the first one was implemented  
which causes the issue for our customer  
but for the more sophisticated second one  
our customer reported that this works for him.

So it seems the more sophisticated second one  
makes things behave well for both use cases,  
the one our customer has and the one @viper1986 has.

Accordingy I will implement that second workaround now  
as a GitHub pull request to somehow move this issue forward...

The suggestion from the discussion in \#3077 is to actually remove the
check for NSR backups from the `checklayout` workflow and instead adding
support for easily running custom code as part of the `checklayout`
workflow.

Specifically this would also mean removing the complete
`650_check_iso_recoverable.sh`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/01f503ed05beef78d8397719b9dce25fcdb211c6/usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh\#L1-L18](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/01f503ed05beef78d8397719b9dce25fcdb211c6/usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650_check_iso_recoverable.sh#L1-L18)

Any thoughts on implementing that? Wouldn't that actually solve the
customer problem, too?

I know that this essentially reverts \#653 and might force users like
@tomglx to adjust the way how they use ReaR. However I hope that this is
acceptable if it will prevent troubles for other NSR users.

BTW, looking at the non-default code paths in `layout/save` it seems
like only NSR has that type of additional backup monitoring
functionality:

> @hpannenb @viper1986 could you please have a look at \#3077

Sorry. I have missed this issue so I am quiet late responding. If
required I might need to dig into this if time permits.

As mentioned elsewhere I just added some snippets of code to the
existing NSR related backup code to enable our companies/my usecase and
to be compatible to the existing one(s). I currently do not get to know
where the `rear checklayout` exits with the wrong error code. Is there
any (debug) log available or did I miss that?

> \#3077 didn't work.

@jsmeix I would have opted for this solution. Is there anything like a
(debug) log to find out more about why it did not solve the
`rear checklayout` situation for the customer?

Hello everyone,  
Unfortunately, I don't have the opportunity to test REAR with NSR.  
I'm very sorry, but our NSR-based environment has been disabled and I am
unable to perform any tests.

FYI  
in general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:

Usually we at ReaR upstream do not have or use third-party backup
tools  
(in particular not if a third-party backup tool is proprietary
software)  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.

In case of issues with third-party backup tools and ReaR  
we at ReaR upstream can usually do nothing but totally  
depend on contributions and help from those specific users  
who use and know about each specific third-party backup tool.
