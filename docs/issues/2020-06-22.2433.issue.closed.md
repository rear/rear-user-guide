@gdha  
I assume you are asking about adding ReaR 2.6  
to SUSE's official SLE 15 repositories which means  
to officially provide and support ReaR 2.6 in SLE-HA-15  
cf. the section "SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Adding a package to SLE is a rather complicated task.  
Currently it is not planned to add ReaR 2.6 to SLE-HA.  
Things could change if SLE-HA customers need ReaR 2.6.
