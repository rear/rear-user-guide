Hello,  
I am using
[https://rear.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rear/trunk/](https://rear.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rear/trunk/)
(825) because stable version was giving me messages regarding BUG BUG
BUG which may be regarding parted.

Anyways, on this SVN version (and may be with other versions of ReaR as
well), Relax and Recover log shows messages that different file systems
such as boot at not dumped, but they may be dumped in reality.

It will be useful if the messages below can be changed such that these
show true sense of what happened.

    tar: /proc/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /nfs1/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /lib64/rc/init.d/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /sys/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /boot/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /dev/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /nfs/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped
    tar: /var/run/dovecot/anvil-auth-penalty: socket ignored

From what I have been told, what in fact happens is that tar is ordered
to back up each file-system (e.g. / /boot /usr), but every mounted
subdirectory is not being backed up as part of the filesystem that is
backed up (using --one-file-system). Above message is scary :D

Let me know if you need more information from my side.

Thanks for your help,

Upen

This is indeed a confusing message, because for each file system that is
being backupped by tar, it will display this message for each mountpoint
on that file system (when `--one-file-system` is provided). Which means
that one will get this error/warning for each mountpoint, which gives a
false sense of incorrect behavior ;-)

A solution might be to look at the `--warning` option in order to
suppress this specific message. Chances are that this specific message
cannot be suppressed without impacting other useful message...
