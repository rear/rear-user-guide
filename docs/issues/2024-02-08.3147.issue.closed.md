-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I have a LUKS encrypted LVM that can be successfully captured and
restored using rear.  
The problem is when I use

    clevis luks bind -d /dev/sda2 tang '{"url":"http://tang.srv"}'

to enable NBDE unlocking the rear restore no longer works.  
After using clevis to bind the key you have to run dracut in order for
the VM to boot properly as described
[here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption_security-hardening#configuring-manual-enrollment-of-volumes-using-clevis_configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption).

I can capture a backup and restore the image but upon reboot the error I
receive is:

    dracut-initqueue[683]:
     Failed to start systemd-cryptsetup@luks\x2d....service:
       Unit systemd-cryptsetup@lus\x2d.....service not found
    Dependency failed for cryptography Setup for luks-...

I went through this [post](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2509) but
my UUIDs in the crypttab matched fine.  
I even set a partlabel on the working VM LUKS partition and modified the
crypttab to use PARTLABEL= instead of UUID but that did not work
either.  
Is there a module that is not getting put into the initrd upon restore?

I just wanted to update that I found a workaround for this issue by
using the PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT settings.  
The pre script unbinds the tang key and then the post script adds it
back.  
Seems to work well.

The PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is set to run right before the backup phase from
what I understand.  
I needed it to happen earlier in the process.  
I changed the name and moved  
/usr/share/rear/backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh  
to /usr/share/rear/init/default/001\_pre\_backup\_script.sh  
and this ran the script earlier in the process  
and I was able to achieve the outcome that is needed.  
If there is a better way to change the order of processes, then please
let me know.

Thanks

@Herpgon  
sorry that noone replied to your posting here.  
I assume this is because everyone was busy with other issues  
and/or noone has sufficient clevis knowlegde or uses clevis.  
At least I know nothing about clevis nor did I ever use it.

Currently there is no support for clevis in ReaR  
('clevis' does not appear in any ReaR source file).  
So what is needed - as far as I see - is adding  
at least basic clevis support in ReaR.

As far as I see your workaround is "OK-ish".  
ReaR is meant to be adapted for specific use cases  
(even with quick and dirty hacks if needed).

If you like to do it and if you would also maintain it  
for some reasonable time until basic clevis support  
works reasonably well in ReaR, we would appreciate  
a GitHub pull request from you that adds basic clevis  
support in ReaR.
