I am looking for a possibility to speedup the backup process by changing
the compression level of gzip. It works fine but it is really slow
caused by the usage of only one CPU.

I tried to use only tar. It works fine with an acceptable speed but I
want to use a low compression to save diskspace.The default
compressionlevel is 6. I think compressionlevel 4 would be a good deal.

Does anyone know how I can edit these compression settings in REAR?

OS= openSUSE 42.1  
REAR-Version= 1.18

Thanks for the information gdha. I already know that information. Other
formats like bzip and xz are much slower than gzip.  
I am looking for a way to change the gzip compression level. I want to
use gzip.

According to  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html\_node/gzip.html\#SEC134](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/gzip.html#SEC134)  
the tar -I option can override the defaults like

<pre>
tar -c -I 'gzip -9 -n -c' -f archive.tar.gz directory
</pre>

but in /etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS="-I 'gzip -9 -n -c'"
</pre>

does not work because in  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh  
it is used as

<pre>
case "$(basename ${BACKUP_PROG})" in
    # tar compatible programs here
    (tar)
    ...
        $BACKUP_PROG $TAR_OPTIONS ...  \
        ...
        ... $BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS \
</pre>

which leads to a quoting hell where I failed to escape  
from it with reasonable effort.

According to  
[http://superuser.com/questions/360966/how-do-i-use-a-bash-variable-string-containing-quotes-in-a-command](http://superuser.com/questions/360966/how-do-i-use-a-bash-variable-string-containing-quotes-in-a-command)  
and other such postings the best way out of quoting hell is

<pre>
Putting commands (or parts of commands) into variables
and then getting them back out intact is complicated.
...
Usually, the best way to do this sort of thing is using
an array instead of a simple text variable:
FLAGS=(--archive --exclude="foo bar.txt")
rsync "${FLAGS[@]}" dir1 dir2
</pre>

Example:

<pre>
# BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=(-I 'gzip -9 -n -c')
# set -x
# tar -c -v "${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}" -f archive.tar.gz directory
+ tar -c -v -I 'gzip -9 -n -c' -f archive.tar.gz directory
</pre>

As time permits I will play around with it...

Wow!

It seems (at least on SLE11 and SLE12) that bash is  
tolerant regarding array versus simple text variable.

In particular one can generally use ${VAR\[@\]}  
also to get the value of a simple text variable:

<pre>
# BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=foo
# echo "'$BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS'"
'foo'
# echo "'${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}'"
'foo'
</pre>

This way it seems I can change  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh  
in a backward compatible way so that it still works when  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS is defined  
as a simple text variable but also when it is defined as  
an array.

It seems basically with simple replacing of all

<pre>
$BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS
</pre>

with

<pre>
"${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}"
</pre>

in usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh  
and usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh  
makes it work for me with things like

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=(-I 'gzip -9 -n -c')
</pre>

in /etc/rear/local.conf

@stoxxys  
please test if it also works for you this way  
and provide feedback.

@jsmeix this is actually standard behavior for Bash and the reason why I
recommend to implement all variables like this as an array. It doesn't
cost us anything and it enables the users to provide more complex
values.

@schlomo  
many thanks for your information!

It means that I can implement it in this way  
without fear of backward incompatible regressions.

I verified that
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/904\#issuecomment-232065858](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/904#issuecomment-232065858)  
also works on SLE10 which has bash version 3.1.17  
(SLE11 has bash version 3.2.51 and SLE12 has 4.2.47).

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/912](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/912)  
this enhancement should be implemented.

Note that tar version &gt;= 1.27 is required for  
using it with command options (like 'gzip -9') in

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( -I 'gzip -9 -n -c' )
</pre>

because only  
since tar version 1.27 tar supports passing command  
line arguments to external commands, see  
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

FYI  
some statistics how the gzip compression level from 1 to 9  
makes a difference on my particular SLES12-SP1 test system:

I specified in etc/rear/local.conf from

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( -I 'gzip -1 -n -c' )
</pre>

to

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( -I 'gzip -9 -n -c' )
</pre>

and got for the gzip compression level from 1 to 9  
those backup.tar.gz sizes and the time and speed  
to make each (according to the last line in backup.log):

<pre>
-1 : 1286M backup.tar.gz in 129.191 s at 10.4 MB/s
-2 : 1270M backup.tar.gz in 131.495 s at 10.1 MB/s
-3 : 1256M backup.tar.gz in 139.401 s at 9.4 MB/s
-4 : 1232M backup.tar.gz in 140.011 s at 9.2 MB/s
-5 : 1217M backup.tar.gz in 165.636 s at 7.7 MB/s
-6 : 1210M backup.tar.gz in 174.397 s at 7.3 MB/s
-7 : 1208M backup.tar.gz in 194.586 s at 6.5 MB/s
-8 : 1206M backup.tar.gz in 271.525 s at 4.7 MB/s
-9 : 1205M backup.tar.gz in 383.796 s at 3.3 MB/s
</pre>

Interestingly for me gzip compression level 9  
needs almost three times more time but results  
only about 7% less backup.tar.gz size  
compared to gzip compression level 1.

@stoxxys  
what are your results with that new feature?

I have tested the new feature an it works great!

Thanks a lot

Changing a string variable into an array  
works usually backward compatible as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/904\#issuecomment-232065858](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/904#issuecomment-232065858)  
but in special cases it is not backward compatible:

In particular one cannot simply use

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=""

instead of the right

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()

because during "rear recover" (with BACKUP=NETFS with usual 'tar')  
the former (i.e. BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS="")  
makes `tar ... -C /mnt/local/` untar the whole backup.tar  
into the '/root' directory inside the ReaR recovery system, see
