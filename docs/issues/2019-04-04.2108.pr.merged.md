-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on SLES12 and SLES15 while testing
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2081](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2081)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

1.)  
The changes in layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh  
avoid that it goes into MIGRATION\_MODE with

    Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)

in any case when there is more than one disk.

Before it compared for all disks how often any original disk size  
matches any possible target disk size and when there are  
more disks e.g. both on the original system and on the target system  
there are /dev/sda with 10 GiB and /dev/sdb with 20 GiB  
then 10 GiB original disk size matches 10 GiB target disk size  
and 20 GiB original disk size matches 20 GiB target disk size  
which are all together two matches which falsely leads to the  
"more than one with same size found".

Now it compares separatedly for each original disk size  
if there are more than one (target disk) with same size found.

Basically a reset `found_orig_size_on_replacement_hardware=0`  
was missing for each original disk size.

2.)  
The changes in finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
avoid that GRUB2 gets needlessly installed two times on the same device.

When there are more disks like /dev/sda and /dev/sdb it can happen
that  
for /dev/sda bootdisk=/dev/sda and GRUB2 gets installed on /dev/sda
and  
also for /dev/sdb bootdisk=/dev/sda and GRUB2 would get installed again
there.

Now we remember in the `grub2_installed_disks` array where GRUB2  
was already successfully installed and skip installing GRUB2 on a disk  
in that array.

@gdha  
could you have a look at the plain code changes if they look o.k. to
you  
because I would like to have it in ReaR 2.5 - except it smells "fishy"
;-)

If there are no objections I woud like to merge it today.
