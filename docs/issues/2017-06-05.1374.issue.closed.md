    UEFI with secure boot enabled
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    rear rescue image fails to boot when secure boot enabled
-   Work-around, if any:  
    disable secure boot. boot with rear rescue image and complete rear

i have seen similar issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/702](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/702)
with SLES11 SP3.

we are using SLES 12 SP2, is there any change is required for SLES12 SP2
to make it work?

One more update:

when we tried to boot the image from EFI shell its giving **Security
violation** error.

    FS0:\EFI\BOOT\>BOOTX64.efi 
    Command Error Status: Security Violation
    FS0:\EFI\BOOT\>

from the above error message, we can interpret that the BOOTX64.efi is
missing signature certificate.  
Please correct my interpretation if its not correct.

I am not at all an UEFI or even Secure Boot expert  
but as far as I see there is not something apparently  
going wrong in your "rear -d -D mkrescue" log.

@porana  
could you re-run "rear -d -D mkrescue" with

<pre>
KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
</pre>

in your etc/rear/local.conf file and  
then inspect if the contents of your  
$TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/  
look o.k. - in particular whether or not all  
needed files for UEFI Secure Boot are there?

Hi @jsmeix,

Thanks for your time. as per our understanding, secure boot does not
have any extra files other than shim.efi. secure boot validates the efi
applications(like BOOTX64.efi. shim.efi, grub.efi, etc,...) using secure
boot tools. whether it has valid signature on that file?

we have following observations from the log file:

    /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/25_populate_efibootimg.sh
    ++ cp -v /boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi /tmp/rear.IfJpNOAQSVgsczd/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi
    '/boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi' -> '/tmp/rear.IfJpNOAQSVgsczd/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi'

here its copying shim.efi to BOOTX64.efi, here if we verify the
signature using sbverify tool, it will show you some signature table has
present.

    rear199:/var/log/rear # sbverify /boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi
    warning: data remaining[1045472 vs 1170720]: gaps between PE/COFF sections?
    Signature verification failed

we tried to reproduce the same manually. we can see that shim.efi has
signature table present.

    rear199:/var/log/rear # cp -v /boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi /tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi
    '/boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi' -> '/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi'
    rear199:/var/log/rear # sbverify /tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi
    warning: data remaining[1045472 vs 1170720]: gaps between PE/COFF sections?
    Signature verification failed

after copying to BOOTX64.efi also, there is no change in the signature
table.

after this rear is trying to create bootable grub2 image using
grub2-mkimage command.

`grub2-mkimage -v -O x86_64-efi -c /tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg -o /tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi -p /EFI/BOOT part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux linuxefi multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs`

after running this comamnd, we verified the BOOTx64.efi with sbverify
comamnd. here its giving the error saying no signature table present

    rear199:/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT # sbverify /tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi
    No signature table present
    Signature verification failed

looks like grub2-mkimage is wiping out the secure boot signature table
on BOOTX64.efi.  
we are not sure here, is there a way to create signature on the
BOOTX64.efi, after grub2-mkimage comamnd executed. or is there a way to
retain the signature table while running grub2-mkimage on BOOTX64.efi.

@gdha , @gozora , @pavoldomin do you have any input on this issue, as
you guys worked similar issue

Hi @porana,

I'll certainly take a look on this issue but it will take couple of
days. I've returned from vacation yesterday evening and need to solve
couple of (for me) priority things first.  
It would help me if you could upload your recovery image (\*.iso)
somewhere. You can provide me login credentials to <c@gozora.sk> if
needed.

Hi @gozora,

Thanks for your commitment.  
i have uploaded the \*.iso file to dropbox and i have given permissions
for you (<c@gozora.sk>). you can download it from there. if you have any
problem creating account for dropbox, please let me know i can share you
the direct link for the iso download.

Thanks & Regards,

@porana just by heaving a quick look on this issue please try to
download and install [latest ReaR
version](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/rear-2.1) which
contains some commits that might help to resolve your issue (9a31a5fa
and his predecessors).

I'd recommend first try ReaR 2.1 without following parameters:

    USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1
    UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi

If you still have trouble with booting please attach output log from
`rear -d -D mkrescue` (located in /var/log/rear/ directory).

Hi @gozora,

Even with Rear 2.1 also, its same issue. you can find the attached log
file for the same.

[rear-rear199.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1073747/rear-rear199.zip)  
its still not booting with secure boot enabled.

Thanks @porana,  
Is *Relax-and-Recover **(no Secure Boot)*** boot option working for you?

@gozora I think there was some miscommunication. Let me explain you the
issue once again.

Option 1:  
if Secure boot enabled at ***BIOS*** level on the server, the rescue
image fails to boot. we did not even get the grub menu of
Relax-and-Recover.

Option 2:  
if Secure boot disabled at ***BIOS*** level on the server, the same
rescue image boots and we get the grub menu of Relax-and-Recover. i.e.
it will show all the 4 options on the grub menu.

1.  Relax-and-Recover (no Secure Boot)
2.  Relax-and-Recover (Secure Boot)
3.  Reboot
4.  Exit to EFI shell

in this case both Relax-and-Recover (Secure Boot) and Relax-and-Recover
(no Secure Boot) options works fine and we are able to do recovery.

in our case all our severs are default secure boot enabled at ***BIOS***
level. so we are not able to boot with the rescue image. if we disable
the secure boot at ***BIOS*** level, then only we are able to boot with
the rescue image.

let us know, if you still does not understand the issue. we will try to
send some screen shots.

I've been looking at this on HP DL360 Gen 9 servers recently when
using  
RHEL. In my rear logs, I saw io errors when accessing the NVRAM
variables.  
Access to this area being blocked for security reasons by secure boot.

On HP servers at least, if you do have a good backup from server A,
and  
are trying to restore to a different server, you can during boot, use
the  
advanced features (F9) I think and there is a 'add' option. You get a
file  
explorer type menu to navigate down to the boot option.

@gozora, I'm also very happy after seeing that message.  
good that you are able to reproduce the issue looks like.

the below SUSE link can give you some insight into the secure boot, how
it implemented in SLES.

Finally I have SLE12 SP2 booted in Secure boot mode!  
@porana can you please send me output from following command:

    echo "===PK==="; mokutil --pk; echo "===KEK==="; mokutil --kek; echo "===DB==="; mokutil --db

I'm starting to have a dim feeling that current ReaR code can't work
correctly with enabled Secure boot ...  
I'll continue with investigation in next days.

Hello @porana,

I've created small
[patch](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/1686526e5e4d79fb4ea922fb121d88f8af4dccce)
that should resolve your problem.

Please download and install ReaR from my Github page
(`git clone https://github.com/gozora/rear.git`).  
If not done already, add
`UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi` to your
*/etc/rear/local.conf*. Then you just need to recreate your ReaR
recovery system (`rear mkrescue`) and try to boot newly created ISO.  
With this patch, ReaR booted with Secure boot without any problems.

HI @gozora,

Thanks for the patch. it has solved our problem.  
now we are able to boot with rescue image when secure boot enabled.

once again, thanks a lot!!!

With \#1385 merged, this issue can be closed.

@porana please be aware that we've changed ReaRs behavior a bit.  
If you decide to use upstream version be sure to update your
configuration as follows:

    - UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi
    + SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/sles_sap/shim.efi"

this make sense, instead of just copying the same Boot loader.

@jsmeix it was fun after all, and except that I have test environment
with working Secure Boot!!!  
So, no problem ;-).
