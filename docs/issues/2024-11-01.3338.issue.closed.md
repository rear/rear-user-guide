-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): Relax-andRecover 2.7 /
    2022-07-13

-   If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you
    can't upgrade:
    [https://software.opensuse.org/package/rear](https://software.opensuse.org/package/rear)
    official version is at 2.7, no other community packages provide a
    newer version so I would have to build my own.

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"): openSUSE Tumbleweed 20241011

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    [failed-local.conf.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17603675/failed-local.conf.txt)

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR): PC

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): Linux x64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): NVMe with secondary SSD

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT"):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    My NVMe drive recently began to mount read only (btrfs) and show
    errors with btfrs check. After replacing the drive and using the
    rear rescue ISO to attempt to recover, I ran into an issue where the
    disk recreation script is failing because of
    `chattr: command not found`. No, I did not test this configuration
    (it worked perfectly with Fedora, so I got lazy and didn't test the
    ISO). However I'm using the Tarfile backup method and a separate
    backup of my home directory using Deja Dup, so nothing too critical
    will be lost... just time.

1.  I believe I've run into
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927).
    Does this mean that this issue is fixed in Rear 2.8? If so, I will
    see if I can request a version bump from the maintainers of the
    package for Tumbleweed.
2.  Am I screwed when it comes to restoring with the current ISO? Or, is
    there a way to get the missing chattr/lsattr binaries into the
    rescue system and complete the rescue?

-   Workaround, if any: none I can find

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Update: I have made a lot of progress, and the bulk of my install is
safe. I thankfully have another computer also running the same version
of Tumbleweed, and I managed to copy over libraries and files that I
needed for REAR to work:

Steps

1.  mount recovery drive
2.  copy custom /etc/rear/rescue.conf with password prompt (using
    encrypted backup)
3.  copy lsattr and chattr to /usr/bin
4.  copy all missing lib\* found using ldd on another machine to /lib64

1.  copy over /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper, and
    /usr/share/snapper/config-templates/default

This answers my question number 2, aka thankfully I'm not screwed and
was able to pull in stuff manually. REAR ran "successfully" (no errors,
but other unrelated issues that I will create a separate issue for). I'm
still curious about the status of the fix for this (question number 1),
does the template here prevent the chattr, lsattr, and snapper issue
from occuring?

@cbmiller2610  
regarding your question

    I will see if I can request a version bump
    from the maintainers of the package for Tumbleweed.

Because there is no newer ReaR release than 2.7  
there cannot be a newer package version  
in Linux distributions under normal circumstances  
(i.e. when Linux distributions do not distribute  
current work-in-progress upstream development states).  
But you can on your own use any upstream state as needed  
because ReaR is only bash scripts (plus documentation)  
so nothing needs to be compiled or otherwise made usable.  
E.g. see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
or use our GitHub snapshots builds from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/snapshot](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/snapshot)
