When downloading rear-1.17.2.tar.gz from "the Sourceforge Downloads
page" at
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)
I get

<pre>
310548 bytes rear-1.17.2.tar.gz
</pre>

In contrast in OBS Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-1.17.2 there is

<pre>
310392 bytes rear-1.17.2.tar.gz
</pre>

Which one is the right one?

A diff between both shows that those files differ:

<pre>
doc/rear.8
packaging/rpm/rear.spec
</pre>

The OBS one was the latest stable uploaded and therefore the correct
one. I've uploaded the OBS tar ball to Sourceforge.
