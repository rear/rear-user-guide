In the example in
[http://relax-and-recover.org/usage/](http://relax-and-recover.org/usage/),
it seems like

    BACKUP_URL=$OUTPUT_URL

is missing.

Or is this actually a bug and it should work without?

I'll be happy to fix it, just wanted to be sure I fix the right thing
:-)

@schlomo you are right - it should say `BACKUP_URL=` instead of
`OUTPUT_URL=`. It would have been correct if the example would show
`rear mkrescue` instead of `rear mkbackup`. If `BACKUP_URL` is defined
(and no explicit `OUTPUT_URL` has been defined) then
`OUTPUT_URL=BACKUP_URL`
