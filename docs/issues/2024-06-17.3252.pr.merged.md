    See CI results

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   Disable some builds and tests to reduce false positives and
        clutter:
    -   openSUSE Copr builds from Packit. The opensuse-leap-15.3-x86\_64
        was obsolete and opensuse-tumbleweed-x86\_64 is not considered
        very useful:
        [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239\#issuecomment-2173594371](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2173594371)
        . In the past, the builds were failing several times due to some
        breakage in Copr unrelated to ReaR or openSUSE. Disabling them
        may reduce false alarms from CI.
    -   Koji scratch builds from Packit. They are unlikely to uncover
        any other issues than the Copr builds do and the resulting RPMs
        have not been very useful.
    -   Fedora rawhide and 40 tests. They fail due to an unknown reason,
        see \#3175. Letting them enabled will only generate false alarms
        in unrelated PRs.

CI tests have not started yet due to

@rear/contributors, this should be independent of the exact outcome of
\#3251, as we need to disable rawhide (and f40) tests for now anyway, as
they are failing deterministically.
