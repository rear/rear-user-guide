Hey Guys,

first of all, thank you for this epic and outstanding fabulous tool! I
love using ReaR at my home environment.

However i am a bit lost and wanted to ask if you may can help me out to
get my physical Server backed up.

-   rear version :  
    `Relax-and-Recover 1.18-git201607251102 / 2016-07-25`
-   OS version :  
    `Distributor ID: Ubuntu Description:    Ubuntu 15.10 Release:        15.10 Codename:       wily`
-   rear configuration file (local.conf):  
    `OUTPUT=ISO BACKUP=NETFS BACKUP_URL="cifs://192.168.0.13/g/BACKUPS/rear" BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/creds" BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/proc/kcore' '/home/zuli12/downloads/*' '/dev/shm/*' '/mnt/*' '/media/*' ) `

Some Information on the original System as rear dump output:

[https://gist.github.com/mzlumin/66a2daf960eba5832cc077d6c2b701c8](url)

I am running LVM over an 2TB HDD, i have build this using the default
Ubuntu Server install proccess and i am trying to recover this one on an
VmWare 12 Workstation Pro ( i have been able to restore 2 VM's without
Issues )

Phsysikal CPU Info:  
[https://gist.github.com/mzlumin/db241e02f73fdb5b0ceb0b4e34829536](url)

VmWare Host CPU is a Intel Core I5  
`Prozessor  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 3401 MHz, 4 Kern(e), 4 logische(r) Prozessor(en) `

OK so if i try to recover from the saved backup i run through the
interactive menu until i face some parted faults, please see here:

I have also tried to modify the script and layout, however it seem not
to work for me, i would ask you for some help in this Case :(

Thanks,  
Mario

@gdha  
I think the parted "Warning ... not properly aligned ..."  
is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102)  
but that does not let "rear recover" fail.

I think the subsequent parted "Error" is a different issue  
and that one lets "rear recover" fail.

@mzlumin  
I have no personal experience in using rear for migration.  
I think in general using rear for migrating a system  
onto different kind of "hardware" is tricky and depending  
on the exact difference it may become a complicated task.  
I think in your case you need to manually adapt the  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf file into something  
that matches the new "hardware", cf. the section  
"Restore to different hardware" in  
doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc  
Again:  
I have no personal experience in using rear for migration  
so that my above information could be totally wrong.

Perhaps my curently first steps in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841)  
to implement rear recovery system update support  
could be already useful here:

Instead of manually changing files like  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
in the running rear recovery system  
my currently implemented first steps in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841\#issuecomment-229069740](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841#issuecomment-229069740)  
to download and install files into  
the running rear recovery system  
could make this task much easier for the user.

@gdha @mzlumin  
if you are interested I could do a pull request and merge it  
to have its current state available in rear master code  
so that you could test it and try out if it is useful for you  
and provide feedback and issue reports if it does not work.

I created
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/945](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/945)

@gdha  
if you like it, please merge it.  
It is a pure additional functionality so that  
it cannot cause backward incompatible regressions.

@jsmeix @gdha  
Thanks for the heads up on this and the answers.  
I will look into \#841 , i will surely try it out on my site if you want
to.

I consider this also might help a few other people out there in such a
Case ? :)

If this one is merged i need to get the newest revision, correct ?  
Is there anything i need to look at afterwards, or should it work out of
the Box ? Just some silly enduser questions :)

@mzlumin  
in general regarding how to test the currently  
newest rear GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory.

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
# cd rear
# vi etc/rear/local.conf
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

Thanks @jsmeix will do that.  
Is it okay if i do the clone now and try it out ? Or do i need to wait
for the merge ?

Do i need to run anything advanced then or is trying and report if that
works enough for you ?

Thanks

As long as it is not merged into rear master  
cloning the rear master code does not contain it.

When it is merged clone it and then read my comments  
how to use it (in particular my comments in default.conf)  
and for an example how it I used it see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841\#issuecomment-229069740](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841#issuecomment-229069740)

Right now I merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/945](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/945)  
so that you can try it out.

See default.conf how RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL works.

Note that this new RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL  
functionality does not at all do anything to make  
your initial problem P2V migration go away.

The RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL functionality  
only could help you to adapt the rear recovery system  
more easily on the new hardware so that "rear recover"  
works on the new hardware.

In short what I think you should do is:

On the old system update rear to the newest rear GitHub  
master code as described above  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-236151041](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-236151041)  
and have in your etc/rear/local.conf (in the directory  
whereto you "git cloned" the newest rear GitHub master code)

<pre>
RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://your_HTTP_server/$HOSTNAME.rear_config.tar.gz"
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" curl )
</pre>

and then run "rear mkbackup" there.

Now you have a rear recovery system with the  
new RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL functionality.

When you boot the new hardware with the above created  
new rear recovery system and run "rear recover" there,  
it will download

<pre>
http://your_HTTP_server/$HOSTNAME.rear_config.tar.gz
</pre>

from your HTTP server and install it into the  
rear recovery system before it proceeds.

This way you can provide for example an adapted  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf to be installed  
into the rear recovery system before it  
creates partitions, filesystems, and so on  
so that you can get partitions, filesystems, and so on  
created by "rear rcover" on the new hardware  
as you need it there.

Probably your first experiments with an adapted  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf will fail but  
with the RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL functionality  
it should be much easier for you to do several  
trial and error attempts until you got it right  
because now you can update the disklayout.conf file  
on your HTTP server, pack it into a \*.tar.gz and  
reboot the new hardware with the same above created  
new rear recovery system but now it will install  
the updated disklayout.conf file from your HTTP server.

Bottom line:  
With the RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL functionality  
you get shorter/easier trial and error cycles when you  
need adaptions in the rear recovery system to make  
"rear recover" work.

Thanks @jsmeix i am on it to create the backup at this time, and i have
build up an simple WebServer to server the config Files.

This will really help a lot to get things changed quicker! Thanks for
the merge.

However i consider i will struggle to get this working with my
experience of partitions and stuff though.

But i will give it a try and report back for sure.

@mzlumin  
many thanks in advance for your feedback about  
the RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL functionality,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/945\#discussion\_r72958496](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/945#discussion_r72958496)

<pre>
The new RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL functionality
will require further enhancements...
</pre>

At least it should help you to struggle faster ;-)

@mzlumin  
I think for your tests you could simplify it and  
leave out the $HOSTNAME indirection and  
use a fixed tar.gz so that you can use a fixed URL like:

<pre>
RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://your_HTTP_server/P2Vstuff.tar.gz"
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" curl )
</pre>

No worries @jsmeix i think i will get the Update\_URL functionality to
work, also i have added ssh access, seems to work better on VmWare
though :)

Let's see how far i come with this one.

Thanks!

@mzlumin  
if you need scp support for automated update  
via RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL like

<pre>
RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="scp://user:password@host/path/to/file.tar.gz"
</pre>

I think I could add this relatively easily.

Wow, basically i think this would also help some people out there, in my
particular case i don't need scp, but thanks for the information!

I consider i might need more help with the actual recovery as i am
somehow too silly to get this working.

I will post the results with the new git version soon, will get this
done in the next 2 hours i think.  
A quick view showed it does download the file just fine, i will need to
look into it to say something.

Will keep you posted - Thanks @jsmeix

Hi @jsmeix

ok i can confirm that it is way easier to get things modified using the
newest git and the UPDATE\_URL attribute - Thanks again for that.

However i seem to be to silly to get things working, it has not
magically fixed my Issues as you stated :(  
Here is my latest log from the recover test:  
[https://gist.github.com/mzlumin/80258ba5ce094aae0153882eeb8a1c47](url)

Here is the disklayout File:  
[https://gist.github.com/mzlumin/0ed1fa5c2720de5dc1901c833af19f55](url)

I tried my best, but as said, i'm not to deep with partitions and stuff
unfortunately :&

What i am wondering about is the last lines in the Log File:

`+++ parted -s /dev/sda mkpart '"logical"' 256909312B 2147483647999B parted: invalid token: logical Error: Expecting a partition type.`

I am pretty sure that a somehow equal config works on another Box, also
with those logical partition ?

Welcome to parted!

In general regarding parted see  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html)

I can reproduce your parted behaviour  
on my SLES12-SP1 test system:

<pre>

parted: invalid token: logical
Error: Expecting a partition type.
</pre>

The reason is that you cannot have a logical partition  
directly on the disk.

You first need an extended partition - a container partition  
that usually goes to the end of the whole disk,  
then you can add logical partitions inside the extended  
container partition:

<pre>
# parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart extended 16MiB 128MiB
# parted -s /dev/sdb print

I suggest that you boot the rear recovery system on the  
new hardware, log in as root but do not run "rear recover".  
Instead do the parted calls manually until you know what  
exact parted calls will work so that you can make the  
disklayout.conf according to the exact parted calls  
that had actually worked.

Thanks @jsmeix i think with that last information i have been able to
get this working!

Just one last thing i have seen while testing these, i have tried it
using the latest git, it also downloaded the file from the WebServer:

The only thing was that it has not used those modified files, if i e.g.
looked at the disklayout file, although modified on the webserver and
packed again to the same name...

I just give it another shot with a fresh backup and recovery..

Thanks anyways for your great help!

@mzlumin  
when using the latest rear master code  
from within a sub-directory "rear" as in

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
# cd rear
# vi etc/rear/local.conf
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

the disklayout.conf file is not in  
/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
but in that "rear" sub-directory  
/.../rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
below whatever path of parent directories.

Accordingly in the rear recovery system you must  
install an updated disklayout.conf into the same  
/.../rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

For example on my SLES12-SP1 test system  
I run the newest GitHub master code in /root/rear  
with /root/rear/etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://10.160.4.244/$HOSTNAME.rear-update.tar.gz"
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" curl )
</pre>

where 10.160.4.244 is my HTTP server  
and "g215" is the hostname of the system  
where I run "usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup".

When I change /root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
I make a tar.gz as

<pre>
tar -czvf g215.rear-update.tar.gz /root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
</pre>

and copy that into /srv/www/htdocs/ on my HTTP server.

In the rear recovery system it looks then as follows:

<pre>
RESCUE g215:~ # rear -d -D recover
...
Updating recovery system with the content from 'http://10.160.4.244/g215.rear-update.tar.gz':
/ ~
root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
~
Updated recovery system.
...
</pre>

This way I get the new disklayout.conf available  
in the rear recovery system at  
/root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

I guess you get your modified disklayout.conf  
installed at the wrong place in your rear recovery system.

Note that the RECOVERY\_UPDATE functionality is meant  
to be usable in a generic way which is the reason why  
it does not have sophisticated built-in "intelligence"  
whereto stuff might be "best" installed. It simply installs  
any content of the tar.gz in the root '/' of the recovery system.

Thanks @jsmeix i consider this one can be set to solved or fixed :)

Thanks for all your help and for getting this amazing project running!

@mzlumin  
I understand your latest comment that  
with the right content in the update tar.gz  
it also works for you.
