A first attempt for FIRMWARE\_FILES support,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1216](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1216)

Do not yet merge it.  
I need to do some more tests.

@jsmeix Can you wait until this Friday before merging this pull request?
I will be doing a live demo at CeBIT around 15:00 (upcoming Friday) and
I do not like surprises that it would fail due this merge. Thanks for
your hard work Johannes.
