I would like to know what the limitations of disk layout complexity
are  
where the disk layout can be recreated with our current layout code.

For what I mean with "disk layout complexity" have a look at the
section  
"Changes in the Partitioner UI to Unleash the Storage-ng Power" in  
[https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/10/09/yast-sprint-64/](https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/10/09/yast-sprint-64/)

The image therein  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1788608/51597951-c9569f80-1efc-11e9-90a1-04e6b425cad6.png)  
shows an (intentional artificial) example of a complex disk layout  
that can be created in newest SLES15 with the so called "storage-ng"  
partitioner and the storage setup subsystem in YaST.

It contains in particular things like

-   MD RAID that consists of full disks and partitions (e.g. /dev/md1
    consists of /dev/sdb and /dev/sda3)
-   MD RAID that contains partitions (e.g. /dev/md1 contains /dev/md1p1
    and /dev/md1p2)
-   A disk that is directly formatted with no partitions in between
    (e.g. there is an ext4 filesystem directly on /dev/sdc that is
    mounted at /data)

That image shows an example of a higher stack of storage objects  
where one kind of storage object (partitions) appear on different
levels:

-   mountpoint /home is on top of
-   filesystem ext4 that is on top of
-   partition /dev/md1p1 that is on top of
-   MD RAID /dev/md1 that is on top of two parents
-   disk /dev/sdb (that has no parent) and partition /dev/sda3 that is
    on top of
-   disk /dev/sda (that has no parent)

Simply put, my question is if ReaR's current layout code is meant  
to support arbitrary big mesh-like stacks of storage objects  
('mesh-like' because a child can have more than one parent  
and 'stack' because there is a hierarchical top-down structure)  
or if there are currenly "built-in" limitations.

@schlomo @gdha  
I hope you could answer my question.  
Perhaps you already experienced generic limitations in our current
layout code?

The layout code was designed to handle the following setup (no picture
as nice as yours):

    HP RAID controller
      /dev/sda
        /dev/sda1
          /boot
        /dev/sda2
          pv
            lv /
            lv ...
            drbd
              pv
                lv /data1
                lv /data2

This means that it should be able to handle arbitrary setups as long as
the names of the things are unique. The dependencies between components
are used to create the devices in the right order.

@jhoekx  
thank you very much for your prompt reply.

Now I will try out (as time permits) to set up such kind of  
(intentional artificial) examples of complex disk layout  
and see how it works with ReaR.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2086](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2086)
is a precondition  
for efficient testing ReaR with arbitrary disk layouts.

@jsmeix IMHO ReaR should support that complexity as I don't see there
any new block device types.

If this "storage-ng" introduces a new storage layer with new block
devices then we would have to add support for this.

The best way to help ReaR in this context is to create an automated test
case that runs for example in a qemu VM.

Independent of the disk layout complexity (i.e. the dependencies  
of parents and children in the mesh-like stack of storage objects)  
there are limitations what kind of storage objects ReaR can deal with.

Currently ReaR does not support

-   One Btrfs filesystem on multiple storage objects (e.g. disks),  
    cf.
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028)

-   Bcache storage objects e.g. `/dev/bcache0`,  
    cf.
