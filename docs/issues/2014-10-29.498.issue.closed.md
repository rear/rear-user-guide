hi,

what is currently the rule-consistent behavior for integration of
daemons getting started by the recovery bootup?

Currently the sesam client is started through the system-setup.d scripts
(etc/scripts/system-setup.d/59-start-sesam-client.sh). As i understand
those scripts are started using a system-setup description on systemd
based systems. This will work nicely if no systemd is around, if so,
starting the sesam daemon from these scripts works until the bootup has
finished, after that the daemon is no longer running.

I suspect the issue has to do with systemd not knowingly starting up the
service in the background and gets rid of it as soon as the system-setup
scripts have been finished, killing off its childs (did not yet have
enough time to spend a closer look)

Can third party programs also supply systemd valid components just like
you guys do for SSHD? And if, where to place them?

Thanks!

sure, you can add your systemd startup files under
`skel/SESAM/usr/lib/systemd/system/`
