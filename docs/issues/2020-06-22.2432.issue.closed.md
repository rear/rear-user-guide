-   ReaR version: 2.6

-   OS version: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (and other systems using cryptsetup ≥
    2.1.0)

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

While ReaR is known to **not support** recovery of a device encrypted
with LUKS version 2 (\#2204), it should correctly recover a device
encrypted with LUKS version 1. However, on Ubuntu 20.04, recovering a
LUKS version 1 device makes ReaR create a LUKS version 2 container. This
prevents ReaR from creating a rescue medium afterwards due to lack of
support for LUKS version 2.

As documented on
[ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Encryption_options_with_dm),
cryptsetup changed its defaults starting with version 2.1.0. So on newer
systems, `--type luks1` must be passed as an additional option to
`cryptsetup luksFormat` if it is undesirable to create a LUKS version 2
container.

So in etc/rear/local.conf something like

    LUKS_CRYPTSETUP_OPTIONS+=" --type luks1"

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1650](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1650)  
should help as a workaround until we could make things working  
automatically by default in ReaR.

I guess we cannot just add in default.conf `--type luks1`  
to the current LUKS\_CRYPTSETUP\_OPTIONS because  
I fear on older systems `cryptsetup`may not support that  
or we are lucky and `--type luks1` is supported on all  
systems that are currently officially supported by ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L2513](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L2513)

On SLES11 `man cryptsetup` does not show a `--type` option  
so on SLES11 using `--type luks1` makes things likely fail  
but SLES11 is no longer officially supported by ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L2524](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L2524)

On SLES12 `man cryptsetup` reads (excerpts):

    BASIC COMMANDS
      The following are valid actions for all supported device types.

      open <device> <name> --type <device_type>
        Opens (creates a mapping with) <name> backed by device <device>.
        Device type can be plain, luks (default), luks1, luks2, loopaes or tcrypt.
    ...
    OPTIONS
      --type <device-type>
        Specifies required device type, for more info
        read BASIC COMMANDS section.

so since SLES12 using `--type luks` or `--type luks1` or
`--type luks2`  
should be supported.

But in the `luks (default)` in `man cryptsetup`  
indicates that having `--type luks1` in default.conf  
may result something different than the default `--type luks`.

On the other hand I cannot find in `man cryptsetup`  
what the difference between `--type luks` and `--type luks1` would be  
because `man cryptsetup` only describes in the 'LUKS EXTENSION'  
section that "LUKS2 is a new version of header format" but nothing  
about 'LUKS1' - only 'LUKS' is mentioned there.

So it seems `--type luks` and `--type luks1` mean the same  
(why the heck don't they explicitly tell about it?)  
so that it seems we may use `--type luks1` in default.conf  
without causing regressions on systems that are  
currently officially supported by ReaR?

@rear/contributors  
does one of you know more details about LUKS  
in particular if and what the differences are  
between `--type luks` and `--type luks1`?

On
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device\_encryption](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption)  
I found (excerpt):

    Encryption options with dm-crypt

    Cryptsetup supports different encryption operating modes to use with dm-crypt:

        --type luks for using the default LUKS format version (LUKS1 with cryptsetup < 2.1.0, LUKS2 with cryptsetup ≥ 2.1.0),
        --type luks1 for using LUKS1, the most common version of LUKS,
        --type luks2 for using LUKS2, the latest available version of LUKS that allows additional extensions,
        --type plain for using dm-crypt plain mode,
        --type loopaes for a loopaes legacy mode,
        --type tcrypt for a TrueCrypt compatibility mode.

Accordingly `--type luks` would be useless in practice  
and `--type luks1` is the only right thing to enforce LUKS1.

Because `--type luks1` in default.conf  
"just works" for my SLES12 LUKS test system. cf.  
"SLES 12 SP 5 with default LUKS encrypted LVM and btrfs structure" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6)  
I will do a pull request soon...

@OliverO2  
I would appreciate it if you could review  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2437](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2437)  
i.e. check whether or not that makes things  
work right by default also in your case.

@jsmeix  
Sure, I'll look at it. Will be sometime next week as I'm too far away
from my lab environment this week. ;)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2437](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2437)
merged this issue is fixed.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2437](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2437)
merged  
the LUKS\_CRYPTSETUP\_OPTIONS defaults  
are no longer compatible with SLES11 `cryptsetup`, cf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2432\#issuecomment-648099580](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2432#issuecomment-648099580)  
which means a SLES11 user whos uses LUKS must manually specify  
in his etc/rear/local.conf appropriate LUKS\_CRYPTSETUP\_OPTIONS  
e.g. what the default had been before, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8472a679f9477ab1eab91fdb387620ce50ddc785](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8472a679f9477ab1eab91fdb387620ce50ddc785)

    LUKS_CRYPTSETUP_OPTIONS="--iter-time 2000 --use-random"

@OliverO2  
thank you for the issue report and for testing the fix!
