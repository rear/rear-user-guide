I installed rear 1.17.0 on my SLES 12 VM named vsaps12 and executed
`rear mkrescue`.

3 lines from my `/etc/rear/site.conf`:

    OUTPUT=PXE
    PXE_CONFIG_PATH=/clusterdisk/srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
    PXE_TFTP_PATH=/clusterdisk/srv/tftpboot/sap/

The output of `rear dump` includes:

    Output to PXE
                   PXE_CONFIG_PATH = /clusterdisk/srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
                 PXE_CONFIG_PREFIX = rear-
                  PXE_CREATE_LINKS = MAC
              PXE_REMOVE_OLD_LINKS =
                     PXE_TFTP_PATH = /clusterdisk/srv/tftpboot/sap
                   PXE_TFTP_PREFIX = vsaps12.
                     RESULT_MAILTO =

So I expect the output in the `$PXE_TFTP_PATH` directory, and there it
is.  
But when I look at `pxelinux.cfg/rear-vsaps12`, I see the lines

     label rear
            kernel vsaps12/vsaps12.kernel
            append initrd=vsaps12/vsaps12.initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0
    vga=normal rw selinux=0 console=ttyS0,9600 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0

Hm, why that? There is no directory vsaps12/, and the file has been  
stored correctly into the sap/ directory. Is this a bug or a feature?

BTW, this is not specific for SLES 12. My SLES 11 SP3 boxes create the  
same config with "kernel = $(hostname)/$(hostname).kernel" ...

I think it was nice if either  
a) rear writes down the correct directory name in the config or  
b) symlinks the directory where the files are put to the directory
that  
is written in the pxe config ;)

@gdha maybe do a 1.17.1 release for this one? If we really broke
existing setups I would be happy to fix it ASAP.

@schlomo Indeed I was just looking at the DRLM documentation

    We have to manualy add to the client configuration file in the DRLM server called /etc/drlm/clients/client_name.cfg with the next content:

    OUTPUT=PXE OUTPUT_PREFIX=PXE BACKUP=NETFS NETFS_PREFIX=BKP BACKUP_URL=nfs://SERVER_IP/DRLM/STORE/client_name OUTPUT_URL=nfs://SERVER_IP/DRLM/STORE/client_name OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE=client_name/$OUTPUT_PREFIX

    You have to replace the SERVER_IP for the IP of the DRLM server and the client_name for the client host name.

I just wonder what the exact link is between
`OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE=client_name/$OUTPUT_PREFIX` and how our code was
changed. Perhaps it was not meant to change?

I miss having tests for this kind of stuff :-( Unfortunately I cannot
read from the code exactly how the result should look.

Just made an issue
[https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm/issues/12](https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm/issues/12)
for DRLM support team so they can verify how serious this issue is for
them.

Hello,  
Maybe if set $OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE="" to /etc/rear/site.conf solve this
issue.

81\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh result:

kernel /$PXE\_KERNEL  
append initrd=/$PXE\_INITRD root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw
$KERNEL\_CMDLINE

@didacog we need to fix ReaR so that it behaves like before adding the
stuff for DRLM. Forcing users to change their configuration is basically
not OK, unless we have a very strong and convincing reason for doing
that.

The reason "nobody verified it before release" is not good enough.

Since you also use this code path, could I kindly ask you to look into
the question of modifying your patch to keep the old behaviour while
enabling your use case?

@schlomo this behavior is the same since rear 1.16. Is not changed in
rear 1.17.

In 1.17 we only changed OUTPUT\_PREFIX to OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE in
81\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh. but remain with same behavior since 1.16.

By default ReaR creates $OUTPUT\_PREFIX directory on remote location and
without this prefix on 81\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh never found kernel
and initrd.

This is true without overwriting PXE\_CONFIG\_PATH or PXE\_TFTP\_PATH.
We never had the need to overwrite these variables.

I see. Maybe nobody really used this stuff since before 1.16, who knows.

Next question for me would be then: Which behaviour do we actually want
to have?

setting OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE="" maintain 1.15 behaviour and works well
with the other rear defaults.

by default is OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE=$OUTPUT\_PREFIX on default.conf and
works well if no overwritting any variables.

@didacog in pull request
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d711f877efe62e2640c50492aae761984cdeb327](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d711f877efe62e2640c50492aae761984cdeb327)
the following was added to the `default.conf` file:

    +# DRLM need this in order to PXE, at boot, can find kernel and initrd files. We initialize with OUTPUT_PREFIX just to maintain same behaviour without DRLM.
    +OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE="$OUTPUT_PREFIX"
    +

If I understand the discussion above well then it is OK for you to make
variable `OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE` empty in `default.conf` , right?  
Perhaps, it would be better to initialize this variable, if you need it,
in script `init/default/01_set_drlm_env.sh`?

@gdha we have no need to initialize this variable in
"init/default/01\_set\_drlm\_env.sh".

If it's defined in default.conf. We can provide a value for it throught
the DRLM http config service.

But if initialized empty in default.conf, this breaks some ReaR default
behaviors fixed in 1.16.

On the other hand, there is no problem for DRLM if
OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE="" in default.conf, we can overwrite this on our
centralized config files.
