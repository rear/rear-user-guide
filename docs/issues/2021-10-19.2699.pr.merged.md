@DEvil0000  
could you test if my overhauled serial console code  
in this pull request still works for you?

I found out why only a serial device was added  
to kernel commandline and recovery system bootloaders  
if there was a "speed" value for that serial device:  
See my comment for the new get\_serial\_device\_speed function in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/093bd1bc58bf68819f731ce374469147e06c2f15/usr/share/rear/lib/serial-functions.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/093bd1bc58bf68819f731ce374469147e06c2f15/usr/share/rear/lib/serial-functions.sh)

@DEvil0000  
with my recent commits here I enhanced how  
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB can be used.  
Now the user can alternatively specify a whole  
GRUB 'serial' command that is used as specified, e.g.  
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB="serial --unit=0 --speed=9600"  
See my updated description for it in default.conf.

@DEvil0000  
if my current SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB implementation  
works well for you (or if you find bugs that can be easily corrected)  
i.e. when you agree with the intent of my current  
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB implementation  
then I could try to implement the same kind also for  
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_SYSLINUX

makes sense. That was my guess, too

sounds good but not sure if that much control was needed

will do as soon as I find the time for it. maybe tomorrow - hopefully
this week.

That SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB can be a whole GRUB 'serial'
command  
was more a nice side effect of my added safeguard condition  
`if test -c $SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB ; then`  
because that made me think about the `else` case.  
Instead of just show an error for that `else` case  
I found it more helpful to support a whole GRUB 'serial' command.  
Of course then SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB="/dev/sda1" results  
a broken GRUB config but that is what I mean with "final power to the
user".  
When the user manually specifies bad things then bad things will
happen.  
ReaR runs as 'root' and ReaR is meant for experienced admins.

I cannot really test because my homeoffice laptop has no  
real serial hardware so that for all its serial device nodes  
`stty -F /dev/ttyS*` results "Input/output error" so not any 'speed'
value  
so there is not any (semi)-automated serial console setup.

The only test I could do so far is with

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=10
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL='MY-DATA'
    USB_BOOT_PART_SIZE=1024
    USB_BOOTLOADER="grub"
    USB_DEVICE_BOOT_LABEL=MY-BOOT
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/MY-BOOT
    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/MY-DATA
    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="yes"
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB="serial --unit=4 --speed=9600"
    KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" console=ttyS4,9600 "

which results on my USB disk

    }

with fallback `KERNEL_CMDLINE=' selinux=0 console=tty0 '`  
in contrast to what I had specified in local.conf  
`KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" console=ttyS4,9600 "`.  
This is because cmdline\_add\_console() in
usr/share/rear/lib/serial-functions.sh  
strips all existing 'console=...' parameters from the kernel
commandline  
that code was before in rescue/GNU/Linux/400\_use\_serial\_console.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/009b1b43eb18df78fc5c4dde1e9268376d948bb4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/009b1b43eb18df78fc5c4dde1e9268376d948bb4)  
but if no serial device node has a 'speed' value it adds the fallback
'console=tty0'  
so I wonder how I could provide same final power to the user  
also for serial console setup of his kernel commandline  
as he has for his serial console setup for SYSLINUX and GRUB.

With my recent enhancement SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICES\_KERNEL  
I can specify serial consoles for the kernel of the recovery system  
as I like:

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=10
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL='MY-DATA'
    USB_BOOT_PART_SIZE=1024
    USB_BOOTLOADER="grub"

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="yes"
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB="serial --unit=4 --speed=9600"
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL="/dev/ttyS7 console=ttyS8,9600 console=tty0"

results this boot/grub2/grub.cfg file on my sdb2 USB boot partition

    search --no-floppy --set=root --label MY-BOOT
    insmod all_video
    set gfxpayload=keep
    insmod part_gpt

    set fallback="chainloader"
    echo 'Switching to GRUB2 boot menu...'
    sleep --verbose --interruptible 3
    menuentry "Relax-and-Recover (BIOS or UEFI in legacy BIOS mode)" --id=rear {
        insmod gzio
        echo 'Loading kernel /rear/linux-h9wr/20211021.0955/kernel ...'
        linux /rear/linux-h9wr/20211021.0955/kernel root=UUID=f05af948-6075-40a3-9191-354b0a0a9afc  selinux=0 console=ttyS7 console=ttyS8,9600 console=tty0 
        echo 'Loading initial ramdisk /rear/linux-h9wr/20211021.0955/initrd.cgz ...'
        initrd /rear/linux-h9wr/20211021.0955/initrd.cgz
    }
    menuentry "Boot from second disk hd1 (usually the original system disk)" --id=chainloader {

        reboot
    }
    menuentry "Exit (possibly continue bootchain)" --id=exit {
        exit
    }

Booting from that USB disk works well for me  
on my older x86\_64 laptop with traditional BIOS  
that has no serial hardware ("stty -F /dev/ttyS..." show "Input/output
error")  
so I see GRUB error messages about unavailable serial things  
(because of "sleep --verbose --interruptible 3" one can see such
messages)  
but GRUB is sufficiently fail-safe and shows its menu on the VGA
console  
and same for the kernel that also uses the VGA console.  
In the booted recovery system "dmesg" shows  
"... console=ttyS7 console=ttyS8,9600 console=tty0"  
in the kernel command line.

@DEvil0000  
because my above little test without real serial hardware  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699\#issuecomment-948367891](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699#issuecomment-948367891)  
worked at least for me I think it this pull request is now in a state  
where you could also test it - preferably with a real serial console.  
If you find issues I will fix them (as good as I can).

I wonder why we explicitly set hardcoded GRUB serial options

    --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1

when those are the defaults in GRUB according to  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html\#serial](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#serial)  
that reads (excerpt)

    word and stop are the number of data bits and stop bits.
    Data bits must be in the range 5-8 and stop bits must be 1 or 2.
    Default is 8 data bits and one stop bit.
    parity is one of ‘no’, ‘odd’, ‘even’ and defaults to ‘no’. 

I think it is better to not explicitly enforce default values  
because that is against what is meant with defaults.

With SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_GRUB the user can specify  
a whole GRUB 'serial' command with all options  
when he needs non-default options like

    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB="serial --unit=2 --speed=115200 --word=7 --stop=2 --parity=odd"

added for boot partition test as needed:

    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REARBOOT 

I tested in addition the following serial config combinations:

    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES="/dev/ttyS0"

    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES=
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB="serial --unit=1 --speed=115200"

    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX="serial 1 115200"
    USB_BOOTLOADER=syslinux

issues found:

-   USB\_BOOT\_PART\_SIZE is not set by default causing a missing boot
    partition. a default of at least 1gb would make sense; min about
    512mb; I like 2gb personally. I think it should be default to work
    well with all output modes. grub config is slightly wrong in this
    case and looking for label REARBOOT even it it does not exist but it
    still works.
-   if USB\_BOOT\_PART\_SIZE is set the output URL default is wrong. it
    points to data not to boot. should be
    OUTPUT\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REARBOOT
-   mkrescue fails if data partition is mounted
-   default description is wrong:
    `# SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL="/dev/ttyS0 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0"`.
    the device should not be there but `console=` stuff should be

**so the serial part looks good to me**

@DEvil0000  
thank you for your review!  
It helps us so much to have a review by one who actually has serial
hardware.

Regarding USB\_BOOT\_PART\_SIZE or other OUTPUT=USB issues:  
I will do further enhancements and cleanup for OUTPUT=USB  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666)  
as time permits (but before ReaR 2.7 will be released).

Regarding SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICES\_KERNEL description in default.conf

    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL="/dev/ttyS0 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0"

I think it is right because I had tested

    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL="/dev/ttyS7 console=ttyS8,9600 console=tty0"

and got in the kernel command line

    console=ttyS7 console=ttyS8,9600 console=tty0
