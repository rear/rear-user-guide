-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/global-functions.sh added a new  
umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy function  
which is basically a copy of the code in  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
which had been added there  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909)

Use the umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy function  
in output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
and also  
in output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
see

Tested "rear mkrescue" with OUTPUT=ISO  
on a SLES15-SP6 KVM/QEMU VM with UEFI.

It works well for me because  
for me 'umount' "just works"  
(as it did for me all the time before).

Then I tested how it behaves when umount fails  
by artificially changing in the function  
umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy()  
in lib/global-functions.sh

         # First attempt to umount:
    -    umount $v "$mountpoint" && return 0
    +    umount $v "$mountpoint-qq" && return 0
    ...
         # Retry the same umount as in the first attempt:
    -    umount $v "$mountpoint" && return 0
    +    umount $v "$mountpoint-qq" && return 0

and then I got

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Found EFI system partition /dev/vda1 on /boot/efi type vfat
    Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1)
    Using '/usr/bin/xorrisofs' to create ISO filesystem images
    ...
    Trying 'umount --lazy /var/tmp/rear.jz7oSXFsmXXvo1O/tmp/efi_virt' (normal umount failed)
    Making ISO image
    Wrote ISO image: /root/rear.jsmeix-umount_mountpoint_retry_lazy/var/lib/rear/output/rear-localhost.iso (199M)
    ...
    Running exit tasks
    To remove the build area you may use (with caution): rm -Rf --one-file-system /var/tmp/rear.jz7oSXFsmXXvo1O

Then I tested how it behaves when also 'umount lazy' fails  
by additionally changing in the function  
umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy()

    -    umount $v --lazy "$mountpoint" && return 0
    +    umount $v --lazy "$mountpoint-qq" && return 0

and then I got (as expected)

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Found EFI system partition /dev/vda1 on /boot/efi type vfat
    Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1)

In general:  
Almost always in practice I never find the time  
to do general code cleanup work.  
So yes, unfortunately in practice we have all the time  
this mess of various code places here and there  
that do almost same things.

The basic problem here is that I alone cannot do  
general code cleanup - more precisely I alone could do it  
but then only im my own way (so as if I was some kind of  
absolute dictator - which I totally refuse to be).  
I.e. the real problem with general code cleanup is  
the very time consuming work to get general consensus  
what the "one right way" is how to do something properly.

In this particular case:  
@pcahyna implemented his umount\_mountpoint\_lazy()  
as he specifically needs it for his specific use case  
and I implemented my umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy()  
as I specifically need it for my specific use case.

So for a general code cleanup of both some superior  
"master developer" would be needed who fully understands  
both specific use cases to create the generalized  
"one right way" function that fulfills both needs.

I think each of us could do it in theory  
but I think none of use finds the time  
to actually get it done in practice.

    "time permits" never happens in practice because of various
    kind of annoying issues elsewhere ...
    SO
    in practice never time for long term improvements in ReaR
    only time for some quick fix here some quick fix there
    ad nauseam...

Consolidating our several unmount functions  
is not what this pull request is meant to do.  
What this pull request is meant to do  
is what is described in its initial description.  
In particular this pull request is not meant  
to change existing code.  
This pull request is only meant to have existing code  
(that was used at a single place where it was tested  
so it has proven to work in practice as intended)  
now as a function because this code is used a two places.  
Advanced further things should not be done "by the way"  
intermixed with what this pull request is meant to do.  
Advanced further things should be done via separated  
dedicated pull requests as needed, as time permits,  
and by those who actually contribute further things.

I understand this. I'm worried that with this approach we just keep
adding more as every ReaR developer essentially builds their "personal"
ReaR within our shared codebase and nobody takes the time to clean up...

@schlomo  
I understand your concern and I have the same concern  
and I know this concern is true and valid  
from many times I looked at ReaR code.

But it is not true in general that  
"nobody takes the time to clean up".  
I spent a lot of time to clean up many things in ReaR  
(I feel that cleanup work was most of what I contributed)  
and also others spent a lot of time to clean up things in ReaR.

See the list of closed pull requests with "cleanup" label:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Acleanup](https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Acleanup)  
This is only what is explicitly labeled as "cleanup".  
Actually there was much more cleanup work done.  
On the other hand only a small part of this cleanup work  
was bigger generic cleanup, in particular code consolidating.

I told about my personal reasoning why there is  
not much generic cleanup and code consolidating in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408\#issuecomment-2694591158](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408#issuecomment-2694591158)

I think generic cleanup and code consolidating  
needs a lot of time - but not actual working time,  
instead it needs time with the meaning of patience.

I think it is a precondition before someone could do  
generic cleanup and code consolidating work properly  
that a broad and sound understanding exists  
so that the one who does the actual work  
can implement it in an insight-driven way.

In the past I did a few generic cleanups and  
for each of them I had known since a long time  
that "this stuff needs some generic cleanup".  
But it needed even longer time until I gained at least  
somewhat sufficient experience by several real-world cases  
to get at least some broad and sound understanding  
of the issue as a whole until I felt sufficiently confident  
that my generic cleanup work will (hopefully)  
not cause unacceptable regressions for our users.

In this particular case here:  
I had zero experience with umounting issues before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908)  
so I implemented  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909)  
only at the one code place where this specific issue happened  
to avoid possible regressions for our users at other code places.  
See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909\#issuecomment-1429530985](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909#issuecomment-1429530985)  
where I had already told that

    It is my goal behind to get in the end a
    sufficiently simple and reliably working
    umounting function in ReaR

But I am not yet there to implement such a function.  
The recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397)  
does not actually provide any new experience  
because it is a duplicate of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908)  
at another code place so this pull request here  
implements what matches for this two specific cases, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408\#issuecomment-2697323887](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408#issuecomment-2697323887)

So currently I am not at all in a position to implement a  
"sufficiently simple and reliably working umounting function".  
To do that I need much more understanding and experience with  
umounting in general via various different real-world cases.  
This will likely take rather long time and patience.

This is only my personal point of view.  
When someone else has sufficient knowledge to implement a  
"sufficiently simple and reliably working umounting function"  
I would appreciate a contribution which improves ReaR  
for our users.

By the way:  
I think we are rather good with generic cleanups in ReaR  
compared to many other software projects.  
In particular as long as the C standary library did not  
clean up and consolidate its various similar functions  
(in particular string related functions) into a few  
that actually are sufficiently simple and reliable,  
we do not need to worry about our cleanup speed in ReaR ;-)

Nice one, thank you. I can be happy with "ReaR is better than `libc` as
a mindset" 🤣

Thanks a lot for what you are doing, you are indeed the biggest
contributor as of late @jsmeix and I'm very much aware of it and I'm
very thankful to you for doing that!
