-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): (very likely
    any), tested with SLES11 SP3

-   Brief description of the issue  
    rear mkrescue (or mkbackup) fails with the message like  
    `2016-03-29 17:14:15.078510507 ERROR: Could not copy initrd to UEFI`
-   Work-around, if any  
    I have modified rear code: extended UEFI image size by
    experimentally determined value for this particular setup. I have
    not tested an actual recovery though (but do not see reason why it
    would not work).

I will post the patch I used immediately, for your consideration.

FYI my tests with unchanged rear 1.18 on an UEFI system:

"rear -d -D mkrescue" fails with 'Could not copy initrd to UEFI'  
because of that error in the log file:

<pre>
cp: error writing '/tmp/rear.kAFGCscGy27EXW4/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz': No space left on device
</pre>

The 128 kKiB (128000 KiB) rear 1.18 default is already  
too small for me (I do not use thrid-party backup software).

I simply changed  
/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/20\_mount\_efibootimg.sh  
directly to

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=$TMP_DIR/efiboot.img count=5 bs=32M
</pre>

i.e. with 5 x 32MiB = 160MiB it is sufficient for me.

This results in "rear -d -D mkrescue" output:  
Wrote ISO image: /var/lib/rear/output/rear-caps.iso (447M)

An UEFI bootable ISO image is much bigger (almost 450MiB)  
than a traditional BIOS bootable ISO image which is less than  
120 MiB for me.

@gozora

Regarding that the virtual image must be aligned to 32MB  
I suggest a (hopefully) cleaner and more fail-safe  
and (hopefully) more obvious way how to do it  
in your new 70\_create\_efibootimg.sh as follows  
(excerpt):

<pre>
# function to calculate exact size of EFI virtual image (efiboot.img)
function efiboot_img_size {
    # Get size of directory holding EFI virtual image content.
    # The virtual image must be aligned to 32MiB blocks
    # therefore the size of directory is measured in 32MiB blocks.
    efi_img_dir=$1
    # Specify a minimum EFI virtual image size measured in 32MiB blocks:
    case "$( basename $UEFI_BOOTLOADER )" in
        (shim.efi|elilo.efi)
            # minimum EFI virtual image size for shim and elilo
            # default: 128MiB = 4 * 32MiB blocks
            efi_img_min_sz=4
        ;;
        (*)
            # minimum EFI virtual image size for grub
            # default: 32MiB = 1 * 32MiB block
            efi_img_min_sz=1
        ;;
    esac
    # Fallback output of the minimum EFI virtual image size measured in 32MiB blocks:
    test $efi_img_dir || echo $efi_img_min_sz
    # The du output is stored in an artificial bash array
    # so that $efi_img_sz can be simply used to get the first word
    # which is the efi_img_sz value measured in 32MiB blocks:
    efi_img_sz=( $( du --block-size=32M --summarize $efi_img_dir ) )
    # Fallback output of the minimum EFI virtual image size measured in 32MiB blocks:
    test $efi_img_sz || echo $efi_img_min_sz
    test $efi_img_sz -ge 1 || echo $efi_img_min_sz
    # Output at least the minimum EFI virtual image size measured in 32MiB blocks:
    if test $efi_img_sz -lt $efi_img_min_sz ; then
        echo $efi_img_min_sz
    else
        echo $efi_img_sz
    fi
}
# prepare EFI virtual image
dd if=/dev/zero of=$TMP_DIR/efiboot.img count=$( efiboot_img_size $TMP_DIR/mnt ) bs=32M
</pre>

I did not you use
[https://github.com/gozora/rear](https://github.com/gozora/rear) for my
tests above.  
For my tests above I used the released rear 1.18 as is.  
I liked to show that for my system 128 MiB is too small.  
Perhaps the default minimal efi image size should be bigger?

But now I used your new 70\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
with the changes in my other comment directly above  
and that "just works" for me.

How embarrassing - my code in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810\#issuecomment-205808349](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810#issuecomment-205808349)
has bugs:

All fallback outputs must of course also  
return from the efiboot\_img\_size function, i.e.  
instead of things like

<pre>
test condition-to-proceed || echo fallback-value
</pre>

it must be

<pre>
test condition-to-proceed || { echo fallback-value ; return ; }
</pre>

Furthermore the

<pre>
    test $efi_img_sz || ...
</pre>

line is unnecessary  
because the subsequent test

<pre>
    test $efi_img_sz -ge 1 || ...
</pre>

alone is sufficient.

@gozora

I will send you the corrected function.  
I am sorry that my bad code caused trouble for you.  
Yesterday I changed too much at once  
and worse I did it too fast and worst I did not test  
if my error handling code actually works :-(

Do you like to keep the current default 128MiB  
minimum EFI virtual image size for shim and elilo  
which is too small for me (i.e. it seems 128MiB  
is too small for my "usual" SLES12 UEFI system)  
or  
should I also specify 5 x 32MiB = 160 MiB for the  
minimum EFI virtual image size for shim and elilo?

Not a big deal, I could discover it as well, but like I mentioned
before, your style of code is a bit hard to read for me I preffer
`if [[ ]]; then else ...` rather than `test`

For the default size, I guess that it doesn't matter what is the default
size, the function should automatically calculate size needed for EFI
virtual image, or am I wrong?

Regarding what you called "default size":

Actually it is not a default size but a minimal size  
(and its variable is named "...\_min\_sz" - cf. below)  
so that a too big minimal size matters because  
the image could never be smaller than that.  
A too big minimal size wastes space for the user, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/813\#issuecomment-205191789](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/813#issuecomment-205191789)

Regarding my coding syntax style:

Feel free to change my "test ..." into "if \[\[ ... \]\] ; then ...".  
For me both are equally well understandable.  
It is just different syntax for the same meaning.  
I do not care much about coding syntax style.

But I do care very much about coding semantics style:

Where I am particularly picky in semantics style  
is naming of any "thingies" (variables, functions, files, ...).

Frankly I insist on using descriptive meaningful names.

In particular I insist on using differentiating
qualifiers/adjectives/...  
in names for example

-   "efi\_img\_dir" instead of meaningless "$1"
-   "efi\_img\_sz" instead of meaningless "size"

I insist on using different names for different things  
so that others can easily "grep" over the whole code  
for such names and get a correct overview what  
actually belongs to that particular "thingy".

For example I never use "i" as a variable name.  
Just try to "grep" for it over the whole code  
to find where a bug is that is related to "i" ;-)

Yes, sorry it is definitely not default size, my fault. It is clear to
me what efi\_img\_min\_sz actually does.  
What I don't understand is why you want to increase it to 160MiB when
function it self can determine what the right size is? I mean when
128MiB are not enough for your SLES12, this function should return
160MiB, right?

And for the coding style, we don't need to change anything, I told it is
hard for me not impossible ;-).  
For the descriptive and meaningful names I can only agree! (however I
sometimes tend to forget to keep this rule)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-04-06 08:50](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810#issuecomment-206227461):

You are absolutely right.

But then I don't understand why there is a minimal size at all  
(i.e. I do not understand your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/813\#issuecomment-205200296](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/813#issuecomment-205200296)).

Shouldn't the "du" command determine what the right size is  
in all cases i.e. for shim and elilo and also for grub?

If the "du" command determines the right size in any case  
we could simply rely on it and remove all code that deals  
with the minimal size and its usage as fallback output value.

In case of errors with the "du" command we could then  
simply abort with "Error error-message" because I cannot  
imagine why the "du" command may fail in practice.

hmmm, actually you are right!  
All what we need is:

1.  determine size of staging directory ($TMP\_DIR/mnt/)
2.  and align it to 32 MiB
3.  return the size to `dd`

Is this what you meant?

Yes, and here my current stripped down 70\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
(that still works for me with same results as before):

<pre>

efi_img_sz=( $( du --block-size=32M --summarize $TMP_DIR/mnt ) )
StopIfError "Failed to determine disk usage of EFI virtual image content directory."
# prepare EFI virtual image aligned to 32MiB blocks:

mv $v -f $TMP_DIR/efiboot.img $TMP_DIR/isofs/boot/efiboot.img >&2
StopIfError "Could not move efiboot.img file"
</pre>

This time I even tested that the StopIfError  
actually works if the du command fails ;-)

And no longer any "test" usage ;-)

I would greatly appreciate it if you could test  
whether or not the current rear master  
with full automated UEFI image size calculation  
(implemented in the new 70\_create\_efibootimg.sh that replaced  
the whole stuff before, cf.

@pavoldomin  
many thanks for your feedback!

I was already a bit wondering why you didn't reply,  
thinking about things like you are perhaps on vacation  
but actually it was some proprietary non-free software  
that made its own false decisions
