The new config variable USB\_SUFFIX  
specifies the last part of the backup directory on the USB medium.  
When USB\_SUFFIX is unset or empty, backup on USB works  
in its current default mode (i.e. backward compatible)  
which means multiple timestamp backup directories  
plus automated rescue environments and backups cleanup  
via USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR.  
When USB\_SUFFIX is set, backup on USB works  
in compliance with how backup on NFS works  
which means a fixed backup directory and  
no automated removal of any stuff  
(regardless of USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR).  
When backup on USB behaves as backup on NFS  
(i.e. when USB\_SUFFIX is set) multiple backups and  
incremental/differential backups also work on USB.

For me incremental backups "just work" now with

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
USB_SUFFIX="myincrementalbackups"
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
FULLBACKUP_OUTDATED_DAYS=7
FULLBACKUPDAY=Wed
</pre>

The default behaviour still works for me with

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

After 5 times "rear mkbackup" I get on the REAR-000 medium  
(with the default USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=2)  
the latest (current) rescue environment or backup plus  
the second eldest and the third eldest (three all together):

As everything looks o.k. for me I will merge it.

@jsmeix  
Yesterday I've spent several hours to make this somehow work with
BLOCKCLONE!  
Next time I'll write documentation instead :-).

@gozora  
I appreciate your patient testing very much.  
I hope with current GitHub master code  
things work more as usual elsewhere also with USB  
provided USB\_SUFFIX is specified which BTW also  
avoids things like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166)

I get more and more the uncomfortable feeling that  
I may need to rework the whole backup on USB stuff  
just as it happened to me with incremental backups :-(

@jsmeix

I just finished some testing of BLOCKCONE on USB. I can confirm that
*USB\_SUFFIX* works well!

@gozora  
many thanks for your positive feedback.  
It is much appreciated!  
Last week I was a bit frustrated because  
I had seen some bits of too ugly code cf. "FIXME" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165/commits/a603b460625a5360e69a360192455c0d86c41434](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165/commits/a603b460625a5360e69a360192455c0d86c41434)  
(cf.
[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/gotchas.html](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/gotchas.html))  
that obscured my mind so that I got confused  
also about the "backuparchive" usage cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166\#issuecomment-272468726](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166#issuecomment-272468726)  
but the "backuparchive" usage and implementation is actually o.k.  
only that the variable name should be uppercase.
