[\#690 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/690) `closed`: Missing mountpoints after recovery
===================================================================================================

A successfully recovered system misses some original mountpoints. A
reason is, that `rear recovery` mkdirs them in `/` and not in
`/mnt/local`.  
See also \#619.

I post a pull request to fix this problem.
