This is a forwarded issue that was initially reported by a SUSE
customer  
and analyzed by a SUSE colleague - here excerpts of what he wrote:

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current GitHub master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

<!-- -->

    # rear -v mkrescue
    ...
    Copying files and directories
    Copying binaries and libraries
    Copying kernel modules
    Copying all files in /lib*/firmware/
    There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries
    /usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen/libloggen_socket_plugin.so requires additional libraries
            libloggen_helper-3.30.so.0 => not found
            libloggen_plugin-3.30.so.0 => not found
    /usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen/libloggen_ssl_plugin.so requires additional libraries
            libloggen_helper-3.30.so.0 => not found
            libloggen_plugin-3.30.so.0 => not found
    ReaR recovery system in '/tmp/rear.1UqzM3iYX37WjeH/rootfs' needs additional libraries, check /var/log/rear/rear-sle15sp3-1.log for details

-   Workaround, if any:

Specify in etc/rear/local.conf

    LIBS+=( /usr/lib64/libloggen_plugin-3.30.so.0 /usr/lib64/libloggen_helper-3.30.so.0 )

-   Analysis and solution proposal:

usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf holds a line

    /usr/lib*/syslog-ng/*

which makes rear include /usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen directory  
containing some libs for the loggen binary which seems to be  
just for testing syslog-ng and doesn't need to be in the rear rescue
system.

Changing said line to

    /usr/lib*/syslog-ng/*so

makes it similar to what rsyslog line looks  
and solves the issue for me.

Cf. the current code at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf\#L182](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L182)

When looking at the LIBS settings in
usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
I wonder why there are (so many) predefined LIBS elements needed at all.

Reasoning (as far as I see it):

In usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
the "Copy libraries" code part that is currently at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh\#L79](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh#L79)  
is

    local all_libs=( "${LIBS[@]}" $( RequiredSharedObjects "${all_binaries[@]}" "${LIBS[@]}" ) )

This copies all libraries in LIBS plus  
all libraries for all binaries (i.e. executable programs)  
and all libraries for all libraries in LIBS  
that are found by the RequiredSharedObjects function.

It does not find recursively libraries for libraries.  
This is intentional because the idea behind is to keep the recovery
system small.  
In the end only libraries that are needed by executable programs  
and libraries that are needed by libraries in LIBS  
are automatically added to the recovery system.

The RequiredSharedObjects function is in  
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh  
currently at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh\#L109](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh#L109)

Because 'ldd' outputs also transitively required libraries  
all required libraries by an executable program and  
all required libraries by a library in LIBS get  
automatically added to the recovery system  
but not more.

This way in particular all executable programs should work inside the
recovery system  
provided they are "normally" linked with the libraries that they need.

If an executable program loads a library via dlopen  
that additional library must be specified in LIBS  
and then all libraries that are "normally" linked with  
that additional library would be also automatically added  
to the recovery system.

Conclusion (as far as I understand it):

Only libraries that are loaded by executable programs via dlopen  
should be needed to be explicitly listed in LIBS  
because all other libraries (i.e. "normally" linked libraries)  
should get automatically included in the recovery sytem  
as described above.

Because of my recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743\#issuecomment-1018280042](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743#issuecomment-1018280042)  
I asked my SUSE colleague:

Could you test what happens when you remove the line  
/usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\*  
from /usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf

When that works could you then also test what happens  
when you add the loggen binary in etc/rear/local.conf via  
REQUIRED\_PROGS+=( loggen )

Here excerpts of what he replied:

> Could you test what happens when you remove the line  
> /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\*  
> from /usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf

Works just fine, libsyslog-ng is still copied over, but no loggen
related libs

> When that works could you then also test what happens  
> when you add the loggen binary in etc/rear/local.conf via  
> REQUIRED\_PROGS+=( loggen )

Ok, here we go:

    sle15sp3-1:/tmp # grep -v ^# /etc/rear/local.conf 
    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( loggen )

    sle15sp3-1:/tmp # chroot rear.FbeTCDwopdJqWU2/rootfs/
    bash-4.4# loggen
    error [loggen.c:enumerate_plugins:167] unable to open plugin directory /usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen (err=No such file or directory)

And what I conclude from his reply is:

    bash-4.4# loggen
    error [loggen.c:enumerate_plugins:167] unable to open plugin directory /usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen (err=No such file or directory)

This proves that loggen works inside the recovery system  
because loggen is able to run (no abort during its startup  
because of missing libraries or other things like that)  
and it is loggen itself that reports the error  
so loggen is running and it "correctly" errors out.

Of course with only `REQUIRED_PROGS+=( loggen )`  
one only get that plain binary in the recovery system  
plus automatically all its "normally" linked libraries.  
But nothing more.

There is no magic in ReaR that would know  
loggen needs additional files to run successfully.

To tell ReaR what additional files loggen needs  
one may use something like  
`COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen )`

Hi @jsmeix , I don't understand the reason for the error then. If all
libraries that are "normally" linked with that additional library are
automatically added to the recovery system, why does the check say that
"/usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen/libloggen\_socket\_plugin.so requires
additional libraries" ? Since `/usr/lib*/syslog-ng/*` is specified in
LIBS, the reasoning above should have applied to it and the required
libraries for `/usr/lib64/syslog-ng/loggen/libloggen_socket_plugin.so`
should have been added automatically.

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for your cutting glance - it helped a lot!

I think I know it:  
What the code in  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
basically does is like (I use /usr/lib\*/qt5/\* as example here):

    # LIBS+=( /usr/lib*/qt5/* )

    # qt5_libs=( "${LIBS[@]}" )

    # for e in "${qt5_libs[@]}" ; do echo $e ; done
    /usr/lib64/qt5/bin
    /usr/lib64/qt5/libexec
    /usr/lib64/qt5/plugins
    /usr/lib64/qt5/qml

    # echo /usr/lib*/qt5/*
    /usr/lib64/qt5/bin /usr/lib64/qt5/libexec /usr/lib64/qt5/plugins /usr/lib64/qt5/qml

    # find /usr/lib64/qt5/ -type f | wc -l
    192

so `/usr/lib*/qt5/*` does not recursively evaluate to all what is below
/usr/lib64/qt5  
but only to what is directly in /usr/lib64/qt5

I think the code in  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
needs to be enhanced for the elements in LIBS  
similar as it currently builds the all\_binaries array  
from the elements in PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
so that the elements in LIBS get fully evaluated to all files.

The programs in the recovery system

    /bin/xmlpatternsvalidator-qt5
    /bin/xmlpatterns-qt5

are there because they are on the original system as

This partially contradicts what I wrote above in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743\#issuecomment-1022133392](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743#issuecomment-1022133392)  
because when build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
shows 'requires additional libraries'  
for all the 104 `*.so` files below /usr/lib64/qt5/  
that exist on my openSUSE Leap 15.3 system  
it means all the 104 `*.so` files below /usr/lib64/qt5/  
were copied into the recovery system  
in build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

What did not happen in 390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
was that other libraries that are required  
by the 104 `*.so` files below /usr/lib64/qt5/  
were also automatically copied into the recovery system.

As far as I see this is because the RequiredSharedObjects function  
is not run for each one of those 104 `*.so` files  
but for to what the bash globbing pattern `/usr/lib*/qt5/*`  
evaluates because the log file contains

    + source /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh
    ...
    ++ all_libs=("${LIBS[@]}" $( RequiredSharedObjects "${all_binaries[@]}" "${LIBS[@]}" ))

Plus my above conclusion therein in different words  
from another point of view ("including programs" point of view):

Needed programs should normally ony specified via

    PROGS+=( non_mandatory_program )
    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( mandatory_program )

But normally there is no need to specify LIBS for them  
because needed libraries for "normally" linked programs  
get automatically included.  
Only libraries that are loaded by executable programs  
via things like dlopen needed to be specified in LIBS.
