-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

This system is being setup for secure use so it was imaged  
configured with the DISA stig for Red hat 8.5 with GUI.  
When I run a the command "sudo rear -v mkrescue" it fails with a error
warning

    BUG in /usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh line 48:
    '\''ReaR recovery system in '\''/mnt/backup/Admin/tmp/rear.ssBwqpOHnTJkjO0/rootfs'\'' is broken: '\''bash -c true'\'' failed'\''

and it also shows this during recovery system test

    /bin/bash: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.6: cannot open shared object file: Operation not permitted

When I checked the rootfs folder under usr/lib libtinfo.so.6 is missing
from the folder.  
I tried including the configuration line LIBS=(libtinfo.so.6) and it
will give a line  
during the verbose run that says libtinfo.so.6 failed to copy.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    tested on VM without controls implemented during imaging  
    and just required grub2 modules to be installed

I was able to resolve this issue by adding
"EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS=(/dev/sdb)" to my local.conf. This was the
secondary drive for the backup itself.

So the local.conf looks like this:

    export TMPDIR="//mnt/backup/Admin/tmp"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=y
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=(/dev/sdb)
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///mnt/backup/Admin/Rescue
    BACKUP_PROG=rsync
    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/backup/Admin/Backup
    FULLBACKUP=THU

Further investigating revealed that these settings didn't fix the issue
but removing and re-installing fapolicyd application fixes it. This app
controls app and file whitelist and is required under the stig

@rtinsley87  
thank you for your feedback what the actual root cause is.  
Such feedback helps us at ReaR upstream a lot because now we know  
there is no hidden bug in ReaR and - at least I - learned about  
yet another security thingy that hinders what even 'root' can do  
besides the well known suspects "AppArmor" and "SELinux"  
(because "rear mkresue" runs as 'root' one assumes it has unlimited
permissions).

You wrote "removing and re-installing fapolicyd":  
According to  
[https://github.com/linux-application-whitelisting/fapolicyd](https://github.com/linux-application-whitelisting/fapolicyd)  
fapolicyd is a "File Access Policy Daemon" so I would assume  
it should be sufficient to only stop this daemon before "rear
mkrescue"  
and re-start it afterwards.  
But this removes fapolicyd protection while "rear mkrescue" is running  
so I think a better solution would be to configure fapolicyd
appropriately  
so that "rear mkrescue" can work.  
But I know nothing about fapolicyd whether or not it can be configured  
this way with reasonable effort.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for following up! My supervisor and I are Windows users mainly
so I didn't think about fapolicyd being a daemon or service in Windows
that I could stop instead. I believe what may have happened is that the
daemon generates a default whitelist when it is initially installed
which is during the OS installation and when I removed and reinstalled
it generated a new default list that included everything currently on
the system or maybe not to that extent. The point is that, the rescue
ISO creation would work after the daemon was reinstalled and active as
well as if I uninstalled it then ran rescue and then re-installed.

I agree that we should configure it correctly if we want to leave it
installed. Thank you for providing the github link for fapolicyd so that
we can understand it better.
