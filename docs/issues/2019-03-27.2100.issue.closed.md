Hello Everyone,

I have taken backup using REAR and stored on the  
NFS server. I am trying to restore that backup while recovering i am
facing issues after run \#rear -d -v recover its showing mount.nfs
mounting xx.xx.xx.70:/media/nfs failed reason given by server no such
file or directory. But on the NFS server /media/nfs directory is
available.

please provide some adequate solution that will be appreciated.

Thanks.

@snxkunwar  
Hello, why do you haven't filled out the support template?  
Which operating system are you using?  
Which version of ReaR are you using?  
Have you activated the following services for the backup? (services
described here are for RHEL/CentOS 6 or an older SUSE operating system)

    chkconfig rpcbind on
    chkconfig rpcidmapd on
    chkconfig nfslock on
    chkconfig netfs on

Hello @dcz01  
Thank you for your reply.

Sir i don't get the term support template can you please explain about
the support template.  
Currently, we are using **Ubuntu 16.04** operating system.  
We are using ReaR version **rear\_2.4-0git**  
We have taken backup and stored on the NFS server successfully. The
above issues are facing while recovering server.

Thanks.

Ok, i'm not a Ubuntu user and i haven't a such system here to test, but
i would say that here is an problem by accessing the nfs server even if
the config file isn't correct to restore or the nfs server is down.  
Have you set an access only to this server or all servers which want to
access the nfs server?  
Maybe the wrong servername or ip adress comes along.

@snxkunwar  
you get our issue template  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
when you click on the "New Issue" button on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)

I use (on openSUSE and SLES) in my etc/rear/local.conf always

    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

for example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf)  
thar reads (excerpt)

    # BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the NFS mount options and
    # with 'mount -o nolock' no rpc.statd (plus rpcbind) are needed:
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
