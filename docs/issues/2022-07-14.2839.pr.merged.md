##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2834 \#2827

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    In the same way as \#2834

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Revert "Use fail-safe 'yes' pipe for "lvm lvcreate"" - PR \#2827 and
    pass `-y` to `lvcreate` to stop asking for input instead.

The `-y` option is much simpler and less error-prone than a 'yes' pipe
(no error termination because of SIGPIPE, for instance). But we lose
support for SLES11, where `lvcreate` does not know the `-y` option.

`yes` remains among `REQUIRED_PROGS`, it can be useful in the rescue
system. (It could be theoretically moved to PROGS, because it is not
required anymore. This could be done separately if really desired, but
for now we prefer to keep it in REQUIRED\_PROGS, sooner or later
something will start requiring it.) See the discussion in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2834](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2834)
.

I am afraid they won't see the error from the `lvm` command itself,
because the output of commands is nowadays hidden, isn't it? I guess
that the diskrestore.sh script may get some special handling...

Exactly because users won't see errors from commands itself  
such LogPrintError messages are crucial to not let it  
appear to the user as if ReaR is failing silently.

When things fail with

    Failed to create LVM volume 'VG/LV' with lvcreate -y ...
    Also failed to create LVM volume 'VG/LV' with lvcreate -y ..."

on the user's terminal where he launched "rear recover"  
it should be sufficiently obvious for the user  
where he could look for the reason  
AND  
it is sufficiently clear for us how to help him  
(provided the user managed to show us his  
terminal output or his "rear recover" log file).

@pcahyna  
I could test how it actually looks when it fails with SLES11.

@jsmeix both your comments are addressed in the last commit. I am going
to merge the PR soon if no further comments.

@jsmeix , thanks for testing how it behaves on SLES11. Merging. By the
way, it is not needed to update the supported system list in release
notes, because support for SLES11 was officially dropped already in 2.7
(as noted in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820\#issuecomment-1153750220](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820#issuecomment-1153750220)
