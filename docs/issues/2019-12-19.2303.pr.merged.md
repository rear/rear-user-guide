-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Currently I had only tested the USB case.  
    I need to test the ISO case.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

For `OUTPUT=ISO` the user can now explicitly specify  
what to boot by default when booting the ISO on BIOS systems via  
`ISO_DEFAULT="boothd0"` to boot from the first disk and  
`ISO_DEFAULT="boothd1"` to boot from the second disk.

For `OUTPUT=USB` the user can now explicitly specify  
what to boot by default when booting the disk on BIOS systems via  
`USB_BIOS_BOOT_DEFAULT="boothd0"` to boot from the first disk.  
The default `USB_BIOS_BOOT_DEFAULT=""` boots the second disk.

Those things are now (hopefully correctly) explained in default.conf

Additionally usr/share/rear/conf/templates/rear.help  
is now plain ASCII according to "Character encoding" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
to avoid that this text may show unexpected when the  
SYSLINUX boot stuff is shown to the user on whatever  
possibly unusual remote console or on whatever special  
system management user interface (I had some personal  
"interesting user experience" with some Java based tingy ;-)

@rear/contributors  
when there are no objections  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

@jsmeix this functionality is useful (cc @chlupnoha who will probably
make use of it), but shouldn't it be an opportunity to unify those
settings? Why to have one option for USB disks, another for CD images,
when both do essentially the same thing? Even why to distinguish BIOS
and UEFI? I propose just `BOOT_DEFAULT` to cover all supported cases
(`ISO_DEFAULT` would remain for compatibility of course.) Similar
comment applies to `ISO_RECOVER_MODE`, which does not seem to be really
ISO specific, but of course this can be left for later.

@pcahyna  
on the one hand I fully agree with you in general  
BUT  
on the other hand because I am not at all an expert in this area  
(the more I do with booting the more I know how little I know)  
I must change the currently working things in careful little steps.  
There are so many subtle interdependencies in ReaR that  
I cannot imagine what may break when I change something.  
My little step by little step way is my attempt to get a bit better  
understanding how things actually work in ReaR while I am doing  
those little steps so that I can a little bit better avoid
regressions.  
If I understood all ReaR code I would...  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286\#issuecomment-558624424](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286#issuecomment-558624424))

Regarding why to distinguish BIOS and UEFI?

My personal answer from my (non booting expert) point of view is:  
We distinguish BIOS and UEFI for ReaR config variables because  
the current ReaR code is completely separated for BIOS and UEFI.

For example I wonder if `BOOT_DEFAULT="boothd1"` would make sense  
for UEFI - is `boothd1` a value that can be actually used also for UEFI?

Perhaps someting more generic like `BOOT_DEFAULT="first_disk"` (or
`disk1`)  
could make sense both for BIOS and UEFI - but I don't know if that is
true.

Is "boot disk enumeration" a really meaningful concept for UEFI?

For example on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system I get

    # efibootmgr -v
    BootCurrent: 0000
    Timeout: 2 seconds
    BootOrder: 0000,0016,0017,0014,001A,0012,0013,0015,0010
    Boot0000* opensuse-secureboot   HD(1,GPT,841a03d5-4e52-4634-b21a-43935c88f5af,0x800,0xfa000)/File(\EFI\opensuse\shim.efi)
    Boot0010  Diskette Drive        BBS(Floppy,Diskette Drive,0x0)..BO
    Boot0012* SAMSUNG SSD SM951 M.2 256G    BBS(HD,P0: SAMSUNG SSD SM951 M.2 256G,0x0)..BO
    Boot0013* USB Storage Device    BBS(USB,USB Storage Device,0x0)..BO
    Boot0014* CD/DVD/CD-RW Drive    BBS(CDROM,P0: PLDS DVD+/-RW DH-16AES    ,0x0)..BO
    Boot0015* Onboard NIC   BBS(Network,IBA GE Slot 00C8 v1550,0x0)..BO
    Boot0016* Onboard NIC(IPV4)     PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x19,0x0)/MAC(64006a64c006,0)/IPv4(0.0.0.0:0<->0.0.0.0:0,0,0)..BO
    Boot0017* Onboard NIC(IPV6)     PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x19,0x0)/MAC(64006a64c006,0)/IPv6([::]:<->[::]:,0,0)..BO
    Boot001A* WDC WD10EZEX-75M2NA0          BBS(HD,P0: WDC WD10EZEX-75M2NA0      ,0x0)..BO

So the `BootNNNN` values have some kind of enumeration  
but that enumeration does not look as if it matches what  
the BIOS boot disk enumeration is.

I think when one has UEFI firmware with legacy BIOS support  
one can specify the boot device ordering for UEFI differently  
and separated from the boot device ordering for legacy BIOS.

Also in my above example the `BootOrder` list is different  
compared to the "natural" ordering of the `BootNNNN` values  
(according to the `NNNN` suffix).

Regarding `ISO_RECOVER_MODE`:

I noticed that special config variable "by accident" while I was  
enhancing the description about `ISO_DEFAULT` in default.conf  
and I was also wondering why `ISO_RECOVER_MODE`  
is specific for `OUTPUT=ISO` and not a generic thingy.

Also here my personal assumtion is that the reason behind is  
that the code for `ISO_RECOVER_MODE` is separated from  
the other cases - or in other words:

A generic functionality to provide predefined ReaR recovery system  
boot menue entries for some "common recovery system boot cases"  
is not yet implemented in ReaR.

What is implemented in ReaR is only a single separated special case  
to boot the recovery system with one predefined kernel command line  
option in case of `OUTPUT=ISO` so the matching config variable  
was correctly named to be ISO specific.

The current generic way for such things is that the user must  
manually add non-standard kernel command line options.  
(By the way: Is that also possible in case of UEFI?)

Finally:

At least some of the above is again the same old consequence  
of how the `OUTPUT=USB` stuff was implemeted in ReaR:

The whole USB stuff is basically some kind of "add-on hack"  
for a special use case that is not well integrated  
with how the rest of ReaR works.

@chlupnoha  
could you explain your ReaR use case so that I could get  
a better understanding what our users do with ReaR?

I had also tested the ISO case and it worked for me.
