@nirmal21s In case You are not allowed or not the admin of the networker
server please use `NSR_CLIENT_MODE=yes` . Otherwise ReaR will fail to
find the proper "save set" on the networker server (but I am not a
networker expert!). Just in case it still does not work it would be
valuable to provide the extract of the log file where the error occurs.

Hello Holger,

Any parameter needs to be changed on Backup server ,with respect to
NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE ?  
Still the "savefs -p -s &lt;NSRSERVER" command is not executing in
470\_safe\_filesystems.sh.  
But when i run this command on client its showing the output.

@nirmal21s: ReaR behaves as per design here: In the NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE
the NSR\_PATH is not gathered and not required. The data recovery for
the to be recovered server has to be initiated on the networker server
side at a later stage of the recovery process. Once the rescue image has
been booted ReaR will prepare the to be recovered server during the
"rear recover" process and a prompt is shown to trigger the data
recovery at a later stage (see
[400\_restore\_with\_nsr.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/17d8cf2778d4d22db12f2d0751c8fb5d82e95308/usr/share/rear/restore/NSR/default/400_restore_with_nsr.sh)).

Thanks Holger!  
I will do the testing and confirm you the status.

Again thanks for your help.
