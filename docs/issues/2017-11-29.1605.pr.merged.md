-   Adapt search for lower interfaces when no 'lower\_\*' symlink exists
    (RHEL6)
-   Replace 'readlink -f' by 'readlink -e'
-   Use 'brctl' when 'ip link' doesn't support 'bridge' type (RHEL6)
-   Use function 'resolve' to wrap 'readlink' when it doesn't support
    more than 1 filename (RHEL6)

@rmetrich  
only FYI:  
Basically the same adaptions are needed for older SLES versions  
so that I thank you very much for this fix that keeps ReaR 2.3  
also working on older SLES versions.  
In particular my simple networking setup still works on SLES11  
with this pull request (but I did not test SLES10).
