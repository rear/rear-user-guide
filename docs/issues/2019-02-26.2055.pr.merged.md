-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not yet tested and not yet complete - some more commits are
    needed...

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

All finalize scripts that patch restored files within TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
should do the same symlink handling which means

1.  Skip patching symlink targets that are not within TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
    (i.e. when it is an absolute symlink)

2.  Skip patching if the symlink target contains /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ or
    /run/

3.  Skip patching dead symlinks

Skip patching symlink targets that are not within TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
does not actually fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1338](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1338)  
but at least it should avoid patching wrong files  
so that for now this pull request before the ReaR 2.5 release  
is meant only as a first step towards actually fixing

For me on SLES12-SP4 with UEFI  
things still work but that does not mean much  
because most of what the finalize scripts can do  
is not needed to be done on my particular system.

I can test this PR on my Arch Linux where I've observed this behavior
for first time
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047\#issuecomment-464846777](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047#issuecomment-464846777)),
but not sooner that tomorrow (27th Feb) afternoon ...

With my above recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055/commits/42b1f0f638732d47b078c31ff0aa4558409f9536](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055/commits/42b1f0f638732d47b078c31ff0aa4558409f9536)  
that etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules stuff  
seems to work o.k. at lest for me for the first time:  
Without

    BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )

I get during finalize stage the restored  
/mnt/local/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  
replaced by the one in the recovery system  
but with

    BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )

I do no longer get a etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  
created in any case in my restored system even when I do not want it  
because that ReaR-created etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  
gets in conflict with what systemd/udev normally should do,  
i.e. creating etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  
so that from my corrent point of view it seems  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770)  
is hereby (hopefully) finally fixed.

To no longer get etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  
created by ReaR in the restored system by default we would  
have to add /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules to  
BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES in default.conf

When I was running test restore of my Arch Linux (with EFISTUB, because
EFISTUB is cool :-)) I've hit something which does not feel right to
me.  
Since I was in migration mode (because why not ...) I was stopped by
[020\_confirm\_finalize.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/020_confirm_finalize.sh),
which prompted me:

    Confirm restored config files or edit them
    1) Confirm it is OK to recreate initrd and reinstall bootloader and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Edit restored etc/fstab (/mnt/local/etc/fstab)
    3) View restored etc/fstab (/mnt/local/etc/fstab)
    4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    5) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)

Now I was tempted to manually update my restored *fstab* because it did
not had right UUIDs ...  
Luckily I've let the file as it was because later
*usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh* took
care of this inconsistency.

What about moving
[020\_confirm\_finalize.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/020_confirm_finalize.sh)
to later stage, ideally very close before `mkinird` ?

@gozora  
thank you so much for your careful observation.

You are absolutely right that 020\_confirm\_finalize.sh is too early.

When I added it via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0bdaf5f2ba13a7cacce14d878f1007d5c06f2075](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0bdaf5f2ba13a7cacce14d878f1007d5c06f2075)  
I had only in mind to get that user dialog in any case  
after the backup was restored (independent of the backup method)  
so that I put that script at the beginning of the finalize stage  
and not at the end of the restore stage (to be independent of the  
particular restore scripts of the particular backup method), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758)  
But at that time I did not have in mind that during finalize  
stage ReaR changes restored files which contradicts  
the whole idea behind 020\_confirm\_finalize.sh which is meant  
to provide final power to the user to adapt restored files as he wants.

So 020\_confirm\_finalize.sh must be after ReaR had changed  
any restored files and I need to adapt the comment in that script  
to better explain what is actually meant...

things look (and work) so much cleaner now  
in migration mode during "rear recover" (excerpts):

    Restoring finished (verify backup restore log messages in /var/lib/rear/restore/recover.backup.tar.gz.726.restore.log)

    Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.

FYI:  
I used a somewhat sophisticated command to launch "rear recover"  
with automated \[Enter\] responses (via plain 'echo') to all user
dialogs, cf.  
"It should be possible to run ReaR unattended" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
plus having the output on the terminal also saved in a file
'rear\_recover.out'  
plus keeping my bash prompt by running all in the background in a
subshell

    # ( exec 0< <( while true ; do echo ; sleep 1 ; done ) ; rear -D recover | tee -a rear_recover.out ) &

because that 'while' loop (and the 'tee') run endlessly so that I won't
be able  
to just type `reboot` after 'rear recover' finished if it was not run in
the background  
(before the reboot I used `scp` to get 'rear\_recover.out' out of the
recovery system).

At least my browser shows here below

    Done. Your build exited with 0.

so that I think actually all is o.k. and I can merge it now...
