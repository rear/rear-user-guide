Since we're using en\_US.UTF-8 at the end of the day, better check
existence of en\_US.UTF-8 rather then creating a single purpose locales,
with the risk also of having failing backups if the locales cannot be
created. Since trending is to make `glibc-locale-source` optional,
better avoid the risk of failure in localedef and to create a barely
used locales.

@andreamtp  
First of all, I must ask, did you FULLY tested this PR (backup +
restore) ?  
This might been changed lately, but as far as I remember during writing
of this patch, ReaR recovery system did not included UTF-8 locales but
rather worked with *LC\_ALL=C* which caused Borg recovery to fail ...

@gozora this PR do not change the behaviour of ReaR with Borg
integration.  
It just avoid the creation of a custom locale for rear, named
[rear.UTF-8](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1469/files#diff-0b9aaf6ae8998ad24e51201f790ac65fL19)
and instead check the existence of
[en\_US.UTF-8](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1469/files#diff-0b9aaf6ae8998ad24e51201f790ac65fR19)
, that is the source for the old rear.UTF-8 , to use it [during
restore](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1469/files#diff-c5c91a44cbda65f3da5b3288fcc87512R17).

The essence of the integration is preserved, it just avoid the creation
of rear.UTF-8 that can fail on modern distros since the source files of
locales are not always shipped by default and the error message that the
user get is not very clear.

I've tested the backup part without any problem, and do not expect any
trouble with the restore as well, since the LC\_ALL used is the same,
despite the name change.

Hello @andreamtp,  
I'm afraid it does break the integration.  
The problem is that ReaR recovery system does not have UTF-8 support by
default (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1035](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1035))
and in order to restore from Borg backup you need to have UTF-8 support,
so that `localedef` is used just for this purpose.  
A way how to solve this problem according your proposal, would be to
check if UTF-8 locales exists on original system and if they does, find
their location and copy them to ReaR recovery system.  
I was thinking of this approach when I was writing Borg backup
implementation but using `localedef` looked to me more straight forward
compared to searching for locales in every available Linux distro you
can imagine ...

As there was no reply since some time and I personally think this PR
would break Borg integration, I'm closing it.

Hi,  
Since I'm expecting an error related to this issue, I would like to ask
if you plan to solve it.  
To be more explicit, I'm getting the following message when trying to

Hi,  
Fedora 25, 26 and 27. Tried it on 25 and 27.

hmm, i'd say that testing on Centos was done when Borg support was
written. Maybe I just missed something. Anyhow I'll run couple of tests
on Fedora and Centos next days (but not sooner then 26th of Dec ;-) ),
and let you konw ...

Hello @GaLaKtIkUs

I just tested ReaR with Borg backend on my Fedora 26, and all seems to
work correctly.

Can you please send me output of following commands:

    # locale -a

    # locale

    # rpm -qa | grep glibc

    # localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US /tmp/mylocale && ls -al /tmp/mylocale

Thanks

V.

Hi,  
I was about to write about how I solved the problem for Fedora 27.  
First of all, I used the patch from this pull request.  
I also used a standalone binary of Borg (generated using pyinstaller)
and included in the rescue disk using COPY\_AS\_IS\_BORG.

I'll continue extensive testing on other versions of fedora and CentOS.

Thank you )

Hello @GaLaKtIkUs,

Be careful, I actually never tested this patch, but I suspect that if
you use it, you will end up with ReaR rescue system that will NOT be
able to restore from Borg repository! To cut things short you will be
able to backup but restore will fail.

ReaR by default does not have UTF-8 locales included.

The `localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US /tmp/mylocale && ls -al /tmp/mylocale`
gave errors as described in earlier posts. That's why I used the patch.

I successfully restored a system (a virtual machine). I made a backup,
deleted the HDD and created a new empty one, than restored the whole VM

I boots successfully.  
I will now a more complex case and report the results back here.

Good, looking forward for that ;-).  
I maybe know why you are having this problem. Could you try to install
**glibc-locale-source** ?  
That should solve this problem without further hacks needed.
