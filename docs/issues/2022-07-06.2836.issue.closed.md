Hello,

Sometimes when the backup completes I have observed the following
entries in the log

    WARNING: tar ended with return code 1 and below output:
      ---snip---
      tar: 16292: Warning: Cannot flistxattr: Operation not supported
      tar: 10: Warning: Cannot flistxattr: Operation not supported
      tar: 14: Warning: Cannot flistxattr: Operation not supported
      ----------
    This means that files have been modified during the archiving
    process. As a result the backup may not be completely consistent
    or may not be a perfect copy of the system. Relax-and-Recover
    will continue, however it is highly advisable to verify the
    backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system.

I've written a "wrapper" script to call Rear, because I wanted to be
notified when this occurred.

An extract of the script logic is below

    rear -C basic_system mkbackup

    # Check return value
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       Update_EventLog "*** Backup completed with error ***"
    else
       Update_EventLog "Backup completed successfully"
    fi

I have two questions

1.  When the above Rear warning occurred. The return code from rear to:
    $? was still 0  
    I would have expected a warning to result in a non-zero return code?

2.  The warning text mentions .."however it is highly advisable to
    verify the  
    backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system".

I've had a look at the user guide and I don't see any mention of verify
options.

Are there verify options that are not described in the user guide?

Thanks

Vaughan

@ZENAdmin-Ops

in general cf. what I wrote at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2835\#issuecomment-1175001352](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2835#issuecomment-1175001352)  
(relevant excerpt):

    In general ReaR does not include things to manage ReaR
    or things to manage backups and so on, cf. the section
    "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in
    https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery

where that  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" section reads  
(only some excerpts - better read the whole section)

    Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) complements backup
    and restore of files but ReaR is
    neither a backup software
    nor a backup management software
    and it is not meant to be one.

    In general backup and restore of the files
    is external functionality for ReaR.

    ...

    It is your task to verify your backup
    is sufficiently complete to restore
    your system as you need it.

    It is your task to verify your backup
    can be read completely to restore all your files.

In particular regarding

    tar: ... Warning: Cannot flistxattr: Operation not supported

see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770)  
therein in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770\#issuecomment-1072659786](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770#issuecomment-1072659786)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770\#issuecomment-1073744082](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770#issuecomment-1073744082)  
and the subsequent comments from there  
in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770\#issuecomment-1073809204](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770#issuecomment-1073809204)  
(excerpt)

    I think
    "tar: ...: Warning: Cannot flistxattr: Operation not supported"
    is normally harmless and
    it also cannot be avoided because
    we need to call 'tar' with "--xattrs"
    to have extended attributes support
    but then files where extended attributes
    are not supported (e.g. files on filesystems
    that do not support extended attributes)
    will cause such 'tar' warnings
    and - as far as I see - there is no
    matching --warning=no-... option
    to suppress that in general.

In general warnings are just warnings and no errors  
so in general it would be wrong to abort ReaR  
with non zero exit code because of a warning,  
see the rather sophisticated exit code handling  
when the backup program is 'tar' in  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

In general regarding "Warning" messages see also
