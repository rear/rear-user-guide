-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When 2 disks have same size, the `rear recover` command forces the user
into migration mode and displays the following messages:

    Ambiguous disk layout needs manual configuration (more than one disk with same size used in '/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf')
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration
    Using /dev/sda (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/sda
    Using /dev/sdb (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/sdb
    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/sda => /dev/sda
      /dev/sdb => /dev/sdb

    UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 275
    Confirm or edit the disk mapping
    1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration
    3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    5) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)

When the disks are well-known (through their Disk ID for example), then
migration mode should be avoided (we know the exact mapping since it was
saved into `/var/lib/rear/recovery/diskbyid_mappings`)

This is linked to \#1857

@rmetrich  
this is a known (and currently intended) minor annoyance  
to be 100% on the safe side aggainst possibly reinstalling  
on a wrong disk, cf. the description about MIGRATION\_MODE  
in default.conf.

I look forward to a pull request from you that reliably  
autodetects when the disks are really well-known  
so that we can avoid that current annoyance  
without any risk to reinstall on a wrong disk.

Thank you very much in advance!  
Take your time (I set its milestone to "ReaR future").
