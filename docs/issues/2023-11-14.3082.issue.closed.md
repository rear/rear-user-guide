-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When REAR will check if bacula is available it will run:

"/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/500\_check\_BACULA\_bconsole\_results.sh"

This script will do a :

grep -i address /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf | awk '{ print $3 }'

In my environment/case i've got an entry in "/etc/bacula/bconsole.conf"

![image](https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/32612067/b702b198-2470-4bca-96e1-3c92893f433e)

The obove mentioned script's output is:

grep -i address /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf | awk '{ print $3 }':

![image](https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/32612067/c26fb6fd-7f18-4cba-91ae-f647bcb952e1)

And that it is - the bacula check will fail - but indeed all is running
(bacula) properly.

So the script command line should check in a more specifc way, like :

grep '^\[\[:space:\]\]*address\[\[:space:\]\]*='
/etc/bacula/bconsole.conf

-   Workaround, if any:  
    remove the comment-"address"-entries in the
    /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf

... same is valid for command:

grep $(hostname -s) /etc/bacula/bacula-fd.conf | grep "-fd" | awk
'{print $3}' | sed -e "s/-fd//g"

It seems REAR will not handle config files properly, when some line are
commented with similar content.

@gdha  
could you please have a look here (as time permits)?

@Githopp192  
could you show us your whole  
/etc/bacula/bconsole.conf  
and  
/etc/bacula/bacula-fd.conf  
files?

Thanks Johannes .. cannot input the whole backup config - to
confidential.

But the context is easy to follow - as long as - in this example
"client-fd" is there more than once (one uncommented);  
the script will have two results (2x client) the script will return an
error an REAR will exit

same is true for your check for "bconsole.conf":

Affected script:
/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/500\_check\_BACULA\_bconsole\_results.sh",

@Githopp192  
thank you for your information.

I am not a user of Bacula  
(or any other third-party backup tool)  
so I need sufficient input to understand  
how things look with Bacula.

@Githopp192  
thanks for your explicit feedback that  
ReaR works when it comes to the crunch.

We don't get many reports when it works  
but mostly when something doesn't work  
(which is expected).

@Githopp192 seems you modified the bacula code to work again? Why not
provide a pull request so others may benefit from your enhancements?

@gdha (did not change the code ... as workaround only removed the
entries with comments ==&gt; \#xxxxxxxx)

i'm glad you mentioned that, because today - this got into my mind, too
.... may be it sounds stupid enough, i should/i could .. but i'm not
experienced with this .. but - yes this is not an excuse :-) - i will
give it a try. Thx 4 your input. I do appreciate
