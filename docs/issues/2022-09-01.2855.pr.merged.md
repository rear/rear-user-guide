This PR adds explicit [permissions
section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions)
to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default
workflows run with [extended set of
permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)
(except from `on: pull_request` [from external
forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)).
By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By
using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow
can do (because of an
[injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/)
or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.  
It is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top
level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions)
and grant write permissions on [job
level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)
case by case.

@rear/contributors @pcahyna  
if there are no objections  
I intend to blindly merge it tomorrorw afternoon  
(bindly because I know basically nothing about GitHub workflows).

@sashashura  
thank you for your valuable contribution to ReaR  
thak makes our GitHub upstream repository more secure!

Sigh!  
I do not understand why the GitHub workflow  
default permissions are not sufficiently secure.  
Why must each and every GitHub user manually adjust the  
workflow permissions to make things reasonably secure?

I guess because granular permissions were not introduced from the very
beginning and then they didn't want to break things. I also recommend
changing this -

@gdha @rear/contributors  
I changed now in  
[https://github.com/organizations/rear/settings/actions](https://github.com/organizations/rear/settings/actions)  
the section "Workflow permissions"  
so that it looks now as in the  
"Preventing GitHub Actions from creating or approving pull requests"  
section in the GitHub documentation  
[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository\#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)

I.e. now the ReaR "Workflow permissions" are  
no longer `Read and write permissions`  
instead only `Read repository contents permission`  
and no longer `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`

Please speak up if this changes cause regressions  
for this or that existing GitHub Actions in ReaR  
so we can evaluate if we could adapt the specific Action  
or if we really must have so permissive defaults in ReaR.

@sashashura  
thank you for your additional info.  
It is much appreciated.

Too permissive defaults are a security nightmare  
because one cannot notice it (because things "just work")  
unless it is too late (after a repository was compromised)  
or by luck when a mindful person kindly informs one.

In contrast too restrictive permission defaults are OK  
because one notices it when things do not "just work"  
and then one can think about if more premissive settings  
are really needed or if somewhat reduced functionality  
that works with reasonably restricted permissions is sufficient.

By the way - cf. "Security: Make Things Not Just Work" in
