Issue an error message and exit if USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM is invalid,
instead of setting it to "ext3". It's safer to fail due to configuation
errors than to ignore/fix them silently.

@casantos  
thank you for your contribution  
to make ReaR behave more in compliance with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I think it is not a bug because conf/default.conf reads

    # Only ext3 and ext4 are supported by the format workflow.

@rear/contributors  
please have a look here (as time permits),  
perhaps I may have overlooked something.

I would like to merge it on Thursday afternoon  
unless there are objections.

Yes, I fully agree with you,  
cf. your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1644125846](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1644125846)  
and my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1645441763](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1645441763)  
that reads (excerpt)

    What is still questionable is if ReaR should
    try to silently "correct" a user specified value
    like "only blank characters" == "no characters",
    ...
    or
    if ReaR should not try to "correct" user specified values?

The more I am thinking about it the more I think that  
ReaR should not try to "correct" user specified values  
but error out when a user specified value is wrong.
