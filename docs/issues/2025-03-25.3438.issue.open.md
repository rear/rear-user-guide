[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436)  
revealed that current simulation mode implementation  
has become somewhat messy over time  
so it needs to be overhauled.  
This is a bigger task for the future as time permits.

We discovered one problem here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436\#issuecomment-2751858143](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436#issuecomment-2751858143)

Another possible improvement would be to source the `init` scripts even
in simulation mode, but that would make them a bit irregular.

I think the real problem is:  
When we call that stuff "simulation mode"  
we should avoid as much as possible to execute code  
which is not actually needed for the simulation.

In particular we must not execute code  
that could (potentially) change the system,  
i.e. we must not execute code from the user  
but only code that we know inside ReaR.

But for a simulation we need to execute some code  
(e.g. the WORKFLOW\_... functions definitions).

So the real problem is to carefully and thoroughly  
determine what code is actually needed for the simulation.

I think this is a bigger task because it requires  
to carefully and thoroughly inspect all code  
that is currently executed in simulation mode  
whether or not it is actually needed.

For example whether or not it is actually needed  
to execute user config files when for the simulation  
only a few user config variable values are needed  
like BACKUP and OUTPUT which we may only read  
from the config files without executing them?

Also it is questionable if we really need to execute  
the workflow scripts usr/share/rear/lib/\[a-z\]\*-workflow.sh  
(see my exceptional code therein for simulation mode)  
when all we need is to know the names of the stages  
that a particular workflow runs which we may only read  
from the workflow scripts without executing them?

Is it feasible to run simulation mode as a non-root user in order to use
the OS-level protections against changing the system? Then if we happen
to execute something that should not be executed in simulation mode, we
will at worst see some "Permission denied" in the log.

I think sbin/rear needs at least to start up as root user  
to have permissions to read /etc/rear/ config files  
and things like that.

But to run a workflow in simulation mode  
it may work to switch to a non-root user?

Provided that non-root user is in TRUSTED\_OWNERS  
because otherwise the 'source' wrapper forbids it  
which leads to another question if it is really needed  
to 'source' scripts in simulation mode when all what  
the simulation mode actually does is to print the script name?

I start to like my 'source' wrapper more and more  
because it "by the way" even helps us  
to see where we may carelessly execute things  
which are not actually needed to be executed.

Correction:

In simulation mode we do not 'source' workflow scripts  
because in simulation mode the 'Source' function  
only prints the script name.

So to run a workflow in simulation mode  
it does not help to switch to a non-root user  
because no workflow script gets executed.

I would say this is too complicated and if users want to run `rear` as
non-root, they are responsible for ensuring that the configuration files
are readable, for which there are many ways (adding ACLs to the files,
making them group-readable and adding the user to the `root` group, or
even making them world-readable if they don't contain secrets). We
should just not prevent it, which we currently do:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/1128f1b616b370e49ac7be7f0ae0fa5ab04bc638/usr/sbin/rear\#L378](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/1128f1b616b370e49ac7be7f0ae0fa5ab04bc638/usr/sbin/rear#L378)

non-root user would basically be an additional safeguard.

@pcahyna FYI:  
This week and perhaps also next week  
(currently I cannot tell how long it takes)  
I can no longer work on ReaR because  
I have to fix several security bugs in other software...

@jsmeix sure, no problem and thanks for the info,  
simulation mode would not be my priority anyway (I am not using it), but
perhaps I will try to remove this check for root user and see how far
one can get with it.
