automatically load fuse kernel module also for sshfs  
in the same way as it is already done for ftpfs  
cf. issue845

@gdha  
please have a look if it looks o.k. for you.

For the reason behind see the  
"FUSE sshfs Problem while recovering a Centos7 System"  
mail thread in July 2016 on the rear-users mailing lis  
in particular see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-July/003376.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-July/003376.html)  
(excerpts):

<pre>
< BACKUP_URL=sshfs://sambasave@10.2.3.4/home/sambasave/Backup
> MODULES_LOAD=( vmxnet vmxnet3 e1000e e1000 fuse hpsa )
...
> When I ty to recover I get a message like :
> "can't load FUSEFS please load the fuse module"
...
In particular regarding loading the fuse kernel module
automatically (regardless of MODULES_LOAD) when 
BACKUP_URL=sshfs://...
I assume the mount_url() function in
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh
needs to be enhanced for sshfs in the same way
as I implemented it for the ftpfs case, cf.
https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845
and
https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859
</pre>

@jsmeix I prefer to make a generic solution instead of a protocol by
protocol fix, by fixing it in
`./skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh`
and load always at the end `/etc/modules`

@jsmeix I think you can close the pull request as I made a generic fix?

@gdha  
the generic fix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ec871676b7cdc52461574200c8a54867d0cfb37](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ec871676b7cdc52461574200c8a54867d0cfb37)  
does not work for me, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ec871676b7cdc52461574200c8a54867d0cfb37\#commitcomment-18192197](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ec871676b7cdc52461574200c8a54867d0cfb37#commitcomment-18192197)

Regardless that the generic fix does not yet work for me  
I agree that a generic fix is the right way to solve it.

Nevertheless as a temporary band-aid I merge my  
current pull request until the generic fix actually works.

When the generic fix actually works I will remove only  
the "modprobe fuse" lines but I like to keep the other tests  
because I prefer to error out in case of errors than to blindly  
proceed cf.

I found out that in practice one cannot omit  
the additional "modprobe fuse" for sshfs and ftpfs  
for the mount\_url() function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh  
because without it:

<pre>
# grep -v ^# etc/rear/local.conf 
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=ftpfs://johannes@10.160.4.244/rear
...
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f121.log
ERROR: Mount command 'curlftpfs --verbose -o user='johannes' ftp://10.160.4.244/rear /tmp/rear.aFr3j7dXQcBGKFg/outputfs' failed.
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f121.log for details
Terminated
</pre>

I.e. the generic fix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/909](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/909)  
only loads the 'fuse' kernel module during "rear recover"  
but to make "rear mkbackup" just working one still needs  
the additional "modprobe fuse" for sshfs and ftpfs  
for the mount\_url() function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh

Because the additional "modprobe fuse" don't hurt  
I keep it as it is now.
