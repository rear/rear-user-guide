Current ReaR does not support IBM Z architecture  
regardless that some Z architecture specific things  
like IBM S390 DASD drive `dasd` appear in some scripts  
but that is only a very first (incomplete) step, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/783](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/783)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f719fee860f656859ec12838b0c5b36d32532d6a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f719fee860f656859ec12838b0c5b36d32532d6a)

In general see

    Supported Architectures
    ...
    ReaR-2.4 does not support:
     * s390x type of processors

What is different on IBM Z `s390x` architecture compared to `x86`  
is basically everything that is crucial for ReaR:

-   storage
-   bootloader
-   how to make and boot the ReaR recovery system
-   and likely many little other things (system console, network
    devices, udev rules, ...)

@schabrolles  
I also assigned you here because you are from IBM  
so you may perhaps know someone else from IBM  
who can actually help here.

Don't worry, I also don't know how IBM Z is working, cf.

For comparison what ReaR scripts are not run during "rear mkbackup"  
on `s390x` compared to `x86` with the on `x86` usually used  
`OUTPUT=ISO` in /etc/rear/local.conf  
(the `diff` of `usr/sbin/rear -s mkbackup` on `s390x` compared to
`x86`):

    +Source conf/Linux-i386.conf
    +Source prep/ISO/Linux-i386/330_find_isolinux.sh
    +Source output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh

    +Source output/ISO/Linux-i386/850_check_for_errors.sh

i.e. those scripts are run on `x86` but not on `s390x`  
but I guess `OUTPUT=ISO` is useless anyway on `s390x`.

I got a ready-to-use `s390x` system where I can login via `ssh`.

On that system I use our latest GitHub ReaR master code as follows:  
I "git clone" our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
into a separated directory and then configure and run ReaR  
from within that directory like:

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear.github.master

    # cd rear.github.master

    # vi etc/rear/local.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup

(note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/")

To make "rear mkbackup" running there to its end without an error  
(but that does not at all mean what it did can be used for "rear
recover")  
I needed some adaptions on `s390x`, see the three 'diff' output below.

On my `s390x` system there is SLES 12 SP4  
with its default btrfs structure installed.

I have

Hello,  
We (Red Hat) were supporting S390x with rear-1.17.2 but apparently the
code changed with rear-2.0 and support has been dropped.  
I would suggest @pcahyna talks about opportunity to support recent rear
to his management.

Does suse use grub on s390 for the bootloader instead of zIPL?

Interesting... I opened a zlinux instance running suse 12

the mbr of the dasd boot device refs zIPL

    dd if=/dev/dasda bs=4096 count=4|strings

yet the boot dir lists grub2 and zIPL. rhel on the other hand has no
references to grub and the guess\_bootloader fails. This has been the
area I was working on

I learned right now how booting IBM Z works in general on SLES12 and
SLES15  
(the following describes it as far as I understand but there could be
errors  
because I am not an IBM Z expert):

The idea behind is to get during booting as soon as possible  
to a common state where things behave same for the user  
on all architectures where SLES is supported.

That common state is GRUB2.  
The user should see GRUB2 on all architectures where SLES is
supported.  
I think this is in particular useful to boot a snapper btrfs snapshot
via  
one same user interface (i.e. the GRUB2 boot menue).

But GRUB2 has no support to access files on the disk on IBM Z.  
There was an attempt to add that support into GRUB2  
but that became too big and too complicated and  
a nightmare to maintain it for all future times.

On the other hand the kernel has "ready-to-use" support  
to access files on the disk on IBM Z and it turned out  
that it is relatively easy to run GRUB2 like a normal  
user process by the kernel.

So on SLES12 and SLES15 booting IBM Z basically works this way:

Initially zipl loads a kernel and  
that kernel runs GRUB2 and  
GRUB2 loads the actual kernel and does a kexec.

To re-install that during "rear recover" all what is basically needed  
is to call `grub2-install` because that is appropriately enhanced  
to do "the right thing" on IBM Z (i.e. it also does the zipl setup  
for the initial zipl kernel load).

This could mean that in the end during "rear recover"  
on SLES12/15 basically the same as in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
needs to be done on IBM Z.

What is a different and completely separated thing is  
how the ReaR recovery system is booted on IBM Z.

On x86 architecture the ReaR recovery system is usually  
a bootable ISO image where the SYSLINUX/ISOLINUX bootloader  
is used.

I think for booting the ReaR recovery system on IBM Z  
the simplest way that works should be sufficient because  
I think on IBM Z the system is not booted accidentally  
by an unexperienced normal user so that I think  
there is no need for a sophisticated boot menue  
when booting the ReaR recovery system on IBM Z.

Accordingly I think plain direct kernel and initrd loading via zipl  
should be sufficient for booting the ReaR recovery system on IBM Z  
(at least this should be initially sufficient for ReaR support on IBM
Z).

It looks like suse differs from rhel and ubuntu.  
[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/linuxonibm/com.ibm.linux.z.lkdd/lkdd\_c\_ipl\_vs\_boot.html](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/linuxonibm/com.ibm.linux.z.lkdd/lkdd_c_ipl_vs_boot.html)

The aux kernel image with grub allows rear to complete the boot
verification process in suse. On rhel and ubuntu, it will fail with an
unknown boot loader. The push req I submitted gets rhel past the boot
verification process on rhel 7.2

@rmetrich @pcahyna  
regardless of what Red Hat management may later decide  
could you have a look here, in particular also have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142)

Perhaps by plain looking at the code changes you may already see  
things that are not right or where @mutable-dan could need help  
to avoid that he does much coding work mostly on his own but later  
we may tell him about a lot of things that he should have done
differently.

Many thanks in advance for your help!

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142)
merged we have now in ReaR  
initial preliminary first basic support for IBM Z architecture "s390x"  
so that interested users can try out how far things work for them, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2e3ff0fbacaf15055ebf4fcfab75f29ee58fe838](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2e3ff0fbacaf15055ebf4fcfab75f29ee58fe838)

@rmetrich @pcahyna @tcerna  
could you test (or do you know one at Red Hat who could test)  
how far our current preliminary first basic support for IBM Z  
actually works in your particular IBM Z environments at Red Hat  
and provide feedback - preferably plus needed fixes, adaptions,  
and enhancements?
