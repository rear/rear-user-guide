@lzaoral  
in your

you wrote

    the final '|| return 1' is necessary because
    bash returns 127 on unbound variables

Why does it matter what non-zero return code  
the get\_var\_from\_file() function returns?

Or in other words:  
Why not have the get\_var\_from\_file() implementation  
simpler by omitting the final '|| return 1' like

    function get_var_from_file() {
        bash -c 'unset $1 || exit 1 ; source "$0" >/dev/null ; set -u ; echo "${!1}"' "$1" "$2"
    }

?

@jsmeix I suppose it does not. I just did that to be consistent with
surrounding functions which return either `0` or `1`. It should be safe
to drop this part.

@schlomo I really hope we are not going to implement a parser for shell
assignments when this parser already exists - in the shell itself, just
because of vague security justifications. The `os-release` file is
documented to be readable this way (see the manual page), as are
`/etc/sysconfig` files - guess how they are read by `ifup`/`ifdown` (See
`source_config()` in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions`)
? What attack vectors are you speaking about when the files that we
intend to source this way are already sourced at every boot?

For such shell files I agree with your logic, but the function claims to
be more generic than shell config files.

For shell config files one can source them and echo, even in a subshell.
But then I'd call the function differently, e.g.
`get_shell_file_config_variable` or such.

@schlomo

> For such shell files I agree with your logic

That's the intent of the function, as documented in the comment:

    # The get_var_from_file function is meant to be used with files
    # like /etc/os-release or certain files in /etc/sysconfig or /etc/default
    # that basically only do shell-compatible variable assignments (VAR="value")

> but the function claims to be more generic than shell config files.

> But then I'd call the function differently, e.g.
> get\_shell\_file\_config\_variable or such.

If you feel that the function name promises more than the function is
able to do, I agree with renaming it.

I prefer names that tell what a function actually is about.  
`get_var_from_file` is too unspecific.

Regarding `get_shell_file_config_variable`:  
I wonder why it is limited to *config* variables?  
I.e. why not only `get_shell_file_variable`  
because it can get the value of any variable  
that is set in a shell syntax file?  
Or is `get_shell_file_variable` confusing  
because one does not know if it is about  
a 'shell file' or a 'file variable'  
so `get_shell_file_config_variable`  
is perhaps really what tells best what it is about?

@jsmeix may I suggest an alternative implementation that doesn't call
the `bash` binary and provides a little bit more error reporting
compared to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203\#issuecomment-2045058844](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203#issuecomment-2045058844)?

This implementation also uses [Bash Restricted
mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html)
to add a little bit of security protection.

The error message also makes it clear that the config file was executed
by Bash, hopefully this helps understanding errors better

About the name: Yes, I believe that the limit to shell config files is
important because it doesn't read other key-value config files that use
`:` as separator or that allow whitespace around the `=`

and leave it to you and @pcahyna and @lzaoral  
how to get the value of a variable out of a file

@jsmeix why? I think that you identified a relevant problem that we have
again and again. Please don't be offended by the fact that somebody
might have a different perspective.

You proposed a solution, got feedback and a even suggestion for a
different solution. We even already aligned on a suitable name.

Besides that you gave us the opportunity for an interesting technical
challenge (secure parsing of shell configs) which is always a good
thing.

I think my context is simply slightly different (and I see it as an
asset for ReaR that we all are so different), for example I already
implemented a `set_variable_from_commvault_status` function:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/09579ae652cf3475a94c1ab79030dfee64cff51c/usr/share/rear/prep/GALAXY11/default/400\_prep\_galaxy.sh\#L5-L23](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/09579ae652cf3475a94c1ab79030dfee64cff51c/usr/share/rear/prep/GALAXY11/default/400_prep_galaxy.sh#L5-L23)

Maybe you just collect all the feedback and proceed with that? I at
least greatly appreciate the love to the details that you bring to ReaR!

@schlomo  
at least for now I would like in this particular case  
to relax from this particular Relax-and-Recover issue.  
I spent already way too many hours on this issue  
which seems to have basically unlimited depth  
so at least for now I feel a bit "fed up" with it.  
Let's wait and see how things look to me  
after the weekend (but no promises).

Since

which I solved right now:

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203/commits/f79454fe2101b50180ba5abf79e68d581a7cf317](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203/commits/f79454fe2101b50180ba5abf79e68d581a7cf317)  
I renamed the function again,  
now from get\_shell\_file\_config\_variable  
into source\_variable\_from\_file  
to make it explicit that the file is sourced  
and  
to make the name less generic (no longer generic 'get')  
so we can - as needed - implement alternative functions  
how to get a variable value out of a file  
with different methods.

Some "forensics" why we use 'source' at all:

Using 'source' was introduced via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165/files)  
therein see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165\#pullrequestreview-1903010946](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165#pullrequestreview-1903010946)  
which shows the following outdated code diff

    28  -  local version_id=$(grep "^VERSION_ID=" /etc/os-release | cut -d\" -f2 ) # 7

    28  +
    29  +  local version_id
    30  +  version_id="$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_ID")"

where 'grep' was replaced by '.'  
There I only liked to have '.' replaced by explicit 'source'  
but I did not question why 'grep' was replaced by 'source'.

Because 'source' fails for readonly variables, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165\#discussion\_r1505473662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165#discussion_r1505473662)  
@lzaoral "reworked the parsing completely", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165\#discussion\_r1504116328](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165#discussion_r1504116328)  
so that 'source' was no longer used and currently  
we use 'grep' again but now together with 'eval', see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165/files)

Then during  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171)  
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#pullrequestreview-1931528461](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#pullrequestreview-1931528461)  
@pcahyna proposed again to use 'source'  
(now with a separated "bash in between")  
because

    I think this is simpler and more robust than using eval and grep
    (think of possible multi-line strings, for example).

see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171\#issuecomment-2015082283](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171#issuecomment-2015082283)

    ... the "bash in between"
    which was up to now more a workaround for source
    that has a problem with readonly variables

(End of "forensics" why we use 'source'.)

From there we further developed  
how to get a variable value out of a file  
with the 'source' method.

For me the generic advantage of the 'source' method is  
that we let 'bash' interpret and execute the file  
so we get the value that 'bash' actually sets  
(think of possible 'if' conditions, for example).

Of course the generic disadvantage of the 'source' method is  
that we let 'bash' interpret and execute the file  
so we execute a (shell-syntax) file only  
to get a variable value out of a file.

I think when we restrict the sourcing shell  
or when we let it abort at any errors, then  
the generic advantage of the 'source' method  
does no longer hold, see my experiments in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171)

I think we either use 'source' as it normally works  
and then the sourced file must be trusted  
or we better use another method  
when the sourced file cannot be trusted.

But even then we would need additional security things  
to avoid unintended bash interpretation/execution  
of the variable value when it is e.g. something like

    $( COMMAND )

or whatever kind of bash code that could trigger  
interpretation/execution when used later in bash.

This all looks rather hopeless to get it secure.  
Perhaps it actually is hopeless to securely  
process unknown files or use data from unknown files?

An offhanded generic idea how to avoid problems  
with  
"safely processing/interpreting untrustworthy files"  
or with  
"safely using data from untrustworthy files"  
or generically with  
"safely using untrustworthy files":

My idea is to "simply" not use untrustworthy files.  
(wow - what a great ingenious new idea ;-)

Actually my idea is that a file is untrustworthy  
for a particular user account,  
if other users could have modified that file.

Or in other words:  
Only those files are trustworthy for a particular user account,  
where only that particular user could have written the file.

For ReaR this means:  
Only those files are trustworthy to be used by ReaR  
where only 'root' could have written the file.

To check if only 'root' could have written a file  
the only possible way in practice is  
to check the current file owner, group, and permissions.

So I suggest another new helper function:

    function is_trustworthy_for_root () {
        local resolved_file
        resolved_file="$( readlink -e "$1" )" || return 1
        # Owner name and group name must be 'root root':
        test "$( stat -c '%U %G' $resolved_file )" = "root root" || return 1
        # Neither group nor others must have write permission
        # so the human readable permission string must be '-'
        # for group and others for example like "-rwxr-xr-x"
        [[ "$( stat -c '%A' $resolved_file )" == ?????-??-? ]]
    }

This helper function can then be called where needed  
e.g. in source\_variable\_from\_file() like

        is_trustworthy_for_root "$1" || return 1
        bash -c ...

My curent `is_trustworthy_for_root` implementation  
is likely on the one hand too sceptical because  
e.g. on my openSUSE Leap 15.5 system:

    # stat -c '%U %G %A' /etc/chrony.keys 
    root chrony -rw-r-----

    # ( set -x ; is_trustworthy_for_root /etc/chrony.keys && echo Y || echo N )
    + is_trustworthy_for_root /etc/chrony.keys
    + local resolved_file
    ++ readlink -e /etc/chrony.keys
    + resolved_file=/etc/chrony.keys
    ++ stat -c '%U %G' /etc/chrony.keys
    + test 'root chrony' = 'root root'
    + return 1
    + echo N
    N

but on the other hand it is likely too careless  
because it considers only traditional  
owner, group, and permissions  
but not newer things like ACLs.

@jsmeix I like your idea to reduce to attack surface by checking for
trustworthy files (and you could use `stat --format "%A %u %g"` to check
for all requirements in one comparison, if you like).

I'm wondering if we really need that as we actually don't have that
check in the `Source()` function of ReaR and don't care about the
ownership of the ReaR files themselves.

So maybe your initial thought was correct and we don't need to care so
much about that?

@jsmeix I was thinking about further along the lines of "preventing
command execution" and came up with this approach: Setting the `PATH` in
the restricted shell to something without binaries in it effectively
prevents running anything.

Here is the amended version of my suggestion embedded in a shell script
to test the behavior:

    function Error() {
        echo -e "ERROR: $*"
        exit 1
    }

    function get_shell_file_config_variable() {
        [[ -r "$1" && "$2" =~ [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* ]] || Error "Arg 1 '$1' is not a readable file or arg 2 '$2' is not valid variable name"
        local file="$1"
        local key="$2"

        (
            function die {
                echo "ERROR: $*"
                exit 1
            }
            set -e -u -o pipefail
            unset $key
            declare -rx PATH=/dev/null
            set -r
            eval "$(< "$file")" || die "Bash errors while executing '$file'"
            [[ -v $key ]] || die "$key is not set in $file"
            echo ${!key}
        )
    }

    get_shell_file_config_variable /etc/os-release VERSION
    echo $?

    get_shell_file_config_variable /etc/os-release SCHLOMO
    echo $?

    get_shell_file_config_variable /etc/passwd VERSION
    echo $?

    get_shell_file_config_variable /etc/cron.daily/dpkg foo
    echo $?

    bad_file=$(mktemp)
    echo -e "date\nFOO='bar in $bad_file'" >$bad_file
    get_shell_file_config_variable $bad_file FOO
    echo $?

    get_shell_file_config_variable /etc/nothing VERSION
    echo $?

Is there a reason why you prefer to run an extra `bash` binary? This
version also has cleaner error handling and doesn't show internal errors
about undefined variables or such:

ATM there is only one scenario that I don't like which is that I didn't
manage to abort reading the config file if there is anything wrong with
it. The example with `line 20: date: command not found` illustrates
that: The line with `date` in the "config file" is ignored but the 2nd
line with `FOO=` is then read. Strictly speaking I'd prefer the code to
abort on that with an error.

Since we talked about the example of reading `/etc/os-release` I read
again
[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/os-release.html](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/os-release.html)
and realised that we should also read `/usr/lib/os-release` if it
doesn't exist... More complexity and probably not part of the function
under discussion, but of the use case for which we bring it in.

My current is\_trustworthy\_for\_root is meant  
for files that are not ReaR files,  
like some shell-syntax config files.

We use our Source() function only for ReaR files  
(hopefully - as far as I assumed up to now).

We don't care about the ownership of the ReaR files  
and currently I cannot tell if this is a problem.  
It could be a problem when we e.g. Source() files  
as ReaR scripts that could have been "injected"  
by others (i.e. new scripts in writable directories)  
or modified by others (i.e. existing scripts).  
Perhaps we may better call is\_trustworthy\_for\_root  
for each file that we Source() to be on the safe side?  
Hopefully at least usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh  
is safe so that others cannot modify is\_trustworthy\_for\_root().  
Up to now I did not at all think about that.  
Perhaps too carelessly I blindly assumed that  
in any case only root can install ReaR  
(perhaps because only root can install RPMs)  
so I assumed ReaR files are owned by root and all is safe.  
But I never verified that others cannot modify ReaR files.

Regarding "why calling 'source'"  
and "why having another bash in between"  
see my explanations above and in particular  
see the history of all that in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3165)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171)

Neither "calling 'source'"  
nor "having another bash in between"  
was my idea so I cannot properly answer questions  
about all the reasoning behind.

I only recognized that things worked better  
(i.e. less false failures from too simple implementations)  
when using 'source' from within a separated bash  
but I did not compare that with possible other ways  
how one could get a variable value out of a file.

I would much appreciate if if @pcahyna and @lzaoral  
could comment here to help to get things sorted out  
so that we all better understand each other.

@schlomo  
regarding your suggested get\_shell\_file\_config\_variable():

I think your goal is different than the goal  
behind the 'source' method, cf. my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203\#issuecomment-2056083708](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203#issuecomment-2056083708)  
therein in particular what I think what  
the generic advantage of the 'source' method is  
and what  
the generic disadvantage of the 'source' method is.

So it makes sense to also have your function in ReaR  
for cases where we cannot 'source' a file.

Perhaps over time we learn that in practice we never  
actually needed to 'source' a file to get a variable  
value out of it and then we could "just drop"  
that source\_variable\_from\_file function  
because it is only a ReaR internal function  
so we are free to do with it what we want.

Perhaps in the end only is\_trustworthy\_for\_root  
and its consequences "survive" from here  
which could be a rather good end result.

Regarding /etc/os-release versus /usr/lib/os-release:

At least on my openSUSE Leap 15.5 I have:

    # ls -l /etc/os-release
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /etc/os-release -> ../usr/lib/os-release

so at least on openSUSE Leap 15.5  
/etc/os-release exists

    # rpm -qf /etc/os-release
    openSUSE-release-15.5-lp155.286.1.x86_64

but I don't know if /etc/os-release exists  
as file or as symlink to /usr/lib/os-release  
on other Linux distributions.

By the way:  
This link was the reason why I do

    resolved_file="$( readlink -e "$filename" )" || return 1

in is\_trustworthy\_for\_root() because otherwise  
the link would be reported as untrustworthy because

    # stat -c %A /etc/os-release
    lrwxrwxrwx
