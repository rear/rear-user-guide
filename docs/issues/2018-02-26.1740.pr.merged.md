##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

This is a continuation of the YUM backup method \#1464

-   How was this pull request tested?

CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 source VMs in Virtualbox, restoring to another VM

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

YUM+backup adds the ability to backup and restore files to the YUM
method, which, like the ZYPPER method, recreates the target system from
scratch using a list of RPMs captured from the source system.

The only files backed up are those which were either

-   Not provided by RPM packages
-   Were provided by RPM packages, but have been modified after
    installation

This minimizes the number of files included in the backups while still
capturing every file on the system not explicitly excluded using options
like BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE, EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS, etc

New configuration options are

-   YUM\_BACKUP\_FILES  
    If true, a backup archive (much like the NETFS archive) will be
    built
-   YUM\_BACKUP\_FILES\_FULL\_EXCL  
    If true, the filesystem is scanned for files which, though symlinked
    directories, point to the files which have been excluded from the
    backup. This minimizes the size of the backup archive in exchange
    for additional processing time
-   YUM\_BACKUP\_SELINUX\_CONTEXTS  
    If true, also capture all of the SELinux contexts so they can be
    restored on the target system
-   RECREATE\_USERS\_GROUPS  
    Has 3 options, *"no"*, *"yes"* and *"yes" "passwords"*. If "no", no
    users that weren't added by RPM packages during install will exist
    on the target system. If "yes", users and groups will be recreated
    on the target system. If "yes" "passwords", users, groups **and**
    passwords are recreated on the target system.

Thanks!

documentation @gdha requested.

@N3WWN  
many thanks in particular for the documentation.

When you do not plan to add more commits I would like to merge it
soon,  
e.g. tomorrow (unless you tell me otherwise).

Hi @jsmeix !

No additional commits are planned at this time. üòÅ

Thanks!

@N3WWN  
many thanks for this major contribution that much improves the YUM
method  
towards a full solution to recreate the system completely as it was
before.

Now we have three fundamentally different methods in ReaR  
how to recreate the system:

The most generic and very low level "BLOCKCLONE" method,  
the various usual backup methods,  
the higher level YUM and ZYPPER methods.

Those fundamentally different methods together with "multiple backups",
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
provide great flexibility and freedom to the user how he can recreate
each of his  
various systems as he specifically needs it in his particular
environment.

When time permits I would like to enhance the ZYPPER method in the same
way  
(i.e. I will basically copy as much of your code to implement
ZYPPER+backup).  
For now I like to keep the scripts for YUM and ZYPPER totally
separated  
until things stabilized - in particular after more user feedback (I am
still waiting  
for a first user "out there" of the ZYPPER method - I am in particular
happy  
that my ZYPPER method at least was useful to have now your much more  
complete YUM+backup method in ReaR).  
Later we can see what is really duplicate code and have common scripts
for that  
or introduce a set of common functions that are used both by YUM and
ZYPPER.
