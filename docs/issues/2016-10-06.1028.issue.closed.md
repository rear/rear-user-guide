Made a backup and tried restoring after drive change and I get this :-0
, any ideas what just happened :-(

I never used rear that way (from USB rescue media)  
but from what I see on your screenshots it seems  
you try to boot a "backup" and not a "rescue image".

Regarding "OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a)":  
We like to know on what Linux system and version  
you did run "rear mkbackup".

From my current point of view it looks as if you need  
first and foremost a better generic understanding  
how rear works.

Or do I perhaps somehow completely misunderstand  
what your issue is about?

Meanwhile I think I am wrong.

The naming "backup" versus "rescue image" confused me.

In output/USB/Linux-i386/30\_create\_extlinux.sh  
I found (excerpts):

<pre>
case "$WORKFLOW" in
    (mkbackup) usb_label_workflow="backup";;
    (mkrescue) usb_label_workflow="rescue image";;
...
syslinux_write <<EOF 4>"$USB_REAR_DIR/syslinux.cfg"
label $HOSTNAME-$time
    menu label ${time:0:4}-${time:4:2}-${time:6:2} ${time:9:2}:${time:11:2} $usb_label_workflow
</pre>

Accordingly the "backup" named thingy should boot a  
rear recovery system that resulted from "rear mkbackup".

@deepesh-agarwal  
can you inspect what files there actually are  
on your USB rescue media?

Did my first try with kind of "USB rescue medium"  
and for me it sems to "just work".

I am using a QEMU KVM virtual machine for my testing  
with a second virtual harddisk /dev/sdb.

For preparation of /dev/sdb as rear rescue medium I did

<pre>
# rear format /dev/sdb
USB device /dev/sdb must be formatted with ext2/3/4 or btrfs file system
Please type Yes to format /dev/sdb in ext3 format: Yes
# parted -s /dev/sdb unit GiB print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 1.00GiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 
Number  Start    End      Size     Type     File system  Flags
 1      0.00GiB  1.00GiB  1.00GiB  primary  ext3         boot, type=83
</pre>

I have in etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

Then I did only "rear mkrescue" because my 1GiB /dev/sdb  
is too small to store also the backup.tar.gz:

<pre>
# rear -d -D mkrescue
Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-g136.log
Creating disk layout
Creating root filesystem layout
Copying files and directories
Copying binaries and libraries
Copying kernel modules
Creating initramfs
Writing MBR to /dev/sdb
Copying resulting files to usb location
You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.HYOgHYJbzr6leKR
</pre>

Then I booted that virtual testing machine from /dev/sdb  
and got the usual rear boot menue where I can select  
an entry to boot the rear recovery system which boots  
as usual for me.

What files there are on my /dev/sdb:

<pre>

I followed the exact procedure shown here -
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)
on a `Debian 8.6` installation to create the `rescue media` and then
created the `backup` on a 2TB USB disk. I got the drives changed and now
unable to restore :(

@deepesh-agarwal

many thanks for your information.  
Now I better understand what you did.

As far as I understand your screenshots,  
your current problem is that your USB rescue medium  
does not boot the rear recovery system on it.

As far as I understand your screenshots, it seems  
you have several rear recovery systems and  
probably also several backup-tar.gz files on  
your USB rescue medium.

I think at the syslinux/extlinux boot prompt "boot:"  
it should work to enter the label or file name  
of what syslinux/extlinux should load and launch  
(but I am really not at all a syslinux/extlinux expert).

When it finally fails to boot a rear recovery system  
from your USB rescue medium you can perhaps  
(on another computer - provided you have one)  
check whether or not there is at least one or more  
backup-tar.gz files on your USB rescue medium  
so that you still have at least a backup of your files.

In gereral note that there is  
"No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation"  
see
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
excerpts:

<pre>
You must test in advance that it works in your particular case
to recreate your particular system with your particular recovery
medium and that the recreated system can boot on its own and
that the recreated system with all its system services still work
as you need it in your particular case.
You must have replacement hardware available on which your
system can be recreated and you must try out if it works to
recreate your system with your recovery medium on your
replacement hardware.
You must continuously validate that the recovery still works
on the replacement hardware in particular after each change
of the basic system. 
</pre>

Bottom line:  
There is no such thing as a disaster recovery solution  
that "just works", see also

Will try your suggestion, but why it made multiple systems in the first
place? I did the process only once!!!

This is the rescue media creation logfile:

The rear recovery system boots as usual and I can  
log in there as root (no password) and run the recovery

I rebooted the rear recovery system and booted the system  
from /dev/sda (where the receated system is) and everything  
works well for me.

Then I did "rear mkbackup" a second time:

I booted again from that /dev/sdb  
got again the rear boot menue  
where I selected first my system (via its host name)  
and then I can now select two recovery systems  
both labeled "backup" but with different time stamps.  
I selected the last one which again boots as usual.

I can log in there as root and run the recovery  
ans now (as expected) I can select between  
two backups with different time stamps

Summary:  
For me using rear with a kind of "USB rescue medium"  
(another disk drive in my case) "just works" even for  
more than one backup on the rescue medium.

@deepesh-agarwal  
I have no idea what went wrong in your particulat case  
why you don't get the usual working rear boot menue.

It's my bad day, while I asked my host to reinstall the OS and leave the
attached USB untouched - they wiped the USB clean. Thankfully, the
server had only 15 days of work which I had a 3 day old source-code
backup.

Will definitely use and learn more about REAR now to backup as ISO on a
different server.

Lesson learned.
