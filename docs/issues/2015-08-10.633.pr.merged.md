This PR removes the dependency nfs-client and adds it as recommendation.

The reasons for this are

-   NFS is not really a dependency for rear, as there are many other
    ways to use it
-   In my eyes NFS is a quite heavy dependency, as it depends on portmap
    which opens tcp/111 udp/111 by default
