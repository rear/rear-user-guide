[\#438 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/438) `merged`: Prevent hang on boot if NTP can't reach any servers
===============================================================================================================

**Labels**: `bug`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120296?v=4" width="50">[mavit](https://github.com/mavit) opened issue at [2014-07-15 09:15](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/438):

If, for example, no network is available, `ntpd -q` will wait forever
for a response from its configured time servers.

This pull request causes NTP syncing to time-out after 10 seconds to
allow the boot to complete. You'll then reach a shell prompt and get a
chance to try to figure out what went wrong.
