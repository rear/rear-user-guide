We have too many ways of defining a variable to be true of false, e.g.

    VAR=
    VAR=y
    VAR=YES
    VAR=1
    VAR=yes

Maybe, we better create a simple function to unify this?  
Feedback welcome...

+1

Do we have tri-states? Like Yes/No/Auto? Or Yes/No/Unset?

When there is one or more common functions it can be enhanced as needed
to test for as many states as needed like yes/no/auto/unset/default/...

I wonder if it is possible to test that common functions are actually
used everywhere? In other words: How to find all places in the code that
would need to be unified?

There is no need to change all code at one moment - whenever, we feel
the need (or come across one piece of code) we can change it...

You are right.

Same reasoning as my own comment ("can be enhanced as needed"). Somehow
I failed to apply my own reasoning to my own question ;-)

Function seems to work. It is now just a question of using it when we
come across a script which uses a non standard test for true/fasle.
