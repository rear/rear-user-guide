@DEvil0000  
I am really not a booting expert so I may ask dumb questions  
but more likely I am just confused by the too similar naming  
of different things.

In case of GPT with BIOS there is now

            if ! parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE unit s mkpart primary $bootloader_partition_start_byte $bootloader_partition_end_byte >&2 ; then
                Error "Failed to create BOOTLOADER system partition on '$RAW_USB_DEVICE'"
            fi
    ...
        if ! parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE unit B mkpart primary $boot_partition_start_byte $boot_partition_end_byte >&2 ; then
            Error "Failed to create BOOT system partition on '$RAW_USB_DEVICE'"
        fi

so first a `BOOTLOADER system partition` gets created  
and then a `BOOT system partition` gets created  
which looks (at least on first glance) as if the same thing happened two
times.

But I assume that actually  
first one is a small BIOS boot partition for GRUB2 to store its
core.img  
and  
the second one a bigger one for what is in the /boot/ directory  
in particular kernel, initrd (i.e. the ReaR recovery system initrd),  
and the rest of GRUB2 in /boot/grub2/

FYI:  
The ReaR recovery system can be up to about 1G  
and when third party backup tools are used even more, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2640\#discussioncomment-908335](https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2640#discussioncomment-908335)  
and the whole recovery system is in an initrd so depending on initrd
compression  
the ReaR recovery system initrd can have several hundred MB.

You are correct about the GPT partitions. The first one contains the
`core.img` of grub and the second one contains the `/boot` (bootloader
config, kernel, initrd). Will add a comment. Also sektor 34 to 2047 for
this first partition sounds okay to me but I am not a expert on this
also.  
1G is what I expected as size for `/boot` partition. My initrd is about
450MB compressed so two of them fit in. I used a optional
`USB_BOOT_PART_SIZE` defaulting to `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE` for a config
option.

In ReaR we use in general not sectors because their size can vary.  
Normally one sector is 512 bytes but it can be also 4K = 4096 bytes per
sector.  
I guess there are USB disks out there with 4K sector size  
in particular for disks &gt;= 2TiB which can be expected for backup
disks.

Therefore we use in general only byte values for parted calls.  
For us it is no drawback that we must calculate the exact byte values on
our own.  
Actuall it is an advantage because only with byte values parted does
exactly  
what is requested without automated rounding or automated alignment  
or parted fails if it cannot do what is requested which is what we want.

With 4K sectors the current code creates the BIOS boot partition  
up to excluding byte 2048 \* 4096 = 8388608 = 8 MiB which matches  
`USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE="8"` in default.conf  
that specifies where the second '/boot' partition starts.

But with 4K sectors the current code would fail if a user sets e.g.  
`USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE="4"`  
in his etc/rear/local.conf

But that is a minor issue.  
I would merge your pull request with that minor issue and enhance it  
later to make it work with any USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE

If you like you may make it safe against this issue  
by using something like

    boot_partition_start_byte=$(( USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE * MiB_bytes ))
    bios_boot_partition_end_byte=$(( boot_partition_start_byte - 1 ))

to let the BIOS boot partition end just before the '/boot' partition
starts.

As far as I understand  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID\_Partition\_Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table)

    Thus, on a disk with 512-byte sectors ...
    the first usable block is LBA 34 or higher.
    While on a 4,096-byte sectors disk ...
    the first usable block is LBA 6 or higher.

it now depends on what sector 34 means for parted.  
Does it always mean 512 \* 34 = 17408 bytes (if a sector in parted is
always 512 bytes)  
or could it also mean 4096 \* 34 = 139264 bytes &lt; 0.133 MiB for 4K
sectors?

Because even 139264 bytes is much less than 1 MiB  
starting the BIOS boot partition at parted sector 34  
would always work even down to the minumum of  
`USB_PARTITION_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE="1"`

But because according to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID\_Partition\_Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table)  
a default GPT area (i.e. with up to 128 partitions) goes up to
(excluding) byte  
`max{ 512 * 34 = 17408 , 4096 * 6 = 24576 } = 24576`  
it should be safe to specify

    bios_boot_partition_start_byte=24576

and call parted with bios\_boot\_partition\_start\_byte and the above
bios\_boot\_partition\_end\_byte

And explain all this in exhaustive comments in the code  
so that others who may look at that code later  
(hopefully after more than 10 years)  
understand why the code is as is.

You are correct, my USB sticks all have 512byte sectors and the code may
not be safe for bigger sectors.  
Since you used the same source (wiki) the first usable sector for gpt
with default length/efi minimum length is
`max{ 512 * 34 = 17408 , 4096 * 6 = 24576 } = 24576`. From my
understanding this is 512byte bootloader + 512byte gpt header +
32x512byte for 128 partition entry slots and then the next sector is
usable.  
I am not sure about that but in my understanding the special purpose
partitions are expected in a specific order and without additional empty
space/gaps. Sometimes I figured a bios refused to boot when the
partition was not within the first X sectors or a expected sector.

Also have a look at [wiki: bios boot
partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition) and the
svg there (lower half) [partition layout for gpt with efi and bios
grub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition#/media/File:GNU_GRUB_components.svg)
this would be the layout for a EFI+BIOS hybrid formatting.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID\_Partition\_Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table)
reads (excerpts)

    The UEFI specification stipulates that a minimum of 16,384 bytes,
    regardless of sector size, are allocated for the Partition Entry Array.
    Thus, on a disk with 512-byte sectors, at least 32 sectors
    are used for the Partition Entry Array,
    and the first usable block is LBA 34 or higher.
    While on a 4,096-byte sectors disk, at least 4 sectors are used
    for the Partition Entry Array,
    and the first usable block is LBA 6 or higher.
    ...
    the Partition Entry Array describes partitions,
    using a minimum size of 128 bytes for each entry block

so this vaules are minumum values but the whole GPT partitioning space  
can be arbitrarily bigger e.g. one may have 256 GPT partitions.

The German  
[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID\_Partition\_Table](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table)  
describes this more clearly

    Die EFI-Spezifikationen schreiben ein Minimum von 16 384 Bytes
    für die Partitionstabelle vor, so dass es Platz für 128 Einträge gibt.
    ...
    Die maximale Anzahl möglicher Partitionen hängt von der
    Größe der Partitionstabelle ab, die laut Spezifikation mindestens
    für 128 Partitionen Platz bietet. Nicht alle Systeme bieten diese
    Möglichkeit, jedoch kann z. B. das Partitionierungswerkzeug gdisk
    eine größere Partitionstabelle erzeugen.
    ...
    Advantages of GPT; 3. Arbitrary number of partitions - depends
    on space allocated for the partition table … By default the GPT table
    contains space for defining 128 partitions. However if the user wants
    to define more partitions, he/she can allocate more space to the
    partition table (currently only gdisk is known to support this feature).

So what the first byte on a GPT disk is that can be used by partitions  
depends on the space allocated for the partition table which can be
arbitrarily big.

This is why I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2656\#issuecomment-879837623](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2656#issuecomment-879837623)

    a default GPT area (i.e. with up to 128 partitions)

because format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh calls

    parted ... mklabel gpt

which creates a default GPT area.

But the size of a default GPT area is different depending on the sector
size.

I think if a firmware assumes the first parition starts at a fixed byte
value  
(e.g. the next byte after a default GPT area with 512 bytes sector
size)  
that firmware has a severe bug.

Partitions start and end as specified in the partition table  
and firmware must read and obey the partition table.

When some BIOS firmware refuses to boot from USB disk  
there could be various reasons that are often related  
to restrictions in the firmware how far it can access data on disks  
and additional restrictions how far it can access data on USB disks,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2534](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2534)

Therefore all data that is needed by the firmware to boot  
(in particular all booting related partitions)  
should be at the beginning of the disk to avoid possible issues.

I am quite sure our understanding of this is the same. Maybe I was just
not clear enough.  
Considering the default size of gpt as in my example it is the byte
amount mentioned and the next sector start after that is usable for
partitions. This is mostly independent of sector size - the difference
is due to the next sector start. GPT however might have a bigger
partition table as well in theory but I never saw a bigger one in
reality.  
Partition alignment is some other thing to consider which does afaik not
apply to BOOTLOADER partition. It may in addition be irrelevant for BOOT
and EFI partitions but that something I am not sure about.

Not sure what would be the best way of fixing the sector size (bios boot
partition start/end) issue. Would appreciate a merge and fix from you.

OK.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it as is tomorrow
morning and  
then I will further adapt and enhance things via a subsequent pull
request from me.
