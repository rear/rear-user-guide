At the moment we use tar in a few cases to copy files around:

-   *usr/share/rear/rescue/default/01\_merge\_skeletons.sh*
-   *usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/10\_copy\_as\_is.sh*

This means that **tar** is a hard dependency for a functional
Relax-and-Recover, while this is not necessarily needed for most
use-cases. It is also unclear to me why we use **tar** in this way,
rather than using **cp**. I would like to get rid of the need for tar
for all but specific tape use-cases, unless there is a good reason why
we do this.

@schlomo @gdha Consider this issue a "call for information" ;-)

Tar is always available (unlike pax :-)) so I don't see this as a bad  
dependency.

IMHO tar | tar is a better cp for many applications because

-   it supports exclude patterns
-   it is more of a streaming copy as we have two tar processes that
    stream
-   (old) unix wisdon recommends tar over cp

What exactly disturbs you about tar? What is the business value of
getting  
rid of it? Is it really a top prio now?

It is not so much a "disturbance" than it is looking to reduce the
number of dependencies. I certainly was not going to propose pax instead
as an alternative.

And no, it is not a top priority or even a priority. Issues are a way to
keep track of things we might want to do (much like those feature
requests that may never happen). I opened it against v1.15 and not
against v1.14 so it definitely is not going to be tackled the coming
month...

I am not convinced about using tar where a simple cp would do fine.

PS If you think I am singling out tar for some reason, I am not. We have
been adding tar "features" and for me it is important to see where we
might want to plug in a more generic feature mechanism for tools.
Currently "features" are spread out all over the place, and in the case
of tar "features" I am now testing features after those basic uses of
tar. That's why I bring this up now after closing the problem created by
the \#67 issue, unfortunately it was not tracked by an issue.

@dagwieers is there still a reason to keep this open? IMHO it will never
change due to time constraints...

If the aim is to decrease the number of issues, I guess you can close
it. On the other hand, the number of issues does not seem that important
to me if they're categorized well. Feel free to do whatever you prefer
:-)
