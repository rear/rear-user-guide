[\#2421 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421) `closed`: Expect include files in OpenSSH client (ssh) and server (sshd) configuration
===============================================================================================================================================

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `fixed / solved / done`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660803?v=4" width="50">[OliverO2](https://github.com/OliverO2) opened issue at [2020-06-06 22:13](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421):

From the OpenSSH [release
notes](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html):

**OpenSSH 7.3**/7.3p1 (2016-08-01):

-   ssh(1): Add an Include directive for ssh\_config(5) files.

**OpenSSH 8.2**/8.2p1 (2020-02-14):

-   sshd(8): add an Include sshd\_config keyword that allows including  
    additional configuration files via glob(3) patterns.

**Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with OpenSSH 8.2 uses this directive at the top of
its configuration files.

1.  In `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`:
        Include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*.conf

2.  In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
        Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

Where ReaR currently scans, copies or patches such files, it should
expect additional settings living in seperate configuration files
referenced by the `Include` directive.

The current [manual
page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man5/sshd_config.5.html)
states:

> /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.d/\*.conf files are included at the start of the
> configuration file, so  
> options set there will override those in /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.

So it would be sufficient to insert ReaR overrides at the beginning of a
patched configuration file (as it is done currently) without worrying
about any duplicate setting later on in any include file or in the main
configuration file.

An important detail regarding `Match` directives is not documented in
the manual pages but in this [Bugzilla
comment](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2468#c26):

> Included files do not affect the match context of the file including
> them.

@OliverO2 @gdha  
do you think this is something that must be done for ReaR 2.6  
or can it be done later for ReaR 2.7?

FYI:  
SLES15 SP1 and openSUSE Leap 15.1 have openssh-7.9p1 while  
SLES15 SP1 and openSUSE Leap 15.2 will have openssh-8.1p1  
and openSUSE Tubleweed already has openssh-8.1p1

@OliverO2 @jsmeix As ReaR-2.6 will be used on RedHat 8 and Ubuntu 20 I
would pin this issue to release 2.6 if you do not mind?

RedHat 7: openssh-7.4p1-21 and does not have a /etc/ssh/ssh\_config.d
directory  
RedHat 8: openssh-8.0p1-4 and does have /etc/ssh/ssh\_config.d/
directory  
Fedora 32: openssh-8.3p1-2 and does have /etc/ssh/ssh\_config.d/
directory

@jsmeix @gdha The current code works as is on Ubuntu 20.04 as those `.d`
directories are empty as distributed. So I had considered it as an issue
to watch for future releases. If I remember correctly, we should be
mostly concerned with the code that scans for unprotected SSH private
keys as such keys might live in files below `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d` in
the future.

The RedHat 8 configuration looks Interesting. Two levels of `Include`
files.

If you'd like to tackle this, it would probably be safest to

-   scan and interpret the include directives (which may contain glob
    expressions) recursively,
-   copy the included files onto the recovery system,
-   scan included `ssh` config files for unprotected private keys.

To me, it looks like there is no need to change patching `sshd_config`
done by `usr/share/rear/build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh` as the current
code works properly even in the presence of included files.

(Note that you cannot just concatenate included files to create a new
configuration as this would change `Match` contexts and result in
different semantics.)

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421\#issuecomment-640488807](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421#issuecomment-640488807)

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2422](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2422)  
I overhauled how SSH config files are parsed for IdentityFile values  
to find (and remove) unprotected SSH keys in the recovery system.  
Now `find ./etc/ssh` should ensure that SSH 'Include' config files  
e.g. in /etc/ssh/ssh\_config.d/ are also parsed.

Regarding "copy the included files onto the recovery system" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421\#issuecomment-640499017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421#issuecomment-640499017)

In usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh we have (excerpts):

    if is_true "$SSH_FILES" ; then
        ...
        copy_as_is_ssh_files=( /etc/s[s]h ... )
    ...
    ... COPY_AS_IS+=( "${copy_as_is_ssh_files[@]}" )

so with explicit `SSH_FILES="yes"` the user can get  
all below `/etc/ssh` copied into his recovery system  
(including sensitive SSH files therein).

With

merged the part  
about "the code that scans for unprotected SSH private keys" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421\#issuecomment-640488807](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2421#issuecomment-640488807)  
should now be fixed.

I'd say this issue can be closed.

The patching code is still correct. For recent OpenSSH versions, we
would no longer need to uncomment overridden settings which appear later
in the configuration file, as only the first setting rules. However,
older versions of sshd might see things differently and possibly
complain about multiple definitions of the same setting. So for now I'd
say it is best if we leave it at that.

@OliverO2  
thank you for attentive issue report and your help and your checks  
to have things properly adapted in ReaR for recent OpenSSH versions.
