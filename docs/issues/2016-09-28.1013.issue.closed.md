The contents of  
skel/default/etc/systemd  
skel/default/run/systemd  
skel/default/usr/lib/systemd  
skel/default/var/run/systemd  
get copied into the rescue/recovery system  
regardless if systemd is actually used or not, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011\#issuecomment-249851303](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011#issuecomment-249851303)

This makes the rescue/recovery system bigger than  
needed when no systemd is used.

I think I could enhance rescue/default/01\_merge\_skeletons.sh  
to not copy systemd files into the rescue/recovery system  
when no systemd is used.

On the other hand I wonder if nowadays this would provide  
a real benefit for the users because nowadays systemd  
is basically used on all systems.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011\#issuecomment-249851303](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011#issuecomment-249851303)  
not copying those systemd files into the rescue/recovery system  
when no systemd is used could at most save about 236K  
which is only about 0.067% of the 342M that the recovery system  
has on my SLES12-SP2 test system, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1012\#issuecomment-250151514](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1012#issuecomment-250151514)

With the same argument as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1012\#issuecomment-250151514](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1012#issuecomment-250151514)

<pre>
From my current point of view that is too little benefit
compared to the additional effort and compared to
the additional risk to mess up something subtle
in the recovery system...
</pre>

I close this issue as "won't fix".
