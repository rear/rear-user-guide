Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053)  
is merged all numbered scripts must now match  
the new 3-digit\_ scheme because the adapted  
SourceStage function in framework-functions.sh  
now only works for 3-digit names.

Furthermore according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022\#issuecomment-255676605](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022#issuecomment-255676605)  
that reads (excerpt)

<pre>
numbers 01 and 99 are never used by ReaR so that
those numbers are always reserved for user scripts
</pre>

ReaR 3-digit\_ scripts should not be 000\_\* or 999\_\*  
i.e. ReaR 3-digit\_ scripts should never use the edges  
of the 000..999 3-digit range so that the edges are kept  
always free to be used by users for their own scripts.

Hereby I ask for an automated test that is run  
for each pull request that checks that script names  
with leading numbers match the 3-digit\_ scheme  
and that at least 000\_\* or 999\_\* are forbidden.

Perhaps we may also forbid more numbers to always  
have free numbers for user scripts.

For example ReaR 3-digit\_ scripts may never use  
two subsequent numbers e.g. 123\_this.sh and 124\_that.sh  
so that between each two ReaR 3-digit\_ scripts there is  
always at least one free number where a user can insert  
his own script.

@gdha  
I assign it to you because I do not know  
how to add automated test.

@jsmeix could be a good idea to verify if everything is still working -
I noticed lots of `chmod` actions during my last commit - I cannot
remember I changed anything on the security mode level, did you?

I did not actively change any owner/group/permission settings  
of ReaR files and I am not aware that I changed something accidentally.
