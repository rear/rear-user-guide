Hey,  
I just tried to recover a system where I used borg as backup system. The
recovery fails at the step where rear wants to list the borg repository.

When I try to run borg from shell, it tells me that there is no python
interpreter available.  
Also made a ` find / -name 'python*'` with no result.

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / 2017-12-20
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Ubuntu
    16.04.3 LTS
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

I would be glad for any help

Hi @catsem,

Please check
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030\#issuecomment-341404033](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030#issuecomment-341404033)

TL;DR  
Either you do manual includes of Python, as comment proposes, or use
[Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases)

Hey @gozora,  
thanks for your reply.  
I think most people with a larger environment will use the python
versions of borg, because this is what you get from the package
repositorys (at least with Ubuntu/Debian). IMHO rear should take care
that we have python in the rescue image out of the box, just like it
does for duplicity or yum.  
See:  
rear/usr/share/rear/prep/DUPLICITY/default/050\_prep\_duplicity.sh  
rear/usr/share/rear/build/DUPLICITY/default/600\_create\_python\_symlink.sh

Could be seen as an enhancement / feature request.

Best  
Christian

My knowledge of Python and surrounding infrastructure is very limited
and I really don't dare to write code like this.  
If you know how to implement this so it works universally across distros
, does not break anything, and (last but not least) honors users with
[Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases) (which might
not want whole python env copied), you are more then welcome to create
PR for this enhancement.

I am a "happy" owner or "larger" environment and I personally prefer
using [Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases) ;-).

For now I'm closing this issue as I guess your original question was
answered.

@gozora  
do you think it is possible with reasonable effort  
to add a test during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" that verifies  
whether or not Borg programs will work in the recovery system?

I mean during 'build' stage something like
build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
but as separated script that only runs in case of BACKUP=BORG.

@catsem  
regarding your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727\#issuecomment-364850414](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727#issuecomment-364850414)  
"rear should take care that we have python in the rescue image out of
the box":

Certainly not "just by default".

Since ReaR exists is does by default take care that its recovery
system  
is not bigger than needed.  
The reason is that the ReaR recovery system is specific for each
original system  
because it contains specific data of each original system (primarily
disk layout data).  
This means when ReaR is used for hundreds or thousands of original
systems  
(which is a main use case of ReaR in business environments)  
any "few more megabytes" by default in the recovery system  
can make a noticeable difference regarding storage space that is  
needed for hundreds or thousands of ReaR recovery systems.  
With RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL this can be mitigated, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841)

Regarding "Python in the rescue image":

What would be needed is an automated test to distinguish whether ro
not  
"Python stuff" is needed to run Borg programs in the recovery system,  
and if yes, what exact "Python stuff" is actually needed.

Since ReaR 2.3 we have for usually compiled programs a 'ldd' test  
in usr/share/rear/build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
but of course - as any automatism it has shortcomings - because  
this test cannot autodetect if unsually compiled programs may  
require additional special libraries via 'dlopen' at runtime.

I know nothing at all if for Python programs there is a tool  
that can autodetect which other "Python stuff" Python programs  
may require at runtime.

Hello @jsmeix,

Checking Brog installed from Debian repo I have:

    debian:(/home/sodoma/tmp)(sodoma)# ldd $(type -p borg)
        not a dynamic executable

Which is OK, I guess, since we are dealing with Python script here.

[Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases) on the other
hand returns:

    debian:(/home/sodoma/tmp)(sodoma)# ldd borg-linux64
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffda0fc000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f5541aa6000)
        libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f554188c000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f55414ed000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f5541caa000)

So distinguish between Borg script and [Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases) is rather
easy.  
As I've pointed out in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727\#issuecomment-364855240](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727#issuecomment-364855240)
I have zero experience with Python and I don't dare to decide what libs
/ env / configs must by copied for Borg into ReaR to make it work
correctly, neither to write some test code and decide if Borg would be
able to recover system successfully. Not talking about fact that every
distro might have different locations for Python environment ...

What I would do is update of
[documentaiton](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-iso-with-borg)
and warn users that until they don't use [Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases), they need to
include all necessary Python files.

@gozora  
in

I only meant an automated test during 'rear mkrescue'  
that warns users if they do not use Borg binaries.

In your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727\#issuecomment-364864044](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727#issuecomment-364864044)  
I noticed that another positive side-effect of using Borg binaries is  
that the generic 'ldd' test in build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
checks that the Borg binaries have all their needed libraries  
in the recovery system.

This is something that could be done with "reasonable effort" +
documentation update mentioned in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727\#issuecomment-364864044](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727#issuecomment-364864044).  
But I'd really not try to automatically copy Python env into ReaR
recovery system.

Especially not when there is very elegant
[solution](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases) to address this
problem, directly from Borg guys ;-) ...

@jsmeix

Do you think we can use code like this near the end of
[build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/980_verify_rootfs.sh)
?

    if [[ $BACKUP = "BORG" ]]; then
        ldd $(type -p borg) > /dev/null
        LogPrintIfError "Make sure you have correctly included Python environment to make Borg work correctly"
    fi

Automatically copy "the right needed" Python enviroment into ReaR

Let's see when we need Java support in the ReaR recovery system ;-))

Documentation updated in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1730](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1730).

I'll add Borg binary vs script check / issue warning in separate PR.
