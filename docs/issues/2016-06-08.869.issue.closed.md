-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2 / 1.18
-   OS version: OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer OS\_VERSION=7
-   Brief description of the issue: on booted rear-system, sshd failes
    to start. Script `build/default/50_patch_sshd_config.sh` add a line
    to sshd\_config **PrintMotd no**. When using Match rules in
    sshd\_config, after a Match rule are only other Match rules or end
    of file is supported (man sshd\_config; section Match). So
    **PrintMotd no** - line should be added before Match rules.
-   Work-around, if any: change sed command in
    `build/default/50_patch_sshd_config.sh` to
    `sed -i  -e 's/ChallengeResponseAuthentication.*/ChallengeResponseAuthentication no/ig' \ -e 's/UsePAM.*/UsePam no/ig' \ -e 's/ListenAddress.*/ListenAddress 0.0.0.0/ig' \ -e '1i\PrintMotd no' \ `
    to add **PrintMotd no** at the beginning.

@Wsaibot thank you for the deep-dive - perhaps prepare a pull request to
get it fixed (faster)?

@gdha I'm really new on github (since last week for rear). Is there a
short howto for creating a poll request? I'd like to help, if I can....
