I think that
[os-release](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html)
is a good thing. All systemd based distros will ship that file and the
content is well defined. We can pull all or at least most of our info
from there as well.

I would therefore propose a completely different approach:

-   Write code to parse
    [os-release](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html)
    properly, following all the hints from the man page.
-   On distros that ship `os-release` remove `lsb*` from the package
    dependencies.
-   Use `os-release` if `lsb_release` is not available.

The result will be a smooth migration with minimal impact. And it is
upgrade safe as we don't run any code on package installation. And it
also works when you run ReaR from source code :-)

Milestone (1.18) removed. No idea when this one will be fixed.

Issue \#778 is a related issue.

referenced to the wrong issue - should have been \#778. This issue has
not been resolved yet!

Just had a look again, with `ID` and `ID_LIKE` and `VERSION_ID` it
contains IMHO all that we need to know.

@jsmeix would this be a way for more recent SUSE systems to avoid
creating this `os.conf` during the RPM build process? The big big
downside of build-time configuration is that a simple `make install`
does not yield the same result as installing the package (hit me today
on SLES10).

That build-time created os.conf file should definitely be dropped  
for newer ReaR versions at least for SUSE because  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241)  
the SetOSVendorAndVersion function results "the right stuff"  
at least for SUSE (regardless whether or not my current  
implementation is really the best way to do it).

@schlomo  
I fully agree that basically all build-time settings  
have the problem that they may be wrong during run-time.

FYI:  
I was hit by a missing os.conf when I used a git clone via

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear
</pre>

@schlomo on SLES10 I only find `/etc/lsb-release` and/or
`/etc/SuSE-release` files, so that we still need to differentiate I
guess

@jsmeix Could you paste from a few SLES versions the output of
`grep "ID" /etc/os-release ` please?

@schlomo @jsmeix @gozora If we would remove `os.conf` spec generation
from the *spec* file would it be an option to generate one on the
**prep** work-flow? The file would be re-generated each time then, but
that would fix capturing OS upgrades (VERSION\_ID that would change)?
