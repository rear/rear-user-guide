Now for me "rear recover" in migration mode  
looks like (excerpts):

<pre>

I have a question to all ReaR maintainers:

Can one of you perhaps explain to me what  
the reason is for the unexpected behaviour in  
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/blob/e5d7f694212912d958168ec1238ed1bae25a50d2/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/blob/e5d7f694212912d958168ec1238ed1bae25a50d2/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh)  
why code like

<pre>
( source $LAYOUT_CODE ) && break
</pre>

does not work because it seems this way  
the 'set -e' inside LAYOUT\_CODE does no longer work  
so that then LAYOUT\_CODE would no longer exit  
if a command therein exits with non-zero status.  
In ReaR I must explicitly test $? as follows

<pre>
( source $LAYOUT_CODE )
(( $? == 0 )) && break
</pre>

so that the 'set -e' inside LAYOUT\_CODE still makes it  
exit if a command therein exits with non-zero status.

On plain command line such code works for me

<pre>
# echo 'set -e ; cat qqq ; echo hello' >script.sh

# ( source script.sh ) && echo ok || echo failed
cat: qqq: No such file or directory
failed

# echo QQQ >qqq

# ( source script.sh ) && echo ok || echo failed
QQQ
hello
ok
</pre>

but it seems same kind of code does not work within ReaR.

I found the root cause of my question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1573\#issuecomment-344284401](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1573#issuecomment-344284401)

In ReaR it does not work because on my SLES12 test system  
where I run ReaR there is "GNU bash, version 4.3.42"  
while on my SLE11 workstation where I usually try out  
commands there is "GNU bash, version 3.2.51" and in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1573\#issuecomment-344284401](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1573#issuecomment-344284401)  
I did the plain command line test with bash 3.x.

The bash version makes the difference here:

With bash 4.x it also does not work on plain command line:

<pre>
# echo 'set -e ; cat qqq ; echo hello' >script.sh

# ( source script.sh ) && echo ok || echo failed
cat: qqq: No such file or directory
hello
ok

# ( source script.sh ) ; (( $? == 0 )) && echo ok || echo failed
cat: qqq: No such file or directory
failed
</pre>

@gozora via

I completely overhauled the  
layout/prepare/default/200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh  
script and I would very much appreciate it  
if you could have a general look at it  
[https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/blob/7b15e5c3783c41d41dbf3c9fb735351633d51a6d/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh](https://github.com/jsmeix/rear/blob/7b15e5c3783c41d41dbf3c9fb735351633d51a6d/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/200_recreate_hpraid.sh)  
whether or not you see perhaps immediate mistakes.  
Many thanks in advance!

Hello @jsmeix

What I can tell you from top of my head.

    grep -q '^cciss ' /proc/modules || return 0

**cciss** is no longer module to be used, HP(E) switched to **hpsa**
some time ago.  
**hpsa** uses standard SCSI disk names for SmarArray logical disks
(/dev/sd\[a-z\] instead of /dev/cciss/...) so I'm not sure if whole code
in *200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh* will work on modern systems ...

Unfortunately I don't have access to any HPE test HW right now, so I
can't really tell you whether recreation of SmartArray works or not
:-(  
I'll however keep this in mind and as soon as I have an opportunity to
test it, I'll do so.

V.

Topic of creating SmarArray (SA) from OS can be even more complicated
due special branch of SA called HPE Dynamic Smart Array (cf.
[specification
link](https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c04406959))
which is "kind of" smart array but can be used only in UEFI mode and
uses different Linux driver *hpdsa* dependent on *hpsa*.

I actually never used ReaR feature for creating logical volumes during
restore process, but rather created them manually prior `rear recover`

I tried hard to not change what the code  
in 200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh actually does.  
I do not have such hardware so that I cannot  
change what that code actually does.

I only changed (i.e. cleaned up) the syntax and  
replaced the 'read' and 'select' calls by UserInput()  
so that the new 200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh again  
matches the new 200\_run\_layout\_code.sh.

Regarding  
"cciss is no longer module to be used, HP(E) switched to hpsa"  
I had noticed that in  
[http://cciss.sourceforge.net/](http://cciss.sourceforge.net/)  
which reads

<pre>
The cciss driver has been removed from RHEL7 and SLES12.
If you really want cciss on RHEL7 checkout the elrepo directory.
A new Smart Array driver called "hpsa" has been accepted into
the main line linux kernel as of Dec 18, 2009, in linux-2.6.33-rc1.
This new driver will support new Smart Array products going
forward, and the cciss driver will eventually be deprecated. 
</pre>

Accordingly my hopefully non-behavioural changes  
in 200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh are not of real importance  
nowadays so that I can more easily merge it without  
too much fear about possible regressions related to  
CCISS HP Smart Array setups.

FWIW:  
For me on my SLES12 test system the new stuff works really well.
