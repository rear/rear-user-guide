The **problem** is that important content from `/var` is missing from
the backup archive (checking on the backup server):

    $ tar -tvzf /srv/scratch/rear-sle15sp4/backup.tar.gz | grep " var/"
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2023-02-12 21:38 var/
    -rw------- root/root     1509845 2023-02-14 08:30 var/log/rear/rear-rear-sle15sp4.log

The root cause for this is that the actual backup tar command looks like
this and includes only `/` and not the other BTRFS subvolumes. But it
also has the `--one-file-system` option set so that `tar` won't descend
into the subvolumes:

    ++ Print 'Creating tar archive '\''/var/tmp/rear.1fX2nBnGHRya4cJ/outputfs/rear-sle15sp4/backup.tar.gz'\'''
    ++ ProgressStart 'Preparing archive operation'
    ++ echo -en '\e[2K\rPreparing archive operation\e7'
    ++ BackupPID=5297
    ++ starttime=61
    ++ sleep 1
    2023-02-14 08:28:36.965871429 tar --warning=no-xdev --sparse --block-number --totals --verbose --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system --ignore-failed-read --anchored --xattrs --xattrs-include=security.capability --xattrs-include=security.selinux --acls --gzip -X /var/tmp/rear.1fX2nBnGHRya4cJ/tmp/backup-exclude.txt -C / -c -f - / /var/log/rear/rear-rear-sle15sp4.log | dd of=/var/tmp/rear.1fX2nBnGHRya4cJ/outputfs/rear-sle15sp4/backup.tar.gz bs=1M

And the root cause for that is that the `backup-include.txt` only
contains `/`

It seems like we don't add the subvolumes to the backup automatically on
BTRFS?? I'm wondering how many SUSE users stumble over that?

And yes, the SUSE-related example config actually explains the problem
and provides the solution (thanks for including that @jsmeix !)

Maybe we should add some logic to automatically set the following in
case `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE` is *not* defined:

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( $(findmnt -n -r -o TARGET -t btrfs | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash') )

Another question: On other systems not using BTRFS, does ReaR behave the
same and include only `/` in the backup or all filesystems? If on
non-BTRFS systems we include everything by default unless configured
differently then I'd suggest to make ReaR behave the same on BTRFS
systems too.

Technically it behaves as btrfs behaves.  
For btrfs a subvolume means for 'tar' with '--one-file-system'  
that the btrfs subvolume is not included.

If we changed that we would make things behave incosistently  
in ReaR because then 'tar' with '--one-file-system' would behave  
different in ReaR for btrfs subvolumes than what plain 'tar'  
would do with '--one-file-system' for btrfs subvolumes and  
ReaR would behave different for btrfs subvolumes than for  
other things that are not included with '--one-file-system'.

Making the backup is in general external functionality in ReaR  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

ReaR calls a backup tool but ReaR is not meant to be  
backup configuration or management software so it is  
the user's task to specify things in ReaR for 'tar'  
in the same way as when he makes a backup whith plain 'tar'.

Perhaps I should explain this in more detail in default.conf  
what it means that 'tar' is called with '--one-file-system'  
so the user is informed to specify things as he needs it.  
Because as far as I see we do not tell our users  
that we call 'tar' with '--one-file-system'  
neither in default.conf nor in a doc/\* file.

ISTR @antonvoznia saw a similar issue on Fedora, where the default is
now also BTRFS and /home got excluded from backup (because it was a
subvolume).

IMO ReaR should treat subvolumes the same way as it does for separate
filesystems: pass their mountpoints to the tar command explicitly. But
maybe I misunderstand how it works - I have not yet dug deeper in the
internal backup inclusion/exclusion code.

All correct. My question would be "what does the user expect?"

And my answer would be: "By default the backup should cover everything"

That is why I would like to suggest that by default ReaR NETFS backup
should always perform a "full backup" of the system.

I would not expect a different behavior if `/home` is a separate BTRFS
subvolume and if it is a separate XFS filesystem.

So what happens on a not-BTRFS system where different directories like
`/home` or `/var` are on different file systems? Will ReaR automatically
include them all in the backup by default or only after explicit
configuration?

I am quite sure it is the former - all disk-based filesystems are added
to backup by default.

Then I'd like to see that behaviour for SUSE as well, regardless of the
filesystem used

Offhandedly I may agree that there should not be a different behavior  
if /somedir is a btrfs subvolume or if it is a separate filesystem  
but when I think about it I get stuck in the dilemma  
that I described above:

'tar' with '--one-file-system' has same behavior  
when /somedir is a btrfs subvolume or a filesystem.

But now ReaR should have a differnt behavior  
when /somedir is a btrfs subvolume versus a filesystem.

How should ReaR behave consistently and trustworthy?

When the user knows 'tar' is called with '--one-file-system'  
then he must be able to trust ReaR to behave accordingly.

FYI:  
I will not enter a discussion what users expect.  
I had that in a totally different area in the past  
more than enough ad nauseam (yes, really AD NAUSEAM).  
It only wastes my energy and likely the energy of others too.  
I would stop contributing to ReaR (except SUSE forces me)  
if I had to deal with user expectation discussions.  
I want ReaR to stay as it always was and still is:  
A lower level expert tool (like 'parted' and such).  
I would appreciate a fully separated user frontend  
when someone makes it (e.g DRLM is some kind of that)  
but I would not contribute to that.

I leave this issue now and let other ReaR maintainers  
find out how to solve it.

FYI  
for clarification to avoid misunderstandings:

I refuse to think about what is commonly  
called "user expectations" or similar.

It is right to ask for what one himself needs.

It is OK to forward truthfully what others asked for  
but it would be better when they speak for themselves.

It is false to "impersonate" others and speak for them.

It works best to only focus on hard (technical) facts  
and avoid to fade away into wishful thinking and the like.

I guess that this is currently by design. I'm fine with leaving this as
it is till somebody is willing to sponsor a better BTRFS support in
ReaR.

After sleeping on it for some time now  
I meanwhile got a vague tentative untested idea  
how it might be possible to implement that some  
btrfs subvolumes get automatically included in the backup.

Please be patient - I need to try that out.

For me crucial parts are  
"final power to the user"  
so that the user must not have to work against the automatism  
(i.e. an automatism must never enforce its stuff on the user)  
and  
backward compatibility  
i.e. users who have specified

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( specific btrfs subvolumes )

must not get a changed behaviour because a new automatism  
adds some more btrfs subvolumes that are not wanted.

Hello @jsmeix ,  
I also checked the behavior of tar with `--one-file-system` and btrfs
subvolumes on and it is consistent with its behavior on mounted
filesystems: if tar is called on `/`, the `/home` filesystem is not
included in the backup if it is a separate mounted filesystem, and
neither if it is a mounted btrfs subvolume. The problem is that ReaR
does not pass the subvolume mount point to tar (while it passes the
mount point to tar if it is a regular mounted FS like XFS), as described
in \#2604 .  
I agree that snapshot subvolumes are a problem, even if one wants to
include btrfs subvolumes, one should skip snapshots (at least in the
first version). Maybe this is not particularly different from LVM
snapshots? I don't even know how those would behave.  
I am sorry that I can't provide a more concrete advice on btrfs as it
seems fairly complicated and I am not familiar with it.  
I can provide information on how it is configured by default on Fedora,
though (the default install uses btrfs).  
Do you want to see a disklayout.conf from a Fedora installation?

@pcahyna  
could you show me on a Fedora installation the output of

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINTS

if this works on Fedora (i.e. with 'MOUNTPOINTS' plural)  
plus the disklayout.conf file.

The current layout/save/GNU/Linux/100\_create\_layout\_file.sh  
does not yet use 'MOUNTPOINTS' but only 'MOUNTPOINT'  
in contrast to the function lsblk\_output() in  
layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh  
(I know - I need to align them - as time permits).
