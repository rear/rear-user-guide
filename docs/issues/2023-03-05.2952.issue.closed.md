Probably I missed the context, but I find it consuing to get a checksum
mismatch error during recovery:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101384/222938620-30599b78-dd8f-4f73-a7c4-5d1cd012d634.png)

While I understand the mechanics, I don't understand the purpose and I
don't understand which problem ReaR tries to solve here. Also, I find
this error not actionable.

I read through \#2795 and I'm wondering if checking the
`CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` array via MD5 is maybe too much... Or maybe we
started to use that variable for too many purposes. For example, it
containt not only the disk layout related configs but also ReaR
configuration and even backup software configuration (for TSM,
FDRUPSTREAM and soon also GALAXY11).

As a result, I'd expect the majority of recoveries to show that error
even though there is no need to do anything because the disk layout
related files (that we wanted to check for missing ID changes, no?) .

Maybe we need to split `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` into two arrays, or limit
the files that we check MD5 sums for? Also, maybe "checking if we should
run `mkrescue` again" is a completely different problem from "is there a
problem with the recovered system" so that we shouldn't use the same set
of checksums for that?

Some more examples where the MD5 checksums are sure to fail:

-   mounting by hardware IDs, e.g. serial numbers, disk IDs or
    hardware-related paths
-   different network adapters
-   updates that happened between creating the backup and taking the
    mkrescue

All of that is because we use the MD5 checksums stored in the *rescue*
image to check content of the *restored backup*, and they are in my
experience much less tightly coupled.

The purpose of this issue is to talk a bit about how to narrow down the
feature introduced by \#2795 to reduce confusing error messages.

The history behind:

It started with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785)  
that lead to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787)  
which is still open,  
i.e. we do not have a solution for that.

In general the reason for this error message is that  
the user made a ReaR recovery system and a backup  
that do not match.

As far as I can imagine such a mismatch can only happen  
when the ReaR recovery system is made separated from the backup  
i.e. not via "rear mkbackup" but via "rear mkrescue" and  
"rear mkbackuponly" or by a third-party backup tool  
plus when something was changed between "rear mkrescue"  
and making the backup.

Here "do not match" means that for md5sums stored during  
"rear mkrescue" in var/lib/rear/layout/config/files.md5sum  
then during "rear recover" after the backup was restored  
a md5sum does not match for restored files that are  
listed in var/lib/rear/layout/config/files.md5sum  
which means the files where the md5sum does not match  
changed between "rear mkrescue" and making the backup.

The purpose of this error message is that  
the user is informed about a possible problem.

ReaR does not try to solve any problem here  
because ReaR cannot solve it during "rear recover"  
when the user made a ReaR recovery system  
and a backup that do not match.

Accordingly it is up to the user to evaluate  
what such reported inconsistencies mean for him  
and take some appropriate action to fix things  
if needed or ignore reported inconsistencies.

@jsmeix that is exactly my point: All users of commercial backup
software will every only use `rear mkrescue` and the frequency of
running `mkrescue` is typically much more seldom (e.g. after software
and configuration rollouts) compared to the backup software taking a
backup (nightly).

A mismatch is therefore to be expected and that is why I'd like to
improve ReaR in a way that it won't show errors for expected situations.

@schlomo  
in your particular case

    /etc/rear/local.conf
    /etc/rear/os.conf

changed.

I don't know details when etc/rear/os.conf changes.  
I think this could be a false positive in your case  
but when really the OS or its version changed then  
it likely indicates severe problems with a recovered system  
when the ReaR recovery system was made on a different OS  
than what is in the backup.

When etc/rear/local.conf doesn't match it always indicates  
that there could be severe problems with a recovered system  
because the user may have changed something critical  
but only the user knows if this is really the case  
(perhaps he only added a comment).

Do you always get this errors or other errors of that kind?

In particular do you also get them when you did not change  
your etc/rear/local.conf between your "rear mkrescue" and  
making your backup (or vice versa)?

@schlomo  
can you elaborate why you think

    ... the MD5 checksums are sure to fail:

    *  mounting by hardware IDs, e.g. serial numbers,
       disk IDs or hardware-related paths

    *  different network adapters

    *  updates that happened between creating the backup
       and taking the mkrescue

I don't see why failing MD5 checksums  
in those cases will always be false alarm.

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785\#issuecomment-1091782697](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785#issuecomment-1091782697)

Summary (excerpts) from both:

    change the UUID of the ... partition
    ...
    The rescue is built everytime the layout changes
    ...
    But the /etc/fstab file that will be used
    during the recover ... is still the one in the backup
    thus the old one with old UUID.
    And the patch will fail ... (without a warning :D).
    And the system will not boot.

The crucial part therein is

    without a warning

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)  
implements such a "warning" but in compliance with

I think the main reason why this error message lines  
look confusing is that context is missing what it means  
in particular because it looks related to the  
"Recreating directories" step before.

So instead of

    Recreating directories ...
    /etc/rear/local.conf: FAILED
    /etc/rear/os.conf: FAILED
    md5sum: WARNING: 2 computed checksums did NOT match
    Error: Restored files do not match the recreated system in /mnt/local
    Migrating disk-by-id mappings in certain restored files ...

a more comprehensible output could be like

    Recreating directories ...
    Checking if restored files may not match the recreated system
    /etc/rear/local.conf: FAILED
    /etc/rear/os.conf: FAILED
    md5sum: WARNING: 2 computed checksums did NOT match

See my initial proposal to make it  
at least look more comprehensible:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2954](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2954)  
therein see

I made another proposal via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2954/commits/2507822e9841bae97fd4408f9dfc0087fe495fca](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2954/commits/2507822e9841bae97fd4408f9dfc0087fe495fca)  
for better user messages in finalize/default/060\_compare\_files.sh

With this it should look like

    Recreating directories ...
    Error: Restored files do not match the recreated system in /mnt/local
      /etc/rear/local.conf: FAILED
      /etc/rear/os.conf: FAILED

This is not yet tested.

Let me add more info about the purpose of the check (I believe I still
remember it quite well). I think @jsmeix is right here but perhaps not
clear enough.

@schlomo

The idea behind this check is to check for problems that may arise
because we should have run `mkrescue` again, but we have not. So it is
not a completely different problem - it is the same problem detected at
different times. That's why it uses the same set of checksums - it is
deliberate.

They should not fail in this case, because the check happens before
patching the files to change the hardware IDs to the new values (the
restored backup should contain the original values and the checksums
have also been calculated with the original values). Indeed, if the
check fails, it indicates that this subsequent patching of hardware IDs
in the files will fail (potentially serious problem! - as @jsmeix said)
and this was originally the main reason for introducing the check,
IIRC.  
Not sure about network adapters, but I think the same reasoning applies
(maybe the problem is less serious if detected, but should not normally
occur either).  
Concerning updates, I don't know, do they often lead to a checksum
mismatch in the files concerned?

Unfortunately they *are* coupled, because the restored files (from
backup) are to be patched using rules stored in the rescue image. That's
the point.

It may happen often in this situation, but it is not "expected" (in the
sense of being harmless) IMO. It indicated that one should have executed
"mkrescue" more often.

I believe this is because ReaR configuration may refer to disks (for
example, in the include/exclude rules), so it is also a "disk layout
related config".

Not sure here, but isn't it a potential problem if the backup was
restored using a different backup software configuration than the one it
was made with?

In particular regarding changed /etc/rear/\* files:

I noticed my offhanded gut feeling reasoning at that time in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795\#issuecomment-1113124577](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795#issuecomment-1113124577)  
which mentiones in particular the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
(excerpt)

    It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent.
    First and foremost the files in your backup
    must be consistent with the data that is stored
    in your ReaR recovery system (in particular what
    is stored to recreate the storage in files like
    var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf) because
    ReaR will recreate the storage (disk partitions
    with filesystems and mount points) with the data
    that is stored in the ReaR recovery system and
    then it restores the files from the backup into
    the recreated storage which means in particular
    restored config files must match the actually
    recreated system (e.g. the contents of the
    restored etc/fstab must match the actually
    recreated disk layout).
    Therefore after each change of the basic system
    (in particular after a change of the disk layout)
    "rear mkbackup" needs to be run to create
    a new ReaR recovery system together with a
    matching new backup of the files.

this issue should be solved at least to some reasonable extent
