#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.3
-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): RHEL 7.5
-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<pre>
NRSERVER=xxxxxxxxxxxx
NSR_CLIENT_MODE=y
OUTPUT=ISO
ISO_PREFIX="rear-nsr-$HOSTNAME"
BACKUP=NSR
OUTPUT_URL=file:///tmp
# Static IP (no DHCP!)
USE_DHCLIENT=
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="y"
# NTP
TIMESYNC=NTP
</pre>

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine):x86
-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot? Legacy BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:we have faced a network connectivity
    issue when the REAR ISO has been booted:  
    The problem is in the mapping of the server physical interfces to
    the ethXX logaical interface names. As you can see in the
    screenshot (1) the eth names are assigned to the physical interfaces
    almost in random which is incorrect configuration. When I removed
    network card kernel modules (rmmod tg3;rmmod igb) and probed than
    back again (modprobe tg3, modprobe igb) the mapping between the
    physical interfaces and logical interface names is correct as you
    can see on screenshot (2). The mapping is configured in the udev
    conf file located in /lib/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules This
    file is present on the REAR iso as well, seems not used by the REAR
    initramdisk during bootup though.

@nirmal21s  
I am afraid, my networking and/or udev knowledge is insufficient  
to actually help with such issues in the recovery system.

As a possible workaround in this particular case when manual  
`rmmod tg3 ; mmod igb ; modprobe tg3 ; modprobe igb`  
helps before running "rear recover" you can automate that  
via the PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT config variable,  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Such a PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT is run during "rear recover" via  
usr/share/rear/setup/default/010\_pre\_recovery\_script.sh  
at a very early stage, cf.

<pre>
# rear -s recover
Simulation mode activated ...
Source conf/Linux-i386.conf
Source conf/GNU/Linux.conf
Source conf/SUSE_LINUX.conf

@nirmal21s  
another blind guess what might perhaps help is to use MODULES\_LOAD  
to enforce to load the specified kernel modules in the given order  
in the rescue/recovery system so that e.g. something like

<pre>
MODULES_LOAD=( tg3 igb )
</pre>

might help in your case.

In general to debug what happens during recovery system startup:

In general regarding debugging issues with the start up scripts  
that are run initially in the ReaR recovery system  
the basic idea behind is to not let those start up scripts  
run automatically and mostly silently but manually  
one after the other with 'set -x' bash debugging mode.

Add 'debug' to the ReaR kernel command line  
when booting the ReaR recovery/rescue system.

In the ReaR recovery/rescue system boot menue select  
the topmost enty of the form "Recover HOSTNAME"  
and press the \[Tab\] key to edit the boot command line  
and append the word ' debug' at its end and boot that.

You may found yourself stopped at a blank screen.  
In this case press \[Enter\] which runs the very first of the  
start up scripts (/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00functions.sh).  
There is some bug that the initial message is not always  
printed so you may need to type the very first \[Enter\] blindly.

The further start up scripts are run one by one  
each one after pressing \[Enter\].

In 'debug' mode the start up scripts are run with 'set -x'  
so that this way you can better see what actually goes on  
in each of the start up scripts.

@jsmeix  
I will add the below parameters in local.conf and test it :

PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT=(rmmod tg3 ; mmod igb ; modprobe tg3 ; modprobe
igb)  
MODULES\_LOAD=( tg3 igb )

I hope the parameter is correct.

@jsmeix  
Just want to know if the reason behind the issue might be due to this
parameter "USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING="y"  
Since the Eth interface is :  
DEVICE=eth0  
BOOTPROTO=none  
ONBOOT=yes  
TYPE=Ethernet  
NM\_CONTROLLED=NO

So do i need to remove "USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING="y"" and use
USE\_DHCLIENT=y ..

@nirmal21s  
I do not know where this "70-persistent-net.rules" file is coming from.
As far as I read it in RHEL 7.x this is not used any more; at least I
cannot find it under RHEL7.4 or Centos 7.5.

About USE\_DHCLIENT: If You have an DHCP server available use it. But I
assume not using DHCP is not the issue here.

BTW, can You provide the information which kind of server is in use?

Thanks.

@hpannenb  
I am not getting your question .. you mean whether is a DHCP server or
?  
The OS version is RHEL 7.5..  
Thanks.

@nirmal21s I believe the question was "do you have internally a DHCP
server you can use to gain an IP address (during a recovery)?"  
If the answer is yes, then use "USE\_DHCLIENT=yes" in the local.conf
file. It would fix your problem in an easy way.

@gdha  
I am not able to prepare the syntax for PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT=(rmmod tg3
; mmod igb ; modprobe tg3 ; modprobe igb)..

The below mentioned is correct :

    for interface_count in `seq 0 9`

    do

    if [ -f "/sys/class/net/eth$interface_count" ]; then

                status="success"

    else

                status="failed"

    fi

    done

    if [ "$status" = "success" ]; then

                exit

    else

                echo -e "Incorrect Interfaece sequence"


    rmmod tg3 ; mmod igb ; modprobe tg3 ; modprobe igb  

    fi

@nirmal21s You could try the following. Add above commands into a script
and saved it as
`/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/77-my-network-setup.sh`
and re-run `rear -v mkbackup`. When booting from the resulting ISO image
this script should be kicked in.

@gdha  
Thanks for the above recommendation.  
Here the issue was after rear recover the network interface mixed up .  
I was going through the issue 770
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770))
.  
Just wondering if this would fix the issue  
BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES=(
/lib/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )

@nirmal21s good thinking as on RHEL 7.5 the
`/lib/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` is not required it is indeed
best to remove it.

@gdha I will test it and confirm ..  
created a ISO image by running mkrescue . for BACKUP=NSR.  
For restoring the files we use Networker tool.  
Hope everything goes well..

After removing the below parameters :

BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES=(
/lib/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )  
USE\_DHCLIENT=

We tried to crated a new ISO image and tried to boot.  
Everything went well , after rear recover ,we got the MAC address.

But we were able to ping only this servers gateway and not able to ping
the backup server IP.  
issue was with routing i guess  
After running the /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-netowrk-devices.sh &
62-routing.sh manually it worked and this server was rechable from
backup server.  
Any clue why REAR behaved like this.

There were changes made to how linux boots & identifies the Ethernet
interfaces.  
potentially there were race conditions in how linux enumerated
interfaces with some physical adaptions of the motheboards  
**Also sometimes the initial config of the setup may make it IMPOSSIBLE
for REAR to discover the correct network....  
It is NOT just a matter of sticking an IP address onto an interface in
some cases.**

In my case I ALWAYS have to boot my HP servers with "REAR" in "manual
mode", since it is impossible for rear to guess my network config.
(unless i make manual scripts)  
A simple

"ip addr" gets me  
2: enp3s0f0:

I then

MUST  
ip addr add 172.18.10.xx/24 dev enp3s0f0  
ip link set enp3s0f0 up

So how can REAR fail to find the ipaddress on a functioning network,
seems foolish ?  
here is an example  
we already know enp3s0f0 is the external interface  
but during the BACKUP... REAR sees this:

cat ifcfg-enp3s0f0  
NM\_CONTROLLED="no"  
IPV4\_FAILURE\_FATAL="no"  
NAME="enp3s0f0"  
UUID="7452703b-4fdc-4e9f-accb-8c30f7803b3d"  
DEVICE="enp3s0f0"  
ONBOOT="yes"  
TYPE=OVSPort  
DEVICETYPE=ovs  
OVS\_BRIDGE=br-ex

cat ifcfg-br-ex  
NM\_CONTROLLED="no"  
DEVICE=br-ex  
DEVICETYPE=ovs  
TYPE=OVSBridge  
PROXY\_METHOD="none"  
BROWSER\_ONLY="no"  
BOOTPROTO="static"  
IPADDR=172.18.10.70  
NETMASK=255.255.255.0  
GATEWAY=172.18.10.1  
DEFROUTE="yes"  
IPV4\_FAILURE\_FATAL="no"  
IPV6INIT="no"  
IPV6\_AUTOCONF="no"  
IPV6\_DEFROUTE="no"  
IPV6\_FAILURE\_FATAL="no"  
IPV6\_ADDR\_GEN\_MODE="stable-privacy"  
ONBOOT="yes"

Ha Har......  
during recovery ,how can we expect REAR to deal with getting a suitable
ip config from the above?  
it is a backup program... not an AI to discover how data is routed out
of the box.
