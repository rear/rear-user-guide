-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I got the same disklayout.conf on my homeoffice laptop  
    with the changes of this pull request here.

This pull request was triggered by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801\#issuecomment-1122015129](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801#issuecomment-1122015129)  
therein in particular the last part that reads

    I will have a look at
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh
    how to make it behave more reliably and failsafe,
    in particular error out directly therein when things failed
    instead of error out later in 950_verify_disklayout_file.sh

Therefore the changes in this pull request are  
generic enhancements to detect early i.e. directly  
in the code where the entries are genereated in  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
when invalid entries would be generated  
(regardless what the actual reason is), see

Because I get same disklayout.conf on my homeoffice laptop  
there should be no regressions because of those changes  
so that I would like to merge them tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections form one of you

I will wait until @pcahyna had done his tests, see

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545)  
we do no longer error out when there is no partition label type value  
for a 'disk' entry in disklayout.conf because "rear recover" works  
in a special case without partition label type value when there is  
only a 'disk' entry but nothing else for this disk exists in
disklayout.conf  
which can happen when /dev/sdX is an empty SD card slot without medium,
