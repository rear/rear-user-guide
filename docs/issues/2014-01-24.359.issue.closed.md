===============================================================================================

Setting SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD is not enough.

When trying to restore server I was unable to login due to sshd\_config
had:  
PermitRootLogin no

I propose a change to /usr/share/rear/rescue/default/50\_ssh.sh from:

            if [[ $SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD ]] ; then
                    echo "root:$(echo $SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD | openssl passwd -1 -stdin):::::::" > $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/shadow
            fi

to:

            if [[ $SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD ]] ; then
                    echo "root:$(echo $SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD | openssl passwd -1 -stdin):::::::" > $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/shadow
                    sed -i "/PermitRootLogin/d" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                    sed -i "/PasswordAuthentication/d" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                    echo "PermitRootLogin yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                    echo "PasswordAuthentication yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
            fi

This will ensure the possibility to use password for login.
