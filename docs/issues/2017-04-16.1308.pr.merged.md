Therefore report the esp flag too.

Could this cause issues on older Linux distributions  
where parted does not support the esp flag?

On my SLES10 system "man parted " reads

<pre>
  set partition flag state
    change the state of the flag on partition to state.
    Flags supported are: "boot", "root", "swap", "hidden",
    "raid", "lvm", "lba" and "palo".
</pre>

On my SLES11 system "man parted " reads

<pre>
  set partition flag state
    Change the state of the flag on partition to state.
    Supported flags are: "boot", "root", "swap", "hidden",
    "raid", "lvm", "lba", "legacy_boot" and "palo".
</pre>

On my SLES12 system "man parted " reads

<pre>
  set partition flag state
    Change the state of the flag on partition to state.
    Supported flags are: "boot", "root", "swap", "hidden",
    "raid", "lvm", "lba", "legacy_boot", "irst" and "palo".

@jsmeix And which parted versions are yours?  
For SLES12 the man output occurs strange to me: it does seem to support
irst (Intel Rapid Start Technology) which was introduced together with
ESP, according to the GNU Parted release notes at
[http://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum\_id=8042](http://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=8042)

My parted is version 3.2.
