-   Brief description of the issue  
    Could not find this in the docs. Is there anyway to purge the
    backups on media, or to keep the latest n backups?. I'd like to do
    backups, but keep only the latest n backups. Thank you very much.
-   Work-around, if any

Hello @peptoni,

Maybe you will give a try to DRLM ([www.drlm.org](http://www.drlm.org))
to manage your ReaR backups.

One of the features is multiple backups management. You just need to set
HISTBKPMAX=&lt;number\_of\_bkps&gt; in /etc/drlm/local.conf and manage
them with: drlm CLI

Hope this can help you! ;)

Thanks @didacog. Nice utility, but I'm on standalone server right now.

I've found this:

Number of rescue environments/backups to retain on USB
======================================================

USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=2

on /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf but it's not working for me. Even
if I add this lines to /etc/rear/local.conf it's not working... I'v done
5 backups, but not purging older ones.

Any idea? Thanks in advance.

script `output/USB/Linux-i386/30_create_extlinux.sh` seems to use the
variable `USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR`. So, it does not work you say?

At least for me, is not working. I've done up to 5 backups onto my USB
drive but all of them remain on disk. There is, apparently, no purge. Is
there any more info I can give you? Thanks in advance.

There is one difference with a standard setup. My drive isn't labeled
"REAR-000". Is labeled "backup", because I have a previous working
rsnapshot setup around that. Other than this, it's a standard setup, as
far as I can tell.

I wrote this script and called it "prunerearbackup".  
It checks the average sizes of the backups and multiplies by 3 (for good
measure) to see if any pruning is needed.  
I set it up to run an hour or more prior to the backup process.  
You'd have to modify it to match your rear folder names and the disk
device...

    #!/bin/bash
    date
    echo "Pruning backup media."

    # Mount disk
    echo "Mounting /dev/sdb1 on /mnt"
    mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

    while true
    do
      # Disk usage
      TOT=`df -BK /dev/sdb1 | grep "/dev/sdb1" | sed -e 's/ * / /g' -e 's/^ //' | cut -f2 -d" " | sed -e 's/K//'`
      USE=`df -BK /dev/sdb1 | grep "/dev/sdb1" | sed -e 's/ * / /g' -e 's/^ //' | cut -f3 -d" " | sed -e 's/K//'`
      AVL=`df -BK /dev/sdb1 | grep "/dev/sdb1" | sed -e 's/ * / /g' -e 's/^ //' | cut -f4 -d" " | sed -e 's/K//'`
      # Backups on disk
      CNT=`ls /mnt/rear/ccasvr/ | wc -l`
      # Average per backup
      AVG=`expr ${USE} / ${CNT}`
      # Required available space defined for this site
      REQ=`expr ${AVG} \* 3`
      # Check and get out if there's enough space
      [ ${AVL} -ge ${REQ} ] && break
      # Check and get out if there's only the minimum number of backup copies or less on the media
      [ ${CNT} -le 2 ] && break
      DEL=`ls /mnt/rear/ccasvr/ | head -n 1`
      echo "Removing ${DEL}"
      rm -r /mnt/rear/ccasvr/${DEL}
      # /bin/echo -e "Press Enter to continue: \c"
      # read ans gbg
    done

    # Unmount disk
    echo "Unmounting /dev/sdb1 from /mnt"
    umount /mnt

Nice script. Very elaborated.  
I would go more for a simple line like:

`find /path/to/files* -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;`

Yours is disk space available oriented and mine is just time oriented.

Anyway, I'd love to find out about the integrated variable in ReaR.

It is not a task for ReaR to purge backups - as it is against DR
principles - purging should be under user control (as was provided above
via a special script).  
OTOH thank you for the question - it is an interesting point we should
keep an eye on.
