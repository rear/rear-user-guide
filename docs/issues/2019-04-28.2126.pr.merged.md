-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): none

-   How was this pull request tested? Ran `rear mkrescue` and
    `rear recover` on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS server before and after
    patching. Verified fix works as intended.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR corrects a mapping error when TCG Opal 2 self-encrypting disks
were present but had to be excluded due to a non-existent disk during
recovery. This exclusion was not handled properly.

(Edit: dropped second change)

@OliverO2  
I assume this issue hapens only when you are in MIGRATION\_MODE  
because the apply\_layout\_mappings function is only called there.

I would like to better understand what actually goes on on your  
particular system because 'an unmapped disk was present' looks like  
things are wrong because - as far as I can imagine offhandedly - there  
must not be any unmapped disk left, see my comments in the  
apply\_layout\_mappings function that show an example where  
the `_REAR*_` string `disk _REAR3_` is left which is then  
correctly detected and reported by "Step 3".

@gdha  
could you also have a look here and review it?

Do you think we can add it to ReaR 2.5?
