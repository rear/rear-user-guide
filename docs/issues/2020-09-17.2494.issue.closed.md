It all started with some seemingly innocent argument checking in [an
issue comment's
code](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475#issuecomment-671361418):

    function opal_device_partprobe() {
        local device="${1:?}"

        [...]
    }

Which prompted [the
observation](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475#issuecomment-671376837)

> this leads to an unfriendly exit without any error message when VAR is
> null or unset.

#### Example 1: Parameter Checks

Store this code as `usr/share/rear/prep/default/000_test.sh`:

    function opal_device_partprobe() {
        local device="${1:?}"

        partprobe "$device"
    }

    opal_device_partprobe  # missing parameter

Running `sudo usr/sbin/rear mkrescue` prints:

    rear mkrescue failed, check [...].log for details

The relevant log excerpt is (timestamps omitted):

    [...]/usr/share/rear/prep/default/000_test.sh: line 2: 1: parameter null or not set
    Exiting rear mkrescue (PID 241592) and its descendant processes ...

#### Example 2: Extensive Checks

    function opal_device_partprobe() {
        local device="$1"
        test -b "$device" -o -c "$device" || BugError "opal_device_partprobe called for '$device' that is neither a block nor a character device"

        partprobe "$device"
    }

    opal_device_partprobe  # missing parameter

Running `sudo usr/sbin/rear mkrescue` prints:

    ERROR:

### Arguments

(I hope this is representative of the original discussion.)

#### In Favor Of Some Checks

> Not checking at all (like most code in ReaR) would let ReaR either
> continue with undesirable results or trigger a follow-up error later
> on which is probably harder to diagnose.

#### Against Extensive Checks

> Putting in explicit error-checking code everywhere (like
> `[[ -z "$foo" ]] || BugError "foo: parameter null or not set" ]]`)
> distracts from the primary functionality and makes the code harder to
> read.

#### In Favor Of Extensive Checks

> The problem for the user is that he does not get the error message on
> his terminal.  
> Let him search the actual error message from the log is not user
> friendly.  
> He needs at least some message about what went wrong on his
> terminal.  
> Then he can search the log for more details related to that message.

> \[Parameter checks only\] would not catch if opal\_device\_partprobe
> /etc/fstab was called.

### To Be Discussed

In principle, we can always insert more checks in ReaR code and rely
less on checks elsewhere. It is apparent that such checks can make the
user's life easier:

-   In the above case, `partprobe` does almost no error checking on its
    own: It does not complain when called without arguments or with a
    regular file argument.

On the other hand, more checking means more code. Checks themselves can
contain bugs. More code must be read when contributing to ReaR.
Comparing the code within the function body (ignoring leading spaces):

-   Example 1: 43 characters
-   Example 2: 177 characters (4.1 times as much)

So what might be the right amount of error checking in ReaR? Can we even
figure out useful guidelines?

@OliverO2  
thank you for your explanatory description of the issue  
which helps so much to discuss such things in a constructive way!

I dared to change the subject from

    What Is The Right Amount Of Error Checking in ReaR?

to

    What Is The Right Way Of Error Checking in ReaR?

because I think it is not only about the `Amount`  
but more generally about what the best `Way` is.

See my reasoning in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475\#issuecomment-671871423](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475#issuecomment-671871423)  
why I am in favor of **explicit** checks.

I am not in favor of extensive (i.e. a high amount of) checks.

Therefore I think the example like

    [[ -z "$device" ]] || BugError "device: parameter null or not set"

is - although better than `local device="${1:?}"` - not what I mean with
an explicit check.

In contrast I think

    test -b "$device" -o -c "$device" || BugError "opal_device_partprobe called for '$device' that is neither a block nor a character device"

is an explicit check.  
In particular it makes it obvious for a code reader what
`opal_device_partprobe` is about  
because the error message provides explicit information in particular
for a code reader.

In the end I am in favor of explicit checks because of what I described
in

So now I stay silent at least until next Monday  
to give the other @rear/contributors some time  
to share their thougths here.

I'm in favor for explicit check for disk devices and creation of
partition and file systems. Other kind of errors can also always be
found back in the log file, which should be a wise thing to do check
each time - will try to explicit mention this in the [ReaR User
Guide](https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/) (in progress)
