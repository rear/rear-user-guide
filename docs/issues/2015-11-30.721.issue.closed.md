===================================================================================================================

I ran into an issue with doing a backup of a server with oracle ASM. The
backups were taking an excessively long time (like 8+ hours). I tracked
it down watching the logs to see what was taking so long. Basically
there were nearly 100,000 files in "/dev/oracleasm/iid" directory and
this list was getting appended to a list within rear to be copied.

I was able to work around the issue by doing the following.

1.  add the "iid" directory to the exclude list - I didnt exclude
    anything before so I took default and simply added the "iid"
    directory  
    COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE=( dev/shm dev/shm/\* dev/.udev
    $VAR\_DIR/output/\* dev/oracleasm/iid/\* )
2.  manually tar the "iid" directory to the server (it was tiny)
3.  ran mkbackup (this took about 5 minutes)
4.  restore the OS
5.  while still booted to the rescue ISO I extracted the "iid" directory
    back to its original location
6.  reboot server

Everything worked fine. We actually only backup rootvg with rear. The
actual database volumes are replicated by storage team. Once the data
was presented to the server the DBA had no issues starting the
databases.

I don't think that the ReaR **rescue** system needs the `/dev/oracleasm`
devices whatsoever.

Can you try if your use case also works if you exclude `/dev/oracleasm`
and **not** manually restore that?

This is a known bug in oracleasm. Please exclude the directory from the
backup as it includes runtime information for ASM. The files are removed
after a restart of the oracleasm service or a reboot of the host.  
Solution: Exclude the whole /dev/oracleasm

Can you please test and confirm that it works? Thanks a lot!
