-   Type: **Enhancement** and **AvoidErrorsDuringRecovery**

-   Impact: **Low** and **High**  
    Low impact when all is fine but hight (useful) impact when things  
    look fishy when disklayout.conf is created during "rear mkrescue"  
    to avoid that "rear recover" fails when it is too late to fix
    things.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    "rear mkrescue" still works for me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 sytem  
    with that partitioning:

<!-- -->

    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
    Model: ATA WDC WD10EZEX-75M (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 953870MiB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags:

     2      501MiB     937911MiB  937410MiB  ext4
     3      937911MiB  953870MiB  15959MiB   linux-swap(v1)        swap

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Currently it is only verifying in disklayout.conf that  
    the 'disk' entries are correct  
    the 'part' entries are correct  
    the 'part' entries specify consecutive partitions

I hope it does not break things (i.e. BugError out with false alarm)  
so that I hope it can be included in ReaR 2.5, more testing will tell...

@rear/contributors  
currently this is work in progress...  
I need to enhance and fix some things...

But of course I would appreciate it very much if you have an early
look.  
Perhaps you could even try it out and report things that behave wrong,  
in particular when it errors out because of false alarm.

@gozora  
when I implemented the `is_*_integer` functions I needed to provide
some  
backward compatibility with what was done before by `is_numeric()`  
and there some `echo` had been used, see

    # git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh

for details that lead to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0eec413050319721d24c31af823da7217f84e0cf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0eec413050319721d24c31af823da7217f84e0cf)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1706)

I could try to clean up the `is_*_integer` functions usage in a
separated pull request.  
For now in this pull request let's ignore that useless numbers output  
that shows up only in case of errors via

    Some latest log messages since the last called script ...

in usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

testing for non consecutive partitions for GPT works for me.  
I have (same sda as above but now MBR on sdb):

In my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2060\#issuecomment-468684916](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2060#issuecomment-468684916)  
I had also removed logical partitions but that did not result  
non consecutive logical partitions.

Before it was

    # parted -s /dev/sdb unit MiB print
    Model: ATA SAMSUNG SSD SM95 (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sdb: 244198MiB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: msdos

     1      1000MiB   2000MiB    1000MiB   primary                type=83
     2      3000MiB   4000MiB    1000MiB   primary                type=83
     3      10000MiB  100000MiB  90000MiB  extended               lba, type=0f
     5      11000MiB  12000MiB   1000MiB   logical   ext2         type=83
     6      13000MiB  14000MiB   1000MiB   logical                type=83
     7      15000MiB  16000MiB   1000MiB   logical                type=83
     8      17000MiB  18000MiB   1000MiB   logical                type=83

and with that (i.e. both sda and sdb are ok)  
"rear mkrescue" worked for me.

Then I did:

    # parted -s /dev/sdb rm 2

    # parted -s /dev/sdb rm 6

    # parted -s /dev/sdb unit MiB print
    Model: ATA SAMSUNG SSD SM95 (scsi)

     7      17000MiB  18000MiB   1000MiB   logical                type=83

where "rear mkrescue" did error out as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2060\#issuecomment-468684916](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2060#issuecomment-468684916)

I got only non consecutive primary and extended partitions  
but no non consecutive logical partitions.

Accordingly it seems testing for non consecutive logical partitions  
is superflous but for now I would like to keep that code there  
until it is clear that non consecutive logical partitions can really  
never ever happen even on old systems.

I tested all the above on openSUSE Leap 15.0.

@jsmeix Sorry I'm late on this thread, but what is that PR effectively
doing?  
Does ReaR support gaps in partition numbering?

@rmetrich  
Currently "rear recover" fails (or may fail) when

-   a GPT partition numbering is not 1 2 3 ...
-   a MBR primary partition numbering is not 1 2 ... up to 4
-   a MBR logical partition numbering is not 5 6 7 ...

see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681)

Accordingly the new verify script
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
tests disklayout.conf after it was created by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
for non-consecutive partitions and lets "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
error out if non-consecutive partitions are found, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681\#issuecomment-469635590](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681#issuecomment-469635590)

What needs to be tested is if
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
may falsely let "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" error out because of false
alarm.

The immediate workaround for the user in such cases is to remove  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
or skip what it does by adding a `return 0` at its very beginning.

In such cases I will fix
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh
