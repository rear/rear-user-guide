According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/rear-2.9](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/tag/rear-2.9)  
the 'rear-2.9' tagged commit is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e89f78abc92c264647068fe540a40d349d8a5671](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e89f78abc92c264647068fe540a40d349d8a5671)  
so by this commit ReaR 2.9 was released  
on "Fri Jan 31 21:08:36 2025 +0100".

Accordingly I assume our rear/rear master branch is again  
open for all further development towards ReaR 3.0, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/25\#issuecomment-2627067661](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/25#issuecomment-2627067661)  
and subsequent comments therein.

@jsmeix , correct. I also tagged `2.9` despite originally thinking that
it will not be needed. The reason is that GitHub creates a download
tarball wit the top level directory named `{project}-{tag}`, so if the
tag is `rear-2.9`, you will get a tarball with a `rear-rear-2.9`
directory, which is confusing and ugly. I thought that having the tag
called `rear-2.9` will help to achieve tarball file name like
`rear-2.9.tar.gz`, which is much better when downloading than
`2.9.tar.gz`, but it turns out this is easily achievable even without
naming the tag `rear-2.9`: just use an URL like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/2.9/rear-2.9.tar.gz](https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/2.9/rear-2.9.tar.gz)
. The part after the last slash is entirely arbitrary, so one can have
the file named as one wants. See the example at
[https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/SourceURL/\#\_git\_tags](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/SourceURL/#_git_tags)
.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
I added a reference link to the above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3389\#issuecomment-2632131305](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3389#issuecomment-2632131305)  
why there are two tags 'rear-2.X' and '2.X'

FYI regarding OBS builds:

OBS has now  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.9](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.9)

By the way I cleaned up OBS builds:

I removed all OBS build targets where ReaR fails to build  
which are RHEL\_6 RHEL\_7 and ScientificLinux\_7 cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238\#issuecomment-2556857719](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238#issuecomment-2556857719)

I removed Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.6  
because it is old and outdated so currently we have

    # osc list Archiving:Backup:Rear
    ebiso
    rear-2.7
    rear-2.8
    rear-2.9

and all build successfully where build is enabled

    # osc results -v Archiving:Backup:Rear
     ebiso
     | rear-2.7
     | | rear-2.8
     | | | rear-2.9

I keep 'ebiso' for SLE12, cf. my comment in  
current rear-2.9.spec

    # osc cat Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.9 rear.spec
    ...
    %if %{?suse_version:1}0
    Requires: iproute2
    # Make USE_DHCLIENT="yes" working by default:
    Recommends: dhcp-client
    # Since SLES11 there is an extra nfs-client package:
    Recommends: nfs-client
    # Use xorrisofs by default to create a UEFI-bootable ReaR recovery system ISO image
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084#issuecomment-2330996873
    # In SLES11 and SLES12 there was
    # /usr/bin/genisoimage provided by the genisoimage RPM and there is
    # /usr/bin/mkisofs provided by the cdrkit-cdrtools-compat RPM and
    # both RPMs are installed by default so we do not need RPM Recommends for them.
    # In openSUSE Leap 15 and SLES15 there is no longer /usr/bin/genisoimage
    # but there is /usr/bin/mkisofs provided by the mkisofs RPM.
    # But we do not need a RPM Recommends for mkisofs because
    # in openSUSE Leap 15 and SLES15 there is the better tool /usr/bin/xorrisofs
    # which is provided by the xorriso RPM which supports UEFI booting for ISOs
    # so with xorrisofs the SUSE specific tool 'ebiso' is no longer needed
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084#issuecomment-1833496190
    # and xorrisofs is used in ReaR by default as preferred method to make an ISO image.
    # In the end we only recommend xorriso for creating (UEFI-bootable) ISOs:
    Recommends: xorriso
    %endif
    ...

Currently 'Recommends: xorriso'  
and 'Requires: bc' is only for SUSE  
because I don't know how the matching RPM packages  
are named for other RPM based distributions.
