Currently there is no documentation on the website. While we do have a
manual page and draft documentation.

Maybe we should add the draft documentation, but clearly indicate it is
a draft version and we expect feedback and contributions through Github.

Put different chapters in different files.

release notes should be added as well on our web-site.

@jhoekx is it possible to update your 'layoutman' page? Would like to
see it on our web-site.  
I'll start with the basic documentation.

I just added links to an auto-rendered GitHub page.  
The documentation can be edited online and edits generate a Pull
Request.

I should have done this a lot earlier ;-)  
But the AsciiDoc-integration in GitHub is a welcome change !
