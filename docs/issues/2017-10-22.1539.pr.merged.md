@schabrolles  
from plain looking at the code (I do not have TSM) it looks good.  
In general regarding adaptions, enhancements, and fixes for TSM  
feel free to implement it as you like because you are at least  
a TSM user so that you can at least test if it works for you  
in contrast to me who cannot actually do anything with TSM.

FYI:  
If you like to get a code review from me  
you would have to explicitly set me as reviewer  
because I was only suggested by GitHub as reviewer  
(i.e. this pull request had no actual reviewer set).
