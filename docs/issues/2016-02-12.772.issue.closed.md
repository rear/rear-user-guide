The rescue image created on fedora23 boots fine, but we do no get an IP
address (via dhclient), because dhclient cannot find the shared object
file.  
The libraries are there, but the `/lib64/bind99` path is missing in
`/etc/ld.so.conf` file.

In script `build/GNU/Linux/39_copy_binaries_libraries.sh` there is a
call to `ldconfig $v -r "$ROOTFS_DIR" >&8` and it goes clearly over the
`/lib/64/bind99` libs, but did not add it the the `/etc/ld/so.conf`
file.  
Perhaps, we should skip this old fashion why of working and use the more
standard way with conf files under `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` directory?

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb)  
the recovery system could fail to boot, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494)

@gdha  
we need a better solution which results a clean recovery system.

@gdha  
I think - but that is only a guess - that in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb)  
only the new script  
rescue/GNU/Linux/550\_copy\_ldconfig.sh  
that copies the /etc/ld.so.conf\* stuff to ROOTFS  
could be sufficient to fix this issue here  
because with the ldconfig config files in ROOTFS  
the 'ldconfig' call at the end of the later  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
should "do the right thing".  
I.e. I think moving additionally the 'ldconfig' call from  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
into the init scripts of the recovery system  
into another new script  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/01-run-ldconfig.sh  
is not needed.

Furthermore I wonder why in  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/01-run-ldconfig.sh  
the 'ldconfig' call is with the '-X' option?  
What is the reason behind why ldconfig must not  
update links in the recovery system?  
What goes wrong if ldconfig also updated links?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1502](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1502)
merged  
issues like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494)  
should now be avoided while it could still work for  
special cases like this issue here because now  
a ldconfig failure is no longer a fatal error, the  
failure is only reported but it does not error out.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1521](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1521)
merged  
the whole binaries and libraries copying code is now  
cleaned up and simplified.
