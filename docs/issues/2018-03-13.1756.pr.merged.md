-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On my SLES11 and SLES12 systems.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Show descendant processes PIDs with their commands in the log  
    so that later the plain PIDs in the log get more comprehensible.  
    What works sufficiently on all systems is "pstree -Aplau
    $MASTER\_PID"  
    but the pstree command is not available in the ReaR recovery
    system  
    so that the ps command is used as fallback.

No longer a real "cleanup" because with what I ended after  
lots of trial and error on SLES10 SLES11 and SLES12 is

<pre>
Log "$( pstree -Aplau $MASTER_PID || ps f -g $MASTER_PID -o pid,args || ps --ppid $MASTER_PID -o pid,args )"
</pre>

because currently I don't know a 'ps' command that "just works" on  
SLES10 SLES11 and SLES12 to show all descendant processes.  
For details see my comments in the code.

@jsmeix code looks good and works on centos. Just one remark if I may?
Shouldn't we add `pstree` to the PROGS array?

@gdha  
if you don't mind - I would like to have pstree by default in the
recovery system  
because personally I am much used to use it regularily and missed it
already  
several times in the past in the recovery system.

Adding pstree to PROGS increases the recovery system size  
by basically only the size of the /usr/bin/pstree binary  
(which is on my SLES11 system about 23 KiB)  
because /usr/bin/pstree needs only standard libraries.

summarizing the process just changed its name, from pstree to psmisc
