If a system has logical volumes with dashes, the translation is not done
correctly from the /dev/vg/lv name to the /dev/mapper device name and
vice versa. lvmgrps with dashes are working fine.

I think the code need to be adapted on the folowing locations:

    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/33_remove_exclusions.sh:34:            vg=${dm_vg/--/-}
    /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/11_include_lvm_code.sh:98:    vg=${dm_vg/--/-}
    /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/31_remove_exclusions.sh:34:            vg=${dm_vg/--/-}
    /usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:115:                dm_vgrp=${vgrp/-/--}

Can you provide an example of what was incorrectly translated. I noticed
that for example it only replaces one instance, while we probably should
replace all instances. So it should become `vg=${dm_vg//--/-}`, but I am
not sure this is the problem you are having ?

I tested with /dev/vg-02/lv-test (/dev/mapper/vg--02-lv--test). The vg
part is correctly translated, the lv part not.  
If I rename the lv without dashes, it works correctly.  
And indeed you're right that you should translate all dashes.

@jhoekx Do you see a cause for this problem ?

Your commit af92078479daedd158ef431d6a4452baddb28e35 fixes it, no?

Just never tested with a dash in both vg and lv.

@wdpoorte Can you confirm that only this fixes it ? I thought the
problem was that the LV part was never translated.

@wdpoorte We assume that this issue is fixed now. If this is not the
case, please reopen this issue with more detailed information.

I cannot reopen (no permissions) and did not test yet (no time), but can
already say this will not fix the issue. In case of a volume group name
with more that 1 dash, this will correct this.  
If we however have a logical volume with a dash, the problem is not
fixed.

We now have this:

        name=${1#/dev/mapper/}
        dm_vg=${name%-*}
        # Device mapper doubles dashes
        vg=${dm_vg//--/-}
        lv=${name##*-}

but I think we should have this:

        name=${1#/dev/mapper/}
        dm_vg=${name%-*}
        # Device mapper doubles dashes
        vg=${dm_vg//--/-}
        dm_lv=${name##*-}
        lv=${dm_lv//--/-}
