Indeed there was an error, but the fix is not correct I'm afraid - it
should be:

    echo "btrfs_id=\$(btrfs subvolume list /mnt/local$mp | tail -1 | awk '{print \$2}')" >> $LAYOUT_CODE

Oops, sorry ! I didn't noticed that this line was redirected in the
layout recreation script, it was the end of the day.  
Do you want me to push the fix ?
