    My config is pretty basic I would image but i had this issue before
    it went away and now it came back. When I run rear -v mkbackup or
    even the mkbackuponly  
    when I get the out put "preparing archive operationOK" I never see
    the archiving status it just simple completes the task as if it
    thinks it is backing up an an empty folder or it can complete
    archiving 2TB of data in &lt;1 seconds ( dont we all wish)

-   Workaround, if any: I will report back if I can find one, I can't
    replicate this issue on my cent

So did some testing, I commented out the following and was able to start
a backup where the TAR File had data. However, i've ran a backup with
the setttings below the other day and it worked just fine granted only
once. But I am getting consistent results.

I checked my openssl version  
OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips 26 Jan 2017

Not sure why but I was able to get backups to work by changing my Crypt
Option to

BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_OPTIONS="/usr/bin/openssl aes256 -salt -k"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_DECRYPT\_OPTIONS="/usr/bin/openssl aes256 -d -k"

to who ever is reading this, me posting here isn't for me but is more or
less just to help if anyone else comes across this issue.

In default.conf there is

    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS="/usr/bin/openssl des3 -salt -k "
    BACKUP_PROG_DECRYPT_OPTIONS="/usr/bin/openssl des3 -d -k "

and that (i.e. with the default `des3` openssl cipher command)  
had "just worked" for me for my tests in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156)

On my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system with OpenSSL 1.1.0  
`man openssl` does not show any `aes*` cipher command.

I am replying since I just reopen the ticket for the same issue again. I
tried encrypting a random text file  
with openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in somefile.txt -out somefile.txt
and I was prompted for a password.

I also tried openssl enc -aes256 -salt -in somefile.txt -out
somefile.txt and it also prompted me fore a password for aes-256-cbc. I
read somewhere that aes256 = aes-256-cbc.

As far as I can tell this is my version for centos 7

@chumunga  
you need to simulate what ReaR does  
i.e. you need to try it out in the same way as ReaR calls it.

For BACKUP=NETFS with BACKUP\_PROG=tar see  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

                $BACKUP_PROG $TAR_OPTIONS --sparse --block-number --totals --verbose    \
                    --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system                        \
                    --ignore-failed-read "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}"                    \
                    $BACKUP_PROG_CREATE_NEWER_OPTIONS                                   \
                    ${BACKUP_PROG_BLOCKS:+-b $BACKUP_PROG_BLOCKS}                       \
                    "${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}"                                \
                    -X $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt -C / -c -f -                         \
                    $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) $RUNTIME_LOGFILE |               \
                { $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY ; } 2>/dev/null |   \
                $SPLIT_COMMAND

and  
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh

                        dd if=$restore_input | { $BACKUP_PROG_DECRYPT_OPTIONS $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY ; } 2>/dev/null | $BACKUP_PROG --block-number --totals --verbose "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}" "${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}" -C $TARGET_FS_ROOT/ -x -f -

i.e. within a pipe and with a specified key.

E.g. in your case do something like

    cat somefile.in | openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -k testing_key | cat - 1>somefile.aes-256-cbc

and

    cat somefile.aes-256-cbc | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -k testing_key | cat - 1>somefile.out

For comparison how it works on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system  
with OpenSSL 1.1.0 with the `des3` openssl cipher command:

    # echo Hello >somefile.in

    # cat somefile.in | openssl des3 -salt -k testing_key | cat - >somefile.des3

    # cat somefile.des3 | openssl des3 -d -k testing_key | cat - >somefile.out

    # file somefile.*
    somefile.des3: openssl enc'd data with salted password
    somefile.in:   ASCII text
    somefile.out:  ASCII text

    # diff -s somefile.in somefile.out
    Files somefile.in and somefile.out are identical

I think I figured it out. I tried your test jsmeix and it worked fine
for me, the problem was my password.

My password was something like this

BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY="$SOMEPASS"  
also tried  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY=$SOMEPASS

The problem here was I believe I am passing a script a variable that has
no value, openssl won't accept a no password, thur output a 0 byte file.

so ultimately what resolved it for me was either single quote OR don't
start a password with $. And I believe if you use either above you will
get the same results I was.

For me this worked and repeatable  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY='$SOMEPASS'  
or  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY=SOMEPASS

Sorry if this is very obvious and I waste time, hopefully someone sees
this and doesn't fall in the same stupidity i did.

@chumunga  
thank you for your explanatory information  
what the root cause was in your particular case.  
Such feedback helps us a lot because otherwise we wonder  
if there is perhaps some obscure bug somewhere in ReaR.

For the fun of it:  
Regarding special characters in passwords you may have a look at the
section  
"Use non-ASCII characters in usernames and passwords to lock yourself
out" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)

Perhaps I should add a section about passwords  
that contain executable scripting code like

    my super $( rm -rf ) password

;-)

I think I could add a test to avoid an empty password  
according to "Try to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Of course this does not help against problematic characters  
in passwords (i.e. special bash characters) like

    # password="foo$bar"
    # echo $password
    foo

    # password='foo'bar'baz'
    # echo $password
    foobarbaz

@jsmeix Thank you! Really appreciate you guys!

Suggestion, maybe there is a way to encapsulate the password in single
quotes so it becomes literal. However, ultimately I think if the
default.conf file should states explicitly about the password's format
as well as syntax this should be enough for any conscious admin. There
comes a point you can't JUST google it ( I hope this day never comes)

@chumunga  
there are still some more things wrong with the code in ReaR  
that deals with BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY.  
I will fix it as time permits...

For now use a BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY value without  
special characters or spaces to avoid unexpected weird effects...

My
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178)
intends to make  
the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY handling code more fail safe.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178)
merged  
the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY handling should be more fail safe.

Special characters in the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY  
value should now work, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178\#issuecomment-509558118](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2178#issuecomment-509558118)  
but to be in general on the safe side it is still not recommended  
to use special characters in values.
