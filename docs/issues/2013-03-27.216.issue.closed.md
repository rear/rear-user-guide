[\#216 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/216) `closed`: Excluding a folder in a rear backup
====================================================================================================

I've been perusing the docs and have not come up with a solution yet. I
am trying to exclude a folder that contains a large amount of logs. Here
is what I have in the local.conf.

ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( VolGroup00 )  
EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS=( "fs:/usr/openv/logs/nbftsrvr" )

So far this does not work. I am not sure if the order matters, or if I
am using the wrong exclude directive. Any insight is greatly
appreciated.

`EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS` only works for real system components like
filesystems or logical volumes. If you just want to exclude a directory
you have to use the BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE array.

Cool. I will do that. I was about to try that, but I just wasn't sure. I
also thought about just trying EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS even though it
technically is not.

Can you show us the `local.conf` you're using? To make sure the
`BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE` syntax is OK.

Holding off for a sec. I may have spoken too soon.

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://some_server/rear/"
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=1
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( VolGroup00 )

I just added single quotes to BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=(
'/usr/openv/logs/nbftsrvr' ). trying again.

The line is not entirely correct. It should be:

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/usr/openv/logs/nbftsrvr' )

You could also try running rear with the `-d` switch. In you
/tmp/rear-XXX/ folder should be a `backup-exclude.txt` file. It's in tar
exclude syntax. That's an interesting file to share.

I checked the file and it contains /usr/openv/logs/nbftsrvr.

The file is sent to tar as-is. Maybe try `/usr/openv/logs/nbftsrvr/*`?

File is now showing /usr/openv/logs/nbftsrvr/\*. I am running rear
again.

Did not work.

I just tailed the backup.log file and saw that it is not copying those
files. So it is working. Looks like I may be backing up something else
that is making the archive rather large. Thanks for your help.

Yep. even though I have ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( VolGroup00 ), it was backing
up a san attached volume. I added it to the exclude list.
