@rear/contributors I'm not bothering you guys with review requests as
this is really just a minimalist change to code ...

I did not merge right ahead just because it don't feel right to me
process-wise.  
@gdha normally I'd merge is on Monday afternoon, but due
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1596\#issuecomment-347919815](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1596#issuecomment-347919815)
you can merge it earlyer if suitable.
