(excerpt)

    I did a "rear recover" test on my laptop
    ...
    the recreated system can no longer boot from its built-in /dev/sda
    (the BIOS tells that an operating system needs to be installed on the disk)
    but it can be booted from the USB disk ReaR recovery system bootloader
    in its syslinux boot menue by selecting `Boot Local disk (hd1)`
    so something on the built-in /dev/sda got lost or damaged by "rear recover"
    that is needed by that laptop's firmware (UEFI capable firmware that I use
    in legacy BIOS mode) to boot.

-   Workaround, if any:

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2299\#issuecomment-564933720](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2299#issuecomment-564933720)  
(excerpt)

    The missing piece on /dev/sda that got destroyed by "rear recover"
    was the enabled boot flag on the GPTâ€™s protective MBR partition, cf.
    https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_node/disk_005fset.html
    ...
    (parted) disk_set pmbr_boot on
    ...
    The difference is `Disk Flags:` empty which does not work
    versus `Disk Flags: pmbr_boot` which is needed
    at least by my UEFI firmware that I use in legacy BIOS mode
    to boot from a GPT disk with GRUB2 installed "in MBR"

Accordingly the following POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
in etc/rear/local.conf helped in my case:

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
    PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS=3
    KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
    GRUB_RESCUE=y
    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_SUFFIX="ReaRbackup"
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=10
    POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( 'parted -s /dev/sda disk_set pmbr_boot on' )

I think what is actually needed is support for parted `Disk Flags`.

E.g. on my original system I have

    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print

    Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 20480MiB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags: pmbr_boot
    ...

but after "rear recover" I get on the recreated system

    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print

    Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 20480MiB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags:
    ...

i.e. no longer any `Disk Flags`.

@jsmeix I think that this bug is important for many systems.  
You should reopen it because it was closed by github-bot.  
I also use some systems with the BIOS and GPT partition format with
pmbr\_boot flag.

@gdha Could we reopen this bug or better said feature for ReaR?
