-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

I've added the correct variables to allow non-interactive authentication
using rsync protocol. Now, one can use RSYNC\_OPTIONS to authenticate
using the "--password-file=/full/path/to/file" rsync's option.

I already fixed the missing username when rsync protocol at checking
stage.

@ivarmu Why did you not use the `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS` variable to add
your additional option `--password-file=/full/path/to/file`? You could
accomplish this in the `local.conf` file:  
For example:

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" --password-file=/full/path/to/file )

If the above works then this PR is not required anymore.

If I remember correctly, the first steps involve a simple ssh/rsync  
conection to check connectivity, and as per this step, I think  
BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS is not the most convenient variable to be used.

What do you think?

Thanks!

@ivarmu I believe if we can enhance script
`usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/default/100_check_rsync.sh` a bit so it
recognizes (and extract what it needs, like the `--password-file`
option) the variable `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS` we can reduces this PR to
the bare minimum. Please give it a try.  
Thanks.

I am not a `rsync` user ( I use only `tar`)  
so that I cannot review the details here.

In general:

When we already have a config variable for a particular  
kind of functionality (BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS in this case)  
we should try to avoid adding more config variables for the same  
functionality (i.e. adding RSYNC\_OPTIONS in this case)  
unless several separated config variables for the same functionality  
are needed to configure several separated parts of that functionality.

But then the config variables must have meaningful separated names  
to make it clear to the user how the usage of the config variables
differs  
(e.g. see the `USER_INPUT_*` config variable names).

In this case it means if two config variables are needed here  
their current names BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS and RSYNC\_OPTIONS  
look confusing to me because I cannot see how their usage differs, cf.  
`Variables and functions must have names that explain what they do, even if it makes them longer`
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

To me it looks as if RSYNC\_OPTIONS specifies generic options  
that are used for all `rsync` calls in ReaR while  
BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS specifies additional options that are  
only used for making the backup with `rsync` and for restoring it.

But the current changes here do not apply RSYNC\_OPTIONS  
to all `rsync` calls in ReaR so that this config variable must be  
named more specifically according to what its actual usage is,  
e.g. RSYNC\_CONNECTION\_CHECK\_OPTIONS according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2011\#issuecomment-450359947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2011#issuecomment-450359947)  
if that is really the actual usage of that config variable.

By the way:

I wonder how making the backup with `rsync` and restoring it  
works without the `--password-file=/full/path/to/file` option  
when that option is needed for the rsync connection check  
(but I am no rsync user).

A side note FWIW:

What even more confuses me is that we have in default.conf (excerpts):

<pre>
BACKUP_OPTIONS=
...
# NOTE: The BACKUP_* variables relate to ALL builtin backup methods !
# (NETFS, ISO, TAPE ...)
BACKUP_PROG=tar
...
BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( "--anchored" )
...
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( --gzip )
...
BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=(--sparse --archive --hard-links --numeric-ids --stats)
</pre>

It seems we got from the past some mess with our `BACKUP_*`  
config variable names that should be cleaned up first of all.  
But we cannot change config variable names because  
that would cause regressions for our users.

Hi all,

as per I can see, RSYNC\_OPTIONS is already defined somewhere at rear
code and translated to BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS at
[/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0baabfb1e3d93d15476f0d9977fae65c86c53349/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020_translate_url.sh#L20)

    grep -n RSYNC_OPTIONS /usr/share/rear/prep/default/020_translate_url.sh
    25:if [[ "$RSYNC_OPTIONS" ]] ; then
    26:    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=$RSYNC_OPTIONS

Anyway, we are only talking about a variable name and it's related
documentation, so I'm changing the PR to use BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS
instead RSYNC\_OPTIONS, although I think we should make that two
concepts differentiated, as commented by @jsmeix .

I'm introducing another change to the rsync checkings, concretely I've
changed the behaviour of --fake-root on rsync protocol versions &lt; 29,
as it may not return an error it the option is not used at all.

@ivarmu  
a side note:  
In ReaR we have the `IsInArray ( needle hayblade1 hayblade2 ... )`
function  
(its name is misleading because it does not expand an array variable,  
see the implementation in usr/share/rear/lib/array-functions.sh)  
so that you could instead of

    if [ ${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]/--fake-super/} != ${BACKUP_RSUNC_OPTIONS[@]} ]; then

use

    if IsInArray "--fake-super" "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" ; then

@ivarmu  
FYI regarding RSYNC\_OPTIONS =&gt; BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20b214db4d8142814ec9c38536f93d40ef46645d](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20b214db4d8142814ec9c38536f93d40ef46645d)  
i.e. RSYNC\_OPTIONS is outdated and should no longer be used  
because nowadays it is BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS and  
the related code in usr/share/rear/prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh  
is only there to provide some backward compatibility.

Nice @jsmeix. I've changed all the needed files (I'm pushing a new
commit) and use only the BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS. I'm already loging the
obsolescence of RSYNC\_OPTIONS at 020\_translate\_url.sh file.

@ivarmu  
instead of only a log message

    Log "Using RSYNC_OPTIONS is deprecated ...

I would also tell the user on his terminal about it via

    LogUserOutput "Using RSYNC_OPTIONS is deprecated ...

or as you like via LogPrintError (that won't exit as the `Error`
function does)

    LogPrintError "Using RSYNC_OPTIONS is deprecated ...

see the LogUserOutput and LogPrintError and their  
base functions like UserOutput and PrintError in

@gdha  
perhaps nitpicking in practice but at least out of curiosity:  
In usr/share/rear/prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh I wonder about

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=$RSYNC_OPTIONS

shouldn't that better be something like

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" $RSYNC_OPTIONS ) 

so that the BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS from default.conf are kept?  
I don't know what the meaning/usage of RSYNC\_OPTIONS was.  
Could it have been also an array?

I don't know what the meaning/usage of RSYNC\_OPTIONS was, too, as it
existed previously and that is my first PR on ReaR code. I agree with
you, but think maybe there's a reason to stay like that... isn't that
supposed to let "site.conf" (for example) to override the defaults? That
could be an explanation. Doesn't matter if it could be an array or not,
as bash interpretes both as well.

Regarding my last comment, a correct option would be:

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( ${RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]} )

but it does'nt matter if one do:

    RSYNC_OPTIONS="--password_file=/tmp/file"
    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=${RSYNC_OPTIONS}
    rsync ${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]} bla bla bla

That would work as well.

@ivarmu  
it does matter if a variable is an array or not, e.g. see:

    # BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( this that 'something else' )

    # RSYNC_OPTIONS=( 'foo bar' baz )

    # for e in "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'this'
    'that'
    'something else'

    # for e in "${RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'foo bar'
    'baz'

    # BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=$RSYNC_OPTIONS

    # for e in "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'foo bar'
    'that'
    'something else'

    # BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( this that 'something else' )

    # BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" "${RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" )

    # for e in "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'this'
    'that'
    'something else'
    'foo bar'
    'baz'

In general using ${VAR\[\*\]} is problematic and using ${VAR\[@\]}
without  
double-quotes is also problematic, see 'Arrays' in "man bash" and  
see the initial comment in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf and  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068)
for some examples.

I think `RSYNC_OPTIONS` variable was probably not an array in the
beginning (that is my guess). And, to be honest I did not know it was
still there (now I understand why @ivarmu used that variable in the
first place).  
I would propose to remove the variable completely from ReaR itself as it
is OLD and obsolete.

Yes, I Know that, but I can't find any code at ReaR looping through the
BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS as would be expected for an array to be managed
(you can "grep -R BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS" and see no for/while/do is
involved).

Anyway... RSYNC\_OPTIONS is obsoleted... so I'm happy with the current
assignation, as had been working since today... I can change it to the
following if you prefer...

`BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( ${RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]} )`

Perfectly fine with me to remove RSYNC\_OPTIONS support.

The only place where it appears is in
prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh

But I would not like to let users who may still use RSYNC\_OPTIONS  
from ancient times in their local.conf learn the hard way by obscure
failures  
that RSYNC\_OPTIONS is no longer supported.

Therefore I suggest to replace in prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh

    if [[ "$RSYNC_OPTIONS" ]] ; then
        BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=$RSYNC_OPTIONS
    fi

with

    test "$RSYNC_OPTIONS" && Error "RSYNC_OPTIONS is no longer supported. Use BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS instead."

FWIW, I find prefixing the variable with `BACKUP_` to be important, so
that `rear dump` will show it.

I find it important that `rear dump` provides all relevant information.

@ivarmu  
thank you for your contribution to ReaR  
and for your patience with us!

Apparently you touched older code so that  
things became more complicated than expected  
but it was also a starting point for further improvements  
like

A a result of this PR there are now some places where
`${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}` is in the rsync command line in case of
`RSYNC_PROTO=rsync` but not for `RSYNC_PROTO=ssh`. Is that intentional?

Also, I am surprised that `${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}` was not needed
here:

have you tested restoring with rsync and non-interactive authentication?
