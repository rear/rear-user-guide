Thanks!

@jsmeix

It is better described in
[BORG/default/250\_mount\_usb.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/aa7b1979c347a3800959d757f7ce485fc10bd788/usr/share/rear/prep/BORG/default/250_mount_usb.sh)

    # We need to mount USB_DEVICE in order to prepare for Borg archive
    # initialization, but only if BORGBACKUP_HOST is not set.
    # When BORGBACKUP_HOST is set, we don't need to mount anything as SSH
    # backup destination will be handled internally by Borg it self.

so your guess

> I guess whether or not BORGBACKUP\_HOST is empty is used

is right!
