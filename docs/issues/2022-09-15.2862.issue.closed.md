reads as of now (excerpt)

    FOSDEM 2023 will take place on Saturday 4th and Sunday 5th
    of February 2023. We are aiming for a physical conference. 

@rear/contributors  
I would like to ask you if you are interested  
to meet in person on FOSDEM 2023?

Perhaps you already intend to attend FOSDEM 2023 because of  
other reasons so we could meet in person "by the way"?

Of course the precondition is that FOSDEM 2023  
will be actually a physical conference.

In the past (i.e. up to 2020) FOSDEM took place at the  
"ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium, Europe, Earth"  
cf. [https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/)

@jsmeix When FOSDEM 2023 stays a physical conference I will come at
least one day.

Hello!  
Yes we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the project, and with a
stand in FOSDEM'23 is going to be great! Hopefully we can meet there
this year after all the "*coronafuck*"...
