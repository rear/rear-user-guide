This is our only SLES12 SP4 LPAR so we don't have all the information to

See in usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh  
the mount\_url() function therein the (iso) case, e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh\#L376](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L376)  
that explains the reason behind and URLs to other issues like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891)  
that was from you and seems to be the same one as this issue here,  
in particular there also networking issues were mentioned.

Perhaps without networking the mount\_url() function cannot work  
in your case but I don't know where the ISO is attached to in your case.

The reason why the /etc/rear/local.conf wasn't included was that we
couldn't restore the ISO backup and the system cannot get booted up.

In hindsight, we could have gotten the local.conf if we access the
Rescue shell. We were in panic mode.

The question we have is:  
Is Rear supported for SLES12 SP4 on Power?

We would need to do more testing on a system that was migrated from
SLES12 SP3 to SLES12 SP4 to see if we can restore at SLES12 SP4 level .

Here is the background of the problem:

1.  System built from base SLES12 SP4 DVD ISO  
    Cannot restore using Rear and and and the workaround in \#2019
    didn't work.

    ##   NOTE:  If no ouput from multipath -r re-run the 2 udevadm commands
    ##          Also, there might not always be 4 paths

1.  Restore SLES12 SP3 Rear backup and migrated to SLES12 SP4 to get the
    system up since the Rear backup of SLES12 SP4 didn't work. We need
    to test if this restore from a SLES12 SP4 migrated system will work.

Here are the info gathered from the system that was migrated from SLES12
SP3 to SLES12 SP4:  
The /etc/rear/local.conf was the same file we used on a base SLES12 SP4
system and a migrated SLES12 SP4 system:
