-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): latest

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): all

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"): n/a

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): all

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): all

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): all

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): all

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
    Not an issue but an improvement suggestion.

I propose the addition of a new workflow called 'mountonly' whose goal
would be, based on the system layout created during 'mkrescue' or
'mkbackup', to simply mount the filesystems of a possibly broken but
repairable system without altering them in any way, the ReaR rescue
image being used as a mini "live distribution" in this case. This would
then give the administrator an ideal starting place to try and repair
that system manually, either by editing files from the ReaR rescue
media, or by `chroot`ing into the now mounted system.

This 'mountonly' workflow would, in essence, mimic a functionality
provided inside the "MondoRescue" suite of tools by the `mount-me`script
(only better, of course ;-) ).

This proposal had already been discussed on the mailing list with
@jsmeix back in March.

A working draft implementation of this feature is already available,
that among others successfully mounts LUKS-encrypted filesystems as well
as the most important virtual filesystems, allowing for immediate
`chroot` into the target system if needed.

I'll now create a branch for it based on this issue, so that everyone
can review it.

**Please note:** workflow name was initially proposed `repair` but later
renamed to `mountonly` at @jsmeix suggestion.

@petroniusniger Thank you - looking forward to the PR already ;-)

What had been discussed on the rear-users mailing list back in March  
was the `ReaR rescue ISO as "live distribution"?` mail thread on

@petroniusniger  
I look forward to your contribution to ReaR!

Perhaps - if time permits - I can reuse parts of your code  
to get the tree of filesystems mounted at /mnt/local  
as the main missing piece to implement a backup restore workflow  
that can work on its own:
