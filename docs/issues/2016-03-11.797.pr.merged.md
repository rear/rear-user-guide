in 10\_include\_partition\_code.sh call partprobe in a backward
compatible and fail safe way, see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793)

Tested on SLES12-SP1 where it still works for me.

After recovery I have in the recovered system in
/var/log/rear/recover/rear-f197.log (excerpts):

<pre>
++ . /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
...
+++ udevadm settle
+++ sleep 1
+++ partprobe -s /dev/sda
/dev/sda: msdos partitions 1 2
+++ my_udevtrigger
</pre>

I.e. for me partprobe "just works" (as it always did) so that I cannot
actually verify if my fail safe way really works (but at least it
seems  
it is still really backward compatible).
