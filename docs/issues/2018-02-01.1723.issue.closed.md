Can you run `rear -d -D mkbackup` and attach here your log file from
/var/log/rear/ directory?

I've attached the log, as requested. I've redacted the machine name and
various IP addresses, but it is otherwise the complete log.

Thanks for responding.

Hi @shellster,  
There is something wrong with your installation of ReaR.  
In the attached log it reads
`Relax-and-Recover 2.2-git.2688.3ad23a02.master.changed` which is OK.  
What is wrong however, are script prefix numbers which change in ReaR
&gt;= 2.0 from 2 to 3 digits.  
E.g.  
You have currently two versions of *\*copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh*:

    39_copy_binaries_libraries.sh
    and
    390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh

Looks like you've just extracted tar ball with ReaR 2.2 over ReaR &lt;
2.0.  
To fix this you should completely remove directory */usr/share/rear*
directory and extract tar ball (with ReaR 2.2) again.  
After this, your strange error should disappear.

V.

FWIW:  
The special BinCopyTo() function in the global lib/linux-functions.sh
was replaced  
by the specific copy\_binaries() in
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/54f2c451acee47fbefb9a3ac87222866562dc7fc](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/54f2c451acee47fbefb9a3ac87222866562dc7fc)

Of course a mix-up of old and new ReaR scripts fails in arbitrary ways.

@gozora  
many thanks for the analysis what the root cause of this issue is.

@shellster

FYI:

How you could test the current ReaR GitHub master code  
without get things messed up with an already installed ReaR  
(e.g. as software package from a Linux distribution):

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

Thank you guys for your help. Deleting all the copies and checking out
the latest github version fixed that error. It's still failing on a
completely new error, but at least it closes this issue.
