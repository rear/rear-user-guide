Can it be, that */usr/share/rear* is symlink somewhere, on your original
system?

It is not (borg is `/usr/sbin/borg -> /path/to/borg-linux64`)

At the first sight, it looks like you are missing */usr/share/rear*
directory in you ReaR recovery system, but based on provided data I
can't tell why.  
@gaia maybe try to correctly fill [ReaR issue
template](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new) and someone might
have an idea what is wrong...

it is missing from the rescue disk

is there a variable that needs to be set correctly for it to be
included? IMHO it should be included no matter what

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf")
-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Normally */usr/share/rear/* is included by
[COPY\_AS\_IS](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1224)
in
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
Since I've already removed your *local.conf* from previous issue, and
you did not provided any for this issue, I'll do again a blind guess
...  
Is there a chance that you've somehow set/reset COPY\_AS\_IS variable in
your *local.conf*/*site.conf* ?
