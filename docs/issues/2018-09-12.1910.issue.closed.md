    # Begin example setup for SLE12-SP2 with default btrfs subvolumes.
    # Since SLE12-SP1 what is mounted at '/' is a btrfs snapshot subvolume
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556
    # and since SLE12-SP2 btrfs quota via "snapper setup-quota" is needed
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/999
    # You must adapt "your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup" at BACKUP_URL.
    # You must decide whether or not you want to have /home/* in the backup.
    # It depends on the size of your harddisk whether or not /home is by default
    # a btrfs subvolume or a separated xfs filesystem on a separated partition.
    # You may activate SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD and adapt the "password_on_the_rear_recovery_system".
    # For basic information see the SLE12-SP2 manuals.
    # Also see the support database article "SDB:Disaster Recovery"
    # at http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery
    # In particular note:
    # There is no such thing as a disaster recovery solution that "just works".
    # Regarding btrfs snapshots:
    # Recovery of btrfs snapshot subvolumes is not possible.
    # Only recovery of "normal" btrfs subvolumes is possible.
    # On SLE12-SP1 and SP2 the only exception is the btrfs snapshot subvolume
    # that is mounted at '/' but that one is not recreated but instead
    # it is created anew from scratch during the recovery installation with the
    # default first btrfs snapper snapshot subvolume path "@/.snapshots/1/snapshot"
    # by the SUSE tool "installation-helper --step 1" (cf. below).
    # Other snapshots like "@/.snapshots/234/snapshot" are not recreated.
    # Create rear recovery system as ISO image:
    OUTPUT=USB
    #OUTPUT=ISO
    # Store the backup file via NFS on a NFS server:
    BACKUP=NETFS
    #BACKUP=DP
    # BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the NFS mount options and
    # with 'mount -o nolock' no rpc.statd (plus rpcbind) are needed:
    #BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    # If the NFS server is not an IP address but a hostname,
    # DNS must work in the rear recovery system when the backup is restored.
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    # Keep an older copy of the backup in a HOSTNAME.old directory
    # provided there is no '.lockfile' in the HOSTNAME directory:
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes
    # Have all modules of the original system in the recovery system with the
    # same module loading ordering as in the original system by using the output of
    #   lsmod | tail -n +2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | tac | tr -s '[:space:]' ' '

    # On SLE12-SP1 and SP2 with default btrfs subvolumes what is mounted at '/' is a btrfs snapshot subvolume
    # that is controlled by snapper so that snapper is needed in the recovery system.
    # In SLE12-SP1 and SP2 some btrfs subvolume directories (/var/lib/pgsql /var/lib/libvirt/images /var/lib/mariadb)
    # have the "no copy on write (C)" file attribute set so that chattr is required in the recovery system
    # and accordingly also lsattr is useful to have in the recovery system (but not strictly required):
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" snapper chattr lsattr )
    # Snapper setup by the recovery system uses /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper
    # that is linked to all libraries where snapper is linked to
    # (except libdbus that is only needed by snapper).
    # "installation-helper --step 1" creates a snapper config based on /etc/snapper/config-templates/default
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )
    # Files in btrfs subvolumes are excluded by 'tar --one-file-system'
    # so that such files must be explicitly included to be in the backup.
    # Files in the following SLE12-SP2 default btrfs subvolumes are
    # in the below example not included to be in the backup
    #   /.snapshots  /var/crash
    # but files in /home are included to be in the backup.

    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    UEFI

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    OS installed in the local disk. Also, have SAN disks (3PAR)

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I have faced issue during the recovery, one of its directory
    (/oracle/client) was not restored as part of the recovery procedure.
    We need this directory to be backed up for the second node two.
    details mentioned below.  
    Configuration:  
    `/oracle/client` ----&gt; This is under local disk (/dev/sda3) for
    node2 server , this directory is required for the SAP application.
    Using Service guard cluster server.  
    Whereas for node 1 (active server) this directory (/oracle/client)
    is on SAN disk (3PAR).

`/oracle/` -----&gt; This directory is also set in the rear's exclude
list because SAN disks are presented to both nodes, therefore, we do not
want to delete or restore any data on SAN disk (3PAR).

May you suggest us what is the correct include and exclude lists for
this configuration. My requirement is to backup /oracle/client only for
the second node server.

-   Work-around, if any:

@manums1983  
I have no personal experience with SAN storage  
which is probably the reason why I do not understand  
your description of your disk layout on your two systems.

Nevertheless FYI some general basic info  
(which might be totally unrelated to your actual issue here):

In ReaR the word "backup" usually means what the backup tool  
does that creates a backup of the files (usually `tar`).

You can include/exclude things related to the backup tool  
and you can include/exclude things related to the disk layout  
where the latter is about "components" (e.g. disks, partitions,  
filesystems and things like that) i.e. things that are kept  
in ReaR's `disklayout.conf` file.

When you have different systems with different disk layouts  
you need usually to use different ReaR config files when  
you need to include or exclude different things.

There are some automatisms in ReaR regarding  
including or excluding things.  
To avoid those automatisms regarding what is included  
in the backup you can use the config variables  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
when you use `tar` for the backup, see the `default.conf` file.  
Other automatisms cannot be changed, e.g. when you  
exclude one partition all other partitions on its disk  
get also automatically excluded, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1771](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1771)

Because you use ReaR 2.3 I like to mention  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767)  
which is about bugs in ReaR 2.3 related to excluding things.  
To avoid that you are hit by those issues I would recommend  
to try out if ReaR version 2.4 works better for you, cf.

Because "no news is good news"  
I assume the issue was sufficiently answered.

Sorry, I forgot to update my issue is corrected. Thanks for the tech
notes.
