Hello all,

This pull request is for issue \#1030 (add support for Borg Backup).  
It was tested on following distros, with [latest stable Borg release
1.0.7](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases/tag/1.0.7):

</table>

I'll update documentation soon, for now here are some hits on setup:

1.  [Borg installation
    manual](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
    recommends to install Borg to */usr/local/bin*. I'd however
    recommend to use /usr/sbin instead, due reasons mentioned in point
    one [in
    comment](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030#issuecomment-252999929).
2.  Before using ReaR with Borg, setup ssh keys for user that will be
    running backup. In other words, issuing following command must work
    without any password prompts or remote host identity confirmation.  
    `ssh <borg_user>@<borg_server>`
3.  I've used following configuration to make Borg work with ReaR:

<!-- -->

    BACKUP=BORG
    OUTPUT=ISO

    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://<server_to_store_backups>/mnt/rear/iso
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} /mnt /test/exclude )

    BORG_HOST=<server_to_store_backups>
    BORG_USERNAME=root
    BORG_REPO=/mnt/rear/borg/$HOSTNAME
    BORG_PRUNE_WEEKLY=2

    GRUB_RESCUE=n

    #BTRFS stuff
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" snapper chattr lsattr )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )

In usr/share/rear/restore/BORG/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh  
I found hardcoded 'mnt/local'.  
Nowadays $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT should be used, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708\#issuecomment-184246702](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708#issuecomment-184246702)  
unless there is a good reason why hardcoded 'mnt/local'  
must be used in your particular case.

In your documentation you sometimes write "borg"  
and sometimes "Borg",  
cf.
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg)
that reads:

<pre>
BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
</pre>

Didn't know about TARGET\_FS\_ROOT... I'll correct it.  
Maybe I could update
[09-design-concepts.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc#inter-module-communication)
as well?

I've try to used "borg" (small 'b') when referencing command and Borg
(capital 'B') everywhere else. I'll review documentation one more time.

Thanks for your inputs.

If @gdha does not object, I will merge it tomorrow.

FYI: I missed  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc\#inter-module-communication](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc#inter-module-communication)  
because 'mnt/local' was not mentioned at that place and I only  
checked all places where 'mnt/local' was already used.

@jsmeix , @gdha  
Did you noticed my change in
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/10\_copy\_as\_is.sh ?

    > cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/. $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/ >&2

    < cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/ >&2
    < cp $v -r $CONFIG_DIR/.[a-z]* $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/ >&2

Do you think it is safe?

@gozora sure no problem with copying dot files (already did the same for
CIFS in 1.19) to initrd rootfs

@gozora Now that you got a fresh integration in your fingertips why
don't you update the
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/10-integrating-external-backup.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/10-integrating-external-backup.adoc)

[10-integrating-external-backup.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/10-integrating-external-backup.adoc)
looks fine for me. Unfortunately I've discovered it after coding was
done (typical me ...).  
Do you have some some specific part that needs to be updated on your
mind? Because it looks to be quite accurate to me.

@gozora No, I was wondering if it could be improved then now was the
right moment to update it so it makes more sense for (new) developers.
However, if it is OK for you then it I'm glad to hear that.

@ThomasWaldmann And one more thanks for all the typos corrections. I'm
obviously lost without spellchecker!

@gozora  
don't worry about a spellchecker - I could read it well without  
noticing all those typos - I'm obviously running some kind of  
silently working full automated autocorrection in my mind ;-)

@jsmeix :-) I basically don't, but @ThomasWaldmann gave me wake up call,
and I realized how much work is actually done by spell checker for me!  
Before I didn't even think of how many mistakes I'm doing ...  
I need to be more careful.

@gozora only a side note:  
What I would like to have is an  
actually useful "spell checker" for bash  
(not only the simple "bash -n" syntax check)  
that could detect bugs like

<pre>
CLEANUP_COMMAND="..."
... || $CLEANUP_C0MMAND
</pre>

Even with "set -eu" the bug would usually not appear  
during runtime (assuming the cleanup is usually not needed).  
I know that it is impossible to really validate a bash script  
but I would be already happy if I had some basic testing  
and get warnings for some usual things that "look suspicious".

@jsmeix heh, this might be tricky one, I guess you are looking for
similar functionality like gcc have, which reports unused variable and
(static) functions ...

@alxgu  
many thanks for the hint!

Some time ago I had a look at ShellCheck  
but as it is written in Haskell I did not try to  
compile it on my own.  
But now it seems there are ready-made packages  
available for some recent openSUSE systems:

<pre>
$ osc search ShellCheck | grep ^openSUSE
openSUSE:Backports:SLE-12         ShellCheck
openSUSE:Factory                  ShellCheck
openSUSE:Leap:42.2                ShellCheck
$ osc results -v devel:languages:haskell ShellCheck | grep succeeded
openSUSE_Leap_42.1   x86_64     succeeded
openSUSE_Factory_PowerPC_standard ppc64le    succeeded
openSUSE_Factory_PowerPC_standard ppc64      succeeded
openSUSE_13.2_Ports_ppc ppc64le    succeeded
openSUSE_13.2_Ports_ppc ppc64      succeeded
openSUSE_13.2        i586       succeeded
openSUSE_13.2        x86_64     succeeded
SLE_12_SP1_Backports ppc64le    succeeded
SLE_12_SP1_Backports x86_64     succeeded
SLE_12_Backports     ppc64le    succeeded
SLE_12_Backports     x86_64     succeeded
</pre>

I will try it out soon...

@ThomasWaldmann maybe one more off topic question. Is there any
difference in doing:  
`borg delete TARGET` and `rm -rf TARGET` ?

yes, it also deletes the .cache/borg/id. see borg delete --help.
