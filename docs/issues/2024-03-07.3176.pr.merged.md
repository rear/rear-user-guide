##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): N/A

-   How was this pull request tested? Recovery of Fedora Rawhide UEFI
    machine.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The idea is to find all direct partitions that contain the ESP mount
point and to skip all other transitive `fs:` dependencies.

The `diskdeps.conf` file contains following entries on default Fedora
installations (the list was shortened to only the relevant ones):

    /dev/vda1 /dev/vda
    /dev/vda4 /dev/vda
    /dev/vda5 /dev/vda
    fs:/boot/efi /dev/vda1
    fs:/boot/efi fs:/boot
    fs:/boot/efi fs:/
    fs:/boot/efi btrfsmountedsubvol:/
    fs:/boot /dev/vda4
    fs:/boot fs:/
    fs:/boot btrfsmountedsubvol:/
    fs:/ /dev/vda5
    btrfsmountedsubvol:/ /dev/vda5

The ESP partition is only on `/dev/vda1`. However, the `find_partition`
call  
was not taking into account the need to skip mounted btrfs subvolumes as
well.  
Therefore, `/dev/vda5` was listed as an ESP partition as well.

This change makes sure that only direct ESP partitions are listed and  
fixes a bug where ReaR would create broken BootXXXX entries which point
to  
completely unrelated partitions.

Relevant excerpts from logs:

    ++ efibootmgr --create --gpt --disk /dev/vda --part 1 --write-signature --label 'RedHatEnterpriseServer 41' --loader '\EFI\fedora\grubx64.efi'
    ...
    ++ efibootmgr --create --gpt --disk /dev/vda --part 5 --write-signature --label 'RedHatEnterpriseServer 41' --loader '\EFI\fedora\grubx64.efi'

> disktodo.conf contains following entries

ITYM `diskdeps.conf`, `disktodo.conf` has a different format. Please fix
also the commit message.

Can you please show an example if you have saved it somewhere?

Thank you, @pcahyna! I've fixed the typo as I meant the `diskdeps.conf`
file and amended the commit message with the creation of those
`BootXXXX` entries.

thank you a lot for the fix and for providing an example of the buggy
behavior!

Only a side question FYI:

I am wondering why the ESP kernel device node  
is determined so indirectly.

Do you know if there is a reason why not  
something like 'lsblk' is used to get directly  
the partition kernel device node  
that matches a mount point?

E.g. on a running system  
(my homeoffice workstation):

    # lsblk -nrpo PKNAME,KNAME,MOUNTPOINT | grep '/boot/efi'
    /dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi

I don't use the SUSE btrfs structure  
so I don't have mounted btrfs subvolumes.

I assume 'lsblk' cannot be used here because  
we are in the recovery system (in 'finalize' stage)  
and need the ESP partition of the recreated system  
below /mnt/local where the ESP is perhaps not mounted  
so we need to determine it from the diskdeps.conf file?

Or why not directly from disklayout.conf?

E.g. on my homeoffice workstation (excerpt):

    # Format: part <device> <partition size(bytes)> <partition start(bytes)> <partition type|name> <flags> /dev/<partition>
    part /dev/nvme0n1 535822336 1048576 rear-noname boot,esp /dev/nvme0n1p1

I.e. why indirectly via the ESP mount point  
than directly the ESP 'part' entry in disklayout.conf?

@lzaoral @pcahyna  
don't worry about my questions.  
Feel free to merge as you like (I approved it "as is").

@jsmeix I'll add the comment explaining why the exclusions are required.

AFAIK, it is necessary to create boot entry for every physical device
present in the RAID array which contains the ESP:

@pcahyna @jsmeix I've rebased the PR and added the explanation comment.

@jsmeix I looked at the places that determine the ESP filesystem /
device and it seems like a mess to me (several different methods are
used), but I don't have enough motivation to fix this as the code
"mostly works" now (I suspect it might have some problems when multipath
is used though) so I am going to stop investigating and merge the code
as it is.

@pcahyna  
yes,  
feel free to merge when it is OK for you.  
We can only improve things step by step  
as far as possible with reasonable effort.
