-   How was this pull request tested?

By me in migration mode as described at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2181\#issue-468078812](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2181#issue-468078812)

With the changes here things "just work" for me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In migration mode apply the disk layout mappings not only to
disklayout.conf  
but also to other files that are also used to migrate the disk layout,
namely  
$VAR\_DIR/layout/config/df.txt and /etc/rear/rescue.conf

Additionally re-read the BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP variable  
from /etc/rear/rescue.conf
