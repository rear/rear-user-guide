#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? Tested on RHEL7

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Prior to this change, when a network interface had a custom name set
instead of `ethX`, the network configuration was not applied. Typical
usage is the `ifcfg` file sets up a `DEVICE` name and `HWADDR` mapping.

The new code fixes this issue by running the network interface migration
code in an unattended manner.

Example (tested on a RHEL 7 box):

    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-first:
    TYPE="Ethernet"
    BOOTPROTO="dhcp"
    DEFROUTE="yes"
    IPV6INIT="no"
    DEVICE="first"
    HWADDR="52:54:00:eb:6c:bf"
    ONBOOT="yes"

/etc/rear/site.conf:

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y

Prior to this change:

-   no network configured

With this code:

-   network is configured, interface `first` is mapped onto `eth0`
    temporarily
-   after recovery and reboot, the network interface `first` will be
    restored

@schabrolles  
could you also have a look here if it looks o.k. to you?

I added you as reviewer because you did some recent changes in  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh
