    virtual machine):

-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot?  
    BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    My ISO image is over 2 GB, so I need use UDF.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    The only thing helps me is manual edit:  
    /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/820\_create\_iso\_image.sh

-   Resolve IMHO.  
    Add please ability for extra parameters to making iso image. Or, may
    be autodetect size of backup.tar.gz with appropriate behavour:
    automatic add parameters)

@der-andrew  
ReaR is intentionally written in bash (the admin's native language ;-)  
so that the scripts in ReaR can be adapted and enhanced as needed  
for this or that special circumstances.  
Accordingly your workaround matches how ReaR is meant to be used.

Nevertheless you are right that it would be easier when  
the options for the ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN program call  
could be specified in /etc/rear/local.conf.

I will sign myself under each word) ReaR really cool!!!  
One disadvantage: after possible rear's update it may be loos custom
(workaround). But I'v got 200+ servers.  
Please, consider the possibility of subject :)  
Thanks a lot for ReaR!

@der-andrew  
it is considered and planned to be done for the next ReaR 2.5 release  
but no promises because it depends on how much time I find for it and  
perhaps during implementation some unexpectedly hard problems may
appear  
regardless that right now I cannot imagine that problems will appear  
(i.e. currently things look "just straightforward" to me).

Regarding overwriting self-adapted scripts by an update of a rear RPM
package:  
See how I package our rear RPM for openSUSE at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear)  
therein the `rear.changes` file that shows (excerpt)

<pre>

...
- Have config(noreplace) also for all files in /usr/share/rear/
  to avoid that RPM package update overwrites user edited files
  because Relax-and-Recover (rear) is meant to be adapted and
  enhanced by the user according to his particular needs
  (see http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery).
- Added rear-rpmlintrc to filter the following false positives
  rpmlint warning messages:
  * non-etc-or-var-file-marked-as-conffile
    because config(noreplace) is intentionally for all files
    in /usr/share/rear/ (see above)
</pre>

and the `rear.spec` file how that is implemented (excerpt)

<pre>
%files
...
%config(noreplace) %{_sysconfdir}/rear/
%config(noreplace) %{_datadir}/rear/
</pre>

This way self-adapted scripts stay and new scripts get installed as
`*.rpmnew` files.  
But this can lead to inconsistencies after a RPM package upgrade when  
old self-adapted scripts do no longer work together with the other  
newer scripts from the updated ReaR which again proves that:

<pre>
For each ReaR version upgrade and for each change of a software
that is used by ReaR you must carefully and completely re-validate that
your particular disaster recovery procedure still works for you.

Will be lookting forward.

merged  
this issue should be fixed.
