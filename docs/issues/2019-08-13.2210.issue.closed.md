ReaR 2.4

The ISO image created by ReaR is not a hybrid and therefore does not
lend itself to creating a bootable USB from the ISO. With such an image
"burned" to a USB device, the system does not boot from it.

Fortunately the solution is trivial: `isohybrid [ISO]` converts it to a
hybrid ISO. Option flag `-u` or `--uefi` makes it UEFI bootable.

Would you consider creating hybrid ISOs by default, and/or mentioning
`isohybrid` in the documentation?

I prefer to create an ISO and store it with backups. However, I will
almost certainly prefer using a bootable USB for any recovery. Storing
ISOs means I do not need to tie up USBs with recovery images, instead
creating it (the USB, not the mkrescue image of course.. ) when needed.

A workaround is to do something like:

`rear mkrescue && isohybrid -u /var/lib/rear/output/rear-$(hostname).iso`

@adatum  
thank you for the exact workaround command that makes things work for
you.

I think it should not be too complicated to add a new ISOHYBRID config
variable  
to default.conf so that the user can specify whether or not to get a
hybrid ISO  
(we will have to see if a hybrid ISO by default could cause whatever
unexpected  
regressions in this or that special cases).

By the way:  
If you used "rear mkbackup" (instead of "rear mkrescue") you could
have  
mis-used POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT to call isohybrid, see in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2769](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2769)

No problem, hopefully it's helpful. Fortunately there are many easy
solutions.

A config variable could be handy. I agree it's probably best not to
change the default behavior. I'm not sure if a hybrid ISO would present
any backwards compatibility concerns compared to a standard ISO.

POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT could be good for someone using ReaR for backups.
(I'm not.)

Instead I'm using Borg for backups and borgmatic for automation.
borgmatic has pre- and post-operation hooks for running shell commands.
Right now, I have
`/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue && isohybrid -u /var/lib/rear/output/rear-$(hostname).iso`
as a pre-backup hook.

is isohybrid option in rear available today ?

Trying to find easy solution for the problem. but even using isohybrid
as an option is not working for me

re-opening the issue as there is a question to look at it again.
