I am not a Fedora user so that I cannot reproduce  
what goes on on your particular system.

Regarding how you could debug what the root cause is  
on your particular system you may have a look at the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In your particular case the script that shows the  
"Starting RPC portmapper ... failed" error message is  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh  
therein this code

<pre>
    rpcinfo -p &>/dev/null || rpcbind || Error "Starting RPC portmapper '$portmapper_program' failed."
</pre>

i.e. calling 'rpcbind' in the ReaR recovery system  
failed in your particular case with

<pre>
rpcbind: /run/rpcbind/rpcbind.lock: No such file or directory
</pre>

which indicates that the directory /run/rpcbind/  
is missing in the ReaR recovery system.

As a workaround for now you may create that directory  
in the running ReaR recovery system before  
you call "rear recover".

If that helps, you can add the command that creates  
the missing directory to the PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
config variable, see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
to automate your workaround.

If that makes things work, we can create the missing directory  
in an appropriate ReaR script.

Once logged in to the recovery console, I created the /run/rpcbind
direcotry.  
That fixed the issue.

However, there is now another issue of no network connectivity for some
reason. An "ifconfig" shows no IP address.

@tjgruber if you are really struggling with ReaR setup and can't find
solution by your own, I can try to install Fedora and take a look what
can be wrong there, just let me know.

@tjgruber for that network issue of yours.  
Automatic network setup can be quite a pain in the ..., but you can
easily bring you network up as follows:

Either:

    ifconfig <dev_name> inet <IP_address> netmask <mask>

or

    ip a add <ipaddress>/<mask_suffix> dev <dev_name>
    ip link set <dev_name> up

Running the following allowed the recovery process to begin:

> mkdir /run/rpcbind  
> chmod a+x /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
> /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

However, now things are stuck again.

I just don't think ReaR was meant to run on Fedora.

Edit: here's the log file instead of lots of screenshots:

@tjgruber don't be upset, as far as I remember you are the first one
opening issue for Fedora ;-), so yes there might be some trouble indeed,
but I guess is is nothing we can't overcome ...

It looks like you've maybe hit some bug in code of mine (XFS filesystem
recreation).  
Would you mind uploading your rescue ISO somewhere, where I can get my
dirty hands on it?  
That ISO contains configuration files that might help me to find out
where the problem is and possibly patch it.

Thanks in advance

I'll see what I can do.  
The .ISO is 200MB. Is there anything specific I can get from it instead?

@tjgruber quickest way for me to find the problem is to boot your ISO
...  
So you can upload it to dropbox maybe?  
If you have whatever problem with it for whatever reason I will accept
it, and install my own Fedora instance and test it there ...

@gozora if you do want to install Fedora 26, I used LVM and XFS on all
relevant partitions.

Here's a screenshot of the partitions I have:

Could you provide me at least with content of following directory

Is that from the .ISO or from the server?

let's try something.  
Once you boot ReaR rescue ISO go to */var/lib/rear/layout/xfs* , edit
every file with suffix **.xfs**  
where you remove string *sunit=0 blks* from **log** section so it looks
something like this:

Hello @sandeen,

Hope you are fine these days.  
Once you've left a
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065\#issuecomment-309479672](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065#issuecomment-309479672)
here, remember? ;-)

I just hope you don't mind answering simple question:

I'm looking on two different XFS versions **4.5.0** and **4.10.0**

When I run following command on **4.5.0** all is **OK**:

    mkfs.xfs -f -i size=512 -d agcount=4 -s size=512 -i attr=2 -i projid32bit=1 -m crc=1 -m finobt=1 -b size=4096 -i maxpct=25 -d sunit=0 -d swidth=0 -l version=2 -l sunit=0 -l lazy-count=1 -n size=4096 -n version=2 -r extsize=4096 /dev/loop0

however same command on XFS 4.10.0 returns

    Illegal value 0 for -l sunit option. value is too small

I'm not sure if this is bug or feature :-(, why is 0 suddenly considered
illegal ?

Thanks

V.

Open *fedora\_serv--build-root.xfs* with `vi`, remove `sunit=0 blks,`
and save file.  
repeat with sda1.xfs and sdb2.xfs

Your **log** section should look something like this:

After this change `rear recover` should run just fine.

This error have nothing to do with XFS from before.  
You have probably some remaining LVM structure present from your
previous `rear recover` session.  
You need to umount and remove all existing LVM structures (lvremove,
vgremove) and partitions (fdisk) before running `rear recover` again.

Okay I think I figured it out.

I ran the following two commands to get a list of logical volumes and
volume groups:

`lvdisplay`  
`vgdisplay`

Then I used the following commands to remove them appropriately.

`lvremove`  
`vgremove`

It looks like things are in process, so I'll let you know in a few
minutes what happens.

It looks like a successful recovery to me. Thank you to everyone for the
great support! It's very much appreciated and will help everyone else
using Fedora, LVM and XFS.

SELinux had to do some relabeling, which it did automatically, and after
that, I was able to successfully boot back into the recovered Fedora 26
server.

To summarize what worked:

    # Create missing directory:
    mkdir /run/rpcbind

    # Manually start networking:
    chmod a+x /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh
    /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

    # Navigate to and list files in /var/lib/rear/layout/xfs
    # Edit each file ending in .xfs with vi and remove "sunit=0 blks" from the "log" section.
    # In my case, the following files, then save them:
    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/xfs/fedora_serv--build-root.xfs
    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/xfs/sda1.xfs
    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/xfs/sdb2.xfs

    # Run the following commands to get a list of LVs and VGs:
    lvdisplay
    vgdisplay

    # Run the following commands to remove the above listed LVs and VGs:
    lvremove
    vgremove

Poking around *xfsprogs* sources this new behavior was introduced in
version 4.7.0 ... :-/.  
I'm not sure how we should approach this.  
My expectation during writing of XFS recreate code was that every option
from `xfs_info` output can be passed as option to `mkfs.xfs` which
proved to be wrong! :-(

In my opinion best and most harmless way would be to simply ignore every
`option=0` pair from *xfs\_into* as omitting such pair seems to be valid
way for `mkfs.xfs`.  
I'll wait couple of days whether we will get some inputs on this from
@sandeen, and write patch afterwards.

@schlomo, @gdha, @jsmeix, @schabrolles as always, any inputs are more
than welcome!

I'll open separate issue for xfs problem tomorrow (or Friday), so we
don't mix topics here ...

@gozora  
I assume you will work on the XFS related parts but  
I do not know what you have planned for me to work on ;-)  
I.e. on what parts of this issue should I work  
(so that we avoid duplicate work on same parts)?

@gozora  
regarding your proposal/question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1575\#issuecomment-344735974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1575#issuecomment-344735974)  
"ignore every option=0":

First and foremost I am not a XFS user  
so that I know basically nothing about XFS and  
I know even less than nothing ;-) about XFS internals.

In general I think "ignore every option=0" is dangerous because  
for some options the value 0 could be right and explicitly intended  
compared to not specify this option and use the mkfs.xfs default.

In particular boolean options usually have '0' as valid value,  
e.g. from "man mkfs.xfs" on my SLES12 system  
where /usr/sbin/mkfs.xfs is from xfsprogs-4.3.0

<pre>
  crc=value
    This is used to create a filesystem which
    maintains and checks CRC information in
    all metadata objects on disk.
    The value is either 0 to disable the feature,
    or 1 to enable the use of CRCs.
</pre>

I basically assigned you here because you've been commenting on this
issue ;-).  
This issue can be closed and I'll open new one for this particular XFS
problem.

Good point!  
Then I'd need to ignore just non-boolean values, I guess ... This would
create a bit hard to maintain code, but unfortunately I don't see easier
way around.

@gozora  
"man mkfs.xfs" on my SLES12 system with xfsprogs-4.3.0  
shows this non-boolean option where 0 is a valid value:

<pre>
  maxpct=value
    This specifies the maximum percentage
    of space in the filesystem that can be
    allocated to inodes. The default value
    is 25% for filesystems under 1TB, 5%
    for filesystems under 50TB and 1% for
    filesystems over 50TB.
    ...
    Setting the value to 0 means that essentially
    all of the filesystem can become inode blocks,
    subject to inode32 restrictions.
</pre>

which is an example for settings where  
the value 0 has a special meaning like  
"timeout=0" could mean unlimited waiting or  
"max\_space=0" could mean unlimited space  
and things like that.

@jsmeix thanks for info.  
It looks like we can't really write a some general rule ;-/, "love
it!"  
Will try to think about it a bit more ...

I'm closing this issue as solved, and opening \#1579 as follow up for
XFS issue that occurred here.

Update for Fedora 26 - the `skel/default/run/rpcbind` directory will be
masked by the new mounted ***/run*** mount-point. Therefore, the problem
as described in this issue is **not** yet fixed.

The solution is to copy the `systemd-tmpfiles` executable and copy as is
the directory `/var/lib/tmpfiles.d` as this will generate the
`/run/rpcbind` directory during the start-up of `rpcbind` daemon. Will
make a PR for this.

The fix proofs to be working as I could do a successful recovery with
NFS (rpcbind started automatically).  
OK to close this issue.
