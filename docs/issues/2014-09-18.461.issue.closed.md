Hi!

I use rear v1.14, but the cause of the problem (mapping script) is the
same in v1.16.  
Situation:  
disk /dev/sda 34359738368 msdos  
disk /dev/sdb 34359738368 msdos

In case of emergency, if disk sda is replaced by a different one (size:
51539607552), the disk mapping
script(/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/30\_map\_disks.sh)
generates the following mapping:  
This is the disk mapping table:  
/dev/sda /dev/sdb  
/dev/sdb /dev/sdb

Which is clearly a bad idea. Expected would be the keep the mapping for
sdb and map sda on the new bigger disk (maybe after asking) or at least
quit with an error.

@zsarosi I do not mind to accept a pull request with better code. We as
a community do our best to keep up with the issues, however if you find
the time I wouldn't mind to hear your ideas.

Hi gdha! The pull request was a misstake, I dind't want to fork an own
git branch, I was just clicking on the false button. Can I undo it?

@zsarosi did you know you can predefine your disk mapping? Just create a
file `/etc/rear/mappings/disk_devices`with your preference.
