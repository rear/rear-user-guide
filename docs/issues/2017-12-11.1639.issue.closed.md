Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1713](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1713)  
/etc/rear/os.conf gets autocreated in the original sytem (if not already
exists).

I wonder why /etc/rear/os.conf is autocreated in the original sytem?

Why not only autocreate a $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/os.conf in the recovery
system  
e.g. in the same way as $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear-release gets autocreated
by  
build/default/970\_add\_rear\_release.sh ?

In general I do not like it when any "rear WORKFOLW" automatically  
changes the original system without an explicit user request.  
I think in general the original system should be sacrosanct - except
there is  
really a very good reason to automatically change the original system.

@jsmeix Cannot follow your reasoning here - it was like this for a
decade. From my point of view this issue may be closed. If you want to
change the behaviour then please create a new separate issue.

O.k. for me.
