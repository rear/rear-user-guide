-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2323

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    With boot and check of ReaR rescue system on SLES12 SP4.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Make USE\_DHCLIENT more fail-safe in ReaR recovery system.  
    (during execution of /etc/scripts/system-setup)  
    Instead just evaluating whether USE\_DHCLIENT is empty, evaluate  
    whether USE\_DHCLIENT is set to 'true' or 'false'.

@gozora  
only as a side note:

While you are at it - but only if you like - you may also improve  
things regarding USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING in the same way:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'USE_STATIC_NETWORKING' | grep -v ': *#'

    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh:
    [[ ! -z "\$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "\$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return

    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/350_routing.sh:
    [[ ! -z "\$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "\$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh:
    test "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" && return

@jsmeix USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING looks somehow OK to me.  
Because default.conf says:

    # Say "y", "Yes" (or any not empty string) to enable static networking (overrules USE_DHCLIENT):
    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=

So checking USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING with `-z` look sufficient.  
What kind of improvement is you your mind?

What I mean is that USE\_DHCLIENT can have 3 values:

-   yes
-   no
-   empty (autodetect)

Where USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING can be:

-   empty (off)
-   non-enpty (on)

Yes, USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING is currently "somehow OK"  
where "somehow OK" means "technically fully correct"  
because its behaviour is documented so there is no need  
to fix something here because there is no (technical) bug.

My side note was only meant as an improvement  
suggestion to make it behave more fail-safe for  
"users who do not read the documentation" ;-)  
like:

    /etc/rear/local.conf excerpts:
    ...
    # Ensure to not USE_STATIC_NETWORKING
    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="No"
    ...

I noticed things like that in user config files several times in the
past.

Ah, so you just want to do something like:

`... -z "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" || is_false $USE_STATIC_NETWORKING  && return`
?

Yes, I was thinking about using  
`is_true` versus `! is_true` versus `is_false` versus `! is_false`,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh\#L101](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L101)  
also for testing the USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING value.

@jsmeix I've done the discussed modifications, can you please a quick
look (when time permits)?

Thx

@gozora  
I am sorry for my USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING cleanup proposal  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2325\#issuecomment-581803457](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2325#issuecomment-581803457)

It seems what looks like an easy "by the way" cleanup  
becomes some kind of nightmare...

Feel free to skip that part - unless you really like to clean it up  
(which I would of course appreciate so much - but I cannot expect it).

Hello @jsmeix,  
I've updated this PR according your proposal, hope it looks better now
;-)

@jsmeix anytime!

I'll merge this PR later this week.
