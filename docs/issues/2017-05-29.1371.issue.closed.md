I suggest to provide security recommendations  
for ReaR developers at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide)

I noticed  
[http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-tips/](http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-tips/)  
and I think basically the same applies to ReaR.

Furthermore I wonder if we should perhaps additionally  
provide security recommendations for ReaR users  
in a doc/user-guide/security\_recommendations.adoc  
file.

What do you think?

Can you please tell us some specific examples how you see them applied
to ReaR?
