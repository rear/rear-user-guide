================================================================================================

**Labels**: `fixed / solved / done`

The purpose of this issue is to have a landmark (sic) so we can
brainstorm  
which of the current issues with milestone of **v2.4**  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22ReaR+v2.4%22](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22ReaR+v2.4%22)  
we keep and resolve and which we move forward to milestone **v2.5**.

We can also make a list of points which might be important in the
preparation of a new release.

### Shall we aim for end of May 2018 to have a final cut-off and prepare for a new release?

@schlomo @jsmeix @gozora @schabrolles Shall we try to concentrate on the
**label 2.4** only. ***New*** issues should not get resolved for 2.4,
but pushed back to 2.5 or later.  
The only new issues that may get attention are serious security
breaches. Otherwise, we never get a new release out of the door (as
scheduled).

The only issue that actually worries me is issue 1769 starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796\#issuecomment-387797072](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796#issuecomment-387797072)  
because it is about a SLES12 system with an unusual btrfs structure  
where "rear recover" does not work which contradicts my intent  
that "rear recover" does work generically for any valid btrfs
structure,  
cf.

From my point of view

With the current ReaR GitHub master code it does no longer work
to recreate a SLES12-GA/SP0 system

blocks the ReaR 2.4 release.

@jsmeix Is the block released or still present at this point in time?

@rear/contributors We are almost at the end of month May which was
defined as a milestone to accept PR for 2.4. The first two weeks of June
we can use to test our candidate release 2.4 as much as possible and
only fix issues coming out from these tests.

**Please keep in mind that from June, 1st on all new Pull Requests will
be headed for 2.5.**

@gdha  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1813](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1813)
was merged it works again  
to recreate a SLES12-GA/SP0 system whith its default btrfs structure  
so that from my point of view nothing blocks the ReaR 2.4 release.

I will have a look at the new ReaR 2.4 release notes

@jsmeix I have delay in writing the release notes - too much to do with
docker/rancher stuff for a customer. Give me 'till end of the week.

@gdha  
no worries - take your time.  
Issues from customers (who in the end pay my salary)  
always have higher priority also for me.

I enhanced the ReaR 2.4 release notes at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-4.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-4.md)

@gdha  
a proposal for future release notes,  
in particular for the next ReaR 2.5 release notes:

I propose the following:

Directly after ReaR 2.4 was officially released  
the next ReaR 2.5 release notes file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md)  
should be created with the appropriate headers for ReaR 2.5 (but with
empty content) like

<pre>
Preliminary work-in-progress Release Notes for the future Relax-and-Recover version 2.5

...

Version 2.5 (currently no planned release date)

Abstract

New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

...

Details (mostly in chronological order):

...
</pre>

During ReaR 2.5 development that ReaR 2.5 release notes file  
should be filled step by step as needed with ReaR 2.5 content.

This way we would during ReaR 2.5 development maintain and provide  
a reasonably up-to-date summary about new features, bigger
enhancements,  
and possibly backward incompatible changes.

I think we would benefit from a continuously developed release notes
file  
because then it should be mostly done when the release date is there.

Additionally our users who use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
would benefit from a continuously developed release notes file because
they  
would get a central place where they could read an up-to-date summary
about  
new features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible
changes  
without the effort to compile that information out of the git commit
messages.

For an example where such information was probably missing for a user  
who tried our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1822\#issuecomment-396304632](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1822#issuecomment-396304632)

@jsmeix Excellent idea to start with release notes for 2.5 right after
the release of 2.4.  
@jsmeix Thank you for updating the the Test Matrix 2.4  
@schabrolles Do you have some updates for PowerVM and/or PPC64(le)
recovery tests for the Test Matrix 2.4?  
@rear/contributors Any blockers left over? if not, I think we are almost
ready to prepare a new release?

@gdha  
no blockers left from me so that for me it looks o.k. to release version
2.4

@gdha @jsmeix I'm gonna start some test on migration with PowerVM this
afternoon. I'll update the wiki for 2.4 Matrix.

I just pushed rear-2.4 into Fedora stack and uploaded it to SourceForge.
This evening I will do the OBS part (no time in the afternoon).

With ReaR 2.4 being released I can finish off this task with the
rear-2.4 branch.
