#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    CentOS 7.8

This is a simple inquiry.  
I am writing the recovery ISO to disk. I can write this recovery ISO to
a USB stick using Rufus under Windows. IT boots fine and recovery is
possible.

However, I noticed the ISO is just a partition. I am trying to figure
out how to write the ISO from a linux system to USB drive.  
I am aware that I can do OUTPUT=USB, but I don't want to leave a UB
drive in all the time.

Basically, it needs to be a EUFI bootable drive and I can't seem to
figure this out from the linux command line. The way I've written raw
disk images in the past (dd) doesn't work. Mostly because it appears the
ISO is just a partition.

Thanks for any ideas.

Well, I'll leave this here.

Format a USB drive as FAT32. Extract the ISO to the drive. UEFI looks
for /boob/efi/bootx64.efi

That's it.

@jagauthier  
perhaps
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)  
could be also of interest for you here?

Additionally there is the `RAWDISK` output method, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555\#issuecomment-767451545](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555#issuecomment-767451545)  
but `RAWDISK` does not support to include the data backup, cf.

Thank you! I didn't know about RAWDISK. I will try it for sure.

@jagauthier  
there are some recent improvements of the `RWADISK` method  
all done by @OliverO2 in our current ReaR upstream master code  
so I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream master code,  
cf. "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in
