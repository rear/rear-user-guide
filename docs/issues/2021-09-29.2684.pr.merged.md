-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not at all tested by me because I don't use UEFI

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Completely overhauled
    output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
    that should in particular fix
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2683](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2683)  
    by no longer using `cp -p` but always and only `cp -L`  
    to ensure the real content gets copied  
    but no longer preserve mode,ownership,timestamps because that may
    fail like

<!-- -->

    cp: failed to preserve ownership for '/tmp/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX/EFI/BOOT/kernel': Operation not permitted

because it copies to a VFAT filesystem on the EFI partition  
(see format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh how it is formatted).
