I've yet to actually use rear but after looking at the docs I'm unclear
about a few things that I would like to see made more clear in the docs,
specifically the [layout configuration
page](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc).

I want to use rear to backup a Ubuntu 20.04 server which uses md raid
for the system disks (MDRAID 10) and ZFS for /home. /home is going to be
backed up to another server using syncoid to preserve the snapshots so I
want to exclude /home and also stop it backing up the systemrescuecd USB
drive I've got plugged into it.

It looks like I'll need to use EXCLUDE\_BACKUP=() for this but that
presents a few questions not covered in the current docs:

-   What is the correct format for an exclude value?

EXCLUDE\_BACKUP=( "fs:/home" )

or

EXCLUDE\_BACKUP=( "/home" )

I have seen both formats used in the current docs.

-   How do I define multiple exclude paths or devices? Do I use multiple
    EXCLUDE\_BACKUP statements, one with comma separated values or one
    with space separated values or...

-   Can I add devices to EXCLUDE\_BACKUP or is it only for local fs
    paths / mounted disks?

-   I see there is also EXCLUDE\_RECREATE but I don't understand what
    this is for? The comments / current docs say

<!-- -->

    # Exclude components during component recreation

What is 'component recreation'? It would seem this isn't just another
name for restore because there is also EXCLUDE\_RESTORE=() so I'm unsure
if I should also use EXCLUDE\_RECREATE?

It seems like `default.conf` is a more comprehensive source of
documentation for rear than the user guide. After having a quick skim
through that, I think I should actually be using:

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=(/home)

To stop rear backing up `/home` rather than `EXCLUDE_BACKUP=()` and it
seems multiple values are separated by spaces so am I right in thinking
that to stop rear backing up `/home` and my USB disk it would be a
statement like:

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=(/home /media/user/disk)

So, what is `EXCLUDE_BACKUP=()` used for and what are the 'components'
it manages?

We should probably update the layout config page of the rear user guide
to include EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS as one of the highlighted functions as
this must be a commonly used option if its what's used to prevent always
connected USB drives, backup dirs etc from being backed up accidentally.

Its OT for this issue but does rear support restoring Ubuntu or proxmox
with ZFS root partitions?

    ~/src/rear$ grep -r zpool *
    ~/src/rear$ 

I strongly suspect that means there is currently no ZFS support in rear
right?

Do I need to pass any special options to backup a md RAID10 array or
will rear handle all the RAID stuff automatically when using Linux's
software RAID?

ReaR currently does not support ZFS,

In general what is called "components" in ReaR is separated  
from what is called "backup" in ReaR.

"Components" are basically what is stored during "rear mkrescue" in  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
i.e. the disk layout components like disks, partitions, and filesystems.

"Backup" are the files (and directories) that are saved  
via a backup method that is specified by `BACKUP= ...`  
during "rear mkbackuponly".

"rear mkbackup" results the same as  
first "rear mkrescue" and then "rear mkbackuponly"  
(you may inspect what "rear -s mkrescue" shows compared  
to "rear -s mkbackup" and/or "rear -s mkbackuponly").

Currently there are various `EXCLUDE` user config variables  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf for example things like

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE
    BACKUP_ONLY_EXCLUDE
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS
    EXCLUDE_MD
    EXCLUDE_VG
    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS
    AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS
    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH
    AUTOEXCLUDE_AUTOFS
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH
    EXCLUDE_BACKUP
    EXCLUDE_RECREATE
    EXCLUDE_RESTORE

Those config variables are used by ReaR in various specific ways  
and they may interact with each other in certain automated ways.

For some basic information what each one should do  
see the descriptions in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

For exact information what each one actually does and  
how each one may interact with other config variables  
you would have to inspect the scripts where each one is used.  
For example to find out in which scripts BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE  
is used you may use a command like

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -l 'BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE'

and then inspect the actual bash code in those scripts.

But in particular BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE is only supported  
for ReaR's "internal" backup methods like "BACKUP=NETFS"  
in particular with "BACKUP\_PROG=tar".

For ReaR's "external" backup methods see the section  
"BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION" in "man rear"  
e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

Regarding the syntax of disk layout components:

To see the exact syntax of components in your particular case  
it should help to inspect after "rear mkrescue" was run  
the var/lib/rear/layout/diskdeps.conf file that lists the  
components for example something like

    /dev/sda1 /dev/sda
    /dev/sda2 /dev/sda
    /dev/sda3 /dev/sda
    /dev/sda5 /dev/sda
    fs:/ /dev/sda5
    swap:/dev/sda1 /dev/sda1

Also var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf lists the components, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229\#issuecomment-529953810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229#issuecomment-529953810)

For an example how EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS had worked for me  
to exclude a particular filesystem, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767\#issuecomment-378925290](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767#issuecomment-378925290)

That issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767)  
also describes that it is currently not possible  
to exclude a partition between other partitions, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767\#issuecomment-379758551](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1767#issuecomment-379758551)

Thanks for your comprehensive replies @jsmeix ! I've not tested a rear
restore yet but I believe I've created a successful rear backup now by
using `EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS()` to exclude my ZFS pool members and external
disks.

So why does rear have both `EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS()` and
`EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS()`? Do these not serve the same purpose?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-03-16 13:18](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2772#issuecomment-1069119836):

EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS and EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS behave differently:

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

    # Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
    # $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
    # be backed up
    # examples: /tmp
    #           /media/bigdisk
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()
    ...
    # Exclude any component from the recovery image.
    # Some component types need a prefix:
    # - filesystems: "fs:/var/cache"
    # - physical volumes: "pv:/dev/sda2"
    # - swap: "swap:/dev/mapper/system-swap"
    # Volume groups look like: "/dev/system".
    # If in doubt about the correct syntax, consult /var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf
    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=()

so the difference is that elements in the EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS array  
get automatically added to the $BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE array  
while EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS excludes only those  
disk layout components (like disks, partitions, and filesystems)  
to be recreated during "rear recover".

For the actual differences inspect their actual code places:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS'

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=()
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:for component in "${EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS[@]}" ; do
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:    LogPrint "Excluding component $component in EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS"

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS'

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# but not implicitly also all excluded mountpoints in EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS:
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# You must also exclude the corresponding mountpoints in EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# EXCLUDE_VG and EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS will get populated automatically, if needed
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# This is different from EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS, which accepts only mountpoints.
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:# EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:#for mountpoint in "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; do
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:#    LogPrint "Excluding mountpoint $mountpoint in EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS"
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/320_autoexclude.sh:        if IsInArray "$mountpoint" "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; then
    usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/300_create_nbu_restore_fs_list.sh:if [ ${#EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]} -gt 0 ]
    usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/300_create_nbu_restore_fs_list.sh:    for FS in ${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}
    usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh:            if ! IsInArray "$mountpoint" "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; then
    usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh:    for excluded_mountpoint in "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; do

In particular  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310\_include\_exclude.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/320\_autoexclude.sh  
look interesting regarding EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS  
where the former (310\_include\_exclude.sh) shows that  
a filesystem in EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS still gets recreated because

    # If a filesystem is excluded (for backup) we still may need to perform an
    # mkfs on the filesystem as it may be referenced in fstab and mounted
    # automatically, or is needed for a separate restore.

except its whole disk gets automatically excluded via  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/320\_autoexclude.sh

And there is also EXCLUDE\_RECREATE with similar  
but again somewhat different behaviour.

Personally I find the whole exclude functionality "hairy", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229\#issuecomment-531474858](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229#issuecomment-531474858)

The current state is the grown result of many contributions  
by various different (mostly voluntary) contributors over a long time  
which is much appreciated because without all those continuous  
contributions there would be basically no ReaR at all.

We cannot "just clean it up" because each specific functionality  
is used by particular users and we want to  
"Maintain backward compatibility", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#maintain-backward-compatibility](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#maintain-backward-compatibility)  
and we neither have the time nor the manpower  
to clean it up in a proper backward compatible way.

@jsmeix

Rear has the function `ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg0" )` which I can use to
backup the root partition / LVM VG on my server that uses LVM but rear
doesn't seem to have a matching `ONLY_INCLUDE_MD()` to only backup
specific soft RAID arrays to do a similar thing on my server that does
not use LVM but does use mdadm. Is there a reason for this other than
its not been implemented yet?

I want to use rear to backup `/dev/md0` on a server thats not using LVM
but I don't want to backup its external disks or ZFS pool. Here is the
relevant bit of its `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` :

    raid /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 level=raid10 raid-devices=4 uuid=a6bd74fc:af330bdc:c585f8e7:9a338b9f layout=n2 chunk=512 devices=/dev/nvme2n1p2,/dev/nvme1n1p2,/dev/nvme0n1p2,/dev/nvme3n1p2
    part /dev/md0 3839413452800 1048576 rear-noname none /dev/md0p1
    # Filesystems (only ext2,ext3,ext4,vfat,xfs,reiserfs,btrfs are supported).
    # Format: fs <device> <mountpoint> <fstype> [uuid=<uuid>] [label=<label>] [<attributes>]
    fs /dev/md0p1 / xfs uuid=be0e9e5b-d449-4f4b-969f-248b81d13222 label=  options=rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,sunit=1024,swidth=2048,noquota

Can I tell rear to only backup this md raid partition or must I instead
do it by excluding all the components I don't want?

I don't know if someone may have tried to implement ONLY\_INCLUDE\_MD  
some longer time ago but failed because it was impossible for some
reason  
but I guess there no reason other than it is not yet implemented and  
I know that noone asked for such functionality since some time  
so likely you are the first who asks for such functionality.

So when you need ONLY\_INCLUDE\_MD see the sections  
"How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover" and  
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Perhaps it is easier to explicitly exclude all unwanted components?

Because ReaR config files (in particular etc/rear/local.conf)  
are executed via the bash builtin `source` you can run commands  
within your configuration files, in particular commands to  
automatically set configuration values as you need, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)  
So you could automatically exclude all unwanted components.

Have in mind that etc/rear/local.conf is executed  
for "rear mkrescue" which runs on the original system  
and also for "rear recover" which runs inside the ReaR recovery system.

So expected storage devices may not exist on new replacement hardware  
or unexpected storage devices may exist on used replacement hardware  
when etc/rear/local.conf is executed during "rear recover", cf. the
section  
"Prepare replacement hardware for disaster recovery" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Simply put:  
Commands in ReaR config files must also work  
within the recovery system on replacement hardware.
