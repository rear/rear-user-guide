hi,

we are evaluating shipping REAR 2.7 with the next sesam release. It
appears that with REAR 2.7, mkrescue  
step will fail bcs of missing libraries during functionality check:

    2022-12-04 12:00:57.066647656 /opt/sesam/bin/sesam/python3/libhogweed.so.6 requires additional libraries (fatal error)
    2022-12-04 12:00:57.075641526   linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc7a5ca000)
                                    libnettle.so.8 => not found

adding two more directories to the backup module related
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH fixes this issue.

@abbbi  
is the change sufficiently backward compatible and fail-safe  
in particular when older SESAM versions are used?

For example I don't know if $SM\_BIN\_SMS has always a value.  
If it is unset or has no value the code would evaluate to

    SESAM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SM_BIN_SESAM:$SM_BIN_SESAM/python3/:

but I don't know how SESAM\_LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH works  
with a trailing colon because "man bash" reads (excerpt)

    PATH
    ...
    A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of PATH
    indicates the current directory.
    A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons,
    or as an initial or trailing colon.

so a trailing colon makes a difference.

hi,

$SM\_BIN\_SMS always has a value (its defined in the config file set in
sesam2000ini\_file)  
Older sesam versions will stick to REAR 2.6 which we shipped in past  
releases, i dont see an issue here regards backwards compatibility.

Reason for the issues is that SEP has obsoleted python2 to python3, and
additional libraries  
are now included within the python3 subdirectory. Additionally RTS
components need additional  
libraries from the SMS subfolder too, to be able to validate.

@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections from one of you  
I would like to merge it next Wednesday (07. December)  
in the afternoon (at Central European Time).

@abbbi  
I meant when users use a current ReaR with your change  
(e.g. from ReaR upstream or from their Linux distributor)  
with an older SESAM version.

the change should not cause any issue with older Sesam versions, in
fact, i wonder why it didnt report the missing  
libraries already with REAR 2.6 (seems the check in REAR 2.7 has seen
some rework and is stricter now).  
Anyways, our customers will (by default) always use the bundled version.

@abbbi  
thank you for your continuous contributions to ReaR  
in particular for the BACKUP=SESAM method in ReaR!

Contributions for third-party backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have those third-party backup tools  
so we totally depend on contributions from people  
who use and know about third-party backup tools  
(users or ideally even developers).
