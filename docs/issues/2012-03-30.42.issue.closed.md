During our development of the interactive menus, we though it would be
useful to have a disklayout.conf-related menu item to modify and
recreate diskrestore.sh from it. This would allow a much faster
turn-around time in making changes during recovery.

@dagwieers nice idea, but who will implement this? Putting milestone
from rear-1.17 to 'rear future' (the fridge)

seems a dead issue; re-open when there is a need for it and time to work
on it!
