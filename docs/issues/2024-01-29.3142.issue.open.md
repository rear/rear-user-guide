for context.

I'd like to be able to use automated source code formatting with ReaR,
and the go-to-tool for that seems to be
[shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd)
which is also supported in our `.editorconfig` file and in various IDEs
(I'm currently using Visual Studio Code with
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format)).

Our
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
has some rules that conflict with the abilities of this formatter,
specifically adding extra white space or padding around code fragments
or before `;`.

I wasn't able to find a shell script formatting solution that works in
the IDEs that allows such a coding style, and I believe that automated
consistent formatting is more important. Therefore I'd like to suggest
to adjust our coding style to also allow (or demand?) a more compact way
of writing Bash and to recommend using a shell script formatter to
format the code.

I'm happy to submit the PR with the change that reformats all lines,
although that would kill `git blame` and therefore I'd rather prefer
that we reformat files as we work on them.

Personally I'd prefer to not require a "clean" `git blame` as a
requirement over consistent and automated code formatting.

What do you think @rear/contributors?

Personally I don't worry about coding syntax style differences.

For example personally I don't care if

    if CONDITION ; then
        ...
        ...
    fi

or

    if CONDITION
    then ...
         ...
    fi

is used because both are reasonably easy  
to read and - most important - to understand.

Therefore  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
talks initially about "hints" - not "rules":

    Here is a collection of coding hints
    that should help to get a more consistent code base.

    Don't be afraid to contribute to Relax-and-Recover
    even if your contribution does not fully match all this coding hints. 
    ...
    Nevertheless try to understand the idea behind this coding hints
    so that you know how to break them properly
    (i.e. "learn the rules so you know how to break them properly").

    The overall idea behind this coding hints is:

    Make yourself understood

So as long as it is reasonably easy for me  
to understand some code I do not care about  
coding syntax style.

For example I prefer spaces as separators  
basically everywhere in my code for example as in

    if for x in this that ; do echo $x ; done ; then
        echo OK
    fi

because personally I find that easier to read  
than

    if for x in this that; do echo $x; done; then
        echo OK
    fi

But this is really not something which makes  
the code needlessly hard to read  
so I don't worry about such coding syntax style details.

In contrast for example I think that backticks  
make code needlessly hard to read - in particular  
when also single quotes are used things look confusing.

@schlomo  
do you perhaps propose  
to run an automated source code formatter  
over all existing ReaR code?
