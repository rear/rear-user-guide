-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
    the VM I try to recover contains one LUKS-encrypted filesystem
    (inside a LVM logical volume). The key to decrypt and mount that
    filesystem is provided as a password, to be typed during boot time.
    During recovery, ReaR correctly detects that this LV should be
    encrypted and prompts me to enter a (new) password for it. It then
    successfully creates the LV, the filesystem and mounts it, then
    proceed with restoring the data. The failure arises later, when ReaR
    tries to re-assign a key file that doesn't exist:

After some investigation, it seems to be the result of an inconsistency
between:

`layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh`

and:

`finalize/GNU/Linux/240_reassign_luks_keyfiles.sh`

In the first script, the temp. keyfile is only created when a keyfile
was specified on the source system (see l. 46-48). In the absence of a
keyfile, a password is either read from the options or (as is the case
for me) the user is prompted for it.

In the second script, we fail as BUG if the temp. keyfile doesn't exist
(see l. 28-29) -- which is the case for us. The script should probably
not have reached the inside of the `while` loop to begin with.

Some error in the `awk` scriptlet? Or 'keyfile' parameter incorrectly
set in the layout file?

Second hypothesis correct. Here is relevant line from 'disklayout.conf':

`crypt /dev/mapper/cr_vg00-lvol4 /dev/mapper/vg00-lvol4 cipher=aes-xts-plain64 key_size=256 hash=sha256 uuid=3300d4a7-2d75-4968-b55d-d330f79efdc9 keyfile=`

This does indeed cause the 'awk' scriptlet to match, but to return an
empty string for `$original_keyfile`.

Will add an extra test in the `while` loop and re-test the
backup/recovery cycle.

The `awk` script in
finalize/GNU/Linux/240\_reassign\_luks\_keyfiles.sh  
is overcomplicated because at least for me it is impossible to  
understand what it intends to do by plain looking at the code.

The `awk` script originated from the very beginning when that script was
made, cf.

    git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/240_reassign_luks_keyfiles.sh

Of course one could reverse-engineer what it does  
but that is not how code in ReaR scripts should be, cf.

Thanks for the report and your correct analysis. The `keyfile` option in
the layout file should indeed never look that way. So the problem
originates in
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/260_crypt_layout.sh`, which
apparently sees an unexpected line in `/etc/crypttab`.

To me it looks like `/etc/crypttab` is not formatted according to
crypttab(5) as field 3 seems to be missing but is expected to be a path,
or `none` (or `-`, but that is already beyond specification). Could you
post the contents of the `/etc/crypttab` file on the original system?

What exactly is impossible to understand? Looks pretty clear to me.

Here is the contents of the original '/etc/crypttab' (from backup
archive):

`cr_vg00-lvol4  UUID=3300d4a7-2d75-4968-b55d-d330f79efdc9`

I checked the (partially) recovered VM, and '/mnt/local/etc/crypttab' is
identical (recovery died before call to `260_rename_diskbyid.sh`).

Just to clarify: I've created the encrypted volume using the YaST2
partitioner module, and I've not edited /etc/crypttab manually
afterwards.

@OliverO2  
Proposed fix in
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/260_crypt_layout.sh`:

    43c43
    <     keyfile_option=$([ -f /etc/crypttab ] && awk '$1 == "'"$target_name"'" && $3 != "none" && $3 != "-" { print "keyfile=" $3; }' /etc/crypttab)
    ---

Shall I test and submit a pull request if successful?

@petroniusniger  
Thanks for quickly providing the information. I think that your fix is
the way to go, I'd appreciate a PR and I'm pretty sure the ReaR
maintainers would welcome one, too.

You might want to check crypttab(5) on your system and file a bug with
YaST as well.

Extracts from **crypttab**(5) on openSUSE Leap 15.0:

           Empty lines and lines starting with the "#" character are ignored. Each
           of the remaining lines describes one encrypted block device, fields on
           the line are delimited by white space. The first two fields are
           mandatory, the remaining two are optional.

and further down:

           The third field specifies the encryption password. If the field is not
           present or the password is set to "none" or "-", the password has to be
           manually entered during system boot. Otherwise, the field is [...]

So, not a bug from the point of view of SUSE, I guess.  
I'll proceed with testing the proposed fix.

Thanks for the insights! Just did a quick research on Ubuntu manpages
where even the 7 year old [Ubuntu 12.04
crypttab(5)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/crypttab.5.html)
manpage says in the description's final section:

> Note that all four fields are mandatory and that a missing field will
> lead to unspecified behaviour.

Anyway, if there are systems around that do not agree, it's always a
good idea to call it a bug in ReaR and fix it accordingly.

I can confirm that I'm able to successfully recover my test system using
the proposed fix.  
I can also confirm that the resulting `disklayout.conf` no longer
contains the problematic `keyfile=` empty option at the end of the
encrypted filesystem line:

`crypt /dev/mapper/cr_vg00-lvol4 /dev/mapper/vg00-lvol4 cipher=aes-xts-plain64 key_size=256 hash=sha256 uuid=3300d4a7-2d75-4968-b55d-d330f79efdc9`

I'll now proceed with the PR creation.
