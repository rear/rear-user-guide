Without debug logging information  
it is in parctice impossible to guess the reason  
what lets it fail in your particular case  
in your particular environment on your particular system  
(for me it "just works" but I do not run "elementary OS Freya").

Because rear is written entirely as bash scripts,  
debugging rear is usual bash debugging.

To debug rear run it both with the '-d' option (log debug messages) and
with the '-D' option (debugscript mode) to log commands and their
arguments as they are executed (via 'set -x') like

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

Afterwards inspect the rear log file for further analysis.  
The rear log files get stored in the /var/log/rear/ directory.

At least post here an excerpt of the rear debug log file  
with some lines before the error message appears.  
Try to imagine how many lines before the error message  
seem to be related to the error.

The relevant code in backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh  
seems to be

<pre>
   127          (tar)
   128                  while sleep 1 ; kill -0 $BackupPID 2&gt;&amp;8; do
   129                          #blocks="$(stat -c %b ${backuparchive})"
   130                          #size="$((blocks*512))"
   131                          size="$(stat -c %s ${backuparchive}* | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')"
   132                          #echo -en "\e[2K\rArchived $((size/1024/1024)) MiB [avg $((size/1024/(SECONDS-starttime))) KiB/sec]"
   133                          ProgressInfo "Archived $((size/1024/1024)) MiB [avg $((size/1024/(SECONDS-starttime))) KiB/sec]"
   134                  done
   135                  ;;
</pre>

I guess something with "stat -c" might not work in your case  
as expected?

Perhaps you can adapt that code so that it also works  
in your case.

@alxndr13 The problem might be that Elementary OS is not yet a known OS
within rear. Try `rear dump` to see more details. I believe it is based
on Ubuntu, no?

I had similar issue in Debian 5.0. The reason was the way how awk prints
numbers above 2G which is reported within ProgerssInfo function. You
will get the error as mentionned only if your backup i larger than 2GB.

In Debian 5.0:  
`stat -c %s backup.tar.gz |awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' 3,29123e+09`

The same file in Debian 7.0 is:  
`stat -c %s backup.tar.gz |awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' 3291226398`

Simply change line 131 in
/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh from

`size="$(stat -c %s ${backuparchive}* | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')"`

to

`size="$(stat -c %s ${backuparchive}* | awk '{s=$1} END {print s}')"`  
or  
`size="$(stat -c %s ${backuparchive}* | awk '{s+=$1} END {printf "%d\n",s}')"`

It solved my problem.

Regards.
