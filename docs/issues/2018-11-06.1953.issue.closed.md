It struck me that the partition table is of **msdos** type instead of
**gpt**.  
Can you check the output of `parted /dev/sdd print`?  
I see you are using the RHEL rear-2.00 version - so if you could open a
support case at RedHat for quick assistance.

I already opened Red Hat case in parallel, but you guys are most of the
time way more effective in finding root cause. :)

Does it mean I should focus on workaround scenario with
AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=y?

Thanks,

@pdanek Start with adding the following 2 lines in `local.conf`

    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
    BOOT_OVER_SAN=y

However, what worries me is the partition table label **msdos**. How can
a multipath disk:

    create: 3600507680c8082f60000000000000015 undef IBM     ,2145

      `- 13:0:0:13 sdbs 68:96  undef ready running

of size **4TB** be using a **msdos** partition table instead of **gpt**.
That does not make sense at all.  
@schabrolles Have you seen this before?

1.  Tested with BOOT\_OVER\_SAN=y, still same error (partition table
    label msdos).
2.  I also downloaded latest rear-2.4-1.el7.x86\_64.rpm from
    [http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/),
    but there we face same issue as with latest rear package in Red Hat

@gdha  
I have a question as multipath noob - perhaps I can learn a bit:

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1953\#issuecomment-436241774](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1953#issuecomment-436241774)  
you wrote about `/dev/sdd`.

How did you find out in the attached logs form @pdanek  
that `/dev/mapper/3600507680c8082f60000000000000015`  
belongs to `/dev/sdd`?

With latest ReaR 2.4 version and AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=n +
BOOT\_OVER\_SAN=y we get following after rear recover:

Do you have an idea what could be wrong please?

I didn't try the option 1 yet as I was assumed "rear recover" should
automatically know which disk is correct.  
This is physical machine so I didn't want to break it as we can't easily
revert to VM snapshot.

disklayout.conf attached -
[disklayout.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2690460/disklayout.conf.txt)  
Should I try restoring with option 1?

Thanks.

@pdanek what you can try to do is the following:

1.  download script from
    [https://github.com/gdha/mismas/blob/master/make\_rear\_diskrestore\_script.sh](https://github.com/gdha/mismas/blob/master/make_rear_diskrestore_script.sh)
2.  the usage is explained at
    [http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/](http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/)
3.  post the `diskrestore.sh` script for review

@pdanek  
because your assumption that "rear recover" should automatically know  
which disk is correct does not hold in general I added this additional
test  
to be on the safe side against a total disaster in case of ambiguous  
possible target disks.

For the reason behind see the MIGRATION\_MODE documentation  
in the current default.conf file and in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)  
the part about 'Improved MIGRATION\_MODE autodetection  
when the disk layout looks ambiguous.'

If you know what you do you can specify `MIGRATION_MODE='false'`  
to let "rear recover" blindly proceed ( as it did before ;-)

@pdanek  
could yo provide a "rear -D recover" log file because  
I would like to understand how that identical disk mapping from  
`/dev/mapper/3600507680c8082f60000000000000002` to the same  
`/dev/mapper/3600507680c8082f60000000000000002`  
happened in your particular case.

@pdanek could you try out the snapshot version from
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/RHEL\_7/x86\_64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/RHEL_7/x86_64/)
? The issue with missing NBU libraries should be fixed in there.

Thanks everyone for the help here.  
Also disk restore script I have used it already for another issue,
useful.

In regards to the above issue with MIGRATION\_MODE, already being
resolved in \#2050.
