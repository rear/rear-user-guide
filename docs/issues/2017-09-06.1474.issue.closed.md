Currently vagrant and VirtualBox support is detected in
[usr/share/rear/rescue/default/550\_vagrant.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2c12a52b3322f833c81cae2a8bc5baa799c3187d/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/550_vagrant.sh).

TODO

-   \[x\] split into two scripts, one for vagrant and one for VirtualBox
-   \[ \] use `getent` to access the passwd, group and shadow databases
-   \[ \] don't assume that the password is hashed with MD5, if there is
    no password in the source system then there doesn't need to be one
    in the rescue system
-   \[ \] don't assume that admin is a relevant group (I actually doubt
    that this works since we *don't* include sudo)
-   \[ \] add support for more recent VBoxService implementations that
    use systemd or upstart

Because @gdha is the only author of  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/550\_vagrant.sh  
as far as  
"git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/default/550\_vagrant.sh"  
tells, I dare to assign this issue to him - at least initially.

As @schlomo has started to split up the script in two pieces I prefer
that Schlomo also owns the issue as well. Honours to the one who works
on it ;-)

Haha, I forgot this one and just thought again "why does virtualbox
depend on vagrant?". Can't promise to do all of that, though.

@schlomo On Ubuntu16.04 we run into trouble with
`/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-5.1.26` inclusion:  
See
[https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/35](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/35)
for the error report.

I wonder if we really need all of this?  
`VBOX_COPY_AS_IS=( /etc/init.d/vboxadd* /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-* /usr/sbin/VBoxService )`
from script `prep/GNU/Linux/280_include_virtualbox.sh`
