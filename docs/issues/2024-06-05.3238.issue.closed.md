# [\#3238 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238) `closed`: RFC: Preparations towards release of ReaR 2.8

**Labels**: `fixed / solved / done`, `ReaR Project`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/888633?u=cdaeb31efcc0048d3619651aa18dd4b76e636b21&v=4" width="50">[gdha](https://github.com/gdha) opened issue at [2024-06-05 09:42](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238):

Rear v2.7 was released in July 2022 (more than 2 years ago),
therefore,  
the time has come to start on the preparations of a new release 2.8.

The ReaR release process is described at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process>

We could add a "blocker" label on the issues we think that should/must  
be included in the 2.8 release.

Other issues that can wait must be relabeled with a "ReaR 3.0" or later
or "ReaR 999 (future)" label.

When you tested the pre-2.8 release make a note in our WIKI page:  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-ReaR-2.8>

@rear/contributors  
because we already had some discussions about ReaR 3.0:  
What about releasing what is currently labeled ReaR 2.8  
as ReaR 3.0?

As usual I will make the release notes for ReaR 2.8  
i.e. a new  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>  
from which a new  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt>  
will be made as described at

    Convert the release notes from the ReaR web pages into a simple text file

in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process#preparation>

Making the release notes is currently blocked by  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302>  
"Distribute rear-release-notes.txt under a more permissive license"  
because it depends on its outcome whether or not  
I could make the release notes for ReaR 2.8  
based on the release notes for ReaR 2.7  
or if I need to make the release notes for ReaR 2.8  
anew from scratch under "GPL v3 or later".

@rear/contributors  
should I change this issue into  
"Preparations towards release of ReaR 2.8"  
or should I create a new separated issue for this?

Let's just change it. I always took it for "prep for *next* release" and
we now decided to name the next release 2.8

Via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/24251c3f092fd2ceca9082def5a052a72326eaad>  
I committed a new release-notes-2-8.md from scratch  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>  
to avoid in particular licensing issues with  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302>

I carefully omitted any text of the currently  
still open (i.e. not yet answered) licensing issues  
of `https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302`

The sections

    New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes

and

    Details (mostly in chronological order - newest topmost)

will now (i.e. in the next days) be filled up by me step by step  
with the the latest release notes for ReaR 2.8  
(and only for ReaR 2.8).

It went faster than expected to fill up the "Details" section,  
see the current  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>

The "Details" entries are basically "copy&paste" excerpts  
of what the command

    git log --format="%ae %H %ad%n%s :%n%b%n" --graph | fmt -w 160 -u -t | less

shows in a local git clone.

According to what that command shows  
some of those entries became rather long texts.  
I do not want (and I do not have the time) to analyze  
each longer text, if this or that part could be omitted  
or re-written in a more concise form.

@rear/contributors  
please have a look at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>  
if this or that needs to be improved or if you spot typos.

In my personal opinion I don't mind when there are long texts.  
In case of doubt or in case of no time to improve texts  
I prefer more and explanatory information where people  
(users and developers) need more time to read them  
over terse snippets where others (in particular our users)  
may not understand what something actually is about.

There are currently no outstanding blockers - we are in the freeze
period for the upcoming 2 weeks. Only pre-approved changes will be
merged (as agreed during our meeting calls).  
**The release of ReaR v2.8 is planned before 25 December 2024.**

No open issues with milestone "ReaR 2.8" except this one  
and no open pull requests with milestone "ReaR 2.8"  
plus added latest git commit messages to "Details" in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>

So our current GitHub master code is now (I think for the first time)  
in a state where we could release that code as ReaR 2.8  
as described in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process>  
which does not mean it will be released right now as is,  
it only means there is no issue or pending pull request  
that needs to be solved before the ReaR 2.8 release.

I will be on vacation starting on 21. Dec. 2024  
there are two weeks left where I could help  
to release ReaR 2.8 before 25 December 2024.

@rear/contributors  
I wish you all a relaxed and recovering weekend!

The ReaR 2.8 release notes on our web page  
looked bad because in the "Details" section  
all git commit messages were shown as one single code block  
so it was totally incomprehensible in practice.

I had to do unexpectedly much trial and error  
until I found out what in the markdown source  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>  
I need to do to show each git commit message in a  
separated code block:

Only a separated

    &nbsp;

line between subsequent markdown fenced code blocks  
also makes each separated code block appear  
separated on our web page:  
<https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-8>

From the current web page I generated  
rear-release-notes.txt ASCII file  
according to  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process>

    export LC_ALL=POSIX
    export LANG=POSIX
    w3m -dump -cols 78 https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-8 | iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT | sed -e 's/^      ? /      - /' > rear-release-notes.txt

which looks good to me so we can still have for ReaR 2.8  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt>  
as an ASCII file.

@rear/contributors  
please have a look at my current rear-release-notes.txt  
for ReaR 2.8 in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238#issuecomment-2531502357>  
and if you agree with its content  
I would replace our current one for ReaR 2.7  
with the new one for ReaR 2.8  
which would actually fix  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302>  
in our ReaR sources.

In the current rear-release-notes.txt  
I manually removed the header

    Relax-and-Recover

      o Home
      o Features
      o Documentation
      o Downloads
      o Support
      o Development
      o Events

    Relax-and-Recover Release Notes

and the footer

    If you like Relax-and-Recover please consider sponsorship

I also noticed that there are no URLs for links.  
I found  
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41345160/display-link-url-in-markdown>  
which shows URLs within angle brackets for  
"Automatic Links, where the label is the URL".

I use now in our source  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>  
plain text for the link label  
and URLs within angle brackets like

    Relax-and-Recover website: <http://relax-and-recover.org>

    GitHub project: <https://github.com/rear>

    For older Relax-and-Recover version release notes see the
    Relax-and-Recover website release notes: <http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation>

because only this works for our source on GitHub  
<https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-8.md>  
and also on our web page at relax-and-recover.org  
<https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-8>  
and also for the generated ASCII rear-release-notes.txt

i.e. I removed all old/outdated/obsoleted "jsmeix" branches

@schlomo @gdha @pcahyna  
I would like that you do a thorough proofread of  
all the 'git' related things in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process>  
and where needed clarify and enhance it  
so that the 'git' related descriptions therein  
become basically foolproof.

My personal reason for my above request is  
that I am not at all a 'git' expert  
so when I should do the ReaR 2.8 release  
my main fear is that I may accidentally / stupidly  
mess up things in our GitHub rear/rear repository.

I would appreciate it if there was a foolproof method  
described how to somehow store some kind of "snapshot"  
of our GitHub rear/rear repository so that one could  
revert the repository to a stored snapshot state  
if the repository got messed up.  
I think every git commit is such a "snapshot"  
so is `git reset --hard <commit>` THE right way to do it?  
But `git reset --hard <commit>` does it on my local repository  
so how could one do it on our GitHub rear/rear repository?

Background information:  
In recent years I moved more and more  
away from using 'git' on my local workstation  
towards using the GitHub web frontend.  
This was triggered by the general move away  
from using local tools towards using web-frontends  
for various things (e-mail, chat, whatnot...)  
to do my work in recent years - yes, I know about  
the "Service as a Software Substitute" problem  
<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html>

My personal reason is that I am not much interested in 'git'  
because it is just a tool for source code management  
but I am not really interested in management.  
Instead my actual interest is creating (software)  
so I like to keep management things out of my way ;-)

My current plan what I will do for the ReaR 2.8 release:

I will basically follow what is described  
in the section "Preparation" in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process#preparation>  
but I would perfer to do it in a more clean way if possible  
which means in particular that I would like to  
keep separated issues separated (KSIS derived from KISS)  
so I propose the following procedure which tries to keep  
steps that change files our rear/rear GitHub repository  
separated from other steps.

(A: Preparation steps that change files)

Today afternoon:

I will do the step

    Finalize commits/versions

and the two steps

    Test packaging (RPM, DEB, …​)

    Create OBS build

I assume only "Finalize commits/versions"  
is meant to change source files in the master branch  
of our rear/rear GitHub repository.

I assume "Test packaging (RPM, DEB, …​)" and "Create OBS build"  
do not and should not change any source file in any branch  
of our rear/rear GitHub repository.  
I will check that.

(B: Some time so that latest changes can be checked)

Have some time so that @rear/contributors  
could have a look at the latest state of  
our rear/rear GitHub repository  
which is meant to be then released "as is".

(C: The actual release)

Tomorrow before noon:

Only the actual release of the source files "as is"  
in the master branch in our rear/rear GitHub repository.

The actual release is not meant to change any source file  
in any branch of our rear/rear GitHub repository.

Accordingly - as far as I understand it - the actual release consists  
of the following steps to release 'ReaR 2.8' in this case here:

(1)  
Make a pristine local git clone  
of our GitHub rear/rear repository  
and change into it:

    git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    mv rear rear-release

    cd rear-release

(2)  
Add an empty commit (no source file gets changed)  
in the master branch to denote when the release happened:

    git commit -S --allow-empty -m 'ReaR 2.8 release'

(3)  
Tag the current state (HEAD) in the master branch:

    git tag -s -a rear-2.8 -m "Rear release 2.8"
    git tag -s -a 2.8 -m "Rear release 2.8"

(4)  
Push the changes in the local git clone to our GitHub rear/rear
repository:

    git push --tags

@rear/contributors  
please have a look here and tell me if there is something wrong  
with my plan what to do for the ReaR 2.8 release.

My results for "Test packaging (RPM, DEB, …​)"  
on my homeoffice workstation:

Only RPM:

In a local clone of our current GitHub master code  
(i.e. without updated version in usr/sbin/rear and  
in packaging/rpm/rear.spec so it is still version 2.7)

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear-test-packaging-rpm

    # cd rear-test-packaging-rpm

    # make rpm OFFICIAL=1 && echo OK || echo FAILED
    ...
    OK

    # git ls-files . --ignored --exclude-standard --others
    dist/rear-2.7-1.src.rpm
    dist/rear-2.7-1.x86_64.rpm
    dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz

    # git ls-files . --exclude-standard --others
    [no output]

    # diff -s dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz /var/tmp/build-rear-2.7/rear-2.7.tar.gz
    Files dist/rear-2.7.tar.gz and /var/tmp/build-rear-2.7/rear-2.7.tar.gz are identical

I compared what is in /var/tmp/build-rear-2.7/rear-2.7.tar.gz  
with what is in my GitHub master code clone and  
I found that

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/.vimrc

is not in /var/tmp/build-rear-2.7/rear-2.7.tar.gz  
but this file is needed because

    # git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/.vimrc

    commit 700727b53855d551c0620c46a839755894b26eb3
    Author: Johannes Meixner <jsmeix@suse.com>
    Date:   Mon Feb 19 13:08:44 2024 +0100

        Fix issue 3151: missing .vimrc and overhauled 130_create_dotfiles.sh (#3154)
        
        Create an empty
        usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/.vimrc
        to fix https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3151
    ...

    # rpmlint -vi dist/rear-2.7-1.x86_64.rpm
    If 'rpmlint' is not a typo you can use command-not-found to lookup the package that contains it, like this:
        cnf rpmlint

I give up here because I won't change my  
homeoffice workstation into a RPM build system  
because I don't build RPMs on my workstation  
(I use only the SUSE and openSUSE build services).

I don't think that building RPMs directly belongs  
to the actual tasks to release a new version of ReaR.

I think building RPMs and testing that it works  
(which includes testing the built RPMs)  
is a separarted task like any other functionality  
in ReaR that needs to be maintained and tested.

@jsmeix may I suggest that you use `tools/run-in-docker`, as it uses
reliably build environments and doesn't depend on your local setup. For
example I can run this even on my Mac:

    ❯ tools/run-in-docker -a amd64 11 -- make package
    Using architecture amd64 instead of default Docker architecture aarch64

    ** SCRIPT RUN TIME 95 SECONDS **

Please look at the top of the script for instructions for how to prep
the Docker images. If you don't give it a target (`11` matched

automated GitHub Actions workflow for the snapshot builds.

My point is that such things  
(testing this or that functionality in ReaR)  
do not actually belong to the task  
to release a new ReaR version.

I never contributed anything to the "make packages"  
functionality in ReaR and I don't know how it works.  
In particular I do not at all need or use  
any "make packages" functionality in ReaR.  
Why is it my task to test functionality in ReaR  
that I have nothing to do with?

Ah, I was just reacting to your `make deb` doesn't work notice and
wanted to offer a way how to "make it work" without effort.
`make package` figures out dynamically which package type to build and
then calls that, so on Debian it runs `make deb` and on RHEL/SUSE it
runs `make rpm`.

In any case, my PR branch builds DEBs just fine.

By the way FYI

On my homeoffice workstation:

    # tools/run-in-docker -a amd64 11 -- make package

    tools/run-in-docker: line 145: docker: command not found
    ...
    tools/run-in-docker: line 221: docker: command not found

For my work my workstation works for me - of course ;-)

I limit the amount of installed software on my workstation  
intentionally to what I actually need to do my work  
to mimimize the risk of whatever issues.

Things are different for my test VMs  
that I run on my workstation as needed.

I modified  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process>  
as far as I meanwhile understand it how it should be done.  
In particular:

I moved the "Test packaging" from "Preparation" to "Testing",  
see above why I think it belongs to general testing  
and not to preparation of the actual release.

I added a section "The actual release" to separate  
the preparations for the actual release  
from the actual release.

I added comments what parts I skipped (for now) and why,  
namely  
"Add the list of contributors" (to the release notes)  
and  
"Create OBS build"  
In particular I will do the OBS things after the actual release  
as described in the "Distribution" part.

I re-added the step  
"Create a new 'stable' branch"  
because I find it useful in practice  
to also have a git branch for each release  
because I assume that not only I but also other users  
are more used to deal with git branches  
(e.g. the usual 'git checkout branch' command)  
than to deal only with git tags.  
I think having also a git branch for each release  
costs nothing but is useful in practice for users.

`git checkout <tag>` works just as well.

It costs confusion to have two objects (branch and tag) with the same
name.

If you think it is simpler to have a branch than not to have it, please
describe whether `git checkout rear-2.5` checks out the branch named
`rear-2.5` or the tag named `rear-2.5`.

@pcahyna  
I will not do backward incompatible changes now for ReaR 2.8.  
I will release ReaR 2.8 backward compatible with ReaR 2.7.

We can re-organize our whole GitHub rear/rear repository  
for ReaR 3.0. This would be perfectly fine with me.  
But I will not do or implement such a change.  
Neither now for ReaR 2.8 nor later for ReaR 3.0.  
My reason:  
I am not at all a sufficient git expert to do it.

Above I asked for a method to restore a GitHub repository  
to a safed "good" state if the repository got messeg up  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238#issuecomment-2536458695>  
but I got ZERO help.

So do not expect that I will do anything regarding git.

Alternatively please step in now  
and do you the ReaR 2.8 release as you prefer it.  
I would much appreciate it if I had not to do the release.

@pcahyna given the broad range of git skills amongst our *users* I'd
prefer to keep things simple and optimize more for the inexperienced git
user than the expert.

Personally I'm actually grateful for your insights and consistent push
for more git proficiency. I just think that we can't expect that level
of motivation to dive deeply into git from all our users.

@jsmeix I really truly appreciate your effort and willingness to create
the release very much, so for me I'd always choose for you to continue
what you do and make a compromise somewhere else.

Open Source depends on individual's initiative and nothing is more
precious to me than that.

@schlomo that's exactly the point! We should not expect our user to know
whether Git prefers a tag or a branch when both of the same name exist.
I don't know the rules in this situation either. Therefore, it is better
to avoid the situation in the first place.

I did "the actual release" right now  
and I also created an additional "rear-2.8" branch  
as described in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process>

When creating that additional "rear-2.8" branch  
GitHub showed this popup text:

    A tag already exists with the provided branch name.
    Many Git commands accept both tag and branch names,
    so creating this branch may cause unexpected behavior.
    Are you sure you want to create this branch?

I confirmed to create the branch nevertheless  
but I have no idea what unexpected behavior  
this branch may cause.  
I guess a branch with same name as a tag may  
cause unexpected behavior when the branch  
contains different sources as what is tagged  
so `git checkout <branch_name>` would result  
something different than `git checkout <tag_name>`.  
But in this case here both the 'rear-2.8' branch  
and the 'rear-2.8' tag should (hopefully?)  
result the same.

what I did for the actual release:

Because 'git push --tags' did not push the empty commit  
with commit message 'ReaR 2.8 release'  
I had to do a subsequent plain 'git push'  
to also get that commit pushed.

accordingly plus comments so that we can clean up and  
improve things for ReaR 3.0 - ideally before the release

By the way:  
I think there is a typo in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt>

    ReaR 2.8 is supported on the following Linux operating systems:
         * Fedora 40, 41 (Silverblue not supported)
    ...
    ReaR 2.8 dropped official support for the following Linux operating systems:
         * Fedora < 39

I think the latter must be

         * Fedora < 40

break and thank you for your patience during this release. It was much
appreciated from us and the User Community will be grateful with this
new release after 2 years.

@gdha  
also to you a nice holiday break!

Thank you for your prompt fix at OBS.  
Now even I can see it - in retrospect:  
The reason why Ubuntu/Debian builds failed on OBS  
was that on OBS there was an old/outdated debian.compat  
while here at GitHub it was fixed two years ago via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2882>

I tried to fix the Ubuntu/Debian builds on OBS also for  
rear-2.7 in the same way (i.e. plain '10' in debian.compat)  
which makes it build on Debian\_12  
but other Ubuntu/Debian still fail.

@gdha  
thank you for also fixing Ubuntu/Debian builds on OBS  
for rear-2.7!

    Update the copyright file

by replacing the old/outdated debian.copyright on OBS  
with the current one at GitHub  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/debian/copyright>

Interestingly the current one at GitHub was not changed  
since 7 years

    # git log -p --follow packaging/debian/copyright
    commit 74787aa0b2e637bf129ee0f542733aa27accb084
    ...
    Date:   Sun Sep 24 06:15:51 2017 -0700

so it looks rather strange why the previous one at OBS  
was looking so strangely corrupted:

It looks as if something appended tons of those entries to it?

I fixed in Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.6  
the messed up debian.compat and debian.copyright  
with the files from Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.7  
so that now also rear-2.6 builds for Debian and Ubuntu  
BUT  
because rear-2.6 is re-built for all distributions  
the new build failes now there for

    # osc results -v Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.6 | grep failed
    ScientificLinux_7    x86_64    rear-2.6    failed
    RHEL_7               x86_64    rear-2.6    failed
    RHEL_7               ppc64     rear-2.6    failed
    RHEL_6               x86_64    rear-2.6    failed

same as now for rear-2.7

    # osc results -v Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.7 | grep failed
    ScientificLinux_7    x86_64    rear-2.7    failed
    RHEL_7               x86_64    rear-2.7    failed
    RHEL_7               ppc64     rear-2.7    failed
    RHEL_6               x86_64    rear-2.7    failed

and for rear-2.8

    # osc results -v Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.8 | grep failed
    ScientificLinux_7    x86_64    rear-2.8    failed
    RHEL_7               x86_64    rear-2.8    failed
    RHEL_7               ppc64     rear-2.8    failed

in rear-2.8 RHEL\_6 is disabled - otherwise it would also fail.

Regardless that it built for Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.8  
I also fixed therein the messed up debian.copyright  
with the file from Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.7

For the log:

Right now I tested on  
SLES 15 SP 6 with RAID1, LUKS, LVM, and default btrfs structure  
the released ReaR 2.8 built as RPM on the openSUSE Build Service  
<https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.8>  
for SLE 15 SP3 (the SLE service pack number does not matter for ReaR  
because ReaR is only bash scripts, e.g. SP3 versus SP6)  
on x86\_64 from the openSUSE Build Service RPM download location  
<http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_15_SP3/x86_64/rear-2.8-3.x86_64.rpm>

Now (with ReaR 2.8 RPM tested on rather complicated SLES15)  
it is really time for me to vacation!

@rear/contributors and all ReaR users who listen here:

I wish you a relaxed and recovering Christmas time  
and a Happy New Year!

@jsmeix thanks for the whole release process and all the fixes you did
along the way!

Merry Christmas and happy new year to you and everyone!

For the record: I tested a snapshot soon before the release on RHEL 8,
RHEL 9 and RHEL 10, both BIOS and UEFI (x86\_64 architecture), LVM
layout only.
