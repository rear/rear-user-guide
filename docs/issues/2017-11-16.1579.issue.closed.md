#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):**ReaR &gt;= 2.1**
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): **ANY**
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): **N/A**
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? **ANY**
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When restoring XFS (&gt;=4.7.0) filesystems during `rear recover`,
    mkfs.xfs returns (or similar):

<!-- -->

    Illegal value 0 for -l sunit option. value is too small

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Remove/update "illegal" value in */var/lib/rear/layout/xfs/\*.xfs*
    in ReaR recovery system, revert partition/mount changes done by
    ReaR, and run `rear recover` again, as described in
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1575\#issuecomment-344732487](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1575#issuecomment-344732487)

@gozora regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1575\#issuecomment-344915473](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1575#issuecomment-344915473)

Probably there is no "ultimate automated solution" in ReaR  
for such cases so that all what ReaR could do in an  
automated way is some "best effort guesswork".

I think in such cases ReaR should report to the user  
about its "best effort guesswork" changes e.g. via  
LogPrint (that output is only visible in verbose mode)  
or with LogPrintError for output that needs to be shown  
to the user in any case. This function name indicates that  
output that needs to be shown to the user in any case is  
(primarily) intended in case of (possible) errors e.g.:

<pre>
# Make the user aware when existing mkfs.xfs options are removed:
LogPrintError "Probably non-working mkfs.xfs option foo=bar removed"
</pre>

I've approached [XFS
upstream](https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg13135.html) with
this topic.  
So far I've got recommendation to use xfs\_copy, which I really can't
imagine to be used with BACKUP=NETFS ...  
I'll wait how and if the discussion will continue, maybe there will be
some light at the end of the tunnel ;-).

@gozora  
do you mean the front light of the train at the end of the tunnel ?  
;-)

@gozora  
as far as I understand "man xfs\_copy" it seems this could be  
more appropriate for the BLOCKCLONE backup method ?

In a similar way 'btrfs send' and 'btrfs receive' could be also  
appropriate for the BLOCKCLONE backup method.

All those filesystem-specific "whole-filesystem-cloning" tools  
are inappropriate for the "normal" file-based backup methods  
in ReaR like 'tar' or the usual third party backup tools.

Exactly `xfs_copy` does block level copy so if you have 1GB partition
you get 1GB backup (doesn't matter how filled), so yes this is much more
appropriate for BLOCKCLONE ...

According to my "man xfs\_copy" (for xfsprogs-4.3.0)

<pre>
The length of the resulting file is equal to the size
of the source filesystem. However, if the file is created
on an XFS filesystem, the file consumes roughly the
amount of space actually used in the source filesystem
by the filesystem and the XFS log. The space saving is
because xfs_copy seeks over free blocks instead of
copying them and the XFS filesystem supports
sparse files efficiently.
</pre>

it seems there could be space saving for the resulting file  
on any filesystem that supports sparse files efficiently ?

I've found nothing really interesting from XFS upstream :-/  
As I was studying XFS a bit last week, I think that best solution for
this problem to omit *-l sunit* when equal **0**.
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1603](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1603))

Btw. If one uses external XFS log, ReaR will ignore this fact during
recovery and creates log as internal.  
I'll try to fix this in upcoming days (but I'll certainly not make it
until ReaR 2.3).

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1603](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1603)
merged  
I consider this issue here to be fixed.

@gozora  
many thanks for all your work to fix and enhance  
the (complicated) XFS support in ReaR!
