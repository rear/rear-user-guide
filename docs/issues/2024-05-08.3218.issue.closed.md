-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I need to make a bootable ISO from my current local RHEL9 server with
all its configs and installed apps, so I can use the ISO file and
install RHEL9 on some other physical servers.

Please let me know if you need other information. Thanks.

@padua12345  
in your etc/rear/local.conf  
you use NETFS\_URL and NETFS\_SKIP\_WARNING  
but none of them is listed in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
so neither NETFS\_URL nor NETFS\_SKIP\_WARNING  
are ReaR user configuration variables.

NETFS\_SKIP\_WARNING does not appear anywhere in ReaR scripts  
so setting NETFS\_SKIP\_WARNING is useless as far as I can see.

NETFS\_URL appears in ReaR scripts in  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh:

    if [[ "$NETFS_URL" ]] ; then
        Log "Using NETFS_URL is deprecated. Use BACKUP_URL instead."
        BACKUP_URL=$NETFS_URL
    fi

so setting NETFS\_URL should work but I would recommend  
to use the current syntax.

For example on my test KVM/QEMU VM I use very often

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.178.66/nfs
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='rear'
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"

to recreate the system on another same KVM/QEMU VM, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-ReaR-2.7\#sles](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-ReaR-2.7#sles)  
where examples that are specific for SLES are shown,  
in particular with specific ReaR configuration settings  
for the special SLES default btrfs structure.

When you are new to ReaR  
and need some initial info how to use ReaR  
you may have a look at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/)  
therein in particular  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
(which is for OUTPUT=USB i.e. using a USB disk for ReaR)  
and the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
as some starting points.

When something fails for you,  
see the subsequent section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I am not a Red Hat user (I use SUSE SLES)  
so I cannot help with issues that are specific for RHEL.
