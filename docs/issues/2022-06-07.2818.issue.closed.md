-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Formatted USB-stick for UEFI using above local.conf:

    rear -D -c `pwd` format -- --efi /dev/sdb 

[rear-sm01-gneu\_format.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8853346/rear-sm01-gneu_format.log)

Prepared rescue system on first host and another one

    rear -D -c `pwd` mkrescue

[rear-sm01-gneu\_mkrescue.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8853350/rear-sm01-gneu_mkrescue.log)  
[rear-sm02-gneu\_mkrescue.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8853351/rear-sm02-gneu_mkrescue.log)

Booting from stick always runs automatically into the rescue system
prepared by the last host saved.  
But I exspected to be prompted for a choice between all the hosts saved!

This choice used to appear with version 2.5-1 on RHEL 7.6 (bios MBR).  
The structure of actual ../rear/syslinux.conf is identical to that
produced by version 2.5-1 mentioned above.  
But behavior is different!  
[syslinux.cfg.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8853357/syslinux.cfg.txt)

-   Workaround, if any:

Produce ISO boot file on each server and copy on demand to usb-stick.

I think this is because with EFI, one boots using GRUB and syslinux.conf
is not even used. This is unfortunate, we have other cases where the
GRUB menu does not offer the same functionality as the SYSLINUX/ISOLINUX
one.

On first glance this issue here seems to be  
same or at least similar to item '(b)' in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666)

See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648)

In current master code we have GRUB2\_DEFAULT\_BOOT  
in default.conf which is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3329](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3329)  
but I don't know if that is also used for UEFI  
and/or if it is of any use for this issue here.

@jsmeix: Yes, you may regard this issue as a duplicate to item '(b)' in
\#2666.

And imho GRUB2\_DEFAULT\_BOOT seems to be of no relevance to the goal to
open a "second level menu" for choosing one of multiple hosts after
choosing between unsecure or secure boot from rear.

I think this issue is sufficiently answered  
so I close it as "done" (we don't have a "duplicate" label)  
because this issue is as duplicate of item '(b)' in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666)  
which is intended to get implemented for ReaR 2.8
