Hi, this was reported as \#2681 . I know two solutions (besides reducing
the size of the initrd):

-   downgrading grub to a version between 2.02-121.el8 and
    grub2-1:2.02-141.el8 :
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681\#issuecomment-1697073572](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681#issuecomment-1697073572)
-   firmware update (helped on HP hardware, don't know if it will help
    on Dell hardware though)

Hi pcahyna , thanks for your reply  
we are in version grub2-2.02-142.el8\_7.1.x86\_64  
Unfortunatly , we can not downgrade to version 2.02-121.el8 . i ask to
upgrade the firmware of dell hardware in case ..  
but is there an other solution please to charge rear-iso file ?  
in fact we are using rubrik backup as third party backup tools  
thanks

What Dell hardware is it, exactly?

Hello  
i have tested on a cisco platform , and i have this version:
grub2-efi-x64-2.02-150.el8.x86\_64  
And i had no problem with rear iso file to load it .

Someone has any idea why it is not working on Dell Platform , ?

@sathyane007 this GRUB problem is apparently firmware (both manufacturer
and version) dependent, that's why. Have you tried updating it?

HI pcahyna thanks for your reply  
iDRAC Firmware Version | 6.10.30.00 which is not an old version  
do you think i need to upgrade for the latest one ?

not sure if UEFI firmware version is the same as the iDRAC firmware
version btw...

For example on my notebook, I get this in the `dmidecode` output:

    Handle 0x0031, DMI type 0, 24 bytes
    BIOS Information
            Vendor: ...
            Version: ...
            Release Date: ...
            Characteristics:
                    (...)
                    UEFI is supported
            BIOS Revision: 1.12
            Firmware Revision: 1.0

i confirm it still not working in idrac firmware 7.10.30 .  
@pcahyna : here is my dmidecode on my powerEdge R750:

Handle 0x0000, DMI type 0, 26 bytes  
BIOS Information  
Vendor: Dell Inc.  
Version: 1.11.2  
Release Date: 08/10/2023  
Address: 0xF0000  
Runtime Size: 64 kB  
ROM Size: 32 MB  
UEFI is supported  
BIOS Revision: 1.11  
Handle 0x0100, DMI type 1, 27 bytes  
System Information  
Manufacturer: Dell Inc.  
Product Name: PowerEdge R750

I cannot see the UEFI version or firmware revision version ?? (under
Bios Revision).

I guess BIOS version is also the UEFI firmware version, they are
probably not separate, so 1.11.2. And 08/10/2023 looks quite new.

so it works only if i remove firmware information on that iso file
(reducing it) but we have different hardware  
idreac dell firmware updated .. grub2 in version 1.50... any other think
to upgrade ?

@sathyane007 another idea... can you perhaps try if setting
`REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lzma"` produces a small enough initrd?

yes indeed this option (REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="lzma") reduced a
little the iso file (instead of 750MB , it reduce to 550M) but still
have the pb :(loader/i386/efi/linux.c:158:can't allocate initrd)

Hi @sathyane007 sorry for the late reply. This needs to be fixed in GRUB
provided in RHEL, so if you have a RHEL support contract, please open a
customer case and refer to
[https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-4389](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-4389)
. Also in the customer case mention the hardware (Dell PowerEdge R750)
and BIOS version. and the initrd size that did not work (550M).

Because "no news is good news" I assume this is meanwhile  
somehow solved (e.g. handled via Red Hat RHEL support)  
and its root cause is not in ReaR anyway.
