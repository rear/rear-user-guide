@jsmeix Thank you and I can assure you that rear still has a bright
future.  
Today I already used a rear rescue image twice to safe a production SPA
HANA cluster (after kernel rebuild) \[SLES for SAP 11 SP3\]

I also think that rear has a bright future.  
As far as I can imagine the number of rear users  
will increase very much in the near future.
