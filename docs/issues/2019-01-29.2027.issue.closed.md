**Question for SuSe**: again what applies for SLES today?

I think removing the `Group` tag would violate  
the "openSUSE:Specfile guidelines" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile\_guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines)  
that read (excerpts):

    Group: only package groups listed in the package group guidelines
    https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_group_guidelines
    should be used.

Regardless that the `Group` tag is not strictly required  
by the "openSUSE:Specfile guidelines" I remember that  
the `Group` tag is used at several places in SUSE and openSUSE  
(for example by the YaST/zypper/libzypp package installation tools).

At openSUSE there was a discussion about removing the `Group` tag  
see the "Killing Group tag in .spec files" mail thread  
on the opensuse-factory mailing list  
[https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-05/msg00460.html](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-05/msg00460.html)

According to  
[https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-05/msg00466.html](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-05/msg00466.html)  
it seems the `Group` tag is somehow mandatory for  
SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) related things and  
[https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-05/msg00498.html](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-05/msg00498.html)  
shows that it is required to build ReaR for older SLE versions  
so that at least for the near future the `Group` tag has to stay.

As in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2026\#issuecomment-458493458](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2026#issuecomment-458493458)  
I think we need to maintain several separated RPM spec files  
as needed for different Linux distributions.

As we build on OBS we must keep this group tag IMHO. We will not fix it.
