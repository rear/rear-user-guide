Hereby I ask for comments whether or not it could make sense  
to have a new "rear restoreonly" workflow as counterpart  
of "rear mkbackuponly".

The following issue triggered this RFC:  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-August/003414.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-August/003414.html)  
It reads (excerpts):

<pre>
> Is there a way to skip deleting the partitions?
> so just a way to then get REAR to copy the files back

... in the recovery system "rear recover" ... should
use the disk as is, only restore the backup and exit?

I.e. you ask for a counterpart of "rear mkbackuponly"
in the recovery system like "rear restoreonly"
</pre>

The main use-cases that I have in mind for "restoreonly"  
is the main use-case for GRUB\_RESCUE, see default.conf:

<pre>
The main reason for the GRUB_RESCUE functionality is
to be quickly able to recover a system
from soft errors (like deleting all of /lib/) without
digging out the rear recovery boot medium.
</pre>

After soft errors like deleting all of /lib/ there is no need  
to recreate partitioning and filesystems.

What is needed to recover from such soft errors is  
to get the tree of filesystems mounted at /mnt/local  
and then restore the backup therein.

After backup restore one needs probably additionally  
recreating the initrd and reinstalling the bootloader  
because after backup restore the kernel could have  
changed (replaced by an older kernel from the backup).

My personal interest is to try to clean up the currently  
single-big-and-fat "recover" workflow, see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-August/003418.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2016-August/003418.html)  
(excerpts)

<pre>
> ... by deactivating all entries
> in disklayout.conf one can skip successfully that during
> "rear recover" any partitions are deleted, created, and
> that any filesystems are created.

But what does not work is that when I only deactivate
the 'disk' and 'part' entries but keep the 'fs'
and 'swap' entries, then "rear recover" fails
...

Currently "rear recover" is not prepared to skip only
certain parts of partitioning and making filesystems.

... when I do partitioning plus creating filesystems
plus mounting alltogether at /mnt/local manually,
then "rear recover" proceeeds for me
... it restores the backup.

After backup restore it fails when installing the
bootloader (GRUB 2 in my case) so that
I also need to do this stuff manually
</pre>

It seems there are currently some "obscure"  
interdependencies in the whole "recover" workflow  
so that it either works as a whole or not at all.

I would like to investigate why that is and  
if I could clean it up so that separated parts  
of the "recover" workflow can run separated.

A "restoreonly" workflow would be only a nice  
side-effect of such an overall clean-up.

@jsmeix is that not the purpose of **real** backup software? Rear should
be strong in **DR**, and leave the restore of missing files to the
backup software. IMHO - we shouldn't please everybody.

Patches are always welcome, especially if they help some users without  
harming anybody else.

I also would not spend core team time on that right now.

Many thanks for your feedback!  
This is certainly not a high-priority issue for me.  
As time permits I will have a look if it can be done  
with reasonable effort and without the risk to  
cause regressions elsewhere.

It seems this one is the exact matching required counterpart  
if "Multiple Backup Methods" can be done as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-262981954](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-262981954)  
and subsequent comments.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091)  
provides an initial version of a restoreonly workflow  
that implements only what its name tells (strictly speaking):  
Currently it only restores - nothing more, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091\#issuecomment-263819775](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1091#issuecomment-263819775)  
where I also describe why I think it could be rather complicated  
to get the tree of filesystems mounted at /mnt/local.

Therefore I will not implement a full-featured  
restoreonly workflow soon which means I change  
this issue milestone back to "Rear future".

@jsmeix was this not implemented already?

A "restoreonly" workflow is implemented but  
that does not implement what is actually requested here,  
see my above comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987\#issuecomment-263856063](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/987#issuecomment-263856063)

To make it more clear what is actually requested here  
I change the subject of this issue from  
Have "rear restoreonly" as counterpart of "rear mkbackuponly"  
to  
Implement a backup restore workflow that can work on its own.
