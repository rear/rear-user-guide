We've installed the latest master.zip file on the partition.  
Once starting usr/sbin/rear mkbackup  
we get this error messages :

@mreubold  
in your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4072247/svpsgsap22rearlog.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4072247/svpsgsap22rearlog.txt)  
there is (excerpts):

    + source /root/ReaR/rear-master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh
    ++ echo 'lvmdev /dev/system /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part3 dLRKGv-c6qU-ycWp-EVwH-333U-Jhpn-XWhgRT 41535488'

    ++ echo 'lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part2 AT1inR-9ss0-vVPi-N6zs-afDm-8RyH-y5J3LD 83458048'

    ++ echo 'lvmvol /dev/system swap 2147483648b linear stripes:1'

So as far as I see from those log excerpts  
you should have those LVM entries in your  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf file

    lvmdev /dev/system /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part3 dLRKGv-c6qU-ycWp-EVwH-333U-Jhpn-XWhgRT 41535488
    lvmdev /dev/system /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part4 bOsEUv-9kAM-jx0l-U9HE-lQoj-Mvlr-jLyiUK 399360
    lvmdev /dev/sap_DS1_vg /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009e nG1ft9-2NPt-YnrT-J0N7-1qGm-uzbO-0LEwQY 209715200
    lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part2 AT1inR-9ss0-vVPi-N6zs-afDm-8RyH-y5J3LD 83458048
    lvmgrp /dev/system 4096 5118 20963328
    lvmgrp /dev/sap_DS1_vg 4096 25599 104853504
    lvmvol /dev/sap_DS1_vg sap_DS1_lv 53687091200b linear stripes:1
    lvmvol /dev/sap_DS1_vg sapmnt_DS1_lv 53682896896b linear stripes:1
    lvmvol /dev/system root 10737418240b linear stripes:1
    lvmvol /dev/system swap 2147483648b linear stripes:1

Please attach your var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf file  
if the LVM entries in your file are any different  
so I could see what there actually is in your disklayout.conf file.

So it seems you got a `lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2` entry  
in disklayout.conf that has neither a matching `lvmgrp`  
nor a `lvmvol` entry.

This case is currently considered that something has gone wrong  
while usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220\_lvm\_layout.sh  
saved your LVM layout into the disklayout.conf file, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/27e2f0c1041fd1b802749d6c66ec60936d762e0f](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/27e2f0c1041fd1b802749d6c66ec60936d762e0f)

For the resoning behind see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2259](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2259)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2291](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2291)

I am not really a LVM expert and I never experienced  
such a `#orphans_lvm` thingy in my simple LVM setups.

By Googling for `orphans_lvm` the only thing I found was  
[https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-lvm/2010-April/msg00026.html](https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-lvm/2010-April/msg00026.html)  
which reads (excerpt)

    Cc: LVM general discussion and development <linux-lvm redhat com>
    Subject: Re: [linux-lvm] what does 'orphan vg' mean?(global vg?)
    ...
    > >       While I was reading the lvm source code, I can't understand what

    > 
    > Orphan PV is device with PV label which is not attached to any Volume Group.
    > (IOW it is handled by LVM, but space on it is not yet allocatable.)
    > 
    > There is no such thing like Global VG in LVM2, only "global lock".
    > It is internal lock used to avoid parallel scanning of all devices.
    > (you will see it in vgscan command for example).

This description matches what there is in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4072247/svpsgsap22rearlog.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4072247/svpsgsap22rearlog.txt)  
(excerpts):

    + source /root/ReaR/rear-master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh
    ...
    ++ lvm pvdisplay -c
    ...
    +++ echo /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part2:#orphans_lvm2:83458048:-1:8:8:-1:0:0:0:0:AT1inR-9ss0-vVPi-N6zs-afDm-8RyH-y5J3LD
    ...
    ++ vgrp='#orphans_lvm2'
    ...
    ++ echo 'lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part2 AT1inR-9ss0-vVPi-N6zs-afDm-8RyH-y5J3LD 83458048'

So it seems my simple test that I added to  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
to verify that the 'lvm...' entries in disklayout.conf  
look syntactically correct is currently too strict because  
it causes false alarm for `orphans_lvm` entries.

Or alternatively perhaps `Orphan PV devices` should be already  
handled in layout/save/GNU/Linux/220\_lvm\_layout.sh  
so that they appear only as comments in disklayout.conf  
if it would be "the right thing" to do so with orphaned PVs  
(i.e. orphaned PVs would not be recreated during "rear recover").

@rmetrich @pcahyna  
could you please tell me what you think is best  
how to deal with `/dev/#orphans_lvm2` things?

Should orphaned PVs be listed as active entries in disklayout.conf like

    lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev/...

and ignored by the test in 950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
OR  
should they be only shown as comments in disklayout.conf like

    # lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev/...

if orphaned PVs should not be recreated during "rear recover" ?

@mreubold  
to test if "rear recover" works at all  
when there are active `lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev...`  
entries for orphaned PVs in disklayout.conf  
please disable the LVM test in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
e.g. just disable that whole script for the test by adding a line

    return 0

at its very beginning, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L247](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L247)  
and then try out if "rear -D recover" works for you even with the active

    lvmdev /dev/#orphans_lvm2 /dev/mapper/3600507638081001a480000000000009d_part2 AT1inR-9ss0-vVPi-N6zs-afDm-8RyH-y5J3LD 83458048

entry in your disklayout.conf file.

Hello,  
I attach the files in var/lib/rear/layout/.

In var/lib/rear/output there is no file. Hence I guess this issue blocks
the creation of iso file and so can't do any recovery test.  
Please let me know,  
Thanks,

backup is running with 950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh "disabled" and
