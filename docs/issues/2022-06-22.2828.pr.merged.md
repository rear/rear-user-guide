##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? Directly by invoking
    `rear format -- -b/--bios <device>`.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Found while testing \#2825.

According to `rear format -- --help`, this workflow should recognise
both `-b` and `--bios` options. This PR fixes the following error
message:

    # rear format -- -b /dev/vdb
    Use 'rear format -- --help' for more information.
    rear format failed, check /var/log/rear/rear-<redacted>.log for details

@lzaoral  
thank you for testing it and for your fix!

It seems that was forgotten in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9591fbf77c0c12329738625fcb83bb1d9b419b51](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9591fbf77c0c12329738625fcb83bb1d9b419b51)  
which links to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2705](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2705)

I guess it was not detected because the default hybrid boot  
when neither --bios nor --efi is specified has worked so far.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

@jsmeix Actually, I tried the `-b` option because the efi or hybrid boot
settings are broken on RHEL 7 at the moment. We are working on a fix
with @pcahyna ASAP since RHEL 7 has older release of `parted` that does
not support the `esp` keyword used here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/039b7b25566181bff8dd21648610e5625a33d036/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh\#L133](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/039b7b25566181bff8dd21648610e5625a33d036/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh#L133)

edit: better wording

@lzaoral  
if possible feel free to solve it by a simple fallback behaviour like

        # Set the right flag for the EFI partition:
        LogPrint "Setting 'esp' flag on EFI partition $RAW_USB_DEVICE$current_partition_number"
        if ! parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE set $current_partition_number esp on ; then
            LogPrintError "Failed to set 'esp' flag on EFI partition $RAW_USB_DEVICE$current_partition_number"
            # E.g. parted in RHEL 7 does not support to set the 'esp' flag so we try a fallback:
            if ! FALLBACK COMMAND ; then
                Error "..."
            fi
            LogPrintError "Did ... as fallback on EFI partition $RAW_USB_DEVICE$current_partition_number"
        fi

The LogPrintError() function should be used in general for  
all important messages that should appear in the log file  
and also on the user's terminal regardless whether or not  
the user launched 'rear' in verbose mode, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L487](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L487)

In particular when there was already a LogPrintError message  
then subsequent messages that are related to that LogPrintError
message  
must also be shown to the user as LogPrintError messages  
to ensure the user gets them on his terminal regardless  
whether or not he launched 'rear' in verbose mode.

@jsmeix, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but during testing of
the fix for the `esp` keyword in `parted` on an EFI machine, I found out
another regression :/.

The `--efi` option by default creates a `msdos` partition table unless I
set `USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt` in `/etc/rear/local.conf`which was
caused by 9591fbf77c0c12329738625fcb83bb1d9b419b51 and which is in clear
contradiction with the documentation in
`usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` and is also a change in behaviour
present in ReaR 2.6:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/5e1ca54e119f016a366bbae6501ff48bec575e64/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L971-L978](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/5e1ca54e119f016a366bbae6501ff48bec575e64/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L971-L978)

@lzaoral  
no need to be sorry.  
I appreciate your news very much!  
And actually it is good news because it is good to know bugs  
before we release ReaR 2.7 so we can fix them which is good  
for our users and also good for us because we get less issues  
when many users use ReaR 2.7.

Could you please have a look at my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829)  
whether or not it makes things work for you  
without the need to explictily specify the right  
USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL value in etc/rear/local.conf

Because this pull request is merged I suggest to continue in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829)  
with what belongs to that subsequent issue.

And for the other subsequent issue above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2828\#issuecomment-1164134153](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2828#issuecomment-1164134153)  
please submit a new separated pull request.
