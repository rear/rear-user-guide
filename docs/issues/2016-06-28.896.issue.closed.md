-   Brief description of the issue  
    At the end of the restore, REAR installs grub on all the "disks".  
    If a whole disk is used a physical devices, then the LVM metadata
    are overwritten.  
    After the reboot, the server hangs with:

    ### 

    Setting up Logical Volume Management: Couldn't find device with uuid
    BYblWm-WqbM-XR73-xL5M-h6ah-XXXXX-XXXXX.

    ### 

    REAR shouldn't install grub on disks that are physical volumes

-   Work-around, if any

@stermeau The BOOT\_OVER\_SAN related code was never 100% finished due
to no HW to test to improve the existing code. The consultancy done so
far ended without extension, so it is very hard for me to improve code
(or add missing pieces), if I cannot spent time on it (via consultancy
or sponsoring). It is like it is - it is not polished yet.  
Of course, you are free to create pull requests to improve the code
where needed. If possible, I can assist, but I will not be in the
driving seat if I'm not paid for it (to define the proper expectations).

@gdha @stermeau

I will provide a pull request solving an error in efibootmgr on
BOOT\_over\_SAN soon. Maybe is a similar problem with /dev/mapper
devices. I can check this tomorrow and maybe provide pull request also
with this problem solved.

@stermeau can you provide (rear -vd recover) logs?  
Regards,  
Didac

Hi,

@didacog , I have attached the log. Thanks for your help.  
[rear.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/337763/rear.txt)

@gdha, the server is not booting from SAN. From my point of view, after
line 65 of 21\_install\_grub.sh ( same thing in 22\_install\_grub2.sh),
if the disk is a physical volume, it should be skipped.  
I will give it a try to submit a pull request if it works

@stermeau I will deepen a little bit more this weekend, I had issues
with efibootmgr but 21\_install\_grub.sh gets disk info in other manner.

Sorry but this week I'm quite busy... I will test few things this
weekend and update the issue.

@stermeau I noticed that you serious modified the local.conf file, but
please check script `prep/GNU/Linux/24_include_multipath_tools.sh`. If
you could improve its content then you would make me a happy man.

@gdha I have updated the pull request.

Yes my local.conf is quite customized.  
Still /etc/multipath and /bindings /etc/multipath.conf are already
referenced in 24\_include\_multipath\_tools.sh. So this is actually
useless.  
The MODULES\* are specific to my environment with QLA cards.  
I think it would make sense to have the following added

     # To properly discover multipath devices

    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( "${PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT[@]}" /sbin/multipathd )

     # When using TSM

    POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT='cp /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD /mnt/local/etc/adsm'

@stermeau Pull request was accepted - thank you for this.  
Concerning the multipath stuff: I guess you want the daemon to be
executed when you boot from the rear image - that is a good point indeed
and can be implemented.  
However, you lost me with the TSM stuff: is this something what is
missing in the current TSM hooks within rear? Wasn't this not restored
by TSM itself?

@stermeau can this be closed?
