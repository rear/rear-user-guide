@schlomo  
could you have a look if that change could cause  
any kind of subtle unexpeted side-effect because  
we have same kind of code also in other scripts

<pre>
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/240_swaps_layout.sh
    done &lt; &lt;(cat /proc/swaps)

usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh
    done &lt; &lt;(cat $LAYOUT_FILE)

usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/510_set_capabilities.sh
done &lt; &lt;(cat $capabilities_file)

usr/share/rear/restore/BLOCKCLONE/default/510_set_capabilities.sh
done &lt; &lt;(cat $capabilities_file)
</pre>

so that I have a dim feeling there might be actually  
a valid reason for that overcomplicated looking construct?

The reason is to be able to set variables in the `while` loop that are
valid afterwards. `<(<` doesn't exist while `$(<`does. If the `while`
loop is part of a pipe then it is in a subprocess and variables set
there don't affect the mother process of the actual script.

So in these specific examples it will probably be OK to replace the
subshell with a plain `< some_file`, if we have a filter or more code in
the subprocess then not.

It might be that I used the same pattern even in places where it was not
strictly necessary.

To illustrate:

    katar:~ schlomoschapiro$ unset baz ; while read foo bar ; do echo XX $foo YY $bar ; baz=$foo ; done < <(< /etc/shells ) ; declare -p baz
    -bash: declare: baz: not found
    katar:~ schlomoschapiro$ unset baz ; while read foo bar ; do echo XX $foo YY $bar ; baz=$foo ; done < <(cat /etc/shells ) ; declare -p baz
    XX # YY List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
    XX # YY Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
    XX # YY one of these shells.

@schlomo  
I fail to understand how `command < <( < /some/file )`  
is meant to work.

Reasoning:

`< /some/file` redirects STDIN but does not output anything.

Accordingly the `command <( < /some/file )` process substitution  
would provide the output of `< /some/file`  
to be read by `command` from a FIFO file name argument  
in the form `command FIFO_file_name`  
e.g. `command /dev/fd/123`  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1658\#issue-283891743](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1658#issue-283891743)  
therein what `diff -U0 ...` reports which actual files `diff` gets.

But there is no output of `< /some/file`  
so that nothing can be read by `command` (except EOF).

In the end this way any `command` finishes immediately, e.g.:

<pre>
# time head -v -c 2 < <( < /dev/urandom )
==> standard input <==

real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s
</pre>

But this pull request is not about to replace

<pre>
command < <( cat /some/file )
</pre>

by a non-working

<pre>
command < <( < /some/file )
</pre>

Instead this pull request is about to simplify

<pre>
command < <( cat /some/file )
</pre>

by

<pre>
command < /some/file
</pre>

i.e. by elimiating the needless `cat` plus FIFO in between  
and let `commnad` directly read from the file.

I think this simplification can only make things work better  
because an actual regular file is e.g. seekable in contrast  
to a FIFO stream (according to the 'ESPIPE' error in "man lseek")  
so that even more things work when using regular files directly.

@schlomo  
in your example in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1633\#issuecomment-350695491](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1633#issuecomment-350695491)  
did you perhaps mean a non-working way  
where a variable is set in a separated sub-process like

<pre>
# unset var ; cat /etc/shells | { var=hello ; head -v -n 2 ; } ; declare -p var
==> standard input <==
/bin/ash
/bin/bash
-bash: declare: var: not found
</pre>

versus working ways  
where a variable is set in the same process like

<pre>
# unset var ; { var=hello ; head -v -n 2 ; } < <( cat /etc/shells ) ; declare -p var
==> standard input <==
/bin/ash
/bin/bash
declare -- var="hello"

# unset var ; { var=hello ; head -v -n 2 ; } < /etc/shells ; declare -p var
==> standard input <==
/bin/ash
/bin/bash
declare -- var="hello"
</pre>
