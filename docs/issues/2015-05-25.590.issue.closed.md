OS - CentOS 6.6 x86\_x64  
Hardware - ESXi 5.1 on HP Proliant DL160 G6  
REAR 1.17

10.11.0.150 --- Bareos Server (testbackup-bareos)  
10.11.0.151 --- Bareos Client (testbackup-client-01)(There is bareos-fd)

This ip addresses are static and this hosts have only one network
interface - eth0.

\[root@testbackup-client-01 ~\]\# uname -r  
2.6.32-504.16.2.el6.x86\_64

Going to 10.11.0.151 (Bareos Client) and backup it:

yum -y install nfs-utils genisoimage syslinux rear  
mkdir /etc/rear/mappings  
echo "eth0 10.11.0.151/24" &gt; /etc/rear/mappings/ip\_addresses  
echo "default 10.11.0.1 eth0" &gt; /etc/rear/mappings/route  
vi /etc/rear/local.conf

###### 

There is config. Link -  
[http://pastebin.com/b3Hn1awQ](http://pastebin.com/b3Hn1awQ)

###### 

Comparing to the default rear local.conf file I edit only lines:  
BACKUP=BAREOS  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BAREOS\_CLIENT=testbackup-client-01-fd  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://10.11.0.150/backup  
USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=y

vi /etc/bareos/bconsole.conf

Director {  
Name = testbackup-bareos-dir  
DIRport = 9101  
address = 10.11.0.150  
Password = "1FlpWEdFUIgbewhedsGGHJgbedsf""  
}

This is ok. bconsole work.

Then begin backup process:

Size of rear-testbackup-client-01.iso is 34191360 bytes

Log file:  
/var/log/rear/rear-testbackup-client-01.log ---

When I boot from rear-testbackup-client-01.iso and choose Recovery
testbackup-client-01 then I've got a error:  
![screen
error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12595731/7797447/e3b1e416-02f4-11e5-9a44-7a992ecb7e32.png)

telinit: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote
application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy
blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection
was broken.  
init: rcS post-stop process (47) terminated with status 1

I don't know how to fix it.

Thanks

@sohmstyle According a RH Knowledge Article:  
\*\*  
Check for the existence of `/etc/passwd`  
Check for the existence of `/etc/nsswitch.conf` and check the content  
If `/etc/passwd` does not exists, replace it from backup as described in
the resolution above  
\*\*  
It sounds not very applicable, but you never know...  
Could you also reduce the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file to the bare
minimum?

    BACKUP=BAREOS
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BAREOS_CLIENT=testbackup-client-01-fd
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.11.0.150/backup
    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y

And try again?

Thanks!

And then I encountered a problem with "Error The LSB package is not
installed."  
There is same problems
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/496](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/496),
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/468](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/468),
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326)  
I tried the solution of those posts, but they did not help.  
I hope it will be possible to solve the problem with LSB package.
