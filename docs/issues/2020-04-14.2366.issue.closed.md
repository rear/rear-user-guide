Hello REAR community,

We have EMC networker used as the backup solution in our environment. I
am trying to integrate REAR into that. So I included the following in
the site.conf file.

    # cat site.conf | grep -v "^#"
    BACKUP=NSR
    OUTPUT=ISO
    MODULES_LOAD=(vmxnet)
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/boot'  '/'  'swap' '/dev')
    MANUAL_INCLUDE=YES

I know the Networker running in this server is working fine and the
regular backups are been done.  
So when I ran the "rear -vD mkbackup" as root on the command line I got
the following error.

    # rear -vD mkbackup
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-lnxjump01.log
    Creating disk layout
    Excluding mountpoint /nmon_data. (MANUAL_INCLUDE mode)
    Creating root filesystem layout
    EMC Networker will recover these filesystems: / /nmon_data /boot
    Copying files and directories
    Copying binaries and libraries
    Copying kernel modules
    Creating initramfs
    Making ISO image
    Wrote ISO image: /var/lib/rear/output/rear-lnxjump01.iso (141M)
    Saving result files with NSR (EMC NetWorker)
    ERROR: Could not save result files with save
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-lnxjump01.log for details
    Terminated

Looking at the log I see this:

    Trace 0: /usr/sbin/rear:251 main
    Trace 1: /usr/share/rear/lib/mkbackup-workflow.sh:24 WORKFLOW_mkbackup
    Trace 2: /usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh:70 SourceStage

    Trace 5: /usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:132 StopIfError
    ++ echo 'Message: Could not save result files with save'
    Message: Could not save result files with save

Any ideas why this is happening? I will attach the complete log.

Thank you for all your support given so far for my other support
cases.

So I figured out what the problem is (I hope) but not the solution. REAR
is writing to the Networker storage pool "Default" but our pool name is
A0C3-S. I do not know where I should change that on REAR.

Hello Support,

I was able to point REAR to the correct pool by changing the following
parameter to the value shown.

NSR\_DEFAULT\_POOL\_NAME=A0C3-S

However, I have a query which I will post as a separate issue by closing
this issue.

Thank you,
