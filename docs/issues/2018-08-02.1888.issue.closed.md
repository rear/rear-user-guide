@langerkunal  
you wrote "I am trying to recover the backup image on a new hardware".

Is your "new hardware" fully compatible with the hardware  
of your original system where "rear mkbackup" was run?  
Cf. the section "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Provided your "new hardware" is fully compatible with the hardware  
of your original system where "rear mkbackup" was run  
I need at least the debug log file for "rear -D recover"  
to have a chance to understand what goes on  
on your particular system.  
Ideally I would need what is described in the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@langerkunal  
I noticed right now that you use

<pre>
BACKUP_URL=file:///tmp/rearbackup/
</pre>

which looks as if your backup is on a local disk on the original
system  
so that it cannot work to restore that on any other system  
or do I misunderstand something here?

@jsmeix For some reason NFS mount wasn't working in my environment so I
took the backup on local system and then copied the backup files to a
different system, from there I booted using DVD/CD (ISO) to start
recovery  
Attached recover.log file for reference.

@langerkunal Can you share the content of
`/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` please?

@langerkunal because all your storage devices are multipath devices you
should add `AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n` to the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file
as currently they are excluded by default
