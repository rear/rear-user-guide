On openSUSE and SLE rear &gt;= 1.18 plus 'ebiso' must be used  
to make the rear recovery system ISO image bootable on UEFI.

With rear 1.18 one must explicitly specify in /etc/rear/local.conf  
that 'ebiso' is used to make the ISO image - otherwise it fails (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/804](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/804)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/801](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/801)).

This issue here is an enhancement request to automate it in a future  
rear version to use ebiso `if is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/801](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/801)).

@jsmeix Does the latest SLES (or OpenSuSE) fixed the `genisoimage` rpm
to boot from on UEFI, or is `ebiso` still a requirement?

As far as I know ebiso is still a requirement.

Furthermore I would prefer ebiso over genisoimage  
because ebiso is known to work in practice and  
I even know the one who makes ebiso personally  
and I know he makes it "just work" (in contrast to  
the genisoimage uncertainity at SUSE/openSUSE).

@gozora  
again many thanks for your relatively simple,  
straightforward, and "just working" ebiso!

@jsmeix is the above statement still true? ebiso of @gozora was/is a
blessing for SLES for sure, but it seems incredible that SLES does not
fixes this in their base OS.

No idea if something meanwhile changed  
and no time for investigation  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799\#issuecomment-531247109](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799#issuecomment-531247109)  
so I just close it as "can't fix" to get it out of sight.
