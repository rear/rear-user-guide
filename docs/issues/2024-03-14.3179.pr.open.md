##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Migration of Fedora Linux system to different hardware (different
    NICs). With this patch, the network connections are preserved and
    functional after recovery, even though the NICs have different names
    and different MAC adresses.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Migrate NM keyfiles during network conf migration. See
    [https://fedoramagazine.org/converting-networkmanager-from-ifcfg-to-keyfiles/](https://fedoramagazine.org/converting-networkmanager-from-ifcfg-to-keyfiles/)
    for more details on NetworkManager keyfiles.  
    Only MAC addresses and interface names are migrated for now.  
    TODO: migrate also IP addresses and routes.

Regarding "TODO: migrate also IP addresses and routes."

Is it worth supporting migration of IP addresses and routes? What is the
use case? I suppose it is for machine cloning to several not completely
identical (different network address) copies, as I don't see how it is
useful for the typical use of ReaR (disaster and recovery) where you
need an identical address after recovery. Would it be acceptable to
remove this feature (say in ReaR 3.0)?

@pcahyna  
offhandedly I don't know what the use case is  
for migration of IP addresses and routes.

My guess is similar as yours that at some time in the past  
someone (mis?)used ReaR for migration of networking setup?

Perhaps (also only a guess) the idea behind is to use ReaR  
to migrate a system from one environment into a different  
environment, for example from bare metal hardware in one  
network environment to a VM in another network environment  
or something like that?

On the one hand ReaR has too many (often half-baked) features  
that are almost never used in practice (and bit-rotting)  
so I would like to drop corner-case features that are not  
sufficiently well implemented and basically unmaintained  
at ReaR upstream because it is a nightmare to maintain  
when customers have issues with such features.

On the other hand such features can be a starting point for  
further development to get them sufficiently well implemented  
so such features could become business opportunities when  
customers want to pay for further development.

I think the solution out of this conflict is  
deprecation via `ErrorIfDeprecated()`.

This way we learn via somewhat enforced user feedback  
which of those features are actually in use and  
we can ask back those users what their use-case is  
so we better understand those corner-case features  
and then we can make an informed decision  
what to do with each individual corner-case feature  
(drop it, keep it as is, further develop it).

@pcahyna  
could you by the way show $network\_config\_file values  
in user output messages with `'` to make it clear  
when a single value consists of more than one word.

As far as I see it is those two code places

    Log "Wrote new MAC addresses and network interfaces in $network_config_file"
    ...
    LogPrintError "Failed to rewrite MAC addresses and network interfaces in $network_config_file"

that should be enhanced to

    Log "Wrote new MAC addresses and network interfaces in '$network_config_file'"
    ...
    LogPrintError "Failed to rewrite MAC addresses and network interfaces in '$network_config_file'"

I supposed the idea was to use ReaR for cloning, i.e. backup a machine
once and then restore it to multiple instances, each one will then need
a different IP address. It seems though that according to the commit
message of 844d50b75ac4b7722f4fee7a5ee3350b93f3adb7 by @schlomo where
this functionality was introduced, they had indeed rather the idea of
"migrating bare metal hardware in one network environment to a VM in
another network environment" in mind.

Oh yes, that was the first version of migration support developed for
P2V.

I now pushed another change, 5ea58a7f91d80aa2dbe4da16802ab2a8c46b28a5,
for a proper test for an empty array. Unfortunately, the code is now
untested, as I have not tested with this change.
