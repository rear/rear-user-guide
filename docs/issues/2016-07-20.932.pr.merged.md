see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/931](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/931)  
and  
some other fixes:

-   first steps to be prepared for 'set -e' which means  
    replaced COMMAND ; StopIfError  
    with COMMAND || Error
-   in output/PXE/default/82\_copy\_to\_net.sh  
    error out in case of "Problem transferring..."  
    for each result file (before it only errors out  
    in case of "Problem transferring..." for the last  
    result file because the Errot was after the for loop)

After I slept on it I still think this is the right thing to do.  
Therefore I merge it.
