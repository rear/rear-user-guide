##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): Unfortunately, the RHEL Jira
    ticket cannot be made public.

-   How was this pull request tested? ppc64le RHEL 8 on baremetal Power
    9 machine

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Modern PowerNV systems with the OPAL firmware do not require the
presence of the PPC PReP boot partition \[1,2\]. Therefore, the
installation of GRUB2 should be made optional on these machines if such
partition does not exist. As long as the GRUB2 configuration is created
successfully, Petitboot will be able to load it and boot the restored
system.

This PR makes sure that PowerNV machines will fallback on GRUB2 if no
PPC PReP boot partitions were found and also skips GRUB2 installation in
such case.

Done. By default, the resulting squashed commit should contain all
respective commit messages, thus, no piece of information should be
lost. On the other hand, I'd argue that squash-merge is a rather
inconvenient practice, especially when you want to revert something
later.

From what I read in the initial description  
this issue is not actually a bug in ReaR  
but an enhancement because it improves ReaR.

Please do not use "squash and merge" unless really necessary, that is if
the intermediate steps are wrong and you want to discard such history.
Contributors often split their contributions into several commits for
valid reasons and they would be disappointed to see this work discarded
by a final squash.

@pcahyna  
I think I remember that some time ago  
you had recommended "squash and merge" to me?

When "squash and merge" is used the merge commit message  
must tell the whole story sufficiently.

The advantage - as far as I understood - is to have  
in the master branch simple and straightforward commits  
without possibly many unneeded "noise" commits that  
were done during development?

Unfortunately I don't remember the context in which I made that
suggestion, but I don't think I suggested it as a general method that
should be always used, rather as a solution for a particular scenario.

Yes, but only when the commits are indeed "unneeded noise". Sometimes
(and in my case, it is nearly always) I intend the commits to be in the
final history and tailor them appropriately. Also, I often tell to
people to at least split "by the way" changes (like
style/formatting/spelling changes and cleanups) that they make when
changing something else into separate commits (if they don't want to
open multiple PRs for this, which I understand), as unrelated changes do
not belong in one commit. This effort would be lost if one squashed the
stuff together at the end.

I think it is safe to use "squash and merge" on your own PRs when you
know that you (as the author) don't want the intermediate steps, but not
on other contributors' PRs unless requested.

I would like to merge the PR today unless there are further suggestions
for improvements.
