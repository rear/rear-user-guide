-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): n/a
-   Brief description of the issue: when `hostname` contains a dot the
    `HOSTNAME` variable in rescue mode is different then in
    mkrescue/mkbackop mode (within rear)
-   Work-around, if any:

<!-- -->

    # hostname
    client.box
    # hostname -s
    client
    # uname -n
    client.box

Internally, REAR defines a HOSTNAME as `hostname -s`, but REAR writes
the `uname -n` to the `rootfs/etc/HOSTNAME` file. In recover mode the
`/etc/HOSTNAME` file is used to define the `HOSTNAME` variable, which is
**not** the same as initially.

As a result the `/var/log/rear/rear-$HOSTNAME.log` is not found.

The issue is marked as "fixed"  
so that I asssume it can be closed.
