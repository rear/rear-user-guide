#### Editor problems in Recovery Mode

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL6
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): -
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue: Editing the local.conf for
    encryption key in recovery mode not simple possible because the
    editors are working different than in the normal system.
-   Work-around, if any: None

Is there a bug with the vi or nano program for editing files in the
recovery mode?

For me 'vi' works o.k. in the ReaR recovery system.

The ReaR recovery system is a very minimal system  
so that you cannot expect this or that "comfort" that  
you may have in a normal running full featured system.

Perhaps it may help to understand your particular issue  
when you even describe what exactly you mean with  
"editors are working different than in the normal system"?

Well my problem is, that when i edit an file not only by adding a new
line but by editing an existing line you should see some strange
happening. this happens in nano a lot. and the vi insert does not work
for me.

@dcz01 Your error description is not complete I'm afraid. Which console
are you using? Physical console or KVM, VirtualBox, vSphere, or
something else? iLO perhaps? Which keyboard language are you using? Is
there a mismatch between keystrokes and what you normally expect?

Yes i'm using vSphere for an test restore and in this console i'm
editing the file with this error/happening.  
I use always german keyboard layout.  
Should i use anything else?

The first picture shows the file in normal with an ssh login.  
The second shows the error only by getting over the writing with the
arrow keys.

@gdha I hope the description and the screenshots can help you to find
the problem or to follow.

@dcz01 So you are using `nano`, right? I'm thinking we are missing some
necessary files from nano.

@gdha Yes right, i'm using nano always. But the problem occours with vi
too...  
Maybe it could be the console mode like you said. I'll test it today
with an recovery with ReaR.

@gdha The problem or bug/error happens in the normal console by the
physical server too.  
But could this come from files which are not present in recovery?

I have seen this as well.  
REAR 2.00

It is NOT just a nano problem, it looks to be related to the video
driver or something.

using a HP 380 gen 7 with a recovery disk off an ibm rack, the boot
starts.  
whilst the kernel is initing jumps about, text goes large.  
finally at the REAR recovery menu screen it is VERY SLOW on video
refresh, but fully visible.

if you then select rear recovery and press to edit the line, the cursor
does not track the characters correctly, jumping back several spaces or
overwriting with other parts of the line.  
each backward movement takes 1 second to execute.

after booting , nano is messed up on editing. the screen is shifted as
per the image by about 50 %  
when you move to a line it jumps to the left.

If you go into the rear hardware inspection system from the rear screen,
it is as if the thing is running on a 1960's computer, every screen
refresh can be seen.  
Like watching the green screen cursor moving from left to right whilst
the scren redraws.

@razorfish-sl @gdha Yes, i think that must be exactly my problem.  
But what can i do then? Integrate more drivers or programs?

check your video parameters being passed about.  
try setting it to the most basic suport.

<pre>
... the boot starts.
whilst the kernel is initing jumps about, text goes large.
finally at the REAR recovery menu screen ...

While the ReaR recovery system boot screen is shown  
the kernel does not run, cf.

Only as a blind guess - perhaps that is somehow related:  
You may have a look at

now...

@jsmeix @gdha @razorfish-sl  
Now i think i found the solution.  
Is it possible to implement this to the start of the recovery system?  
`export TERM=linux`

@dcz01  
the scripts in the usr/share/rear/skel directory are those  
that are run during ReaR recovery system startup phase.  
In our current GitHub master code in those scripts I found

    # find usr/share/rear/skel -type f | xargs grep 'TERM='

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/profile:
    export TERM=ansi

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service:
    Environment=TERM=vt100

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service:
    Environment=TERM=linux

The different `TERM` values that are set here  
indicate that something at least looks inconsistent  
regarding the `TERM` value in our ReaR recovery system.

FYI:  
In other scripts I find

    usr/share/rear/restore/ZYPPER/default/980_initial_network_setup.sh:
    chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "yes '' | TERM=dumb yast2 --ncurses lan add name=eth0 ethdevice=eth0 bootproto=dhcp" || true

    usr/share/rear/restore/NSR/default/400_restore_with_nsr.sh:
    TERM=linux nsrwatch -p 1 -s $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server ) </dev/tty8 >/dev/tty8 &

    usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:
    TERM=dumb $@ 2>&1 | sed -rn 's/^[^0-9\.]*([0-9]+\.[-0-9a-z\.]+).*$/\1/p' | head -1
