-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.1.x
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): ubuntu16
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    In my rear-automated-testing environment (in centos7) I use the
    following entry to keep the network alias names with the kernel
    option:

<!-- -->

    KERNEL_CMDLINE="$KERNEL_CMDLINE net.ifnames=0"

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue: ubuntu vagrant box uses
    **biosdevnames** for network interfaces and not the alias *eth*
    names

<!-- -->

    root@client:~# ip addr show enp0s8
    3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 08:00:27:e0:e7:04 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 192.168.33.10/24 brd 192.168.33.255 scope global enp0s8

-   Work-around, if any:  
    I used another local.conf file without the KERNEL\_CMDLINE line, so
    we keep using the biosdevnames in client/server and recover VMs.

That is tedious and stupid, therefore, IMHO we better do some
auto-detection of biosdevnames and

-   add the KERNEL\_CMDLINE lines automatically, or
-   propose the user to add the KERNEL\_CMDLINE line himself

PS: this is also related to previous issues \#951 and \#1020

@gdha, I think adding KERNEL\_CMDLINE `with net.ifname=0 `won't help if
the original system is using `biosdevname`.  
When booting on ReaR rescue, network configuration script will look at
interface name `enp0s8` (Name on the original system) But because of
`net.ifname=0`, Interfaces name will be named `eth0`.  
So even when trying to recover on the same machine (same HW, no
migration) ReaR recover cannot find the interface.

I usually don't like when an application force the user to modify the
current system.  
We should add `net.ifname` to KERNEL\_CMDLINE only if it is present on
the KERNEL CMDLINE option of the system to backup. (Checking
/proc/cmdline).

Moreover, as I explain in \#1020 there is several way to activate
**biosdevname**. One is a script managed by systemd (which override
KERNEL net.ifname parameter if I remember well).

IMHO we should rethink the way we are assigning IP address in the
recovery image (based on MAC).  
I think creating some function that mimic `ip` command but with MAC
instead of device name could help.

    ip_mac a add 10.1.1.1/24 dev 00:01:02:03:04:05

This wrapper function will look for interface name with
00:01:02:03:04:05 MAC and then run the real `ip` command with the good
interface name (could be eth0 eth1 enp1s2 etc...)

If the MAC address cannot be found, then we should ask the user to
choose the interface from a list.

This can be also useful for new system like ubuntu, rhel7 ... which has
drop undev/70-persistent-net rules. Today, when you migrate a "multi
inet" rhel7 to a NEW system (means new MAC)\`, inet migration is not
detected and IP is "blindly" assign to the same inet name (eth0 for
exemple.. You need to be sure to get the inet in the same order (easy
for VM, less for Bare metal system with 1GB for admin, 10Gb or even 40Gb
for production.... the order will be given by the kernel module load
order.)

My final thought in one sentence: It is time to rethink the network
configuration / migration part. (Today mostly based on device name,
based on udev persitent-net rules which are now dropped in distro like
ubunu & redhat.)

@schabrolles I fully understands the business concerns, however, we
should not rush and change blindly our network scheme to a new model as
we may potentially break more then we fix.  
For example, in a SAP HANA environment we can have 6 or more network
interfaces - in case we do a migration to another HW then it could be a
nightmare for the administrator to guess which is the proper interface
based on the MAC addresses to choose from to perform the recovery. IMOH
asking which interface is not always useful as he/she just does not know
the answer on front. He/she probably have to test it manually or on
sight by investigating which interface should get the IP address
assigned to.

I do agree with have to prepare ourselves for new challenges that come
along with network layer.

@gdha, don't worry, I don't want to change blindly everything in the
network scheme but may be propose some evolution in order to use the
latest distro.

I don't understand your point regarding SAP HANA migration with 6
adapters:

-   Currently, during a migration, some question are ask to the user to
    choose the new interface (devname mac are prompt to the user). This
    mean that the user needs to know on which new adapter he has to
    place the old network adapter. On the target eth0 will not necessary
    have the same name (order is not guaranteed ), and the only meaning
    of eth0 is the fact to be the first interface detected by the kernel
    (which has no interest for the user). So the only possibility for
    the user to choose the good interface is to use MAC or biosdevname
    (PCI location).
-   Worse: if the OS doesn't have an `udev-net-rules` there is no
    migration and network configuration will be blindly applied :

extract from 55-migrate-network-devices.sh

    # get the rule files (though it should be only one)
    RULE_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/*persistent*{names,net}.rules )
    ORIG_MACS_FILE=/etc/mac-addresses
    MAC_MAPPING_FILE=/etc/rear/mappings/mac
    MANUAL_MAC_MAPPING=

    test "$RULE_FILES" || return 0 # skip this process if we don't have any udev rule files

But let this migration point aside for the moment. We still have an
issue during recovery on the same system when a user disable
`biosdevname` on the original OS. Unfortunately, because KERNEL option
are not automatically applied on the Rescue image (\#1420), the network
interfaces are renamed following the default `biosdevname`, and because
no migration occurred (no udev-rules-file), ReaR cannot setup the
network (ip command with device name hardcoded in
60-network-devices.sh).

Solutions / workaround:

-   use KERNEL\_CDMLINE to add 'net.ifname=0'. This could be automated
    by ReaR only if the option is detected in `/proc/cmdline` (IMHO)
-   Create a 60-network-devices.sh which is not linked to device name
    but HW mac. (MAC to dev and dev to MAC should be transparent for the
    user and automatically done by ReaR).

I made a first prototype which work now on the following scenario
(ubuntu 16.04):

-   use `net.ifnames=0`on the original system (interface name: eth0)
-   run `rear mkbackup`
-   boot on the ISO, `net.ifnames` not set =&gt; interface name enp0s1.
    But IP and route are well setup due to the new `ip_mac` wrapper.
-   run `rear recover`
-   reboot on the restored system `net.ifnames=0` (interface name backed
    to eth0)

example of new 60-network-devices.sh generated

    # Network devices setup:
    # Skip network devices setup if the kernel command line parameter 'noip' is specifiled:
    grep -q '\<noip\>' /proc/cmdline && return
    # When DHCP was used via 58-start-dhclient.sh do not change the existing networking setup here:
    [[ ! -z "$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return
    # If IPADDR=1.2.3.4 has been defined at boot time via ip=1.2.3.4 setup network devices this way:
    if [[ "$IPADDR" ]] && [[ "$NETMASK" ]] ; then
        device=${NETDEV:-eth0}
        ip link set dev "$device" up
        ip addr add "$IPADDR"/"$NETMASK" dev "$device"
        if [[ "$GATEWAY" ]] ; then
            ip route add default via "$GATEWAY"
        fi
        return
    fi
    ip_mac addr add 10.7.19.141/24 dev 00:1a:4a:16:01:e3
    ip_mac link set dev 00:1a:4a:16:01:e3 up
    ip_mac link set dev 00:1a:4a:16:01:e3 mtu 1500

ip\_mac() function

    # ip wrapper command which use mac addresses instead of device name.
    ip_mac(){
        ip_args=$*
        dev_mac=$(echo $ip_args | awk -F"dev " '{ split($2,TAB," "); print TAB[1] }')
        dev_name=$(get_device_by_hwaddr $dev_mac)
        ip_args=$( echo $ip_args | sed "s/dev $dev_mac/dev $dev_name/g" )
        ip  $ip_args

feel free to test it during your ubuntu 16.04 automated test.

There is still a lot of work/test before thinking to merge it into
master.

-   checking variable
-   comments
-   vlan and bonding function need also to be modified.
-   Add Migration when udev-rules is not available. (the most difficult
    part)

@schabrolles Are these changes already merged? Or, are you waiting on my
test results? I'm sorry, but I was too busy with other customer
activities (cannot remember it anymore what I did).

@gdha, everything is now merged. Just test it when you have time on your
Ubuntu 16.04. It should work with or without set.ifnames=0 parameter.

@schabrolles are you sure it is merged? I cannot find `ip_mac` keywords
in our code.  
I just test it on ubuntu16.04 and the current code did not recognize
biosdevnames automatically.
