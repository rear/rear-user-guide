Hi,  
is it possible to build a IMG to a USB-Disk that is connected do
Raspberry PI.  
So that if the SDCard died can rebuild with the IMG to a new SDCard.

    This means that files have been modified during the archiving

    backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system.

    Is that not something we can do with the BLOCKCLONE workflow? Instead of partition based a whole disk?

    The `sudo usr/sbin/rear -v -C blockclone mkbackuponly` seemed successful with below configuration:
    ```bash
    # cat blockclone.conf

Nice, would you consider adding a Raspberry Pi section to our docs?

Did a restore test on a USB stick of the saved blockclone disk image of
a RPi4 128 GB USB disk:

    # gzip -dc rpi4-ubuntu24-04.img | dd of=/dev/sdq bs=4K

And, used this new USB stick to boot the RPi4 successfully. So, we have
a working method to save and restore RPi disk images.

By merging PR \#3333 we can close this issue.
