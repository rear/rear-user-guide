**Question for SuSe**: does the same rules apply for SLES these days?

I agree to remove the `%clean` section.

I have no `%clean` section in my rear.spec  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1)  
that is used for the official rear RPM in openSUSE at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear)  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855\#issuecomment-404100990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855#issuecomment-404100990)

What  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile\_guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines)  
reads about a `%clean` section:

    The %clean section should not be included -- it is no longer
    necessary.

    The %clean section, if specified, will be run after the binary and
    source RPMs have been generated. In the Open Build Service, this
    section is not necessary because chroots and VM environments
    used to build the package are generally torn down anyway.
    Building packages in environments not started from scratch
    is usually not supported for openSUSE packages
    (https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176528#c4).

    Starting from rpm 4.8 (openSUSE 11.2+), rpm defaults
    to "%clean: rm -Rf %{buildroot}" if the %clean section
    is completely absent from the spec file.

    If a package contains a %clean section, it should be safe to remove.
    Check with another maintainer first if you are not sure.

The %clean section was already removed by
