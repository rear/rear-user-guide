##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): closes \#2777

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Full backup and recovery with \`MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS="-d sunit=128 -d
    swidth=128" and root on XFS. Before the change, recovery failed to
    mount the root filesystem during layout restoration.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The mount command displays all mount options for a filesystem, including
those that are not explictitly set in fstab, and ReaR saves them to disk
layout. In the case of XFS, some of them can be harmful for mounting the
filesystem during layout restoration:

The `logbsize=`... mount option is a purely performance/memory usage
optimization option, which can lead to mount failures, because it must
be an integer multiple of the log stripe unit and the log stripe unit
can be different in the recreated filesystem from the original
filesystem. It was reported for some some exotic situation apparently
involving an old filesystem created with a version of xfsprogs that
accepted values that it does not accept anymore, see GitHub issue \#2777
. More importantly, it can occur when using `MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS`, because
this will lead to a change of filesystem parameters and the mount
options will no longer match. If `logbsize` is not an integer multiple
of the log stripe unit, mount fails with the warning
`XFS (...): logbuf size must be greater than or equal to log stripe size`
in the kernel log (and a confusing error message
`mount: ...: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on ..., missing codepage or helper program, or other error.`
from the mount command), causing the layout restoration in the recovery
process to fail.

Wrong sunit/swidth can cause mount to fail as well, with this in the
kernel log:
`kernel: XFS (...): alignment check failed: sunit/swidth vs. agsize`.

Therefore, remove the `logbsize=`... and `sunit=`.../`swidth=`... from
XFS mount options before mounting the file system.

(Another option possibility be to remove them already when saving the
layout, in layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh, but I
decided to follow the example of btrfs here.)

@pcahyna  
I am wondering if the function name `remove_mount_options_values`  
correctly indicates what this function actually does because  
from only reading its description it seems this function  
removes whole mount options like  
`nodev,uid=1,rw,gid=1`-&gt; `nodev,rw`  
and not only the values from mount options like  
`nodev,uid=1,rw,gid=1`-&gt; `nodev,uid,rw,gid`  
so the simpler function name `remove_mount_options` might be better?

It is an enhancement when ReaR even works in an  
"exotic situation apparently involving an old filesystem  
created with a version of xfsprogs that accepted values  
that it does not accept anymore".

I think in practice that situation is not as exotic as it seems  
because (at least how SLES service pack upgrades happen at SUSE)  
it could be rather common that upgrades of basic system software  
happen via software package upgrades (e.g. RPM package updates)  
and (of course) not by reinstalling the system anew.

By the way cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

    You must continuously validate that the recovery
    still works on the replacement hardware in particular
    after each change of the basic system.
    .
    .
    .
    When you have a working disaster recovery procedure,
    do not upgrade ReaR and do not change the basic software
    that is used by ReaR (like partitioning tools, filesystem tools,
    bootloader tools, ISO image creating tools, and so on).
    ...
    When you have a working disaster recovery procedure running
    and you upgrade software that is related to the basic system
    or you do other changes in your basic system, you must also
    carefully and completely re-validate that your particular
    disaster recovery procedure still works for you.

more descriptive name would be `remove_mount_options_with_values`, but I
felt it was a bit too long.

> and not only the values from mount options like

`remove_mount_options` would suggest that it removes anything, even
options without values (`rw`, `nodev` and so on), which it is not able
to do (I preferred to keep the implementation simpler).

Maybe it would be better to let the function let look for both options
witjout values, and options with values, and remove them both? (And
rename it.) My only worry is that there might be a case where an option
without a value means something different than an option with a value.
The oncly case I found where an option can be specified both with and
without value is `utf8`:

           utf8
               UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of Unicode that is used
               by the console. It can be enabled for the filesystem with this
               option or disabled with utf8=0, utf8=no or utf8=false. If uni_xlate
               gets set, UTF8 gets disabled.

@pcahyna  
I didn't want to make a bigger issue with this function name.  
Leave it as is - its current name is OK - and what is most important:  
It is well described what it does so the name is not a real issue.

Indeed.

I described it as "exotic", because even in older RHEL versions that had
more relaxed checks on XFS parameters I was not able to create the
problematic combination of parameters. Probably there is some trick that
I am missing, given that the bug report is real.

@jsmeix thank you for having a look!
