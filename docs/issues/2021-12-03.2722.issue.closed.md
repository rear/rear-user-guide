-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    After creating the ISO and mounting it as boot device on the VM, the
    writing of the partitions fails at the step where the LUKS password
    should be entered.

<!-- -->

    Please enter the password for LUKS device dm_crypt-0 (/dev/sda3):
    UserInput -I LAYOUT_CODE_RUN needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh in line 127
    The disk layout recreation script failed

-   Workaround, if any:  
    I haven't found one

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):  
    Unfortunately I cannot get the log out of the VM.

Hello, is it LUKS 2 ? I am no LUKS expert, but this sounds similar to
bug \#2204. If so, LUKS 2 support was added by a colleague of mine
(@vcrhonek) in PR \#2504, but it is not yet present in any released
version. Can you please try the current development version?

Yup, it is indeed LUKS2. I will see if I can use the dev version. Is
there an ETA for LUKS2 support in the release?  
\[Edit\]I installed rear with apt. how do I get the dev branch and which
branch is the LUKS2 support in \[/Edit\]

See the first part of
[https://github.com/rear/rear\#quick-start-guide](https://github.com/rear/rear#quick-start-guide)
"how to run Relax-and-Recover from the git checkout". Note that the
configuration file for running from git checkout is indeed
`etc/rear/local.conf`, not `/etc/rear/local.conf` (the path is relative
to the root of the checked-out tree). The dev branch is the default
`master` one, the LUKS2 support branch has been already merged into
it.  
EDIT you can of course skip the part about preparing your USB media and
configuring USB output, you can configure the Git version just as you do
with your current version, only the config file path is different.

The partition table was created. Unfortunately I did not include the
necessary information about the restic backup that has the rest of the
disk content and I cannot get to it from the rescue image, but that is
not part of the issue

I consider this issue closed.

Thanks everyone

@Quixus thank you for verifying the fix in the development version.
