While working on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1075](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1075)  
I noticed that code like

<pre>
Error 99 "error messsage"
</pre>

does not let rear exit with exit code 99.

The reason seems that EXIT\_CODE can be set  
but that variable is nowhere evaluated:

<pre>
$ find usr/share/rear/* | xargs grep 'EXIT_CODE'

usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500_compare_layout.sh:    EXIT_CODE=1
usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/510_compare_files.sh:        EXIT_CODE=1
usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650_check_iso_recoverable.sh:   EXIT_CODE=1
usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:          EXIT_CODE=$1
usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:          EXIT_CODE=1
usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:    EXIT_CODE=1
usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:        EXIT_CODE=$1
usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:    # Call Error explicitly with the above set EXIT_CODE:
usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:    Error $EXIT_CODE "
usr/share/rear/lib/help-workflow.sh:EXIT_CODE=1
</pre>

I.e. there is nowhere a $EXIT\_CODE except my recent change in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1075](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1075)  
where I call "Error $EXIT\_CODE"  
but that does not let rear exit with that EXIT\_CODE value.

<pre>
$ git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh
</pre>

shows that EXIT\_CODE was initially introduced  
by Dag Wieers.

@dagwieers  
can you tell me how EXIT\_CODE is meant to be used?

I found where $EXIT\_CODE is used:  
In usr/sbin/rear there is the very last line

<pre>
exit $EXIT_CODE
</pre>

but somehow that does not work - at least not via e.g.

<pre>
Error 99 "error messsage"
</pre>

Found the reason:

Using in a script

<pre>
EXIT_CODE=99
</pre>

works as expected:  
rear exits with that exit code.

In contrast using in a script

<pre>
Error 99 "test error 99"
</pre>

exits rear always with exit code 143 which means  
usually the program caught a SIGTERM signal  
i.e. the process was killed.  
For rear it is USR1 that kills it via  
usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

<pre>
# activate the trap function
builtin trap "DoExitTasks" 0
# keep PID of main process
readonly MASTER_PID=$$
# duplication STDOUT to fd7 to use for Print
exec 7>&1
QuietAddExitTask "exec 7>&-"
# USR1 is used to abort on errors, not using Print to always print to the original STDOUT, even if quiet
builtin trap "echo 'Aborting due to an error, check $LOGFILE for details' >&7 ; kill $MASTER_PID" USR1
...
Error() {
    ...
        kill -USR1 $MASTER_PID # make sure that Error exits the master process, even if called from child processes :-)
}
</pre>

so that setting EXIT\_CODE for Error functions is useless.

I think I will simply remove the EXIT\_CODE stuff  
from the Error functions.

The only usage of EXIT\_CODE in Error functions is

<pre>
$ find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/* | xargs grep 'Error [0-9][0-9]* '
usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/500_check_BACULA_bconsole_results.sh:StopIfError 1 "Bacula client status unknown on director."
usr/share/rear/prep/BAREOS/default/500_check_BAREOS_bconsole_results.sh:StopIfError 1 "Bareos client status unknown on director."
usr/share/rear/verify/BACULA/default/050_check_requirements.sh:   StopIfError 1  "Bacula configuration file (bconsole.conf) missing"
usr/share/rear/verify/BAREOS/default/050_check_requirements.sh:   StopIfError 1  "Bareos configuration file (bconsole.conf) missing"
</pre>

that I can easily adapt.
