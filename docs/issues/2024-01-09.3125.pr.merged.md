##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): related to \#2997

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not tested.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Improvements of the layout configuration part of the user guide to
    address \#2997

    -   Describe `EXCLUDE_RECREATE` better. Instead of copying a snippet
        of default.conf, describe in prose what the variable does and
        what is the syntax.
    -   Update whitespace after comment in layout examples. Commit
        4d6fac780f9234b55dbb0ca7fa55b56e4fbc7157 changed the formatting
        of commented entries in layout: "Change commenting in layout
        file to have no space after the \#." Adapt the examples that had
        been generated before the change to match.
    -   Do not copy almost identical layout file in the documentation
        multiple times. Show only the parts that have changed after
        changing something.
    -   Move autoexcludes description. I believe that "This behavior is
        controlled by the `AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=y` parameter" must refer to
        the exclusion of the unused backup disk. At the current location
        (disk layout when the backup disk is NOT unused anymore) it does
        not make sense. Move the whole part about autoexcludes just
        after the section where it is mentioned that a disk was
        automatically excluded.
    -   Don't copy EXCLUDE\_BACKUP/RESTORE from default.conf.
        `EXCLUDE_RESTORE` and `EXCLUDE_BACKUP` are irrelevant for layout
        file and disk layout recreation. They merely influence file
        backup or restore (for supported backup methods). This guide is
        about the recreation of the disk layout. Therefore, omit the
        variables from here. They are not used in the doc anywhere
        anyway after showing a copy of their description originating
        from default.conf. So, why to show it at all?
    -   Do not refer to "restore list". This term is never defined or
        used anywhere. Let's talk about the layout file instead.

Open question: where to describe variables that control only the file
backup and restoration (for supported backup methods)? Like
`EXCLUDE_RESTORE` and `EXCLUDE_BACKUP` and `BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE`. They
don't belong here as this chapter is only about storage layout
recreation. I think it would be the best to introduce chapter 7 with
this information.

diff gets confused by the move of a large piece of text, so the diff of
the whole PR does not make much sense. I suggest to look at per-commit
diffs
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125/commits](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3125/commits))
when reviewing the PR, each of them looks reasonable.

Thanks for working on the rear docs!

I've had a look at these commits but I have nothing to add really.

I might be able to comment better once committed and I can read it as a
whole but even then, I don't know rear well enough to be correcting one
of the devs.

(it even works when one is not logged in at GitHub)  
and therein at the top right corner  
of the sub-window that shows the changes for a file  
click on the three dots '...' which shows a sub-menu  
where you can select "View file"

I think a new chapter that only describes variables  
that control only the file backup and restore  
is not possible in practice because of the various  
interdependencies with the variables that control  
the disk layout.

Right now I see that we have already a chapter 7  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/07-tips-and-tricks.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/07-tips-and-tricks.adoc)  
which I had never read before.

Yes, unfortunately the chapters are numbered, so to insert a new one we
would have to renumber the following ones.

@jsmeix do you think the description of file backup-related variables
should be added also to this chapter? This would make it less focused,
though.

@pcahyna  
offhandedly I think disk layout and files backup  
should be kept separated primarily because

    Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) complements backup and restore
    of files but ReaR is neither a backup software
    nor a backup management software
    and it is not meant to be one.

    In general backup and restore of the files
    is external functionality for ReaR.

At first glance I think  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/07-tips-and-tricks.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/07-tips-and-tricks.adoc)  
is not really useful - perhaps even bad in some cases, for example:

-   I think GRUB\_RESCUE can be useful but at the same time  
    it is a bad idea to let ReaR modify the bootloader of the  
    original system
-   Why it is a "tip" or a "trick" that it automatically detects  
    and enables serial console support?
-   Preserving SSH keys can be useful but at the same time  
    it is a bad idea to leak out secret SSH keys from the original
    system  
    into the (possibly "public" accessible) recovery system
    (initrd/ISO/...)
-   During recovery one can NOT at any stage re-run "rear recover".  
    In my experience in most cases re-running "rear recover" fails  
    or would only work with too complicated manual things  
    so that in most cases it works better in practice  
    to reboot the recovery system, do needed adaptions,  
    and then run "rear recover" again.

So from my current point of view  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/07-tips-and-tricks.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/07-tips-and-tricks.adoc)  
is mostly questionable / misleading / wrong / ...

The document does not suggest to leak secrets. I believe that what is
intended is to mention the preservation of root's
`.ssh/authorized_keys`, which allows you to login remotely. This file is
not especially sensitive.

Maybe. But the whole layout recreation is implemented with this in mind,
with all the `todo` and `done` in disktodo.conf. This is also the point
of the sentence just above
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc\#planning-in-advance](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc#planning-in-advance)
:

I must say I don't like the whole section
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc\#restore-to-different-hardware](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc#restore-to-different-hardware)
, WDYT?

@danboid can you please have a look at the resulting document

? Not to check correctness, but to see whether it is better
understandable than the previous version and addresses

. (Note that the backup options EXCLUDE\_BACKUP etc. are deliberately
omitted, as they don't refer to the layout configuration.)

@pcahyna  
the section  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc\#restore-to-different-hardware](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc#restore-to-different-hardware)  
is rather old, in particular I never updated it.

I did not pay attention to this section because  
at SUSE we do not support migration to different hardware.

In general I find migration to different hardware  
not at all something that is "simple" with ReaR.

I think what that section basically tells is that  
migration to different hardware does not "just work".

So the basic information is still true and users  
can clearly see that with an example where the technical  
details are somewhat outdated which is a minor issue here  
because nobody has exactly such a system so the details  
should not matter in practice for this section.

@jsmeix I especially dislike the wording

as it sounds like one can leave figuring out the details to the moment
when disaster happens (although this may not have been the original
intent of the text).

@pcahyna  
according to

    # git log --follow -p doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc

that part about "being lazy" is unchanged  
since it was introduced at the beginning as  
"a first draft of a layout engine usage guide" via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/259b66cd59a0cde9cf0070c2fa3048c7ddb13664](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/259b66cd59a0cde9cf0070c2fa3048c7ddb13664)

I think what it tries to tell is that

-   the lazy approach is meant when the target hardware  
    is unknown in advance and then one must have  
    good knowledge of one's system - actually the lazy approach  
    is the only possible way in practice when one does not  
    already have replacement hardware to verify it in advance  
    (e.g. for individual end user workstations and laptops)
-   the plan in advance approach is meant ("is preferable")  
    when the target hardware is known in advance  
    (in particular for business/enterprise environments)

At SUSE we officially support only the latter case, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
and  
[https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP5/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html](https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP5/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html)
