lz4 -l is necessary for Linux kernel boot compatibility, a separate
branch and patch has already been pull request for that change in code.
This patch also updates the documentation for that change. And it
includes a table with an example to show the real life trade offs for
extraction time, creation time and size based on an example.

@jsmeix @ProBackup-nl Perhaps wait a few days to merge this pull request
as it was already added some days ago. I want to be sure it is a valid
one.

@gdha  
the actual change is in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1235](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1235)  
and I think this cannot go wrong because  
the lz4 initrd compression was newly added  
by @ProBackup-nl and when he now changes it  
there cannot be regressions.

@gdha The was insufficient testing in my initial commit. I only tested
writing. I skipped the part to test that I could actually boot from is.
Any suggestions what else I could/should test?
