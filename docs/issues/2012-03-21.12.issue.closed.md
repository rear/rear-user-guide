During rescue boot, the default output for various services is the
screen, and so udev and various other daemons write debugging/info
messages to the screen while it is booting.

This is not only confusing people that have a (different) problem, it
does not help troubleshooting as these messages are logged nowhere. The
solution is to define a (small) framework that would log standard output
and standard error to a file, just as Rear is doing outside of the
rescue image.

so far we has no complaints about this. Nobody has the time to rewrite
the rescue framework.
