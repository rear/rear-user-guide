Currently ReaR provides only a few limited specific  
adaptions of the network configuration during "rear recover"  
in particular for IP and MAC addresses and routing  
via some /etc/rear/mappings/ files, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc/mappings](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc/mappings)

But other basic network migration functionality is missing  
for example the hostname, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-574592858](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-574592858)  
where @tumbajamba wrote (excerpt):

    an idea btw. suggestion for a new feature
    "changing hostname for target machine".
    Since you've already implemented features like:

    mappings/ip_addresses
    mappings/routes
    ...

    So it would just make sense to implement a function:
    mappings/hostname

    Which would complete the processes of
    deploying a new server out of the existing machine
    based on REAR-Software.

I think providing complete networking migration and/or setup  
functionality during "rear recover" for basically all and everything  
what can be set up for networking is (at least currently)  
out of scope of what ReaR is meant for.

But I think providing functionality to migrate and/or setup  
only the basic networking functionality during "rear recover"  
so that after "rear recover" the new (re)-created machine  
has a correct new basic network setup is what ReaR could do.

@rmetrich @gdha  
what do you think about this enhancement proposal?

Would it make sense?  
I.e. does the term "basic network setup" actually make sense  
or is network setup actually an unlimited complex beast  
where one cannot separate "basic network setup"  
from "advanced network setup" in a reasonable way.

If it makes sense, would it be doable with reasonable effort?

Perhaps a simple and generically working basic method  
to set up networking at the end of "rear recover" could be  
something like NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2604](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2604)  
e.g. a new TARGET\_SYSTEM\_NETWORK\_SETUP\_COMMANDS  
where the user can specify his particular comands to set up  
networking at the end of "rear recover" as he needs it?  
On the other had we already have POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
as a generic basic method where the user could do whatever  
is needed at the end of "rear recover".  
But POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT runs within the ReaR recovery system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/wrapup/default/500\_post\_recovery\_script.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/wrapup/default/500_post_recovery_script.sh)  
while networking setup comands for the new (re)-created machine  
should be run within that new (re)-created target system i.e. within  
a `chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT` environment so a separated  
new TARGET\_SYSTEM\_NETWORK\_SETUP\_COMMANDS  
where that happens automatically would make sense.

@jsmeix Hello, network setup is just a beast, it will be extremely
difficult to have something work among all distros.  
Even setting the hostname is not that easy (unless systemd is used).  
I would definitely let the admin do what he wants.

@rmetrich  
According to this link, setting up hostname doesn't look that difficult
to implement, even though you are completely right, that the procedure
of setting up the hostname across different distributions might
differ.  
[https://www.tecmint.com/set-hostname-permanently-in-linux/](https://www.tecmint.com/set-hostname-permanently-in-linux/)

Basically we have three options here:

    /etc/hostname
    /etc/sysconfig/network
    hostnamectl on systemD

I added "needs sponsorship" because since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-594591924](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-594591924)  
it does no longer look as if I could do that alone in a reasonable way.
