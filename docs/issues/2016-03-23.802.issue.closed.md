See also \#734 - it did not get in 1.18 on time.

Move milestone once again due to lack of funding

Feature is already implemented in Rear v1.17 . The following
configuration works exactly as requested:

\#/etc/rear/local.conf  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=null  
BACKUP\_URL="iso:///backup"  
**ISO\_DIR="/home/test\_rear" \#Here should be the custom location for
iso.**

But it is not very intuitive, unless you look into code and you know
what variable $ISO\_DIR is used for and you figure out that directives
in default.conf can be redefined in local.conf.

Is it intended behaviour? Is variable $ISO\_DIR meant to be used as a
standalone configuration directive? If yes, it should be documented.

@gdha Perhaps my last post regarding duplicate iso images was overlooked
among the other comments. I think it can prevent lot of unnecessary work
in the future. This solution is already being used on enterprise
production system with positive feedback

Need to think about it, but it won't be for ReaR v2.0 I'm afraid.

@gdha Add it to the documentation as a FAQ?

As default.conf file entry ISO\_DIR has now a better explanation we can
close this issue.
