Currently there is no check if a NETFS 'tar' backup is empty.

What gets included in a NETFS 'tar' backup  
gets specified in $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt by  
backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
via var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device that was made by  
layout/save/default/340\_generate\_mountpoint\_device.sh  
based on the active 'fs' entries disklayout.conf

In certain cases it can happen that backup-include.txt  
does not contain '/' or is even empty, e.g. see  
starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189\#issuecomment-2082615405](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2082615405)  
and the subsequent comments therein down to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189\#issuecomment-2082981807](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2082981807)

So I am thinking about a generic check for an empty NETFS backup  
(regardless of multipath or whatever).

My point is that I assume at least '/' must be included  
in any backup because it is the basic functionality  
that "rear mkbackup" makes a backup of the files  
of the basic system so at least '/' must be  
backed up (with '--one-file-system').

So in case of a NETFS backup at least '/'  
should normally be in backup-include.txt  
and - as far as I can imagine - at least an  
empty backup-include.txt is always an error.

Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189\#issuecomment-2092992455](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2092992455)

By the way:  
It seems '/' is last in backup-include.txt  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189\#issuecomment-2082615405](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2082615405)  
(excerpt):

    2024-04-29 14:45:49.347139698 Backup include list (backup-include.txt contents):
    2024-04-29 14:45:49.349245934   /boot/grub2/i386-pc

    2024-04-29 14:45:49.366581308   /

But I think it would be better in general to have '/'  
first in backup-include.txt to get the files and directories  
of the the basic system first stored in backup.tar.gz  
so that in particular the directories of the the basic system  
get restored first during "rear recover" so that those  
directories are already there when later other files  
get restored into the basic system directories.  
Perhaps the ordering may not actually matter but at least  
it looks "unexpected" to store and restore '/' last, cf.
