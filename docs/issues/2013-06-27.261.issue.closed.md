I'm looking into this more myself, but on 2 systems, both ubuntu
12.04.02 i686  
One with the LTS enablement pack (fresh install) and one without  
(so kernel 3.5.0-34 and kernel 3.2.0-xxx) when the Bootable image is
made, then  
attempted to boot from, on the same system, and other systems, you get
attached screenshot (do not know how to log)

/etc/rear/local.conf are the same each time  
USB :  
<code>OUTPUT=USB  
BACKUP=NETFS

USB\_DEVICE=/dev/sdb
====================

BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000</code>  
ISO:  
<code>OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs:///Ip-addres/mnt/storage/rear/</code>

BUT it works perfect with another system also 12.04.02 i686 with kernel
3.9.2, is there a workaround? (manually switch backup images?)

I did a  
$sudo rear -v -d -D mkrescue  
and here is the resulting .log

It looks like the kernel has problems while decompressing the initramfs
on the USB.

Could you try to unzip it manually and extract it with cpio?

I attempted this with 2048 MB of ram on a ubuntu VM  
and 1024 MB as well  
also used latest GIT, and stable and snapshots from the OSBP

The original ramdisk on your Ubuntu, what kind of compression/filesystem
does it use ? (check with the `file` command on both the compressed
initrd as well as the uncompressed initrd).

Are there any kernel boot parameters set on the system that may be
needed for booting this kernel/initrd ?

nothing but the default ubuntu. no flags were added,  
the compressed initrd is gzip compressed and "regular file"
uncompressed  
as well as the kernel, regular file.

@DrDrache I was expecting a CPIO archive or a filesystem...

@DrDrache does the same problem occur with rear-1.15? I'm not sure what
we can do to help you with this? Or is it fine to close this issue? No
response within 1 month means "yes"

close the issue with "no feedback received" within 1 month - if needed
you may re-open the call \[ @DrDrache \]
