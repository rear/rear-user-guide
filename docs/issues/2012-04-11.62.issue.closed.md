if disks of source and destination are not same, script switches to
manual mode, and asks to map disk. if there are lots of available disks
(special files) , the choices will be a long list and only the last
lines can be displayed on screen. Seems that it needs formatting on
output(eg. less the output)

I have some Images , but I cant attach to bug.  
Please send me some email address to send files to. I am not sure if its
a good idea to sent them to the MList.
