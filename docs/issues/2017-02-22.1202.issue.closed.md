I noticed that the ReaR recovery system does not  
contain all kernel modules of the original system.

I think by default the ReaR recovery system should  
contain all kernel modules of the original system.

This way even system migration could be much easier  
because the ReaR recovery system would be prepared  
by default for "all hardware" (via manual module loading).  
In contrast when needed kernel modules are missing in the  
ReaR recovery system it is a dead end for "rear recover".

Missing kernel modules can result any kind of  
awkward unexpected failures like:

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # mkdir /mp

RESCUE e205:~ # ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/
... SLE-12-SP2-Server-DVD-x86_642192 -> ../../sr0

RESCUE e205:~ # mount /dev/sr0 /mp
mount: unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'
</pre>

In the recovery system I have

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # find /lib/modules/ | wc -l
861
</pre>

in contrast on the original system I have much more kernel modules:

<pre>
# find /lib/modules/ | wc -l
2479
</pre>

The easy workaround is

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]:-}" /lib/modules )
</pre>

With that

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # mount /dev/sr0 /mp
</pre>

just works because the needed kernel modules are  
loaded full automagically (provided they exist ;-)

IMHO we copy all storage and network modules but skip all the other
stuff  
to keep the image size smaller.

Hi @jsmeix @schlomo

I agree with @schlomo about keeping smaller image size as possible, but
on the other way I also understand the concern of @jsmeix.

Maybe something like SYSTEM\_MIGRATION=no to keep the current behaviour
and in case of a system migration or cloning, ... set to
SYSTEM\_MIGRATION=yes and in that case set:

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]:-}" /lib/modules ) 
</pre>

Maybe a better var name could be:

RESCUE\_IMAGE\_TYPE=\[targeted|template\] ???

Is just food for thoughts... :-P

regards,

As a first step I will better document the current behaviour  
in default.conf which contains currently only

<pre>
# files/dirs to copy as-is (with tar)
COPY_AS_IS=( $SHARE_DIR $VAR_DIR )
</pre>

Currently in default.conf there is

<pre>
# kernel modules to include on the rescue media in addition to the ones
# present at mkrescue time
MODULES=()
</pre>

I think it should be relatively easy to add support  
for values with special meaning something like

<pre>
MODULES="all"
</pre>

or

<pre>
MODULES="none"
</pre>

or

<pre>
MODULES="currently_loaded"
</pre>

plus support for find '-iwholename' patterns like

<pre>
MODULES=( 'currently_loaded' '*btrfs*' '*/net/ethernet/*' )
</pre>

This will not change the current default behaviour but  
it will give the user some better means to specify if needed  
what exact kernel modules get included in his recovery system.

IMHO Not even all storage and all networking needs to be copied onto the
rescue system.

To "Relax" it will be nice when the average user needs as little
configuration as possible, and a rescue system that only carries what is
needed.

The user choice:

> Do you wish to build a:  
> Minimal rescue system for fastest backup and restore on similar
> hardware  
> or  
> Hardware migration rescue system?

Further along the road `OUTPUT`, `BACKUP_URL`, and the host system
itself do give clues what be needed on the rescue system.

Building blocks:

1.  bare minimum
2.  +MD (software RAID)
3.  +LVM
4.  +LUKS (disk encryption)
5.  +Multipath disks
6.  +Btrfs (or include in bare minimum?)
7.  +DRBD (enables networking block too?)
8.  +Hardware RAID controllers
9.  +Tape drivers (?)
10. +networking: BACKUP\_URL=(nfs|cifs|sshfs) or OUTPUT=PXE

<strike>Although "hardware migration" will require most, if not all
blocks.</strike> For hardware migration via USB, I still wouldn't need
MD, LVM, LUKS, multipath, DRBD, Hardware RAID, Tape drivers or
networking.

The building blocks inclusion is only needed for the included source
disk(s) not the excluded source disk(s). For example it is pointless
(from bare minimum rescue system point of view) to include HP SmartArray
controllers when the machine has got such a controller, but the disk(s)
that are being back-upped, are not attached to that controller.

Second user choice:

> Based on your host system your rescue system will be made including
> and excluding the following building blocks:  
> Included: BTRFS, ...  
> Excluded: MD, LVM, ...  
> Do you wish to:  
> (A)ccept auto-selection  
> (M)anually change this selection

Note: these user choices can be interactive questions, or configuration
file options.

I like to enhance my proposal in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202\#issuecomment-284377443](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202#issuecomment-284377443)  
in a (hopefully) very useful way according to  
what I learned in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1244](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1244)  
in particular according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1244\#issuecomment-286718903](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1244#issuecomment-286718903)  
USB keyboard function on any replacement hardware is a must  
so that a plain

<pre>
MODULES="none"
</pre>

is probably never really useful.

Therefore I think it should be possible to specify something like

<pre>
MODULES=( 'none' 'currently_loaded' '*/usb/*' )
</pre>

which includes no modules except those that are currently loaded  
plus all USB modules - i.e. which includes only those that are  
currently loaded plus all USB modules.

The logical counterpart would be something like

<pre>
MODULES=( 'all' '*/bluetooth/*' '*/firewire/*' )
</pre>

which includes all modules except the modules  
for bluetooth and firewire.

Do you maybe mean this?

    MODULES=( 'all' '!*/bluetooth/*' '!*/firewire/*' )

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1352](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1352)
merged  
there is a major cleanup of linux-functions.sh  
therein in particular the ResolveModules function  
and the ModulesCopyTo function that are called  
only by build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
as a preparation step that is intended to solve  
this issue here.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1359](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1359)
merged  
this issue should be solved.

Now there is support for some new special MODULES values  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'no\_modules' )  
This way users can better specify what kernel modules  
get included in the rescue/recovery system.  
See the explanation in default.conf.

This is not yet the full featured detailled MODULES support as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202\#issuecomment-287346514](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202#issuecomment-287346514)  
but it is (hopefully) a first step forward in the right direction.

Because of what I noticed in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355)  
I think it may perhaps fail more often than not  
if only certain kernel modules directories  
or kernel modules file name globbing stuff  
gets copied into the recovery system because  
there could be so subtle kernel module dependencies  
that in practice only simple things like  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' )  
would actually work sufficiently well  
(see what I described in in default.conf).
