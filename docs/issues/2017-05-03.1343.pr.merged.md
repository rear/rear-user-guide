Should fix \#1342

-   No need to copy files if `TSM_RESULT_SAVE` is false
-   When `$PXE_TFTP_URL` is defined, results files are deleted by  
    `800_copy_to_tftp.sh` ... So it produce an Error "No files to copy
    (RESULT\_FILES is empty)"

Regarding clean up of

<pre>
if [[ "$TSM_RESULT_SAVE" = "n" ]]; then
</pre>

in 950\_dsmc\_save\_result\_files.sh  
I wonder what the actual meaning of that condition is?  
Strictly reading the code it is

<pre>
if is_false $TSM_RESULT_SAVE ; then
</pre>

but actually the meaning could be

<pre>
if ! is_true $TSM_RESULT_SAVE ; then
</pre>

it depends on what the fallback behaviour should be  
for TSM\_RESULT\_SAVE.

@schabrolles  
as it seems you work with TSM, it is your decision  
what fallback behaviour should be in ReaR  
in case of BACKUP=TSM

In general regarding TSM support in ReaR  
you may also have a look at

@schabrolles  
if it is o.k. from your side I would "just merge" it.

Looks good to me, I agree with your last message, but the default
setting is TSM\_RESULT\_SAVE=y and I think it is better if skip the
RESULT\_SAVE when the user explicitly ask to NOT save it ...

@schabrolles @jsmeix See also issues \#634 and \#734 for the discussions
in there. Might be wishful thinking?

@gdha  
thanks to mention that OUTPUT\_URL=null  
is a related topic.  
I don't think it is wishful thinking.  
But I think in general support for third party tools  
(in particular third party backup software)  
needs sponsorship because third party tool issues  
can only be implemented by someone who actually  
uses and tests ReaR with a particular third party tool.  
As long as the support for third party tools  
is considered "sufficient" by its users  
it is o.k. as is ;-)
