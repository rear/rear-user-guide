Current ReaR code uses in very most cases  
(actually in 682 cases)

<pre>
${array[@]}
</pre>

when "the whole array" is meant.

But sometimes (actually in 22 cases)

<pre>
${array[*]}
</pre>

is used.

I think I should investigate the array\[\*\] cases and try to find out  
whether or not each array\[\*\] usage is actually right.

FYI: I used

<pre>
find usr/share/rear/* | xargs grep -ho '[[:alnum:]_]*\[@\]'
</pre>

versus

<pre>
find usr/share/rear/* | xargs grep -ho '[[:alnum:]_]*\[\*\]'
</pre>

to find array\[@\] versus array\[\*\] usage.

Background information:

See "man bash" for the difference:

<pre>
If subscript is @ or *, the word expands to all members of name.
These subscripts differ only when the word appears within
double quotes. If the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]}
expands to a single word with the value of each array
member separated by the first character of the IFS special
variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of name
to a separate word.
</pre>

In general ${array\[\*\]} is problematic and  
using ${array\[@\]} without double-quotes is also problematic.

For example see how using ${array\[\*\]} or "${array\[\*\]}"  
or even ${array\[@\]} results probably unexpected stuff  
(unless those results are actually intended) while  
only "${array\[@\]}" results what is usually expected:

<pre>
# arr1=( 'first1 first2' 'second1 second2' )

# for e in ${arr1[*]} ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1'
'first2'
'second1'
'second2'

# for e in ${arr1[@]} ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1'
'first2'
'second1'
'second2'

# for e in "${arr1[*]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1 first2 second1 second2'

# for e in "${arr1[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1 first2'
'second1 second2'

# arr2=( ${arr1[*]} 'third1 third2' )

# for e in "${arr2[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1'
'first2'
'second1'
'second2'
'third1 third2'

# arr2=( ${arr1[@]} 'third1 third2' )

# for e in "${arr2[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1'
'first2'
'second1'
'second2'
'third1 third2'

# arr2=( "${arr1[*]}" 'third1 third2' )

# for e in "${arr2[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1 first2 second1 second2'
'third1 third2'

# arr2=( "${arr1[@]}" 'third1 third2' )

# for e in "${arr2[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first1 first2'
'second1 second2'
'third1 third2'
</pre>

Please post here the 22 cases of "${array\[\*\]}", I remember using that
in  
some very specific cases on purpose.

@jsmeix Please be extremely careful with changing the array expansions -
you might create new problems. Do not change to just change things.

@gdha  
don't worry, as long as things are well documented  
no ReaR contributor would inadvertently change it  
to a wrong behaviour because he (falsely) assumes  
he would improve things.

E.g. (shameless self-praise ;-) see  
rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh

<pre>
if test "${NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS[*]}" ; then
    # For the above 'test' one must have all array members as a single word i.e. "${name[*]}"
    # (the test should succeed when there is any non-empty array member, not necessarily the first one)
    # while later one must have the array members as separated 'command' words i.e. "${name[@]}".
    echo "# Prepare network devices setup as specified in NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS:" >>$network_devices_setup_script
    for command in "${NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS[@]}" ; do
</pre>

in contrast to e.g. in verify/TSM/default/400\_verify\_tsm.sh  
where Schlomo Schapiro added an initial comment about  
that issue but - as far as I understand his comment - he was  
unable to find out whether or not the "\[\*\]" usage is really  
on purpose (and if yes what that purpose actually is).

I change it from "bug" to "minor bug" because  
currently things seem to work.

As long as the array members do not contain blanks  
there is no difference beween "\[@\]" and "\[\*\]" usage  
but probably there are some cases where things break  
if array members contain blanks.

I am waiting for the first user who has blanks  
in system file names or system directory names  
that are used by ReaR e.g. things like

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/my important stuff/*' )
</pre>

I never tested if things like that would work.

Nothing is urgent here.  
In particular nothing needs to be done for ReaR 2.0.

Using the '\[\*\]' subscript is required when testing arrays:

<pre>
# arr1=( 'first1 first2' 'second1 second2' )

# test "${arr1[@]:-}" && echo ok || echo empty
-bash: test: first1 first2: unary operator expected

An even more complicated usage of the '\[\*\]' subscript  
plus an interposed 'echo -n' is required when testing arrays  
if there is any non-empty array member (not necessarily the first one)  
but on the other hand the test should not succeed when there are  
only empty or blank members:

<pre>
# arr1=( '' ' ' )

# test "${arr1[*]}" && echo non-empty || echo empty
non-empty

# test "$( echo -n ${arr1[*]} )" && echo non-empty || echo empty
empty

# echo -n ${arr1[*]} | wc -c
0

# arr1=( '' ' ' 'some thing' ' ' 'something else' )

# test "$( echo -n ${arr1[*]} )" && echo non-empty || echo empty
non-empty

# echo -n ${arr1[*]} | wc -c
25

# echo -n ${arr1[*]} | od -a
# echo -n ${arr1[*]} | od -a
0000000   s   o   m   e  sp   t   h   i   n   g  sp   s   o   m   e   t
0000020   h   i   n   g  sp   e   l   s   e
</pre>

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1334](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1334)  
and the thereby added explanatory comment  
in prep/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
For the 'test' one must have all array members
as a single word like "${arr[*]}" with double-quotes
because it should detect when there is any non-empty
array member (not necessarily the first one)
But on the other hand the test should not succeed
when there are only empty or blank members
which would falsely succeed when the
array is e.g. something like arr=( '' ' ' )
because then "${arr[*]}" evaluates to "  "
(the empty and blank members separated
by the first character of IFS) and test "${arr[*]}"
results true for any non-empty argument
(e.g. test " " results true).
Therefore 'echo -n' is interposed because
the output of arr=( '' ' ' ) ; echo -n ${arr[*]}
is empty when the array has only empty
or blank array members
</pre>

Note that there must be no double-quotes in the

<pre>
echo -n ${arr[*]}
</pre>

command because otherwise

<pre>
# arr=( '' '' )

# test "$( echo -n "${arr[*]}" )" && echo non-empty || echo empty
non-empty

# echo -n "${arr[*]}" | od -a
0000000  sp
</pre>

FYI:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2098](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2098)  
is a good example how much care is needed to use  
the specific right syntax for array expansion:

Within a longer string with double quotes `${arr[@]}` may expand  
to something unexpeced.

E.g. see the following artificial example what happens:

    # arr=( 'first element' 'second element' )

    # ls "this ${arr[@]} that"
    ls: cannot access 'this first element': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access 'second element that': No such file or directory

The "embedded" `${arr[@]}` expands to separated words/strings  
(which result two separated `ls` error messages)  
plus (see "man bash"):

      Arrays
        ...
        If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word,
        the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the
        beginning part of the original word, and the expansion
        of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the
        original word.

that results `ls` is called as

    ls 'this first element' 'second element that'

Therefore within a longer string with double quotes  
usually `${arr[*]}` expands as normally intended.

E.g. in the above artificial example

    # ls "this ${arr[*]} that"
    ls: cannot access 'this first element second element that': No such file or directory

the `ls` command is called with one single parameter.

It seems that
[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2145](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2145)
uses a rule of thumb that ${arr\[\*\]} is more likely to be correct than
${arr\[@\]} if it occurs embedded in a longer string, because
${arr\[@\]} will split the string into multiple parts and this is
unlikely to be desired. This heuristics IMO makes sense.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2019-03-25 13:08](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068#issuecomment-476188249):

Yes, I came to the same heuristic conclusion in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068\#issuecomment-476122565](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068#issuecomment-476122565)

    Therefore within a longer string with double quotes
    usually ${arr[*]} expands as normally intended.

FYI:  
The `printf` example in  
[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2145](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2145)  
works for me (output looks different but things do not fail)  
with bash 3.x and 4.x

    # arr=( 'first element' 'second element' )

    # set -x

    # printf "Arr: %s\n" "this ${arr[*]} that"
    + printf 'Arr: %s\n' 'this first element second element that'
    Arr: this first element second element that

    # printf "Arr: %s\n" "this ${arr[@]} that"
    + printf 'Arr: %s\n' 'this first element' 'second element that'
    Arr: this first element
    Arr: second element that

I am looking for a simple example where `${arr[@]}` in a longer string  
would make things badly fail...
