##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   How was this pull request tested?

Manually on Ubuntu 22.04

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Add an automated restore feature to `REQUESTRESTORE`, similar to how
`NFS4SERVER` works.

Example:

    Confirm the recreated disk layout or go back one step
    1) Confirm recreated disk layout and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Go back one step to redo disk layout recreation
    3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    4) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)

    User confirmed recreated disk layout
    Now you must manually restore your backup.
    Ensure the backup data gets restored into /mnt/local (instead of '/')
    because the disks and filesystems of the target system are mounted there.

    Waiting for /mnt/local/ok file to signal when the restore is completed and recovery can proceed.
    Waiting since 02:05, used storage space: 4.3G
    Restored 4.4G in 02:10 minutes.
    Created SELinux /mnt/local/.autorelabel file : after reboot SELinux will relabel all files
    Recreating directories (with permissions) from /var/lib/rear/recovery/directories_permissions_owner_group

with a config like this:

    REQUESTRESTORE_FINISHED_FILE=ok
    REQUESTRESTORE_ABORT_FILE=bad

Without those two variables the behaviour is like before, with a prompt
and dropping the user into `rear_shell`.

This will also help with \#2988 for this backup method.

I used the following command on another computer to perform the remote
restore of a backup created via `BACKUP=NETFS`

    ssh root@192.168.11.52 "tar -C /mnt/local -x -v -z && echo >/mnt/local/ok" </srv/scratch/rear-u2204/backup.tar.gz

@codefritzel what do you think?

@rear/contributors please have a look, I'd like to merge this soon

The output is a very good idea and also adopted for `NFS4SERVER`.
