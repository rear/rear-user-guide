Stock ubuntu 20.04 with official installed borg and rear package.  
Made backup with rear mkbackup, then tried to recover with usb
pendrive.  
Rear recover gived error message: `Failed to list Borg archive.`  
In console borg gived error:

    /usr/bin/python3: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

(tried with rear 2.6 but with similar result)

Hello @zolalmasi

Maybe
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1727)
can help you ?

Yes I think my fault... at n.th reading documentation I found:  
We strongly recommend to use Borg standalone binary (..) as it includes
all necessities for Borg operations. If you decide to go for different
type of Borg installation types, make sure you include all needed files
for Borg runtime into ReaR rescue/recovery system. E.g. by using
COPY\_AS\_IS\_BORG=( '/usr/lib64/python3.4\*' '/usr/bin/python3\*'
'/usr/bin/pyvenv\*' '/usr/lib/python3.4\*' '/usr/lib64/libpython3\*' )

@zolalmasi  
to test whether or not things work inside the ReaR recovery system  
without the need to boot the ReaR recovery system you could set

    KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"

in your `etc/rear/local.conf` and after "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
`chroot` into TMPDIR/rear.XXX/rootfs/  
and run things inside the ReaR recovery system as a test, see  
`KEEP_BUILD_DIR` in your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
also online for current ReaR GitHub master code at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L148](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L148)

Of course such tests are no replacement for a real "rear recover"
test,  
cf. "No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation"
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
but such tests help to find obvious issues in the ReaR recovery system
more easily.
