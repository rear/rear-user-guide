-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.00 git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Arch rolling
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? UEFI
-   Brief description of the issue: vi not available on host results in
    /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/[500\_confirm\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/500_confirm_layout.sh):
    `line 22: vi: command not found`.

[Linux.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf)
contains at least 3 different editors in the PROGS array (to copy to the
recovery env.):

1.  [vi](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L76)
2.  [pico](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L77)
3.  [nano](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L78)

Don't assume that vi is available
---------------------------------

Image a slim (Arch) Linux installation (not those fat distros RHEL,
Ubuntu, etcetera) that comes with no editor. A user has got a preference
for a specific text editor, and only installs that text editor **only**.

No vi installed
---------------

When that text editor is not `vi`, then the ReaR recovery environment
version 2.00 will show an error message when trying to edit the disk
layout (for instance).

Check for editor executable existence
-------------------------------------

Check that the editor is actually on the source system, before using
that editor in 500\_confirm\_layout [and similar vi dependant
scripts](https://github.com/rear/rear/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vi&type=)

#### Mkrescue abort when no editor?

An additional improvement, might be to abort `mkrescue` when no (known)
editor is available on the source system.

#### More then 1 text editor on source?

Then try to guess the user favourite text editor?  
No clue, then look for configuration option?  
Still no clue, then ask the user?

As far as I know it does not really matter  
when things in PROGS array do not actually exist.

Only for the REQUIRED\_PROGS array it should matter  
but see

The issue is not whether any editor is required or not. User experience
will improve when Rear picks the editor that is available instead of
having a hard-coded `vi`.

I guess this is a really difficult topic. To be correct we should be
looking at `$VISUAL` and `$EDITOR`, however most users set that in their
user environment and not globally (ReaR runs as `root` and not as a
user). Also, that would mean handling cases like me where
`EDITOR=atom -w` which obviously won't work in the ReaR rescue system.

So what is the best fall-back option? IMHO we should decide upon one
editor which we always take along, e.g. `nano`, and also make sure that
is is present via `REQUIRED_PROGS` and package dependencies. That way we
can guarantee that there will be a functioning editor in the rescue
environment.

To soften that we could go ahead and respect the `EDITOR` environment
variable and pull that into `REQUIRED_PROGS` and pray that it won't need
any other files that we are not aware of. Since this seems rather risky
I would prefer deciding upon a standard editor.

Hi all!

If I can vote for a default editor I will vote for `vi` ;-P

I think "rear mkrescue" could inspect whatever  
is appropriate to find root's preferred editor  
but I also think it must be implemented  
based on a whitelist of known editors  
that are supported by ReaR to avoid  
things like "EDITOR=/usr/local/X11/fancyGUIedit"  
could make it into the ReaR recovery system.

The final fallback must be 'vi' and if that one  
is not available on the source system  
"rear mkrescue" must error out (see below).

@didacog  
the main issue here is not about what editor to use  
by default when several editors are available,  
the main issue is to ensure there is at least one editor  
available in the recovery system (and use that one).

@ProBackup-nl  
I agree to abort mkrescue when no (known) editor is available  
on the source system.

In general I think a ReaR rescue/recovery system must contain  
an editor even if usually no editor should be actually needed  
(usually "rear recover" should "just work") but in general  
any rescue system must contain an editor.

Regarding that "rear mkrescue" may not abort when  
needed programs for the recovery system are missing,  
see above

@ProBackup-nl **To reverse the question: why would you need an editor to
recover when the source OS does not have any editor?**

We should try to avoid to over-commit ReaR with zillion of pre-condition
tests.

@gdha  
I disagree regarding "pre-condition tests".

I think we should add "zillions of pre-condition tests"  
to "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" so that ReaR errors out early  
when things are not as expected during "mkbackup/mkrescue"  
cf. "Try to care about possible errors" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

This way users get known in advance that something  
is not as expected by ReaR instead of the current behaviour  
where usually "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" succeeds  
but later when it is too late for the user to get things  
properly fixed (e.g. install needed stuff), "rear recover" fails,  
cf. "The user's ultimate expectation: 'rear recover' works" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide)

Of course there will be a reasonable compromise  
between ultimate expectations and feasibility.

@jsmeix if a customized Linux distribution choose to remove an editor -
ReaR would be broken if we force an editor. Therefore, I would avoid
editors in the REQUIRED PROG array - it is an user option/decision to
have an editor on-board (for security reasons). And, as such the user
has to make sure DR works with ReaR without intervention required. That
is what I meant by adding zillion of pre-condition tests.

On the one hand I agree with @schlomo  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298\#issuecomment-296192604](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298#issuecomment-296192604)  
that during "rear mkrescue" it should be looking at  
the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables  
but on the other hand this probably leads to  
an endless sequence of subsequent issues  
when VISUAL or EDITOR has "strange" values  
like VISUAL=/usr/bin/X11/xemacs  
or EDITOR=/usr/bin/X11/oowriter  
for particular users ;-)

Therefore it is perhaps best to have another config variable  
REAR\_EDITOR in default.conf that must default to 'vi'  
to keep ReaR working backward compatible regardless  
of any VISUAL or EDITOR setting in particular for those  
users who have a "strange" VISUAL or EDITOR setting.

When the user sets empty REAR\_EDITOR in local.conf  
"rear mkrescue" may do whatever sophisticated magic  
to autodetect "the right one".

Alternatively the user can specify anything to be used  
as editor in the recovery system independent of his  
preferred VISUAL or EDITOR setting in his running system  
(i.e. "final power to the user" ;-)

E.g. the user may prefer EDITOR=/usr/bin/emacs  
in his normal running system but he may also like a small  
ReaR recovery system via REAR\_EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi  
(or whatever fits best for his particular needs).

@gdha The case was not that there is no editor at all on the source os.
The case is that a different editor then 'vi' is on the original system.
My Arch has 'nano' not 'vi'.

As `/bin/nano` is already part of `PROGS` array so we can close this
case.

@gdha  
this enhancement request is that when /usr/bin/vi is not available  
but another editor is available e.g. /usr/bin/nano  
then all hardcoded places in ReaR that currently call `vi`  
(mainly user dialogs that offer choices to edit files  
like disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh)  
would have to be cleaned up and enhanced  
to call an actually available editor.

I enhanced the most important user dialogs with the generic choice  
`Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here`  
specifically the user dialogs in  
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/500\_confirm\_layout\_file.sh  
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/200\_recreate\_hpraid.sh  
/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/100\_confirm\_layout\_code.sh  
/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh  
/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/020\_confirm\_finalize.sh

My personal reason is that when I need to change something  
I prefer in general to use the ReaR shell because there  
I can do anything I want.

Accordingly in current ReaR the user can already call  
whatever editor he likes via using the ReaR shell  
so that this enhancement request can be considered  
to be already mostly done in practice.

At least I will not have time for further enhancements here  
in the foreseeable future so that I set it to "fixed/solved/done"  
because I think it works currently sufficiently o.k. in practice  
even if it is not yet fully done as requested.
