Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   manually this Debian 11/12 an Bareos 21 and 23.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   mostly modernizing the Bareos integration, making it more
        robust.
    -   this should only affect the Bareos bconsole integration, not the
        Bareos bextract integration. I've not tested the bextract
        integration, but fixed an obvious typo in it, therefore I doubt
        that is has been working before.
    -   "Automatic Recovery" is working with these changes.

-   Questions

    -   The restore in the original code did start `rear_shell` at the
        end of the restore. I added an optional execution to of
        `rear_shell` also to `410_restore_backup_bconsole.sh`. I could
        not figure out (by comparing to other integrations) if this is a
        good approach or not. A hint about the best practice to finish a
        restore would be welcome.
    -   Is there a function to determine how much data have been written
        to the disks? I mean something like `df`, but it should sum up
        all mounts below `/mnt/local`

-   Remark:

    -   as already discussed with @gdha we receiving reports of
        Bareos/Rear users getting hit by \#2901. While this problem is
        long been solved in master, the fix is not in the latest release
        rear-2.7. A new release would be very welcome.

@joergsteffens Reviewed the code updates (quite a bit a must say). The
updates seems a serious improvement over the current bareos code base
and are most welcome.  
If you do not care about distro's without systemd then I would merge
your code updates as is if there are no comments from my fellow
@rear/contributors (by the end of this week)?

> @joergsteffens Are you sure that Bareos will start properly on older
> distro's? (without systemd)

Good point. No, it will not, but we oldest release Bareos supports is
bareos-21 and the oldest distros bareos-21 supports are CentOS\_7,
Debian\_10, Fedora\_34, RHEL\_7, SLE\_12\_SP5, Univention\_4.4,
openSUSE\_Leap\_15.2, xUbuntu\_18.04  
All of them to support systemd. So from Bareos point of view this is
fine.

But it might be a good idea to add a check for systemd in prep. Is there
a function or variable I can query to determine if the target rescue
system will contain systemd?

@joergsteffens If the system where you initiate `rear mkrescue` on
contains systemd then the ReaR ISO image will also contain systemd. ReaR
v2.6 and higher have systemd services on-board by default.

In general regarding things like:

    Will Bareos start properly on older distro's without systemd?

and

    might be a good idea to add a check for systemd in pre

I would recommend against such environmental checks.

Instead I recommend in general  
to first and foremost only check "the real thing"  
and usually leave environmental things to the user.

In this case here it would mean:

First and foremost only check that  
Bareos is working properly as actually needed  
and if not clearly tell the user about that  
without additional checks what environmental thing  
might be the cause that Bareos is not working properly.

Ideally show an original Bareos error message to the user  
and leave it to the user to make sense of it what the  
actual root cause is in his particular environment.

When this is properly implemented, then as an optional  
separated additional step there could be environmental  
checks to provide hints to the user what the actual  
root cause could be in his particular environment.

In particular in this case here:  
The systemd environment in the ReaR recovery system  
is rather different (in particular rather minimal)  
compared to the systemd environment on the original system.  
So a simple check whether or not systemd is running  
basically tells nothing whether or not some specific  
systemd service will actually work within the  
ReaR recovery system environment.  
So you may need rather sophisticated checks to really  
find out whether or not the root cause is in systemd  
when Bareos is not working properly as actually needed.

I think, I covered most/all of the feedback. However the changes are
pretty much untested. I'll test them soon, hopefully tomorrow.

Only a tiny generic text style side note:

Usually one should not use "please" in user messages  
because computers (i.e. machines) should not beg  
the user (i.e. humans) to do something.  
When machines talk in some kind of personal tone  
to the user it could be perceived as intrusive.

Better simple and straightforward wording,  
for example like:

    Error "Could not determine this system as Bareos client (no BAREOS_CLIENT specified)"

Here I also omitted to tell the user which config file to use  
because the user could not only use local.conf but also  
site.conf or via '-C' whatever other config file.

Same for things like

    Error "Could not determine which restore job to use. Use BAREOS_RESTORE_JOB to specify it."

    Error "Could not determine which restore fileset to use. Use BAREOS_FILESET to configure it."

    LogPrint "
    Verify that the backup has been restored correctly to '$TARGET_FS_ROOT'
    ...

@joergsteffens Please make `bconsole` the default setting in
[https://github.com/joergsteffens/rear/blob/bareos-improvements/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2806](https://github.com/joergsteffens/rear/blob/bareos-improvements/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2806)
(of variable `BAREOS_RESTORE_MODE`). Schlomo told me that you might drop
the bextract restore (as nobody uses it and therefore, never has been
tested properly). The ReaR Automated Testing framework also used only
the `bconsole`way of working.  
That would also reduce the complexity around the `REQUIRED_PROGS_BAREOS`
section as we could get rid of the two extra variables
`REQUIRED_PROGS_BAREOS_BEXTRACT` and `REQUIRED_PROGS_BAREOS_BCONSOLE`.

Furthermore, which versions of Bareos are supported with this update?
Are these all tested? We could list them up in the Test Matrix of 3.0.

Good thoughts, can we state (and maybe check for) a minimum Bareos
version that we want to support? And use that to get rid of some tech
debt?

Bareos supports the current and the last 2 major releases, so currently
bareos-21, bareos-22 and bareos-23. I've tested Debian 11 with bareos-21
and Debian 12 with bareos-23.

I'll remove the bextract parts with this PR and also do some other
improvements soon, in the next days.

One question: is there a better (easy) way to run a program as another
user? I looks that for su (and sudo) I probably need to also include PAM
modules and configuration.  
Currently I plan to add

`chmod u+s,g+s       ${ROOTFS_DIR}/bin/bconsole`

during build.

Reason is that in future version bconsole might limit commands when
running as `root`.

@joergsteffens I'd suggest using
[chroot](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man8/chroot.8.html)
which actually includes the ability to change the user and should be
already part of the ReaR rescue system.

And I just noticed that we already copy all users and groups by default,
according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c2b9a4fe1fcf634c7312ee4def5a6dcf248fccba/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1976-L1980](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c2b9a4fe1fcf634c7312ee4def5a6dcf248fccba/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1976-L1980)

So, with my latest commits, I hope I've now covered all remarks. Feel
free to review it again.

@schlomo thank you for the hint about using `chroot`. This did work
well, but in the end it made the code more complicated, so I decided to
use another approach, without running as another user.

I think, I covered all suggestions.  
Having said this, the github action `build` currently fails in my fork.

I don't see how this is related to my changes.  
I've seen, there have recently been some github actions cleanup
(removing some SUSE distros). Outside of this PR I checked it after
rebasing on master. However, a similar error did appear (this time on
SLES15.6).

I've not rebased this PR so far to make the review not more
complicated.  
Just tell me, if I can do a rebase and if you think the error is related
to my changes.

@gdha nice test! Maybe on some occasion you can also add the automatic
Bareos configuration which should pick up the client, restore job and
fileset automatically if there is only one for each.

I see. I use functionality that has been introduced with bareos-20, see
[https://github.com/bareos/bareos/pull/574](https://github.com/bareos/bareos/pull/574)  
Relevant is the version of the Bareos Director, not the local File
Daemon.

I see 3 options:

-   do nothing, as bareos-19 is not supported by bareos.com anymore
-   add a Director version check and exit with an proper error if the
    Director is too old (for that, could you (@gdha) please issue the
    commands: `.api json` and than `version` on the Director and send me
    the results? Just to make sure, that the version command supports
    the json output mode.)
-   implement a work around. This is harder than I first thought.
    However the code to skip the restore\_job tests, if
    `BAREOS_RESTORE_JOB` has been set manually and Director version is
    less than 20 (or `get_available_restore_job_names` fails. Getting
    all job names and check against them is also easy.).

I'm in favor of actively checking for the minimum supported Bareos
version and erroring out during the `prep` stage if ReaR won't work
properly.

The general philosophy of ReaR is that if you could create a rescue
media than there is a very high probability that you can use it for a
successful recovery. Therefore we need to error out in prep for as many
known problems as possible.

@joergsteffens I tested it as follow:

    $ cat bareos_test.sh
    #
    # Bareos version extracting with json api
    #
    DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV="null"

    source ./bareos-functions.sh
    source ./array-functions.sh
    source ./_input-output-functions.sh

    BAREOS_CLIENT=client-fd

    echo "-------------------------------------------"
    bcommand_json "version" | jq -c '.result[].version'
    echo "-------------------------------------------"

and the output is:

    -------------------------------------------
    "19.2.7"
    -------------------------------------------

I think we could add a short prep script to test the Bareos version and
bail out if it is lower then 21?

Makes sense. On pre-releases the version number has an postfix text,
like: `24.0.0~pre668.a159a82bd`. So best only check for the first number
before the dot.  
I'll do so in a separate PR.
