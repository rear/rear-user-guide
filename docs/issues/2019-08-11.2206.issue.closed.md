-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Fedora 30

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    `REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" /home/test/Downloads/borg-linux64 )`

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): UEFI

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

> ERROR: Cannot find required programs:
> /home/test/Downloads/borg-linux64

Upon recovery, ReaR gives an error and aborts when a required program is
specified with an absolute path, which naturally may not exist in the
recovery media.

The program, `borg-linux64` is nevertheless present in the recovery
media, though located in `/bin` as it should.

-   Workaround, if any:

1.  Comment out the `REQUIRED_PROGS` line in `/etc/rear/local.conf` in
    the recovery environment before running `rear recover`.
2.  Use `PROGS` instead of `REQUIRED_PROGS`.

@adatum  
as far as I know PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS are only meant  
to be used with plain program names, cf.
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
and all this way specified programs end up in /bin/ in the ReaR recovery
system.

If you need to copy arbitrary files into the ReaR recovery system  
use COPY\_AS\_IS.

I think how those variables are meant to be used could be better
explained  
in default.conf.

I agree those variables could be explained better, as I struggled to
tell the difference between COPY\_AS\_IS and PROGS. Does COPY\_AS\_IS
put executables in /bin/ ?

I got the impression COPY\_AS\_IS is for copying libraries, though it's
also unclear to me where they would end up being copied to in the rescue
media, i.e. is the path preserved?

The
[documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)
mentions that it is highly recommended to include the borg standalone
executable, but it does not mention how to do this and which variable in
default.conf to use. Ideally, it should be placed in /bin/ in the rescue
media.

Just click [Install Borg backup
link](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#standalone-binary)
in the mentioned documentation.

Excerpt:

    sudo cp borg-linux64 /usr/local/bin/borg
    sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/borg
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/borg

and you are done, no need to include anything ...

V.

@gozora I suppose that is an option, but that means using the standalone
binary on the system. I would rather use the system package so that it
gets automatically updated. The binary is just for including in ReaR
rescue media without dealing with dependencies.

I think
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2397](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2397)
should fix this issue.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2397](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2397)
merged  
this issue as described in its initial comment should be fixed.

But note  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2397\#issuecomment-628535963](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2397#issuecomment-628535963)  
that reads (excerpts):

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( /home/johannes/mypartprobe )
    ...
    inside the recovery system
    one cannot call /home/johannes/mypartprobe
    because inside the recovery system one would have
    to call plain mypartprobe or /bin/mypartprobe
