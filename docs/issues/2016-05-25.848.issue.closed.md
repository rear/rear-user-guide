-   rear version 1.18
-   OS version: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (x86\_64) SP1
-   rear configuration file:

<!-- -->

    BACKUP=NSR
    OUTPUT=ISO
    NSRSERVER=xxx
    NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME=xxx
    NSR_RETENTION_TIME="Month"
    USE_CFG2HTML=y

Brief description:  
After booting from created ISO image I cannot login to the server, no
input is possible with ILO console and the server is not reachable over
the network (ping, ssh, ...)

Is the hardware type supported?  
With a HP Proliant DL 380p Gen8 the backup and recover was successful
with the same ReaR configuration.

When I'm booting the HP Proliant DL 380p Gen8 server from the ISO image
created with the HP ProLiant BL460c Gen9 server it hangs when I have to
choose the network interface to use.

@KingDanTR IMHO you are missing a kernel module which differs between
Gen8 and Gen9. However, I cannot help you with this due to no HW to test
on.

I think the issue is sufficientliy answered (as far as possible  
withou having that hardware available) =&gt; closing it.  
If needed it can be reopened.
