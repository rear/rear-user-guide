-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Changed double quotes (") to single quotes(') in documentation  
    related to BORG\_PASSPHRASE variable. Double quotes will not avoid  
    expanding of variable when '$' sign is used inside pass phrase
    string,  
    which can lead to unsuccessful opening of Borg archive.
