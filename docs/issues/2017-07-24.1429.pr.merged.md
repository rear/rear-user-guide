about the many contributors who helped ReaR. Fixes \#1427

For minor changes please simply push to this branch. For bigger ones let
me know and I'll do the work.

I'll ask everybody to review. If I don't hear from you within a couple
of days/weeks then I assume that you consent to this change.

I wonder if it is legally (i.e. according to the GPL)  
sufficient to have the authors and contributors  
(I think in GPL wording all relevant contributors  
are legally same as authors) only mentioned indirectly  
via an external link as in

<pre>
To see the full list of authors and their contributions please look at
https://github.com/rear/rear/graphs/contributors
</pre>

Perhaps we must provide a list of the authors in a source file?  
Perhaps we can leave out the e-mail addresses of the authors?

Or does a git repository count as sources for the GPL?  
I.e. what one gets via

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
</pre>

because that contains all authors and their contributions  
in the git log - but a special tool 'git' is needed here  
to "pull out" the authors and their contributions.

@jsmeix I share your concern. It seems that the FSF serves as some kind
of a copyright proxy
([https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Copyright-Papers.html](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html)),
but the process seems quite cumbersome on first reading. Can you maybe
ask the specialists at SUSE for some practical advise?

@schlomo  
I will ask them but from my (outsider) experience  
often a lawyer cannot provide concrete practical advise  
because (as far as I understand it) license issues are  
often complicated without matching court decisions  
so that often "it depends..."

The currently proposed MAINTAINERS file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/93e544a258ff184d09b94a5c7128380a488b3227/MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/93e544a258ff184d09b94a5c7128380a488b3227/MAINTAINERS)  
lists Dag Wieers and Jeroen Hoekx  
but as far as I see they do no longer actively maintain ReaR.

I think the MAINTAINERS file is meant to list  
those who currently actively maintain ReaR.

I think a MAINTAINERS file is not meant to list all  
contributors which is what an AUTHORS file is meant to do.

Accordingly I think when Dag Wieers and Jeroen Hoekx  
really do no longer actively maintain ReaR, then they  
should no longer be not listed in the MAINTAINERS file.

Alternatively the MAINTAINERS file could have separated  
sections to distinguish currently active maintainers  
from no longer active maintainers.

E.g. something as the "Alumni" section in the exhaustive and
explanatory  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/MAINTAINERS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/MAINTAINERS)  
but probably much shorter for what ReaR actually needs.

I'll ask them

BTW I noticed that I still have merge rights on this repository. This
probably dates back from the time we moved to Github. (Which I think was
the best decision we could have made ;-))

You may want to restrict my "write" access (and probably @jhoekx too)
for security purposes. It would still be nice to stay as a member of the
project though.

And when there is a need to have commit/merge rights again, I'm sure we
can enable it again at that time.

@jsmeix I know that this is not perfect, I hope that this is a step into
the right direction.

@schlomo  
for me it is "sufficiently perfect" üëç cf.
