Currenr rear master.

Basically same issue as
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793)

Now it happened for the very first time to me:

<pre>
RESCUE e229:~ # rear -d -D recover
Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-e229.log
Starting required daemons for NFS: RPC portmapper (portmap or rpcbind) and rpc.statd if available.
Started RPC portmapper 'rpcbind'.
RPC portmapper 'rpcbind' available.
RPC status rpc.statd available.
NOTICE: Will do driver migration
Calculating backup archive size

Comparing disks.
Disk configuration is identical, proceeding with restore.
Start system layout restoration.
Creating partitions for disk /dev/sda (msdos)
An error occurred during layout recreation.
</pre>

and in /var/log/rear/rear-e229.log theer is

<pre>
+++ echo -e 'Creating partitions for disk /dev/sda (msdos)'
+++ my_udevsettle
+++ has_binary udevadm
+++ for bin in '$@'
+++ type udevadm
+++ return 0
+++ udevadm settle
+++ parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos
Error: Partition(s) 2 on /dev/sda have been written, but we have been unable to inform the kernel of the change, probably because it/they are in use.  As a result, the old partition(s) w
ill remain in use.  You should reboot now before making further changes.
++ ((  1 == 0  ))
++ LogPrint 'An error occurred during layout recreation.'
</pre>

I can even reproduce it in that particular running  
rear recovery system.

Therefore I will now play around with it  
and try to change some rear script(s)  
so that the issue is avoided.

False alarm.

This is not
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793)

In my case parted is fully right to state

<pre>
Error: Partition(s) 2 on /dev/sda have been written,
but we have been unable to inform the kernel of the change,
probably because it/they are in use.
</pre>

because I had /mnt/local still mounted from a previos  
intentionally by me interrupted "rear recover" run  
in that same recovery system.

After I did "umount /mnt/local" another "rear recover" run  
just works.

Therefore this issue here is invalid.
