Right now I was informed about  
[https://github.com/p-gen/smenu](https://github.com/p-gen/smenu)

<pre>
This simple tool reads words from the standard input,
presents them in a cool interactive window
after the current line on the terminal
and writes the selected word, if any,
on the standard output.
</pre>

and  
[http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/smenu/%28offset%29/0](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/smenu/%28offset%29/0)

Probably not directly usable for ReaR right now  
(unless smenu became usually installed on Linux systems)  
but in general it looks interesting so that I like  
to have you informend hereby.

@jsmeix looks to be a cool tool, but I not really usable within ReaR as
not (yet) part of the core OS repositories
