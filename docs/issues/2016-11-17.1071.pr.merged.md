See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069)

I introduced the new RESTORE\_ARCHIVES() array that  
contains the restore input files for 400\_restore\_backup.sh

I did major changes in 400\_restore\_backup.sh  
so that it now launches a separated restore subshell together  
with the progress stuff for each element in RESTORE\_ARCHIVES.

Together with changes in 070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
it does now already restore real incremental backups  
(i.e. one full backup plus several incremental backups).

For example assume during several "rear mkbackup"  
the backup directory contains:

<pre>
2016-11-15-1502-F.tar.gz
2016-11-16-1057-I.tar.gz
2016-11-16-1100-I.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1324-F.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1348-I.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1354-I.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1451-I.tar.gz
</pre>

then "rear recover" will restore those backups:

<pre>
2016-11-17-1324-F.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1348-I.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1354-I.tar.gz
2016-11-17-1451-I.tar.gz
</pre>

i.e. the latest full backup plus all incremental backups  
afterwards.  
The "rear recover" output looks then like (excerpt):

<pre>
Restoring from '/tmp/rear.YKFtL4WiICTkRPF/outputfs/d108/2016-11-17-1324-F.tar.gz'...
Restored 2426 MiB [avg 70992 KiB/sec] OK
Restored 2426 MiB in 36 seconds [avg 69020 KiB/sec]
Restoring from '/tmp/rear.YKFtL4WiICTkRPF/outputfs/d108/2016-11-17-1348-I.tar.gz'...
Restored 11 MiB [avg 11288 KiB/sec] OK
Restored 11 MiB in 2 seconds [avg 5644 KiB/sec]
Restoring from '/tmp/rear.YKFtL4WiICTkRPF/outputfs/d108/2016-11-17-1354-I.tar.gz'...
Restoring... OK
Restoring from '/tmp/rear.YKFtL4WiICTkRPF/outputfs/d108/2016-11-17-1451-I.tar.gz'...
Restoring... OK
Restoring finished.
</pre>

Note that when the backup archive is very small  
the current progress stuff in 400\_restore\_backup.sh  
(I did not change its behaviour) does not show  
any "Restored ... MiB \[avg ... KiB/sec\]" message  
because it waits initially one second and during that  
one second the restore had already finished.

Now I re-implemented differential backup, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069\#issuecomment-261301219](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069#issuecomment-261301219)

For my first tests now differential backup  
and real incremental backup work well.

In particular I annihilated the RFC 1925 6a indirection  
of using special timestamp.txt and basebackup.txt files  
that caused more indirections (i.e. dirty hacks) as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1066\#issuecomment-260638160](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1066#issuecomment-260638160)

Now incremental/differential backup works plain and simple  
only on the file names of the backup archives.

This has the advantage that the admin can change  
only the backup archives as he likes and  
incremental/differential backup will "just work".  
Of couse when the admin deletes required backup archives  
(e.g. the full backup) then "rear recover" cannot restore  
from what is not there.

Furthermore I made FULLBACKUPDAY an array so that  
now on several weekdays a full backup can be triggered.

Regardless that for me it works well currently,  
I will not merge it right now but wait over the weekend  
so that others might be able to test it.

Furthermore I have to adapt the meanwhile outdated  
other documentation that BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental  
is actually a differential backup.

The current behaviour is documented only in default.conf.

Finally I have to improve the messaging  
because currently it shows same messages  
for "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover"  
but the messages about what backup will be created  
are at least misleading in case of "rear recover" where  
it should be shown what backups will be restored.

Tested again in several ways and usual backup  
and incremantal and differential backup  
all work for me.

I think the general approach with using  
an RESTORE\_ARCHIVES() array  
to support multiple restore archives  
is the right (and future-proof) way to go.

Therefore I will merge that major change now  
so that all GitHub master code users will test it  
so that in case of regressions I have sufficient time  
to fix them properly until the next ReaR release.
