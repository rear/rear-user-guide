1.  Added automatic OS vendor and version detection.
2.  Added logic to search for kernel files in using default
    /boot/vmlinuz-`uname -r` pattern in the event that the standard
    ELILO kernel install paths come up empty.

Added legacy LILO bootloader support.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On a Slackware 14.2 OS, performed a full backup to and recover from
    a USB device. Was able to boot with coldstarted disk using basic
    LILO bootloader. Should not conflict with other bootloader types
    (GRUB and ELILO).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Updates to ease the backup/recover process of a Slackware OS using
    the legacy LILO bootloader.
