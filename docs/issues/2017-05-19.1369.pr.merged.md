Patch to support grub2 installation with software RAID1 on Linux on
POWER (ppc64/ppc64le)

-   Need to loop over multiple PReP partition and install grub2 on it.
-   Need to use chroot with set a proper PATH in order for
    grub2-install  
    to call additional tool when `/boot` is set on md devices.

Tested with CentOS 7 LE pp64le

@schabrolles great stuff! ReaR users really have to thank you a lot for
your contributions.

I just was wondering about the following question: What is - from a ReaR
perspective - the difference between ppc64 and ppc64le? Maybe we can
treat them as one similar to how we treat i386 and amd64 as one?

Only FYI as a side note regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1369\#issuecomment-302673437](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1369#issuecomment-302673437)  
I used

<pre>
# find usr/share/rear -name '*.sh' -ls | grep ppc64
</pre>

and it seems much is same for ppc64 and ppc64le  
but I found some differences in several files.

@schlomo  
it refers to the [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

-   During 90's, most the UNIX were Big Endian (AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, etc
    ...). (POWER runs IBM AIX)
-   In 2001, Linux is supported on POWER (big-endian was choosen, may be
    easier to migrate as AIX was Big-Endian)
-   In 2013, IBM want to accelerate Linux on POWER and create [openPOWER
    foundation](https://openpowerfoundation.org/) (google, nvidia, IBM,
    mellanox etc ...)  
    OpenPOWER push Little-Endian (easier to port x86 code on POWER as
    x86 is Little Endian).

**POWER8 processor can run Big or Little Endian:**  
but binary are Big or Little Endian =&gt; OS is Big or Litlle  
**ppc64**: refers to the original ppc 64 bits (big-endian)  
**ppc64le** : refers to the new architecture ppc 64 bits little endian

*The future is clearly ppc64le. ppc64 still exists for transition of
application to LE*

From a user/admin point of LE or BE are the same, we choose the right
version depending to the availability of the software we want to use.

Short status of what is available on POWER:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Linux distro</th>
<th>Endianness</th>
<th>Bootloader</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>RedHat 6</td>
<td>ppc64 only</td>
<td>yaboot</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>RedHat 7.1 or &gt;</td>
<td>ppc64 or ppc64le <em>(2 different version)</em></td>
<td>grub2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Sles11</td>
<td>ppc64 only</td>
<td>yaboot/lilo</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sles12</td>
<td>ppc64le only</td>
<td>grub2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Ubuntu</td>
<td>ppc64le only <em>(named ppc64el !!!!)</em></td>
<td>grub2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>debian</td>
<td>ppc64le only</td>
<td>grub2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Redhat 7 is the only Linux distro with 2 different version available (BE
or LE)  
Grub2 is the preferred bootloader for new distro.

I hope it answers to your question.

@jsmeix I think there is some cleaning we can make there to avoid
duplicates...  
the command you gave definitely help to find them...  
`find usr/share/rear -name '*.sh' -ls | grep ppc64`

The table above could help to understand some choice I made like:  
if ppc64le =&gt; grub2  
but ppc64 can be yaboot (rh6), lilo(sles11), grub2(rh7be)

@schlomo I update the code with `/usr/sbin/env` instead of
`/bin/bash`... it works  
tested with centos7 ppc64le

@schabrolles thanks for the nice overview. What I meant is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L78](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L78)
where we map all x86 and x64 architectures to i386 because there is no
difference in code (and we use `/lib*` instead of `/lib` to mask the
difference).

I was wondering if the same could be done for either all ppc
architectures or at least for all ppc64 architectures.

@schlomo Yes, they are quite equivalent. I already try to use link when
I can.

I prefer ppc64 -&gt; ppc64le as it will be the "preferred" architecture
for the future.

The command provided by @jsmeix will help us to continue the cleaning
for the ppc64/ppc64le part.

If all what belongs directly to this pull request is solved  
I would like to merge it tomorrow (to get it into ReaR 2.1)  
unless there are objections.

The general ppc64/ppc64le cleanup should  
be done after the ReaR 2.1 release.

I guess RedHat will be very happy to support PPC with ReaR :-)

Merged to have that in ReaR 2.1.
