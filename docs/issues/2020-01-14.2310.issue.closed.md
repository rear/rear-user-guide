Hello dear Devs ;-)

I would like to report a bug(at least it looks like a bug to me) and
hopefully contribute to the project and help you guys to make your great
project even more polished and stable.

**Description:**  
Netmask suffix E.g. /24 or /16 are ignored when you define them in
ip\_addresses file on SLES15 SP01 System. After restore the system ends
up with ip-configuration like this: `192.168.20.192/32`.

**Steps to reproduce:**  
defining ip-addresses in the rescue-system before restore:

    vi /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses
    eth0 192.168.20.192/24
    eth1 192.168.21.192/24
    eth2 172.20.20.192/16

After restoring my network config files look like this

    cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0
    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.20.192'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 1'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

As one can see the netmask value /24 or /16 is ignored/missing.

This is how the config file should look like(note /24 suffix):

    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.20.192/24'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 1'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

Would you kindly check and fix the issue.

**Additional info:**

-   Rear Version: Relax-and-Recover 2.5-git.0.ef3febb.unknown.changed /
    2019-07-04
-   System architecture: PPC64LE -&gt; Power9 CPU
-   Bootloader: GRUB
-   Hardware: IBM E950 (PowerVM LPAR)
-   OS version: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1

Thank you so much in advance!

@tumbajamba  
thank you for your report!

I am not a real networking expert but I think the root cause could be
in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
therein the code parts that are related to

    # change the ip addresses in the configuration files if a mapping is available

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh\#L78](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh#L78)  
which contains in particular

    # TODO: what if NETMASK keyword is not defined?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh\#L95](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh#L95)  
where that code originates from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8472c46b31de2b748a6f948325101a970c452e61](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8472c46b31de2b748a6f948325101a970c452e61)

As far as I understand that code part

            # RHEL 4, 5,... cannot handle IPADDR="x.x.x.x/cidr"
            nmask=$(prefix2netmask ${new_ip#*/})    # ipaddress/cidr (recalculate the cidr)
            if [[ "$nmask" = "0.0.0.0" ]]; then
                nmask=""
                nip="$new_ip"           # keep ipaddress/cidr
            else
                nip="${new_ip%%/*}"     # only keep ipaddress
            fi

            # Fedora/Suse Family
            for network_file in $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/sysconfig/*/ifcfg-*${new_mac}* $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/sysconfig/*/ifcfg-*${dev}*; do
                # TODO: what if NETMASK keyword is not defined? Should be keep new_ip then??
                sed_script="s#^IPADDR=.*#IPADDR='${nip}'#g;s#^NETMASK=.*#NETMASK='${nmask}'#g;s#^NETWORK=.*#NETWORK=''#g;s#^BROADCAST=.*#BROADCAST=''#g;s#^BOOTPROTO=.*#BOOTPROTO='static'#g
    ;s#STARTMODE='[mo].*#STARTMODE='auto'#g;/^IPADDR_/d;/^LABEL_/d;/^NETMASK_/d"

I think

    nmask=$(prefix2netmask ${new_ip#*/})

results `nmask=255.255.255.0` for `new_ip=192.168.20.192/24`  
according to what is described for the prefix2netmask function  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh\#L85](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh#L85)  
and then (because \`"$nmask" = "0.0.0.0" is false)

    nip="${new_ip%%/*}"

results `nip=192.168.20.192`  
but because in /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0  
the NETMASK keyword is not defined  
the sed\_script replaces the IPADDR only with the  
plain new IP `192.168.20.192` without the `/24` CIDR suffix.

Accordingly I think what needs to be done is to implement the

    # TODO: what if NETMASK keyword is not defined?

part in
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh

@tumbajamba  
to verify if my assumptions in my above

Ugh!  
It seems there is much more TODO in this area to get things working  
sufficiently well with nowadays network ifcfg file syntax because  
on my SLES15-like openSUSE Leap 15.0 system  
/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template  
shows in particular

    ## Type:    string
    ## Default: ""
    #
    # If using a static configuration you have to set an IP address and a netmask
    # or prefix length. The following examples are equivalent:
    #
    # 1) IPADDR=192.168.1.1/24     # NETMASK and PREFIXLEN will be ignored
    # 2) IPADDR=192.168.1.1
    #    PREFIXLEN=24              # NETMASK will be ignored
    # 3) IPADDR=192.168.1.1
    #    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    #
    # For multiple addresses use this variable multiple times and extend them with
    # different suffixes. For example IPADDR_1=, IPADDR_2=. See section 'Multiple
    # addresses' in manpage ifcfg).
    #
    IPADDR=

    ## Type:    string
    ## Default: ""
    #
    # Set the network mask for the ip address. This variable will be ignored if a
    # prefixlength is set in variable PREFIXLEN in IPADDR.
    # For multiple addresses use the same suffixes as with IPADDR.
    #
    # Note: Deprecated IPv4 only variable.
    #
    NETMASK=

    ## Type:    integer(0,64)
    ## Default: ""
    #
    # Set the prefixlength of the ip address. This variable will be ignored if a
    # prefixlength is set in variable IPADDR.
    # For multiple addresses use the same suffixes as with IPADDR.
    #
    PREFIXLEN=

so we would have to add supprt for all combinations of  
IPADDR, NETMASK, PREFIXLEN ...

@jsmeix  
To make things complete I would like to suggest you implement the
function for changing the hostname of the target machine just like:

    vi /etc/rear/mappings/hostname
    new-server-name

That is a pretty cool step for the deployment of new machines based on
REAR.

@tumbajamba  
what "function for changing the hostname of the target machine" do you
mean?

I do not find the string `hostname` in any usr/share/rear/finalize file

    # find usr/share/rear/finalize/ -type f | xargs grep -i 'hostname'

results no output for me so I assume there is currently no  
"function for changing the hostname of the target machine"  
in ReaR?

@jsmeix  
Hahaha I'm sorry for confusing you ;-) It was an idea btw. suggestion
for a new feature "changing hostname for target machine". Since you've
already implemented features like:

    mappings/ip_addresses
    mappings/routes
    .....

So it would just make sense to implement a function:  
`mappings/hostname`

Which would complete the processes of deploying a new server out of the
existing machine based on REAR-Software.

It doesn't have anything to do with the current bug-ticket.

The `return 1` lines come from the read\_and\_strip\_file function  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh\#L11](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L11)  
and show that there is none of the mapping files

    /etc/rear/mappings/mac
    /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses
    /etc/rear/mappings/routes

in the ReaR recovery system where "rear recover" is running  
which contradicts your initial description where you wrote  
that you have /etc/rear/mappings/ip\_addresses  
in your ReaR recovery system:

    defining ip-addresses in the rescue-system before restore:

    vi /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses

@jsmeix  
I'm going to double-check this and make another restore attempt with a

Aghhh! You right, I recovered the LPAR again without ip\_addresses just
before I went home yesterday! I'll generate another log

Currently
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313)  
is just an initial incomplete "submit early submit often" part of
today  
so that you could have an early look at what I am doing  
(perhaps you notice already issues by plain looking at my changes,  
in particular my comments describe what I think what the code does)  
of a general cleanup as a first step which I do primarily  
to get some basic understanding of the code.  
There is not yet any actual enhancement (that will be the second step).

@jsmeix  
It sounds good that you've already started to polish and comment the
code, keep updates coming.

As far as I understand there are several ways of defining netmask on
SLES/SUSE 15 in `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*`.

Are you going to process them depending on syntax in initial(source)
config files found in source system?

like this:

    IF source                            THEN target

    1) NETMASK=255.255.255.0             NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    2) IPADDR=192.168.1.1/24             IPADDR=192.168.1.2/24 
    3) PREFIXLEN=24                      PREFIXLEN=24

According to `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template` the parameter
`NETMASK=` is deprecated:

    ## Type:    string
    ## Default: ""
    #
    # Set the network mask for the ip address. This variable will be ignored if a
    # prefixlength is set in variable PREFIXLEN in IPADDR.
    # For multiple addresses use the same suffixes as with IPADDR.
    #
    # Note: Deprecated IPv4 only variable.
    #
    NETMASK=

So it might be a good idea to always use 192.168.1.2/24 notation since
it seems to be compatible with standard yast syntax and according to
`ifcfg.template ` is the most "dominant" solution which overwrites all
other options. In this case other netmask entries(`PREFIXLEN,NETMASK`)
should be removed from the config file.

@tumbajamba  
because
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
works on the user's restored files of his target system in /mnt/local  
what it does must match what there is on the user's target system.

E.g. when the user has

    IPADDR=192.168.1.1
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0

cf. example `3)` in the /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template excerpt  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-574574414](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-574574414)  
then finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
needs to adapt that existing syntax only to the new values.

It is already somewhat scaring that during "rear recover" finalize
stage  
some of the user's (normally sacrosanct) config files from  
his restored backup get "just modified" in an automated  
(and mostly silent) way by ReaR without an explicit confirmation  
from the user that he wants ReaR to do that.

I will never ever implement automated modification by ReaR  
of the used syntax (or even semantics) in user's own files.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312)  
I have some first ideas how to provide generic functionality in ReaR  
so that the user can manually and explicitly specify the exact things  
that he needs to be done during "rear recover" finalize stage how  
to adapt and modify his own restored files in his (re)-created  
target system.  
This follows my general `final power to the user` principle,  
cf. things like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2283\#pullrequestreview-322105398](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2283#pullrequestreview-322105398)  
that reads (excerpt):

    Because I want "final power to the user"
    it is mandatory for me that there are basically
    no hardcoded "decisions" in ReaR.

    Instead there must be for basically all and everything
    a config variable (exceptions are common "hardcoded"
    values like etc/fstab) so that the user can - if needed -
    specify what he wants and then ReaR has to obey
    which means ReaR must error out when the user
    specified something plain wrong or impossible.

    Usually config variables should be empty by default
    which means by default ReaR will try its automated things
    or ... config variables have a reasonable default value
    when there is no automatism implemented.

Hello @jsmeix,

I tested your script and found at least one bug.  
Let me explain:

I have 3 network interfaces in my server. The config of each looks like
this:

    /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0

    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.20.191/24'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 0'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

    /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1

    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.21.191'
    NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 1'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'



    /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth2

    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='172.20.20.191'
    PREFIXLEN=16
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 2'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

After a backup, I restored my SLES with the following
**mappings/ip\_addresses** config:

    /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses

    eth0 192.168.20.192/24
    eth1 192.168.21.192/24
    eth2 172.20.20.192/16

The result was like this:

    cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0
    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.20.191/24'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 0'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

    lin0000:~ # cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1
    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.21.191'
    NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 1'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

    lin0000:~ # cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth2
    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='172.20.20.191'
    PREFIXLEN=16
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 2'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

The IP-Address from **mappings/ip\_addresses** doesn't work, instead,
the new script is using original IP address which is a bit dangerous,
since it may cause IP address conflict in the network.

@tumbajamba  
thank you so much for testing it!

I expected that you find issues and I need such testing and feedback  
to get to a point where things work OK (to some reasonable extent).

Could you attach here a `rear -D recover` debug log file  
so that I can see what exactly goes on on your system?

Regarding how to get a `rear -D recover` debug log file  
see the section "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@jsmeix  
sure! Thx a lot!  
[rear-lin0000.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4287797/rear-lin0000.log)

By the way, I found a misconfiguration on my end:

    cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1

    BOOTPROTO='static'
    BROADCAST=''
    ETHTOOL_OPTIONS=''
    IPADDR='192.168.21.191/24'
    NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
    MTU=''
    NAME='Virtual Ethernet card 1'
    NETWORK=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='auto'

This config contains two diffrent netmask notation: **/24** and
**255.255.255.0**, so ignore this issue if you find it in the log file,
its not a problem of your script.

@tumbajamba  
in your case 320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
does basically nothing so it seems the result in your case is still  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-574595709](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-574595709)

As far as I see it seems the root cause is  
that you do not have a `/etc/mappings/mac` file so  
320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh does

    Using generated fallback $TMP_DIR/mappings/mac file (/etc/rear/mappings/mac is missing or has no content)

but that fallback seems to not work.

I thought a `/etc/mappings/mac` file gets automatically generated by  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
and/or by  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/300\_create\_mac\_mapping.sh  
so that usually a `/etc/mappings/mac` file should be there  
but it seems that code also does not work  
or I misunderstand how that whole stuff is meant to work.

Currently I am confused and I will need sufficient time  
to get that whole networking migration code  
somewhat sorted out...

@jsmeix  
But wouldn't it be the easiest just to use IP-addresses from
`/etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses` in case there is no
`/etc/mappings/mac` available or even use them always in general? Why
would you need the mac file if you just want to swap the IP-addresses?

@tumbajamba  
I tried hard to not change how things work in ReaR  
so as a first step for now I only intended to  
"Cleanup and enhance 320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh"  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313)  
which is only a general cleanup as first step which I do primarily  
to get some basic understanding of the code, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313\#issue-363216311](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313#issue-363216311)  
because "I am not a real networking expert" see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-574568493](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-574568493)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-574654142](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-574654142)

Anything more would have to happen via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312)  
where currently nothing at all is done.

I added "needs sponsorship" (i.e. I need substantial help) because
since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-594591924](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-594591924)  
it does no longer look as if I could do that alone in a reasonable way.

Too bad we are not able to get it fixed. Hopefully, someone would fix it
someday. Thank you for your effort.

@tumbajamba  
no need to give up right now.  
I only meant that I alone won't be able to solve it in a reasonable
way.  
Therefore I asked for help and because of  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)  
there is hope that things might get solved even sooner than later.  
On the other hand ReaR upstream maintainers are often very busy  
with other tasks (those stuff what primarily makes their salary)  
so solving things might get delayed for a long time, e.g. cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799\#issuecomment-531247109](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799#issuecomment-531247109)

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before, cf.  
"Goal: Recreate a destroyed system" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and in most cases ReaR is used in this way.

Changing the system via "rear recover" is what we call "migration"  
and that is not done so often so that it is neither as well tested  
nor as well supported as the "recreating exactly as before" case.  
E.g. ReaR does not fully support to migrate the bootloader, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437)

For example personally I only use DHCP when testing ReaR  
because it is not so easy for me to get some fixed IP addresses  
that I could use in my network (i.e. in SUSE's network)  
for testing IP address migration with ReaR and in general  
networking stuff is not so much on my personal agenda.

As far as I can imagine the current workaround to migrate  
the networking setup on the recreated tartget system is  
to do that manually after "rear recover" had finished  
but still from inside the running ReaR recovery system  
by manually adapting the restored network config files  
of the recreated tartget system in `/mnt/local/etc/...`  
or by `chroot /mnt/local` to manually adapt the networking  
setup inside the recreated tartget system while still the kernel  
and the networking setup of the ReaR recovery system is used.  
To avoid that the networking setup of the ReaR recovery system is  
using the IP address of the original system you may use DHCP  
in the ReaR recovery system or setup networking of the ReaR  
recovery system manually, cf. in "man rear" the section  
"RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and config variables like `USE_DHCLIENT` `USE_RESOLV_CONF`  
`NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS` in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

From my personal perception "system migration with ReaR"  
is more and more asked for by ReaR users.  
In particular migration from one kind of hardware to another  
kind of hardware and here mainly migration from physical  
hardware to virtual hardware i.e. "P2V"  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical-to-Virtual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical-to-Virtual)  
but that also does not "just work" with ReaR, cf.  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html)

@tumbajamba  
when you have a sufficient SLE15-HA contract with SUSE, cf.  
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
it might help to speed up things when you submit  
a feature request to SUSE to get something like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312)  
implemented. The drwaback in this case is that usually  
it is me alone who has to do basically all and everything  
for ReaR at SUSE so we could be back in the exact same  
situation as now...

@tumbajamba  
I merged the new 320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/78d7a519b4700c828544df00763a90886e0847a6](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/78d7a519b4700c828544df00763a90886e0847a6)  
so the new one is now available at  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh)

It contains now in particular a recent fix that @yontalcar found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313/commits/9277ff22b623a491556cb560b1bcd3d3172475be](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313/commits/9277ff22b623a491556cb560b1bcd3d3172475be)

The fix is in the code that generates a new `mappings/mac` file  
as fallback when there is none (as in your case) see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh\#L198](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh#L198)  
and subsequent lines.

So perhaps that fix might even help in your case  
so you may try out again how far it works for you.

Only an offhanded unverified idea of a possible reason  
why there is none of the mapping files

    /etc/rear/mappings/mac
    /etc/rear/mappings/ip_addresses
    /etc/rear/mappings/routes

in the recovery system when "rear recover" is running its
`finalize`stage  
regardless that the user had a /etc/rear/mappings/ip\_addresses file  
in his recovery system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-574595709](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-574595709)

In  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
there is this code (excerpts):

    MAC_MAPPING_FILE=/etc/rear/mappings/mac
    ...
    # Temporary rear_mappings_mac used when interfaces have been renamed
    tmp_mac_mapping_file=$(mktemp)
    ...
    # A later script in finalize/* will also go over the MAC mappings file and
    # apply them to the files in the recovered system, unless we did the mapping
    # automatically, which means some device has been renamed and will probably
    # gets its name back upon reboot.
    if [ -s $tmp_mac_mapping_file ] ; then
        rm $MAC_MAPPING_FILE $tmp_mac_mapping_file
    fi

so it seems at least /etc/rear/mappings/mac can get deleted  
during recovery system startup phase under some conditions.  
But I do not understand what the comment tries to tell  
why /etc/rear/mappings/mac must be deleted.

@rmetrich  
as far as I see it seems the code that deletes /etc/rear/mappings/mac  
was added by you via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37dbb032c134f5f9777cb733d53024a3fb960cad](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37dbb032c134f5f9777cb733d53024a3fb960cad)

Could you have a look here?

Perhaps /etc/rear/mappings/mac is deleted too often here?

Perhaps the current autometed network migration in the recovery system  
conflicts with user intended network migration of the recreated system  
via user provided network migration files like /etc/rear/mappings/mac ?

This are only offhanded unverified ideas so I could be plain wrong.
