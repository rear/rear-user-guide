Hi all.

I am with the integration of REAR with NetBackup. I have all fine more
or less but I have a problem I cannot solve because my develop knowledge
is limited :)

The issue is if I do a point in time restore, the date and time I type
is configured in the script "400\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh" in the command
"bprestore" as the variable "edate", that is perfect but when you launch
the recover, NetBackup restores all the full backups of the server from
the date and time you specified and also to the past... This does
obviously the backup is not consistent. You can specify a time interval
in the "bprestore" command using the parameters "-s" (start) and the
previously mentioned "-e" (end). What I intend is to create a new
variable "sdate" for example with the date and time of the variable
"edate" -1 second. I have tested this manually in the command
"bprestore" and works fine. Curiously, you have to put these parameters
in the next order to works fine: "bprestore -e -s", if you do not follow
this order, the command fails. With the parameters "-e" and "-s", you
can restore the exactly backup you want :D

My question is, how I can create a new variable "sdate" getting the
information (date and time) of the variable "edate" and subtracting 1
second? I am checking the proper script "400\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh" and
the script "390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh" (the
script that treat when REAR ask about the date and time of the restore).
But here are inputs outputs topics and others and I am lost here...

As we commented above, my develop knowledge is limited and I am not be
able to solve this problem... Solve it it would be nice because we would
get REAR and NetBackup able to restore the exact backup :)

Thank you very much!

P.D: a good idea could be using the same date and time in the "-e" and
"-s" parameters and, if this works, we have not do nothing but I tested
and NetBackup give an error 127 that means NetBackup does not find the
backup required.

P.D.2: I can share what I do to integrate REAR and NetBackup if it can
be useful for the community :)

@cge77  
in general please provide the generic information we request in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
in particular your /etc/rear/local.conf file and ReaR debug log files  
for `rear -D mkbackup` and `rear -D recover` could help us  
to better see what exactly is going on in your particular case,  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In general regarding enhanchements for ReaR bash scripts  
we would need to get your complete and excat current code  
so that we can have a look what exactly the code changes are about  
(regardless whether or not your current code changes do actually work).

In particular regarding `BACKUP=NBU`:  
In general there is nothing at all what I could do in case of issues  
with third-party backup tools or any other third-party software  
because I do not have such software on my test systems  
so that I can neither test nor reproduce anything.  
But I can help with generic bash scripting issues.

I'd love to help our here, but I do not have this running in my env,
only in some customer environment. Sorry.

Hi all.

Thanks for the information and for the help.

I solved the issue using the parameter "-T" (True Image Restore) in the
"bprestore" command in the script "400\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh".

Many thanks!
