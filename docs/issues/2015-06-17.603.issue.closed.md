Booting in UEFI mode from an USB disk can be a life saver when UEFI ISO
booting is no option, e.g. SLES 11/12 cannot create an UEFI bootable ISO
image (yet).

-   elilo seems out of the question (as it uses `/etc/elilo.conf` to
    read what to make bootable; alternative location seems problematic)
-   grub.efi might be useable (like we do for ISOs)
-   syslinux-efi (if version &gt;6.02) ??

As `ebiso` is now available
([http://www.it3.be/2015/10/27/uefi-iso-boot-with-ebiso/](http://www.it3.be/2015/10/27/uefi-iso-boot-with-ebiso/))
there is no real need for this issue. We implement this feature as a
paid service only

Re-open this issue when we found a sponsor to implement this missing
feature

@gdha  
I wonder if issues with "looking for sponsorship"  
should be kept open until it is implemented  
because otherwise I think in parctice nobody  
can find them.

When one clicks at the right under "Labels"  
onto "looking for sponsorship" one gets a list  
filtered by

<pre>
is:open label:"looking for sponsorship" 
</pre>

which means that closed issues  
are excluded by default.

To get all issues with "looking for sponsorship"  
one has to manually change the filter to

<pre>
label:"looking for sponsorship"
</pre>

but then it is impossible to decide which ones  
are already implemented (and rightfully closed) versus  
which ones are not yet implemented (but closed nevertheless).

@jsmeix I tend to add *looking for sponsorship* issues on our web pages
([http://relax-and-recover.org/support/sponsors](http://relax-and-recover.org/support/sponsors))
and then close these as they will be kept open forever. No-one is
sponsoring anyhow.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/834](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/834)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/837](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/837)  
I regard this issue as done.

UEFI booting from USB disk/stick is implemented in two parts:

Part 1 is this issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/603](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/603)
that  
implements support for "rear format --efi" to format  
an USB disk/stik with an additional UEFI (FAT) partition.

Part 2 is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/831](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/831)
that  
implements filling the UEFI (FAT) partition on USB disk/stick  
with bootloader and creating an appropriate bootloader config.
