hi:  
I found the bug because my system has /dev/drbd1 and /dev/drbd11. but
after checking the code, I found similar bug exists in other scripts. so
if the system has "/dev/md2","/dev/md21", or "/dev/lvm-a","/dev/lvm-ab".
the same bug will bite.  
I tried to fix all the bugs for scripts under the same directory. but I
don't know if the bug exists at other directory. since I don't have all
the layout to test, so please take a look to see if the patches are
proper.
