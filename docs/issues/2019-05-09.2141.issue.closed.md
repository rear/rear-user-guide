For small systems, is it possible to save the whole system to one single
ISO image? Business case - restricted DMZ with no backup, nfs, etc.  
Thank you!

Yes,  
because it is possible to have the backup inside the ISO image  
(usually the ISO contains only the ReaR recovery system).

See what "man rear" tells about `BACKUP_URL=iso://`  
e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

It is even possible to spilt it onto more than one ISO image,  
see what usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf reads about  
`ISO_MAX_SIZE`

But I have no personal experience with using `BACKUP_URL=iso://`  
so that I don't know about the details here - I had tested it once,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545)  
but I do not use it regularly in practice.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545)  
I had used this /etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///mybackup"

but in a 'restricted DMZ with no backup, nfs, etc'  
`OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs` cannot work.

I think `OUTPUT_URL=file://` or `OUTPUT_URL=null`  
(see "man rear") could help in this case.

Alternatively you may think about using  
`OUTPUT=USB` and `BACKUP_URL=usb://`  
see "man rear" and have a look at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
and see the `OUTPUT=USB stuff` section in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Because "no news is good news" I assume it is sufficiently answered.
