fixes \#2930

I wrote something that has this effect:

    rear-sle15sp4:/src/rear # cat /etc/rear/local.conf 
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( $(findmnt -n -r -o TARGET -t btrfs | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash') )
    COPY_AS_IS=foobar
    rear-sle15sp4:/src/rear # rear help
    ERROR: Missing array assignment like +=(...) for COPY_AS_IS in /etc/rear/local.conf:
    COPY_AS_IS=foobar

    Use debug mode '-d' for some debug messages or debugscript mode '-D' for full debug messages with 'set -x' output
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-rear-sle15sp4.log.lockless for details
    Terminated

What do you think?

@rear/contributors what do you think? As usual, no comment means I will
merge tomorrow.

Now it looks like this:

    # usr/sbin/rear -C /tmp/bad help
    ERROR: Syntax error: Variable BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE not assigned as Bash array in /tmp/bad.conf:
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE="( $(findmnt -n -r -o TARGET -t btrfs | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash') )"

    Use debug mode '-d' for some debug messages or debugscript mode '-D' for full debug messages with 'set -x' output

Thanks for the feedback!

And now we catch even these cases:

-   variables that contain other variable names
-   multiple assignment on the same line

    F_BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE="( $(findmnt -n -r -o TARGET -t btrfs | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash') )"
    COPY_AS_IS=() BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=foobar

    # usr/sbin/rear -D -C /tmp/bad help
    Sourcing additional configuration file '/tmp/bad.conf'

It was merged too fast  
because `mapfile` is not availabe in older bash,  
at least not in GNU bash version 3.1.17 on SLES10  
(SLE10 is the oldest one I have and I use that  
to check what there is on rather old systems):

    # type -a mapfile
    -bash: type: mapfile: not found

    # bash --version
    GNU bash, version 3.1.17 ...

`mapfile` is a bash 4.x thing according to  
[https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/bashver4.html](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/bashver4.html)

    The new mapfile builtin ...

I suggest to add at the beginning of  
init/default/001\_verify\_config\_arrays.sh  
a simple fail safe check like

    # Skip this test when 'mapfile' (a bash 4.x builtin) is not available:
    type -a mapfile 1>/dev/null || return 0

because that script is optional.

That '1&gt;/dev/null' is only there to suppress needless

    mapfile is a shell builtin

output which would appear in the log file in debug modes  
but on the other hand it does not hurt in the log file in debug modes  
so perhaps the simpler the better without needless '1&gt;/dev/null'.

Ah, good catch. I was wondering about that and will add the check.

BTW, `sed -E` also doesn't work on ancient systems, I checked this on
CentOS 5 which has Bash 3.x (couldn't find a SLES10/SUSE10 Docker image
quickly)
