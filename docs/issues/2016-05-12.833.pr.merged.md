@Joeri-MS  
many thanks for your valuable contribution!

As I wrote in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)  
I cannot check myself if it works  
(because I do not have TSM)  
which means I could only "basically blindly" acccept it.

With "basically blindly" I mean that I can only look  
at the code whether or not it looks o.k. for me  
but I cannot verify by a test that it actually works.

Because your code looks o.k. for me  
I will "basically blindly" acccept your pull request  
provided you could report here with some details  
on which system you have tested it so that it is  
documented where it can be expected to work.

Hi, We are facing similar issue while recovering SLES 12 SP1 (Rear 1.19)
with default btrfs for systemvg. We can backup and create image fine
however during recovering it gives errors. Could you please help us in
overcoming this issue and it has became a kind of show-stopper atm. Is
there a workaround/patch/update to get it working on SLES12 SP1? I have
contacted SLES support and they said they only support REAR on SLES for
SAP version and not the normal SLES.  
I am not well-verse with github so please excuse my non-awareness
regarding posts. Your help/advice would be much appreciated.  
Thanks and regards,  
Vish
