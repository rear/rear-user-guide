'ebiso' is used to make an UEFI bootable ISO image  
of the rear recovery system mainly on openSUSE  
and SUSE Linux Enterprise systems.

The ebiso autor @gozora found a captious bug in ebiso  
versions before 0.2.2, see  
[https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/releases/tag/v0.2.2](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/releases/tag/v0.2.2)

It can cause (under certain circumstances) corruption  
of random file by overwriting one byte with zero ('\\0').  
This overwrite always happens on the end of block  
of 2048 bytes so for this reason it can remain unnoticed  
most of the time.

In general the ISO should be safe once user is able to boot from it.  
I.e. users who are careful and verify that their disaster recovery  
procedure actually works should be safe.

Nevertheless to be even more on the safe side  
users who use ebiso &lt; 0.2.2 should update it.

ebiso &gt;= 0.2.2 RPM packages are available from the  
openSUSE build service project "Archiving:Backup:Rear"  
for the 64-bit x86\_64 architecture for various openSUSE  
and SUSE Linux Enterprise versions.

For direct RPM package download go to  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/)  
and select your exact matching openSUSE  
or SUSE Linux Enterprise version and then  
the "x86\_64" sub-directory.

After ebiso RPM package update, verify again that your  
disaster recovery procedure actually works, cf.  
"No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation"  
and "Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover (rear)" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regardless that ebiso is already fixed  
I like to keep this issue open for some time  
so that others can more easily notice it.

There is another ebiso bugfix update:

ebiso version 0.2.3.1 RPM packages  
are available from the same repositories  
as mentioned above in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/815\#issue-145926677](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/815#issue-145926677)

I think I kept this issue open long enough for others to notice it  
and there was no single follow-up here  
so that I close it now.
