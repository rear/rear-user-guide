‚Ä¶ and associated update to conf/default.conf

I have added the support for ntpdate in order to satisfy issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1598\#issuecomment-347920758](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1598#issuecomment-347920758)
.

Changes in `/etc/inittab` are not necessary since they appear to do
nothing anyway. I checked the history of `430_prepare_timesync.sh` and
the entire file seems to have been added at once (as
`43_prepare_timesync.sh`) by @schlomo about 9 years ago (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/07c0385e931ffad1a79d7ea841a6d3f978f0bea9\#diff-8fcb1c324ed3bff4cc3a656e0c1298d4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/07c0385e931ffad1a79d7ea841a6d3f978f0bea9#diff-8fcb1c324ed3bff4cc3a656e0c1298d4)
).

ntpd successfully sets the time on both CentOS 6 (SysV) or CentOS 7
(systemd), but ntpd is not running as a daemon on either.

I think we can reasonably delete the following line, but I don't want to
do that at this time as I feel it deserves its own PR:

Awesome! I'm glad I could help! I'll address adding chrony support and
re-examine the inittab stuff in the next week or two, as I get
opportunity.
