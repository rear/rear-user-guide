When we do regular automated tests for a variety of use-cases,
distributions and (snapshot/stable) releases, there may no longer be a
use for the current `rear validate` functionality. But we still may want
to make it easy for users to report problems (through a more direct
channel rather than email)

We like to discuss this on the next LinuxTag meeting in order to
improve, redesign or remove the current "rear validate" functionality.
Any feedback or ideas from users are welcome.

Perhaps we better move this part to the web instead of having validation
reports part of a rear package?
