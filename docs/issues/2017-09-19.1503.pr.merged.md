[\#1503 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1503) `merged`: Improve encrypted password detection in 500\_ssh.sh
=================================================================================================================

Currently, usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh can only detect if
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD is MD5 encrypted. Any string other than those with a
'$1$' prefix will be encrypted using MD5. For instance, SHA-512
encrypted passwords are common and are identified with a '$6$' prefix...
but would not be detected as an encrypted password and rear would
re-encrypt the already encrypted string using MD5, breaking the ability
to use intended password.

Per the discussion with @schlomo and @jsmeix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1489\#issuecomment-329745987](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1489#issuecomment-329745987)
, this PR improves encrypted password detection.

CI build is failing because `bash` is not called with `-O extglob`:

> 0.69s$ make validate  
> == Validating scripts and configuration ==  
> find etc/ usr/share/rear/conf/ -name '*.conf' | xargs -n 1 bash -n  
> bash -n usr/sbin/rear  
> find . -name '*.sh' | xargs -n 1 bash -n  
> ./usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh: line 55: syntax error
> near unexpected token
> `(' ./usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh: line 55: `
> $\[0-9\]?(\[a-z\])$\*) echo "root:$SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD:::::::" &gt;
> $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/shadow ;;'  
> make: \*\*\* \[validate\] Error 123

I can replicate the failure on my dev system:

> \[root@OLC-1372-centos7 rear\]\# bash -n
> usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh ; echo $?  
> usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh: line 55: syntax error near
> unexpected token
> `(' usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh: line 55: `
> $\[0-9\]?(\[a-z\])$\*) echo "root:$SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD:::::::" &gt;
> $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/shadow ;;'  
> 2

By adding `-O extglob`, the test passes:

> \[root@OLC-1372-centos7 rear\]\# bash -O extglob -n
> usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh ; echo $?  
> 0  
> \[root@OLC-1372-centos7 rear\]\#

Is there anything I can do (or need to do) to repair this?

Good catch, please add the `extglob` and the `nullglob` options to the
test. We set them in ReaR so they should be also set for the test.

Thanks @schlomo ! `make validate` shopt\_options updated and CI build is
now passing.

@N3WWN

I dared to enhance the syntax a bit to better match  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
Please have a look whether it is still o.k. for you.

@N3WWN  
If you agree with my syntax enhancements  
I would like to merge it soon.

Thanks for the polishing @jsmeix ! üòÅ Looks good!

I've read (and reference) the Coding Style document several times, but
some of the items fall don't stick in my head. I'll try to adhere better
in the future.

@N3WWN  
many thanks for this nice enhancement!

Regarding coding syntax style guides:  
No need to take coding syntax style guides too serious.  
As long as your code is easy to understand everything  
is o.k. - this is about coding semantics and that does matter.  
All the coding syntax style guides are just nice to have.
