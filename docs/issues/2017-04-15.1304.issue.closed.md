[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)
gives a nice example how to contribute.

However the example doesn't work very well for branches that live longer
then a week. These branches tend to become 100+ commits behind master,
causing merge conflicts etcetera.

Please include some hints how to stay up to date with upstream/master
code.  
`$ git pull upstream master`?

I am not at all a git expert but I could at least document how I do
it.  
Hopefully I find some time during May or later but no promises...

See also
[http://stevenharman.net/git-pull-with-automatic-rebase](http://stevenharman.net/git-pull-with-automatic-rebase)
for more infos about why rebasing is better than merging, I have

    git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always

Also
[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)
is a nice explanation.

My favorite article is:

[https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/](https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/)

I like that most because it explains "all in one" single article.

I think such links could be added to  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
only as a courtesy for ReaR contributors.  
Of course  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
is not meant as exhaustive explanation how to use git  
or how to work with GitHub but some useful links  
for more information would be nice.
