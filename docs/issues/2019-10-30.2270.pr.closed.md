-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

\#2266

-   How was this pull request tested?

Used `rear mkrescue` to successfully create an ISO both from the command
line and via CDM's fileset pre-scripts on CentOS 7.7 and 8.0.
Successfully booted the CentOS 7.7 ISO.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Added `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` information to the CDM documentation.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to have a review by another ReaR maintainer  
in particular the `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:..."` part.

I think this is not yet the right solution but only a workaround for
now  
because I guess in CentOS 7.7 and 8.0 this is done differently  
so a review from a CentOS 7.7 and 8.0 user would be much appreciated.

Basically in the ReaR recovery system things should be done same  
as on the original CentOS 7.7 and 8.0 systems.

So if on the original CentOS 7.7 and 8.0 systems things are done via

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:...

the same should be automatically done in the ReaR recovery system  
and when on the original CentOS 7.7 and 8.0 systems things are done  
differently things should be done same in the ReaR recovery system.

In general regarding a global `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="..."`:

Setting a global LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH leads to unexpected side effects  
because libraries via LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH have precedence  
over the normal/default system libraries so that  
after `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="..."` all programs  
are run with the special libraries in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
and not with the normal/default system libraries.

In particular `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="..."` in etc/rear/local.conf  
let all programs in all ReaR scripts run with the special libraries  
in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and not with the normal system libraries  
so that the programs could behave different when run "in ReaR"  
compared to when run directly on the system.

where the latter reads in particular (excerpts):

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH – or: How to get yourself into trouble!
    ...
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH tells the dynamic link loader ...
    where to search for the dynamic shared libraries
    an application was linked against ...
    and this list is then searched
    before the compiled-in search path(s),
    and the standard locations (typically /lib, /usr/lib, ...)
    ...
    It is even getting worse, if this crutch is applied
    globally into an user’s (or the system’s!) environment
    ...
    Inconsistency:
    This is the most common problem.
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH forces an application
    to load a shared library it wasn’t linked against,
    and that is quite likely not compatible with
    the original version.
    This can either be very obvious,
    i.e. the application crashes,
    or it can lead to wrong results, if the
    picked up library not quite does what the
    original version would have done.
    Especially the latter is sometimes hard to debug.

@jsmeix, so what is a more appropriate way to resolve this issue? I
don't have much experience in how to tell ReaR where to look for
libraries if it cannot find them in the default paths.

@DamaniN  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2266\#issuecomment-554971616](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2266#issuecomment-554971616)

The real fix should be to properly  
replicate in the ReaR recovery system  
the config of the run-time linker (for /sbin/dhclient)  
from the config on the original CentOS system

@DamaniN  
I guess you closed this pull request because  
you are now trying to get this issue solved in a different way?

That pull request had an extra commit from \#2267 in it. I removed the
commit for this issue to allow it to close and merge. I haven't found a
better fix for this yet and will repost the original shortly.
