-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Have a hardcoded '-iso-level 3' option  
in output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/820\_create\_iso\_image.sh  
because it is also hardcoded  
in output/ISO/Linux-i386/820\_create\_iso\_image.sh  
and it seems to also work in general on PPC64LE architecture.

When there are no objections I would like to merge it today afternoon.
