My currently known (minor) behavioural changes:

1.)  
Since I implemeted real incremental backups  
BACKUP\_TYPE=incremantal  
does no longer mean a differential backup  
but now it means real incremental backups.  
For real differential backup the new  
BACKUP\_TYPE=differential  
must now be set.  
See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974)

2.)  
ReaR default logfile name changes, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1092](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1092)  
2a)  
The logfile that gets copied to the NETFS location  
had hardcoded name "rear.log" but now it respects  
the LOGFILE setting so that now it is by default named  
"rear-HOSTNAME.log" according to default.conf  
LOGFILE="$LOG\_DIR/rear-$HOSTNAME.log"  
2b)  
The partial logfile that gets copied to initramfs  
had hardcoded name "rear-partial-..." but now  
it respects the LOGFILE setting so that now it is  
by default named "rear-HOSTNAME-partial-..."  
using $( basename $LOGFILE ) except a trailing '.log'  
as name prefix with the default.conf setting  
LOGFILE="$LOG\_DIR/rear-$HOSTNAME.log"

3.)  
The BugError message has changed format.  
Now it is more informative because it shows the  
source file where BugError or BugIfError was called  
and it is less "shouting at the poor reader" because  
"BUG BUG BUG! ..." is replaced by "BUG ...", see

@jsmeix @gozora Can we agree that we freeze adding **new** features into
ReaR as of today? Otherwise, we will never be able to deliver v2.0 by
the end of this year of beginning next year. Remember, the milestone is
Fosdem 2017.

PS: bug fixes and what was already in process of being added can
continue, but try to get it in before Christmas or otherwise, post-pone
for v2.1.

Hello @gdha,

No problem for me.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-12-13 12:56](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073#issuecomment-266731532):

Of course no new features or bigger changes from me.  
All I like to get for ReaR 2.0 is that  
multiple (optionally simultaneous) backups and restores  
work sufficiently well.

One more (minor) behavioural change, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073\#issuecomment-264127724](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073#issuecomment-264127724)

4.)  
Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1130](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1130)
merged  
when rear ends there is now in syslog (e.g. /var/log/messages)  
either "rear $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"  
or "rear $WORKFLOW failed with exit code $EXIT\_CODE".  
Before it was only "DONE: rc=0" - there was no longer  
a syslog message for non-zero exit codes before, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e57893983cb29808866fcfee3b96056e0e851c57](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e57893983cb29808866fcfee3b96056e0e851c57)

4a)  
Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1133](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1133)
merged  
when the checklayout workflow ends with exit code 1  
there is now the special syslog message

<pre>
rear checklayout finished with exit code 1 (layout or config changed)
</pre>

A possibly major change that may cause  
real regressions for some users:

5.)  
All numbered ReaR scripts have been renumbered  
from two digit prefix numbers NM\_script\_name.sh  
to three digit prefix numbers NM0\_script\_name.sh  
by ading a trailing 0 so that 12 becomes 120  
except 00 which becomes 005.  
This renumbering will cause regressions for users who have  
their own 2-digit scripts because now only 3-digit scripts will  
work (see the SourceStage function in framework-functions.sh)  
so that 2-digit user scripts must be renamed to 3-digit names.

As far as I see from my point of view  
I think ReaR 2.0 can be released now.

I noticed inconsistent documentation about what  
distributions are supported by ReaR in  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
doc/user-guide/01-introduction.adoc  
doc/user-guide/02-getting-started.adoc  
I will do a pull request to align them...

@gdha  
I think you broke it with your latest commits  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/64535e0d3a76d8688bd47372fdd34c1b40c5849a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/64535e0d3a76d8688bd47372fdd34c1b40c5849a)  
and

Now it looks perfectly o.k. again.

@gdha  
only a side note FYI regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073\#issuecomment-270301959](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073#issuecomment-270301959)  
"starting with the release notes"  
and the matching

<pre>
git log --format="* %s : %b %n" --topo-order
</pre>

on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

Personally I use meanwhile very often something like

<pre>
git log --format="%ae %ad%n%s :%n%b%n" --graph | fmt -120 -t | less
</pre>

(where --graph implies --topo-order see "git help log")  
to get a relatively easily comprehensible history.

For example

<pre>
git log --format="* %s : %b %n" --topo-order | fmt -78 -t | less
</pre>

results (excerpt)

<pre>
* Merge pull request #1148 from dl5rcw/master : Bareos support: add missing
   directory /var/run/bareos in recovery system

* add missing directory :

* Merge pull request #1147 ...
</pre>

while

<pre>
git log --format="%ae %ad%n%s :%n%b%n" --graph | fmt -78 -t | less
</pre>

shows that excerpt as

<pre>
|
*   gratien.dhaese@gmail.com Tue Jan 3 16:08:42 2017 +0100
|\  Merge pull request #1148 from dl5rcw/master :
| | Bareos support: add missing directory /var/run/bareos in recovery system
| |
| * info@dl5rcw.de Tue Jan 3 15:07:07 2017 +0100
|/  add missing directory :
|
|
*   jsmeix@suse.com Tue Jan 3 12:46:46 2017 +0100
|\  Merge pull request #1147 from
</pre>

which makes it more clear that the meaningless  
"add missing directory" entry can be simply ignored  
for the release notes because it is clear that this one  
is the predecessor of the more meaningful  
"Bareos support: add missing directory  
/var/run/bareos in recovery system" entry.

As ReaR has been released yesterday (albeit under radar) we can close
this issue. Still need to do some announcements.
