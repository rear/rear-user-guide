Hi Team,

Is it a bug or I am doing anything wrong configuration?.

Below are few more test results:

1.  Tried with latest 2.2.X version and not able to restore
2.  Tried only with one file system encrypt (/project) and not able to
    restore

Hi @metro1234,

I doubt that this is your fault.  
Just from plain looking at your error:

    cryptsetup luksFormat -q --cipher aeAn error occured s-xts-plain64 --hash sha1 --uuid efd9xxxxxxxxxx /dev/sda5/

It looks that something went wrong during `rear mkbackup`.

It would be interesting to see following files

1.  */var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf* from your original system
2.  */var/log/rear/rear-&lt;hostname&gt;.log* created during
    `rear -d -D recover` session

Can you please provide these two files?

Thanks

V.

@metro1234,

At first glance I don't see anything wrong neither in disklayout.conf
nor in log file.  
I'd need to install similar setup to yours and try to reproduce your
problem.

Your problem is rather simple to solve.  
Prompt for password you see after launch of `rear recover` is not asking
you for password you've used prior `rear recover`, but for NEW password
that will be set on newly created partitions for encryption. (which just
give perfect sense, if you think about it ...)  
So all you have to do is enter (and later re-enter) some STRONG password
that will be accepted by password quality check of cryptsetup ...  
Once `rear recover` finishes, you will use this password to decrypt
restored partitions (a.k.a boot ;-) ).

Thanks @gozora for trying out that setup.

What about `error loading dictionary`? Can it be that `cryptsetup` wants
to check the quality of the passphrase with the help of an external
tool?

Can it be that we need to improve the user guidance in ReaR so that it
will show the user a short help text before running `cryptsetup`?

Maybe we should also actively handle the case that `cryptsetup` fails
due to bad user input, maybe show the `crypsetup` error to the user and
give him a chance to try again?

Hi @schlomo,

> Thanks @gozora for trying out that setup.

No problem, I was curious about how ReaR works with LUKS ...

I have no idea where this is coming from ... Maybe missing cracklib ? I
really can't tell unless I have more information ...

Today it was first time in my life I've was configuring LUKS. I must say
that neither configuring LUKS nor ReaR was "brain surgery or rocket
science". So I'd conclude that if user have some basic understanding how
LUKS works, he can handle such setups + basic troubleshooting.

> Maybe we should also actively handle the case that cryptsetup fails

You have this chance even now by running `rear recover` again ...

Like I already said, LUKS + ReaR works well enough for me. Only thing I
would add is recovery of keys that were used on original system.  
Currently you have to enter NEW passphrase for every LUKS partition.
Problem with such approach is that original LUKS partition could have up
to 8 passphrases/keys for unlocking (various users can do unlock). This
creates some additional work for administrator after recovery like
configure additional passphrases/keys or setup automatic unlocking.

@metro1234 if you still have trouble with restore, maybe you could share
with me your recovery ISO so I can see what is wrong.

Thinking of it, this is not such a good idea ... It would require to
store original passphrases/keys somewhere very very safely, so NO
Vladimir don't even think about it! :-)

IMHO crypto disks are, by **design**, not meant for automated disaster
recovery as long as the crypto secrets are entered by a human on the
source system. ReaR cannot automate more than is already automated in
the source system.

That means that it could be automated if the entire crypto setup is
automated on the source system, e.g. by retrieving the keys from a key
server during booting (and yes, this is probably not a typical setup).

If you all agree that ReaR doesn't require any improvement for this use
case then please close the issue.

I think the issue is sufficiently answered so that I close it.

For the future we might use my new grandiose UserInput function  
where the user can predefine user input values to get them  
automatically input (for an unattended "rear recover")  
to get the LUKS passwords from the user.

This way it is the user who can predefine his LUKS passwords  
input values as he likes it before he runs "rear recover"  
and no secret needs to be stored by ReaR.

For example the user can predefine his LUKS passwords  
input values manually in the running ReaR recovery system  
before he runs "rear recover" to achieve that the actual  
"rear recover" runs unattended.

Alternatively - if the user really likes it - he could predefine  
his LUKS passwords input values manually in /etc/rear/local.conf  
and keep his /etc/rear/local.conf sufficiently secure as he needs  
it in his particular use case.

For some reasons I have not able to recover. I have used different

@gozora ,

Just curious. How did you encrypt the file system? Did you encrypt
during installation or Did you encrypt after OS Installation. Could you
Please share steps you performed during encryption. I will try same
setup here. I have tried cent OS,RHEL 7.2 for both version It will hung
after passphrases password enter.

I've let installer to setup and encrypt */* and once installation was
done, I've manually configured encryption for */data1*, this however
does not matter.  
You need to adapt your config to make things work.

1.  There looks to be some dependency (which I did not had time to
    investigate further) between *cryptsetup* and *dmsetup*.
2.  You will need to have existing */var/tmp* in order to let ReaR do
    its post installation steps (this is currently discussed in \#1455).

So your ReaR config should look something like:

    ...
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/media' '/var/tmp/*' '/var/crash')
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" /usr/sbin/dmsetup )
    ...

After you run `rear mkbackup`, you should be able to boot and restore
from your **newly** created ISO without any further problems.

Hello @jsmeix,

In this case it requires to have */var/tmp* directory available at
restore time (addressed by your \#1457), and `dmsetup` needs to be
available (addressed by mine \#1458).

So with current ReaR 2.2, following needs to be added to \_local.conf)

    ...
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/var/tmp/*')
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" /usr/sbin/dmsetup )
    ...
