#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    RHEL 7, 8 and 9 systems were recovered and checked via `xfs_db` that
    `features_ro_copmat` and  
    `features_incompat` are left the same as on the original systems.
    Additionally, checked via `xfs_info` that new features keep original
    enablement status.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Recognize the following XFS features from the `xfs_info` output:
    `rmapbt`, `reflink`, `bigtime`, `inobtcount`, `nrext64` and
    `sparse`, and preserve their original enablement status. In newer
    version of `mkfs.xfs`, these options are enabled by default, which
    is not the desired behaviour if they were intentionally disabled.

@rear/contributors  
could you please have a look here  
(as time permits).

I am not an experienced XFS user  
so I cannot properly review it.
