##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): also helps with the problem in
    \#3128

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Full backup and recovery on a hybrid UEFI/BIOS bootloader setup,
    with UEFI firmware.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   Fixes a bug where a system with hybrid BIOS/UEFI boot was
        restored without the BIOS bootloader (`GRUB2`) and on subsequent
        `mkrescue` it will abort because it can't detect the
        bootloader - the BIOS bootloader was not found in the boot
        sector and the presence of the BIOS boot partition confused the
        EFI bootloader detection. In detail:
    -   Support BOOTLOADER=GRUB/GRUB2 with UEFI. This will happen with
        hybrid boot: BOOTLOADER=GRUB2 indicates that there is the BIOS
        version of GRUB2 installed and at the same time,
        USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1 indicates theat there is also an EFI
        bootloader. Note that it is now perfectly legal to have
        USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1 and BOOTLOADER neither EFI nor
        GRUB2-EFI nor ELILO. This will happen with hybrid BIOS/UEFI
        booting: BOOTLOADER will be detected as GRUB2, but
        USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1.
    -   Detect GRUB2 earlier - when saving layout. We used to
        distinguish between GRUB and GRUB2 when reinstalling the
        bootloader. This meant that the saved bootloader was wrong: GRUB
        for GRUB2. Detect GRUB2 earlier, already at the moment when we
        guess the bootloader, and save the correct value. This should
        help with the problem reported in PR \#3128 (misdetection of
        GRUB2 as GRUB on any non-SUSE distro).
    -   Don't look for EFI bootloader in the start of disk. EFI
        bootloader is not installed to the start of the disk, but to the
        EFI System partition as a regular file. It is this futile to
        search for EFI bootloaders in the first sectors of disks. If we
        find "EFI", it is only because there is a GPT, and "EFI PART" is
        the GPT signature (this does not tell anything about the
        presence of an EFI bootloader). See
        [https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/67ac463446a5b140ea1eb1d9268e86422f869ebf\#r138332329](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/67ac463446a5b140ea1eb1d9268e86422f869ebf#r138332329)
        .
    -   Delete the code that checked for 'Hah!IdontNeedEFI' as a special
        case - it is not needed now. The code effectively skipped the
        check for EFI when there was a B[IOS boot
        partition](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/BIOS_boot_partition).
        Its presence does not indicate the absence of an EFI bootloader,
        though. We could be on an UEFI machine with the disk partitioned
        in hybrid (BIOS/UEFI compatible) mode. In this case ReaR can
        error out if legacy GRUB is not installed, because it does not
        find any bootloader (the EFI check is skipped).

@rear/contributors I plan to merge it tomorrow unless there are
objections.
