====================================================================================================

For example in RHEL where efivarskernel module is builtin. The check of
/sys/firmware/efi/{efi,efivars} is enough IMHO.  
Example on RHEL 6.4 on an UEFI system:

modprobe efivars
================

FATAL: Module efivars not found.

efivars module create and populate /sys/firmware/efi directory. On a
BIOS system, this directory will never be created.  
After the modprobe command, rear test if this directory exists and
return if not. According to the test-efivars in Systemd, we see that the
test of the directory is enough :

Systemd test the efi boot with this function :  
bool is\_efi\_boot(void) {  
return access("/sys/firmware/efi", F\_OK) &gt;= 0;  
}

@Florent38 Alright, I understand it now. The patch looks fine.

There is one other thing I don't like from that same file, which are the
'||' and '&&' statements. For me they break the flow of the logic and I
always have a hard time interpreting the intended flow. (In the past I
wanted a coding standard to avoid certain shell statements and have a
more consistent way of writing shell).

Especially this I find confusing:

    cat /proc/cmdline | grep -q noefi || {    # 'noefi' option not found, so check for the dir itself
        if [ -d /sys/firmware/efi/vars ]; then
            SYSFS_DIR_EFI_VARS=/sys/firmware/efi/vars
        elif [ -d /sys/firmware/efi/efivars ]; then
            SYSFS_DIR_EFI_VARS=/sys/firmware/efi/efivars
        else 
            return    # when UEFI is enabled the dir is there
        fi
        }

I would expect that in case someone would configure the kernel to not do
EFI by setting `noefi` that we would not bother including UEFI support.
So I would expect this:

    if grep -qE '\bnoefi\b' /proc/cmdline; then
        return
    fi

    if [ -d /sys/firmware/efi/vars ]; then
        SYSFS_DIR_EFI_VARS=/sys/firmware/efi/vars
    elif [ -d /sys/firmware/efi/efivars ]; then
        SYSFS_DIR_EFI_VARS=/sys/firmware/efi/efivars
    else 
        return    # when UEFI is enabled the dir is there
    fi

Now it seems that if `noefi` was specified on the kernel command line,
it will not bother checking */sys/firmware/efi/vars* and continues using
UEFI. What am I missing ? :-)

I'm agree with you.

The noefi option on the kernel command line instructs the kernel not to
access the UEFI Runtime Services (don't load efivars module in fact, so
the directory in /sys/firmware/efi isn't populated).  
What do you think about the rear handling of this noefi option ?

Why don't use the -w option of grep instead of the -E "\\befi\\b" ?

Be careful - `noefi` does not mean that UEFI cannot be used. Only that
it is not visible to us. Very confusing, but is that not the purpose of
UEFI??

@gdha Agreed, but if the user decides that UEFI should not be visible,
the intention is there to not use UEFI. What else is the purpose. Or to
put it differently, if a system without UEFI has got the `noefi` keyword
set, we don't want to assume the system *does* have UEFI, because we
cannot tell. So my hunch is "if `noefi`, we don't do UEFI". No matter if
the system has the capability.

@Florent38 Because I didn't know about the `-w` option to grep ;-)
Thanks for that, something we could reuse in Relax-and-Recover, no
doubt.

@gdha Can we merge the original pull request ? And then decide what to
do with `noefi` ?
