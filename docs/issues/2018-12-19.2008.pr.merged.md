@jsmeix please just a quick look of your bug capturing sight! ;-)

@gozora  
I wonder if separated BORGBACKUP\_SHOW\_PROGRESS  
and BORGBACKUP\_SHOW\_STATS are really needed?

Wouldn't a single config vatiable BORGBACKUP\_CREATE\_OPTIONS  
be more generic any more versatile where the user could specify  
any addiotional options for the `borg create` call as he likes it?

I.e. in backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
remove all code related to `borg_additional_options`  
and have only

    borg create $verbose --one-file-system $BORGBACKUP_CREATE_OPTIONS ...

plus documentation in default.conf about BORGBACKUP\_CREATE\_OPTIONS  
that is by default empty.

This way the user could specify in his etc/rear/local.conf

    BORGBACKUP_CREATE_OPTIONS="--progress --stats"

or whatever he needs and likes in his particular case  
even up to more sophisticated stuff like

    test "$VERBOSE" && BORGBACKUP_CREATE_OPTIONS="--stats"
    test "$DEBUG" && BORGBACKUP_CREATE_OPTIONS="--progress --stats"

To stay backward compatible with the current behaviour  
the default setting in default.conf would have to be

    test "$VERBOSE" && BORGBACKUP_CREATE_OPTIONS="--progress --stats"

but I won't mind if the current behaviour is changed by this pull
request.

Hello @jsmeix,  
Thanks for your checks!

I guess it is matter of taste. I think `BORGBACKUP_CREATE_OPTIONS` can
be misleading.  
It can create illusion to specify some additional options for Borg that
are not intended or might not work correctly with ReaR. E.g. one might
use Borgs `--exclude-from` instead of ReaRs native include/exclude
system ...  
It might surprise you, but I'm not Borg user as well, I just liked the
deduplication idea in ReaR.  
On top of this, by having explicit Borg options (BORGBACKUP\_\*) in ReaR
I'm forced once in a while (when ReaR issue is open) to revisit Borg
project and check for news in current version ;-).

@gozora like many time before your guess is right!

Of course it is a matter of taste and you implement it as you prefer.  
I approved it, so feel free to merge it in its current form.

I only liked to tell you about my thoughts.

I think when the user specifies ReaR config variables, he is
responsible  
for what he specifies because current ReaR is not at all fool-proof  
because current ReaR is meant for experienced users.

Only out of curiosity:  
What would go wrong if the user wants to specify Borg's
`--exclude-from`  
directly instead of using ReaR's native include/exclude system?  
E.g. would it conflict with
`--exclude-from $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt`  
and let `borg create` fail with non-zero exit code which lets "rear
mkbackup"  
error out which would be perfectly o.k. because the user would see
that  
he cannot use Borg's `--exclude-from` directly.  
Or may it silently result a bad/broken/corrupted Borg backup?

And it is good so, because it copies famous quote about Unix: "UNIX was
not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would
also stop them from doing clever things."

As far as I know (but I might be wrong of course, because it is some
time already since I wrote this code) something like passing custom
options to Borg is currently not possible. So <s>un</s>fortunately users
might control Borg behavior only by [ReaR
predefined](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1613)
`BORGBACKUP_*` settings or by Borg native [environment
variables](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html#environment-variables)
`BORG_*`.
