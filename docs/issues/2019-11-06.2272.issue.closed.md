-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I am trying to restore a server to a new server, in order to test the
restore functionality.

Each bare metal server in the IBM Cloud gets its own static IP address.

This particular server has four nics, configured into two bonded nics,
one for private and one for public.

Upon booting the rear iso, and selecting the new hardware mac addresses
for the network cards, the network is not available, since the static IP
address is not correct. Rear configures the bond1 interface with the
original server's public static address.

For the purposes of the restore test, I don't need the private network
to work.

My question is how to modify the rear setup scripts so that I can
configure them to use the correct new static ip address?

I am trying to run the recover in debug mode, but there is no way to
access another tty via the supermicro IPMI console access java app. So
even though each function pauses before it runs, I can not edit them.

After upgrading to rear 2.5, I was able to successfully restore one bare
metal machine to another.

The static IP address and default gateway still needs to be manually
configured, it would be great if ReaR could have an option to prompt for
what the new static ip addresses should be on the new machine. E.g. even
after the restore, I had to manually edit the
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts to modify the MAC addresses and IP
addresses, since the ones from the backup image were from the old
machine. Which makes sense if you are recovering a backup image to the
same exact machine, but doesn't work if you are testing the restore
process on different hardware.

@carylewis  
thank you for your feedback how you made things working in your case.

I do not know much about the networking setup code in ReaR.  
Personally I use basically always in /etc/rear/local.conf

    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"

because I have a DHCP server running in my environment  
that provides all I need in the ReaR recovery system  
which is access to my NFS server where my backup is  
(that NFS server is in the same network as the ReaR recovery system)  
so my personal networking setup experience with ReaR is rather low.

To set up networking of the ReaR recovery system  
you can use in particular config variables like

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING
    USE_DHCLIENT
    USE_RESOLV_CONF
    NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD

that are (more or less well) described in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
and/or you can specify kernel command line options,  
see the section "RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

We even have a script  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh)  
that is intended to migrate the basic networking configuration  
but I never actually worked on it because "that code it \[sic!\] too
obsure for me"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d4ee9de5dfd2d4ebdac74b6d496f38518cf63491](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d4ee9de5dfd2d4ebdac74b6d496f38518cf63491)  
so I don't know how migrating the networking configuration actually
works.
