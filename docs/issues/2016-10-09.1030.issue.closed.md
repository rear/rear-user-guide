Borg Backup here:
[https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

This backup solution uses data deduplication which is good for people
backing up disk images or other large files. Plus it seems to be simple
and file based and not disk image based, so would be a great fit as rear
would bring bare metal restore capability to a space saving backup
solution.

Interesting software, would you consider to provide a pull request?

I added an issue to borg to keep track of this:

Really a nice tool!  
If you guys are can't find anyone to implement it, I'll gladly do my
best and integrate Borg into ReaR.

Hello all,

I have first sample of Borg implementation ready on my [Github
page](https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/rear_borg). Code is not yet
ready for pull request, as I need to solve couple of things first. Any
comments and testing are (as always) more than welcome.

Couple of notes if you decide to test:

1.  [Borg installation
    manual](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
    recommends to install Borg to */usr/local/bin*.  
    I however, had some hard times with this location. (not sure what
    was the reason, but I guess that ssh client have some hard coded
    paths, which don't cover */usr/local/bin*), so either install Borg
    to /usr/sbin; /usr/bin; /bin; /sbin or create symlink to these
    locations.
2.  Before using ReaR with Borg, setup ssh keys for user that will be
    running backup. In other words, issuing following command must work
    without any password prompts or remote host identity confirmation.  
    `ssh <borg_user>@<borg_server>`
3.  I did test ONLY for client/server scenario over ssh (backup was
    running from client to remote server over SSH). No manual mounting
    of remote filesystems or anything else was tested yet.
4.  Borg seems to be sensitive to locales setup. I did just quick and
    dirty configuration of locales on my test system (SLES11 SP3 :-)),
    So if you see error during recovery that LANG should be set to
    certain value, try to setup your locales correctly (can be a bit
    hard though). I've managed to succeed with en\_US.UTF-8 ...
5.  For now, use this code for testing purposes only!!!

And just bit of stats:  
I've managed to save 3 backup of base OS (without Xorg stuff) in
~1.5GB  
Output statistics made after 3rd backup can be found
[here](https://gist.github.com/gozora/08cf21776ca2479fe86d4d60ccd7bfa2).

I'll continue to work on this topic and keep you posted ...

V.

@gozora  
regarding "Borg seems to be sensitive to locales setup":

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:rear\_borg?diff=unified&name=rear\_borg](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:rear_borg?diff=unified&name=rear_borg)  
I noticed in your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
# Investigate propper locales setup in ReaR recovery media
COPY_AS_IS_BORG=( /usr/lib/locale/en_US.utf8 /usr/share/locale/en_US )
</pre>

Side note: Typo: Not "ReaR recovery media"  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1008](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1008)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1033](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1033))  
but either "rear rescue/recovery system" or even  
better "Relax-and-Recover rescue/recovery system".

I know about issues with locale when doing ssh  
from a remote host onto a rear recovery system.

Basically the locale that you use on the remote host wherefrom  
you do things like "ssh <root@rear.recovery.system>"  
is also used for the comands that you run afterwards (via ssh)  
on the rear recovery system.

But on the rear recovery system there is no localization support.  
The only locale that works on the rear recovery system is  
plain 'POSIX' (or 'C'), cf. /usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
# Make sure that we use only English:
export LC_CTYPE=C LC_ALL=C LANG=C
</pre>

(I don't know the reason behind why also LC\_CTYPE=C is set  
because - as far as I know and as far as I experienced - only  
"export LC\_ALL=C LANG=C" should be sufficient.)

Accordingly the solution for working from remote on a  
rear recovery system is to set the POSIX/C locale via

<pre>
export LC_ALL=POSIX LANG=POSIX
</pre>

either on the remote system before "ssh <root@rear.recovery.system>"  
or in the rear recovery system before running any other command.  
To be on the safe side I would suggest to set the POSIX/C locale  
on the remote system before "ssh <root@rear.recovery.system>"  
to ensure also the bash and all what profile/bashrc initially runs  
on the rear recovery system is run in the POSIX/C locale.

For the fun of it:  
Running commands in a non-POSIX locale on a system where  
only POSIX is supported can result arbitrarily nasty issues.  
For example very basic commands may badly abort  
with a locale-related error from glibc.  
Obviously local related issues are (nowadays?) sufficiently  
severe to just abort programs ;-)

Hello @jsmeix,

Thanks for you inputs. I'll correct that misspelling and will try to use
new agreed style for naming things.  
That locale thing with Borg would be tricky. I guess that Borg requires
use of same locales for recovery as was used for backup.  
The problem I'v encounter is described here:
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/382](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/382)  
So far I was only able to successfully restore, if my locales were set
to *en\_US.UTF-8* in my Relax-and-Recover rescue/recovery system.  
I'll do some more experiments on this topic for sure ..

In general when a software fails in POSIX/C locale  
it is usually a bug in that software (an exception  
might be things like an editor that is specifically  
intended to be only used for e.g. UTF-8 files).

In particular system tools like backup/restore software  
must not fails in POSIX/C locale.

No backup/restore software should depend  
on localization support.

In particular no backup/restore software should depend  
on localization support for UTF-8 - regardless how much  
UTF-8 is "usually used nowadays", it must not fail if it is  
run in plain traditional POSIX/C locale.

100% agree, give me some time to gather some more data on this
localization issue. Once I've learned a bit more about this topic, I'll
ask Borg guys about their point of view.

From what I read in
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/382](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/382)

<pre>
File system encoding is "ascii", extracting
non-ascii filenames will not be supported
</pre>

it seems - at least on first glance - that perhaps  
Borg deals wrongly with filenames, cf.  
"Non-ASCII characters in file names"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)  
that reads in particular:

<pre>
For the operating system a filename is a
plain sequence of bytes without any additional
information what characters are meant by
this sequence of bytes
</pre>

Accordingly I think that backup/restore software should  
not treat filenames as text in whatever encoding  
but as plain sequences of bytes.

In particular it would be plain wrong when a backup/restore software  
would store a filename as text in the encoding that matches the  
locale when the backup was run and restore it under a filename  
as text in the encoding that matches the locale when the restore  
is run.

If backup/restore software would work this way (but I never  
tested how e.g. 'tar' behaves under different locales)  
then one could get a filename /tmp/binär on the disk  
in ISO-8859-15 encoding restored under a filename in  
UTF-8 encoding which results a different file name, cf.  
"Non-ASCII characters in file names"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)

Let's ask Borg guys:
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702\#issuecomment-253185826](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702#issuecomment-253185826)

Puuhhh! (that is my native German - in English it is "Phew!")

Good old traditional 'tar' works for any filenames:

According to what I described in  
"Non-ASCII characters in file names"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)  
I created /tmp/tartest with two  
subdirs /tmp/tartest/iso885915 and /tmp/tartest/utf8

In /tmp/tartest/iso885915 I did in the en\_GB.iso885915 locale  
echo binär &gt;binär

In /tmp/tartest/utf8 I did in the en\_GB.utf8 locale  
echo binär &gt;binär

I got this:

<pre>
$ ls /tmp/tartest/utf8 | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 303 244   r  \n
0000007
$ cat /tmp/tartest/utf8/* | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 303 244   r  \n
0000007
$ ls /tmp/tartest/iso885915 | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 344   r  \n
0000006
$ cat /tmp/tartest/iso885915/* | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 344   r  \n
0000006
</pre>

Now I created a tar archive under POSIX/C locale:

<pre>
$ pushd /tmp/tartest
$ tar -cf testy.tar *
$ popd
</pre>

Let's see what filenames tar has stored:

<pre>
$ tar -tf /tmp/tartest/testy.tar 
iso885915/
iso885915/bin\344r
utf8/
utf8/bin\303\244r
</pre>

Now I restore it under POSIX/C locale:

<pre>
$ mkdir /tmp/restore
$ pushd /tmp/restore
$ tar -xf /tmp/tartest/testy.tar
$popd
</pre>

Let's see what tar has restored:

<pre>
$ ls /tmp/restore/utf8 | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 303 244   r  \n
0000007
$ cat /tmp/restore/utf8/* | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 303 244   r  \n
0000007
$ ls /tmp/restore/iso885915 | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 344   r  \n
0000006
$ cat /tmp/restore/iso885915/* | od -c
0000000   b   i   n 344   r  \n
0000006
</pre>

Summary:

Good old traditional 'tar' works for any filenames  
and for any file content.

@gozora  
could you test that the above also works with Borg?  
I.e. that after restore you got the two files again  
with same bytes in their file names as it was before, i.e.  
one file with this (hexadecimal) bytes for its name

<pre>
62 69 6e c3 a4 72
</pre>

( 'binär' in utf8 encoding)  
and one file with that (hexadecimal) bytes for its name

<pre>
62 69 6e e4 72
</pre>

( 'binär' in iso885915 encoding)

If I've understood your test intentions correctly, Borg handles
different encodings fine.

@gozora  
yes, it seems Borg backup and restore work correctly.

You have  
one file named 'binär' in utf8 encoding  
with content 'binär' in utf8 encoding  
(62 69 6e c3 a4 72 in hex values) and  
another file named 'binär' in iso885915 encoding  
with content 'binär' in iso885915 encoding  
(62 69 6e e4 72 in hex values)  
and after backup and restore you get exactly  
the same (no byte has changed - neither  
in the file names nor in the contents).

In particular it seems (hopefully) Borg does not try to  
"handle encodings" for file names (or even file contents)  
for its actual backup and restore operations.

For the actual backup and restore operations any  
backup and restore software must backup file names  
(and file contents) as plain sequences of bytes and  
restore them as exactly the same plain sequences of bytes.

It would be a different task if a software provides  
some kind of "migration" feature where file names  
(and perhaps also file contents) could be re-encoded  
provided the user explicitly wants that.  
But then the user must specify both the source encoding  
and the target encoding to get predictable results because  
in general it is not possible to autodetect which encoding  
is meant for the bytes in a file name or the content bytes  
in a so called "plain text" file, cf.

@jsmeix so far I did several backup/restores with Borg as backend and
did not observed any anomalies so far. I was browsing Borg issues today,
and it looks that Borg guys are really taking close attention to data
integrity and testing, so I think that Borg will not be a weak point
here.

For that locale issue, I don't have anything new in
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702),
so I've decided to go for plan B and made some improvements in
[code](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/c7dc42da35cd1f106829fcc882369265efc3c722).  
A quick summary of commit:

1.  Create rear own locales on running system with `localedef` during
    prep phase, and add them to Relax-and-Recover rescue/recovery
    system.
2.  Set *LC\_ALL=rear.UTF-8* but only for duration of `borg restore`.

I think that this should have no impact on remaining ReaR flows ...

@gozora  
as far as I understand  
[https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/c7dc42da35cd1f106829fcc882369265efc3c722](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/c7dc42da35cd1f106829fcc882369265efc3c722)  
I like your 'plan B' very much because  
it is in perfect compliance  
with "Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
and  
it is a nice initial step how we might add UTF-8 locale  
support in general to the rear recovery system:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1035](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1035)

@gozora  
as always I appreciate your continuous valuable  
contributions to Relax-and-Recover very much!

@jsmeix  
As always, you are welcome, it is fun working on ReaR.

At the time I was reading
[Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style), I've
skipped "Dirty hacks welcome" section thinking that I'd never attempt to
do something like that, and here we are :-). Life is strange
sometimes...

I'm planning to do some tests with other distributions over weekend and
if all goes fine, create "official" pull request starting of next week.
Hopefully there will be more volunteers for testing once the code is in
main tree.

When you do your "official pull request" please mention  
on what systems it has worked for you (and if you know

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037)  
merged, there is now initial support for BorgBackup  
in Relax-and-Recover.

@gozora  
many thanks for your (always) valuable contributions  
to Relax-and-Recover!

@phirestalker  
please provide feedback here how it works for you.  
You can still add comments regardless that  
this issue is closed.

If there are issues with current support for BorgBackup  
in Relax-and-Recover please submit new separated  
GitHub issues for each separated issue.

been preoccupied with other stuff. I noticed there were 2 more commits
related to borg. I wanted to know if there is somewhere I can find how
to configure rear for borg and also if I have to do the initial setup of
a repository in borg first.

You can read some basics
[here](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-iso-with-borg).  
No, if all goes fine you don't need to do repository initialization.

ok I read the make backup script for borg. It looks like I can fix it
with a few checks for blank user and host variables. According to the
borg documentation if you just use a path with no user and host it will
use the local system.

@phirestalker  
you wrote that you have "borg and rear on the same machine".  
Does this mean the Borg backup is stored on that machine?  
If yes, I wonder how the backup could be restored after a  
disaster happened on that machine?  
I am not a Borg user but as far as I understand  
[https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)  
"using SSH ... is fastest and easiest" to get the Borg backup  
safe on another host.

@phirestalker,  
Implementation for Borg was written for one simple scenario: Client -
Server over ssh.  
As you've already mentioned, it should not be a big problem to adapt the
code not to use ssh.

I'd be however interested in your setup. Currently I can imagine 2 kind
of configurations:

1.  You have Borg repository on your internal disk, which is not a good
    idea
2.  You have Borg repository mounted using some external filesystem
    (NFS, Samba, CIFS ..), in such case you will also need to adapt
    REQUIRED\_PROGS with binaries that will actually mount your external
    filesystem in ReaR rescue/recovery system.

I have a SMB share mounted for the backup. Could you point me to where
to  
modify REQUIRED\_PROGS?

@gozora I decided to write here, because this error is relevant to borg

Using COPY\_AS\_IS\_BORG as a workaround:

    COPY_AS_IS_BORG=( '/usr/lib64/python3.4*' '/usr/bin/python3*' '/usr/bin/pyvenv*' '/usr/lib/python3.4*' '/usr/lib64/libpython3*' )

List of files consolidated from `rpm -qa | egrep 'borg|python34'`

for me, and `rear recover` command suceed.

Yesterday I've find out why I did not encounter this problem when
writing support for Borg.  
The thing is, that I've used [Borg binaries generated with
pyinstaller](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases) which seems to
contain all the libs needed for Borg run.
