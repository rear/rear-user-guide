@jhoekx I guess you're best placed to decide on this pull request!

I don't like this as implemented as I said on the mailinglist when the
topic was discussed.

I see the case where you want to restore to a different system, but with
identically sized disks as the most common scenario for Rear. I don't
like dropping into migration mode for that.

If there's a flag (off by default) to require this strict behaviour,
then I wouldn't mind having the code...

Guess it is clear from above discussions (and in the mailinglist) that
we will not accept the pull request without serious adaptions. As this
will not happen it is better to close this pull request until someone
has a better idea or reason why we need it.
