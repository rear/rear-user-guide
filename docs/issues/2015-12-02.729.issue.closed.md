In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/728](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/728)
I did

<pre>
has_binary wipefs && REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" wipefs )
</pre>

based on what I found in 26\_crypt\_layout.sh

<pre>
if ! has_binary cryptsetup; then
    return
fi
...
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" cryptsetup )
</pre>

In \_input-output-functions.sh there is

<pre>
# Check if any of the binaries/aliases exist
has_binary() {
        for bin in $@; do
                if type $bin >&8 2>&1; then
                        return 0
                fi
        done
        return 1
}

get_path() {
        type -p $1 2>&8
}
</pre>

Because plain "type" without any option is used  
the has\_binary function also results true e.g. for aliases  
(as mentioned in its comment) and in general for  
anything that can be called from a bash prompt  
(also functions).

Accordingly I assume the has\_binary function is not the right one  
to find out if its argument is an executable file that can be added  
to the REQUIRED\_PROGS array.

It seems get\_path is better but even that has strange effects  
because "type -p" may output nothing with zero exit code  
in some cases:

<pre>
# type -a test
test is a shell builtin
test is /usr/bin/test
test is /usr/bin/X11/test

# type -p test && echo y
y

# type -P test && echo y
/usr/bin/test
y
</pre>

I think the only fail-safe way to test if something is an executable
file that can be added to the REQUIRED\_PROGS array is "test -P".

@gdha @schlomo  
could you tell more about the intended usage of the has\_binary and
get\_path functions?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) commented at [2015-12-02 16:45](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729#issuecomment-161360329):

has\_binary helps you to know if there is a program that you can call.
You don't care if it is a shell alias or a file on disk or a shell
function, you just want to know if you can call it.

get\_path returns you the file path of a program on disk if it is in
$PATH

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2015-12-03 13:52](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729#issuecomment-161645588):

Simply put:

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" kill )
</pre>

does not work (no "bin/kill" in recovery system)  
while

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" /usr/bin/kill )
</pre>

works.

Details:

My point is that get\_path (i.e. "type -p") returns the file path of its
argument on disk if it is in $PATH but only when its argument is of type
"file".

In contrast to "type -P" that returns the file path of its argument on
disk if such a file exists in $PATH.

Accordingly I wonder if "type -p" or "type -P" should be used for the
elements in the REQUIRED\_PROGS array.

Currently get\_path (i.e. "type -p") is used in
39\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

<pre>
# calculate binaries from needed progs
declare -a BINARIES=( $(
for bin in "${PROGS[@]}" "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"; do
        file="$(get_path "$bin")"
        if [[ -x "$file" ]]; then
                echo $file
                echo "Found $file" >&8
        fi
done | sort -u) )
</pre>

For normal cases when for an element in REQUIRED\_PROGS only an
executable file exists, that file gets copied into the recovery system.

But for an exceptional case when for an element in REQUIRED\_PROGS both
a function or builtin and an executable file exists, then nothing gets
copied into the recovery system.

I wonder if that behaviour is right or wrong.

In general when for an element in REQUIRED\_PROGS both a function or
builtin and an executable file exists one could assume that then those
function or builtin is (somehow) automatically available in the recovery
system.

This is in particular true for the usual functions in rear (but those
functions are normally not specified in REQUIRED\_PROGS).

But should we rely on it?

E.g. when a builtin exists but that does not provide features of an
executable file so that the executable file is explicitly required.

I think the actual root issue here is that when for an element in
REQUIRED\_PROGS not only an executable file exists but something else
too (e.g. a function or a builtin).

I think the actual problem is what to do if an element in
REQUIRED\_PROGS does not identify a unique executable.

I think it is impossible to automatically do the right thing in such
cases.

Therefore I would like to implement a warning message that is shown if
an element in REQUIRED\_PROGS does not identify a unique executable.

I would like to show a warning message if "type -a" does not result one
single line for an element in REQUIRED\_PROGS like:

<pre>
'kill' specified in REQUIRED_PROGS is ambiguous:
kill is a shell builtin
kill is /usr/bin/kill
kill is /bin/kill
Specify it with full path when you need the executable file.
</pre>

But on the other hand I know your ( @schlomo ) opinion about warning
messages and I agree with you in general.

But currently I have no better idea here.

I think silently ignoring ambiguities (as it is now) and let the user
find out later the hard way when it does not work is worse than a
warning message in this particular case.

IMHO `kill` is not really a valid example. As ReaR actually requires
Bash &gt;= 3 to work we always "ship" the Bash internal commands.

If a user would have a personal shell function `mykill` and include that
in `REQUIRED_PROGS` then indeed it would not work.

Maybe we can fix that problem when it comes up? Or do you have a
specific problem that needs fixing.

Using `type -P` might indeed be a good idea. Since which Bash version is
that supported?

I have no specific problem that needs fixing  
so that there is not any kind of pressure here.  
Accordingly I did not set the label "bug" for this issue  
but only "enhancement" (and "documentation" if needed).

I think "kill" is a valid example at least on my SLE12 system because:

<pre>
# help kill
kill: kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] pid | jobspec ... or kill -l [sigspec]
...
    Options:
      -s sig
...
      -n sig
...
      -l
</pre>

versus

<pre>
# man kill
...
SYNOPSIS
       kill [-signal|-s signal|-p] [-q value] [-a] [--] pid|name...
       kill -l [number] | -L
...
OPTIONS
       -s, --signal signal
...
       -l, --list [number]
...
       -L, --table
...
       -a, --all
...
       -p, --pid
...
       -q, --queue value
</pre>

I.e. the kill builtin and /usr/bin/kill support different options.

Meanwhile I also think "type -P" is the right thing.

Reasoning:

When the user specified

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" kill )
</pre>

it is reasonable to assume that his explicit "kill" therein does not
mean  
the builtin but the executable file:

<pre>
# type -P kill
/usr/bin/kill
</pre>

Even if his explicit "kill" therein did mean the builtin, having
/usr/bin/kill additionally in the recovery system cannot do any harm
because a simple "kill" calls the builtin while /usr/bin/kill would have
to be explicitly called with its path.

In the end I think at least in 39\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh it is
possible to do automatically "the right thing" via

<pre>
# calculate binaries from needed progs
declare -a BINARIES=( $(
for bin in "${PROGS[@]}" "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"; do
        file="$(type -P "$bin")"
        if [[ -x "$file" ]]; then
                echo $file
                echo "Found $file" >&8
        fi
done | sort -u) )
</pre>

Currently I do not know if there could be regressions at unexpected
places if we change get\_path in \_input-output-functions.sh to

<pre>
get_path() {
        type -P $1 2>&8
}
</pre>

According to your ( @schlomo ) above description in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729\#issuecomment-161360329](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/729#issuecomment-161360329)

<pre>
get_path returns you the file path of a program on disk if it is in $PATH
</pre>

it matches exactly "type -P" (but not "type -p" in any case):

<pre>
# help type
type: type [-afptP] name [name ...]
...
    If the -p flag is used, `type' either returns the name of the disk
    file that would be executed, or nothing if `type -t NAME' would not
    return `file'.
...
    The -P flag forces a PATH search for each NAME, even if it is an alias,
    builtin, or function, and returns the name of the disk file that would
    be executed.
</pre>

This is the "help type" output of bash 3.1.17 in SLE10.

In the bash-2.05b sources (we have that in SLE9) I found
builtins/type.def that contains:

<pre>
... type [-afptP] name [name ...]
...
If the -p flag is used, `type' either returns the name of the disk
file that would be executed, or nothing if `type -t NAME' would not
return `file'.
...
The -P flag forces a PATH search for each NAME, even if it is an alias,
builtin, or function, and returns the name of the disk file that would
be executed.

@jsmeix did we already define the oldest OS version we support? That
would give you where to check.

BTW, I just realized another probable reason for having `get_path` and
`has_binary`:

-   `get_path` should be used to copy programs to the rescue system.
    Here we need the actual path of the file in order to copy it.
-   `has_binary` should be used to decide if a a feature is available,
    e.g. `wipefs`. For that we don't care if the program is an alias, a
    function or an actual file on disk. We just want to know if we can
    call that program and don't care about the implementation. Very
    useful to allow users to supply a missing program with a Bash
    function in ReaR that will do the same job.

I fully understand your arguments. And I am not against using "type -P"
if it works also on the oldest supported OS (Thanks for checking
SLE9!!). Feel free to make a pull request, as usual.

Let's close this issue till it becomes an actual problem (it helps us
all if "open" issues are issues where we still need to do something).

Feel free to reopen it if we should do something.

I made my pull request simultaneosly with your comment.

If you like, accept the pull request.

I think using "type -P" instead of "type -p" for get\_path()  
is a real improvement towards more fail-safe operation.

Even if it is only needed in exceptional cases - but usually  
the special use cases are the ones that cause trouble.

I think I remember official support for some old distributions was
dropped. I think @gdha has mentioned it in the documentation...
