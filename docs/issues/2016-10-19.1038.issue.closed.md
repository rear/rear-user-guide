    GRUB|GRUB2) CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ${CHECK_CONFIG_FILES[@]}  /etc/grub.cfg /etc/grub2.cfg /boot/grub2/grub2.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg )

Because the variable "myBOOTloader" in SLES 12 is "GRUB2":

    $ cat /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader 
    GRUB2

After this change it works as expected.

@gsbit I'm just curious, because I have a feeling I've hit something
similar and forget to report it ...  
Can you please post here content of your /etc/sysconfig/bootloaer ?

@jsmeix In my case I had "EFI-GRUB or EFI-GRUB2" (or similar), which
resulted to message like this.  
I don't have currently access to this machine, I'll check it later
today.

This is very unexpected because I had run rear  
many times on SLE12 systems.

@gsbit  
I need a debug log to understand what happens on your system.  
Please run "rear -d -D mkrescue" and provide the log file.

In particular I am interested what happens on your system while  
/usr/share/rear/prep/default/50\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
runs i.e. what happens on your system that results  
that myBOOTloader="GRUB2".

I can reproduce it.  
Some of the latest commits before 1.19 caused it.

It works for me with a bit older git clone with latest  
commit 6c31e79dc6a21b891ee644f3ffacd22761b698f9  
"Merge pull request \#1009 from  
jsmeix/correct\_misspelled\_forms\_to\_Relax-and-Recover\_issue1008"

If fails on the same machine with a git clone of current master.

That machine is SLES12-SP2 with

<pre>
# egrep -v '^#|^$' /etc/sysconfig/bootloader 
LOADER_TYPE="grub2"
SECURE_BOOT="no"
TRUSTED_BOOT="no"
</pre>

In both cases I get

<pre>
# cat var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader 
GRUB2
</pre>

which indicates the fix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1039](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1039)  
is actually needed but somehow that did not matter before  
the last few commits.

Investigating...

Where it had worked I get in the "rear -d -D mkrescue" log

In contrast where it does not work I get in the log:

++ BugError 'Unknown bootloader (GRUB2) - ask for sponsoring to get this fixed'
</pre>

Inspecting
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/45\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh  
where it works shows only

<pre>
case $myBOOTloader in
    EFI)  CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ${CHECK_CONFIG_FILES[@]} /boot/efi/EFI/*/grub*.cfg )
        ;;
    GRUB) CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ${CHECK_CONFIG_FILES[@]}  /etc/grub.cfg /etc/grub2.cfg /boot/grub2/grub2.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg )
        ;;
    LILO) CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ${CHECK_CONFIG_FILES[@]} /etc/lilo.conf )
        ;;
    ELILO) CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ${CHECK_CONFIG_FILES[@]} /etc/elilo.conf )
        ;;
esac
</pre>

i.e. there is not yet a BugError default case.

The BugError default case was added by @gdha in his  
commit d15591e65461dfa43df6b7dbf23015d8e5598648  
with that non-matching commit message:

<pre>
    All license references are now pointing to the COPYING file (which is the gpl license v3.0).
    REAR should only reference to GPL v3.0 from now on - if otherwise seen, just report it back
    Related to issue #825
</pre>

It seems that additional change (added BugError default case  
in 45\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh) slipped somehow in  
by accident?

Ha!  
That added BugError default case in 45\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh  
already caused a regression on POWER based systems, see

@jsmeix sorry - I shouldn't have changed the
`45_check_bootloader_files.sh` while doing the LICENSE/COPYING batch
change, but I couldn't help it as it was stronger then me. A catch all
was too generic IMHO so a `BugError` was required to be sure we support
the bootloader found.

Hello @jsmeix  
As I've mentioned earlier today, my SLES12 SP1 with UEFI boot, ends up
with similar error:

    ERROR: BUG BUG BUG!  Unknown bootloader (GRUB2-EFI) - ask for sponsoring to get this fixed 

This comes from:

    suse12:~ # grep LOADER_TYPE /etc/sysconfig/bootloader
    LOADER_TYPE="grub2-efi"

Once I remove */etc/sysconfig/bootloader*,
*/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader* contains **EFI** as a bootloader,
which is recognized by ReaR so all works fine.

@gozora  
could you do a pull request that adds support for 'GRUB2-EFI'.  
I guess it is as easy as
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1039](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1039)  
but you can just test it so that I would prefer when you do it.  
Many thanks in advance!

@gozora you were saying that */var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader*
contains **EFI** as bootloader, right?  
I think we better keep the `LOADER_TYPE="grub2-efi"` as bootloader
identification, and adapt script `45_check_bootloader_files.sh` to
recognize it as a valid bootloader.

@gdha  
no worries!

SUSE's official RPM package for SLE12-SP2 customers  
is "rear118a" which does not contain those latest commits.  
Regarding "rear118a" for SLE12-SP2 see  
"rear / rear116 / rear1172a / rear118a" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

And SLE12 users that are no SUSE customers  
can get voluntary help here.

/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader contains EFI **only** if I remove
/etc/sysconfig/bootloader prior starting rear mkrescue. This is however
very dirty workaround!  
If I used default SLES11 SP1 configuration
/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader contains GRUB2-EFI, which is not
recognized by ReaR.  
I guess there is some code that first checks for existence of
sysconfig/bootloader and if not found, it tries to guess bootloader by
him self.

hmm, According comments in my */etc/sysconfig/bootloader*, `LOADER_TYPE`
can be one of following:

-   grub
-   grub2
-   grub2-efi
-   none

Guess which option did I try as next :-). Correct, **none**.

And I have even more interesting result in

@gdha  
because of @gozora findings I wonder if the current  
BugError default case in 45\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh  
is really useful.

Perhaps the default case in 45\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh  
should better be used as fallback to use GRUB2 and  
output a message to the user that GRUB2 is used  
as fallback bootloader?

The underlying basic question is if rear could use  
reasonable fallbacks when things are not clear  
or  
if rear should better always error out when things are  
not clear to always work strictly on the safe side?
