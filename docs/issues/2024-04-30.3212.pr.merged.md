-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In default.conf explain how one could reduce  
the size of the ReaR recovery system initrd  
in particular on POWER architecture  
via COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM and alternatively  
via COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_TSM and additionally  
via MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' ),

Thanks for the info about IBM Spectrum Protect, I didn't know that.

If there is a general size limit for the initrd on POWER systems then I
would expect a check for that, aborting if the initrd is too large
(since we know that it won't boot).

We might also add code to automatically enable some space reducing
features, like loading less modules and no extra firmware files.

Finally, if we could update the TSM configuration in ReaR to reflect
modern TSM agents, that would be of course really great. Maybe
@schabrolles can add some knowledge to this?

Otherwise of course the change in comments is fine, although personally
I find it a little bit misplaced under the TSM section. Maybe better add
a file to the `docs` directory explaining about ReaR on POWER?

I cannot properly implement a check that errors out  
because I am not at all a sufficient POWER expert.

There are several different kind of POWER systems  
and several different ways how to boot them.  
I assume that vague 128 - 4 = 124 MiB limit  
does not apply to all POWER boot methods  
so we cannot eror out in any case on POWER  
when ReaR's initrd is e.g. bigger than 123 MiB.

Regarding why the initrd size limit is vague:  
A colleague told me:

    The absolute limit you can push (in our case)
    is 128 MB = 131072 KB (in binary).
    But in fact IBM always adds some prep boot
    (service data, their own "magic") data to that block.
    And we were able to fill only 123 MB = 125952 KB.
    And that is bad from IBM side as they are one
    of the developers of the IEC standard
    (because of the punch cards), but you will
    never find it black on white on their site.

I.e. it is unknown how big that additional data is  
so it is unknown how much less than 128 MiB is left  
for the initrd.  
Therein note the "in our case":  
This means the case where things were tested at SUSE.  
By trial and error (via artificially increasing the  
initrd) colleagues as SUSE found that 123 MiB limit  
on the POWER system where they tested things.  
That POWER system reported errors during boot  
when the initrd was too big in contrast to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189)  
where  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/14837101/boot.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/14837101/boot.log)  
shows nothing - just a kernel panic at the end that  
tells noting about its root cause.

What I may implement is a LogPrint() or LogPrintError()  
user information when the inird is bigger than 120 MiB  
that tells about the vague 128 - 4 = 124 MiB limit  
so the user is at least informed that booting may fail  
(depending on his specific case).

Same basic reasoning (i.e. "it depends")  
for including a reduced/minimal TSM client:  
When the initrd size does not matter in some cases  
then the full TSM client should normally be included  
to have all TSM client functionality available  
during ReaR recovery system runtime.

On POWER by default no firmware files are included, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189\#issuecomment-2076960341](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2076960341)  
which I now also mention here via my recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3212/commits/10436d8f0102709291c2c94b1f73bd90d9b6b2cc](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3212/commits/10436d8f0102709291c2c94b1f73bd90d9b6b2cc)

Whether or not MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' ) works  
depends on whether or not the replacement hardware or VM  
is fully compatible with the original system.  
I don't know if on POWER the replacement VM  
is always fully compatible with the original VM?  
As far as I know on POWER there is always a VM  
but there are different kind of VMs on POWER.

I also find it somewhat misplaced under the TSM section  
but that is all what I can do for now with my rather limited  
available time - in particular I will first and foremost  
continue with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189)  
to help our customer - "customers first" ;-)  
Now there are multipath issues - again an area where  
I have zero personal experience with - so I need to  
somehow find my way through that stuff - hopefully as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189\#issuecomment-2051683257](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189#issuecomment-2051683257)  
where my vague intuitiveness revealed the root cause...

I will merge it now.  
I ignore the two current CI errors

    testing-farm:fedora-40-x86_64 — Error
    testing-farm:fedora-rawhide-x86_64 — Error

that both show at  
[https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/59b815ee-d4a4-46b4-a0db-fe3070972188/](https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/59b815ee-d4a4-46b4-a0db-fe3070972188/)  
and  
[https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/1c4a3dd1-8744-4ffb-b8f4-3ee0db996581/](https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/1c4a3dd1-8744-4ffb-b8f4-3ee0db996581/)  
(excerpts)

    fail: Failed to pull workdir from the guest.
     This usually means that login as 'root' to the guest does not work.
    fail: Command 'yum install -y rsync' returned 255.
    ...
    ssh: connect to host [IP address] port 22: Connection timed out

because the changes here are only comments in default.conf  
so the changes here cannot be a cause of those CI failures.
