Some minor improvements of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1471](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1471)  
but still kept the behaviour of how it worked before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1471](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1471)  
i.e. CLONE\_ALL\_USERS\_GROUPS  
replaces the CLONE\_USERS and CLONE\_GROUPS

If the behaviour of how it works should be changed  
a separated issue or pull request is needed.  
Personally I do not intend to change the behaviour  
because it seems to work o.k. as is (no user complaints).

I further enhanced and improved 900\_clone\_users\_and\_groups.sh  
so that it can now also copy all via 'getent' available users and
groups  
and described that in default.conf  
but it is currently not yet tested.

@N3WWN  
I would very much appreciate it if you coud test if my current  
rescue/default/900\_clone\_users\_and\_groups.sh  
works for you or at least have a look at the code  
if you see errors therein by plain looking at the code.

There is really no reason to not always extend the CLONE\_USERS  
and CLONE\_GROUPS arrays because if that is not wanted  
the user can simply specify empty CLONE\_USERS and/or  
CLONE\_GROUPS arrays.

@schlomo  
note that even if "getent passwd" or "getent group"  
does not list all users or groups (e.g. in larger organizations),  
at least for a specific user or group "getent passwd $user"  
and "getent group $group" must work because  
otherwise that $user and/or $group is skipped  
and must be skipped because then there is no  
passwd entry or no group entry that could be copied.

@jsmeix thanks a lot, this is exactly what I meant. And yes, of course
`getent` for individual items always works.

@schlomo  
by the way do you perhaps know if in default.conf

<pre>
CLONE_GROUPS=( group ... )
</pre>

is a typo or does a group named 'group' really exist  
on some systems or whatever the reason is  
for that default cloned group named 'group'?  
Nothing goes wrong because of that - it lonly looks strange.

@jsmeix I think that this is a mistake. The array should be initialized
to empty.

According to what

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
</pre>

shows there are reasons why CLONE\_GROUPS is not empty  
by default so that I will not change the default to avoid  
unexpected regressions (again: non-existent groups  
do not matter because they are simply skipped).

That 'git log' shows that the group named 'group' was added  
via the huge "Integrated P2V patch from Heinlein Support"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commits/844d50b75ac4b7722f4fee7a5ee3350b93f3adb7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commits/844d50b75ac4b7722f4fee7a5ee3350b93f3adb7)  
via

<pre>
-CLONE_GROUPS=()
+CLONE_GROUPS=(group disk cdrom floppy tape audio video lp tty dialout kmem uucp )
</pre>

but I cannot find the actual reason for it.

Because it works for me I "just merge" it now.  
Of course if there are bugs I will fix them  
as far as I can reproduce them or when the fix is obvious.

Testing it now... with both YUM and YUM+backup

Only FYI  
a possible future further enhancement:

Because CLONE\_USERS and CLONE\_GROUPS are arrays  
I assume it is easy to further enhance it so that  
also complete /etc/passwd and /etc/group entries  
could be specified if needed by the user  
e.g. to even create new users and groups  
in the ReaR recovery system e.g. like:

<pre>
CLONE_USERS=( ... 'jnd:x:123:56:John Doe:/home/jnd:/bin/bash' 'jed:x:124:56:Jane Doe:/home/jed:/bin/bash' ...  )
CLONE_GROUPS=( ... 'does:x:56:jnd,jed' ... )
</pre>

plus a test in 900\_clone\_users\_and\_groups.sh  
if an array element is of the form '^\[\[:alnum:\]\_\]\*:'  
to detect this case.

@jsmeix

I've been testing the new
rescue/default/900\_clone\_users\_and\_groups.sh, and it doesn't copy
over the passwords for the users. I'm not sure that's an issue since
this user/group cloning isn't meant to fully populate the accounts on
the rescue or target systems.

The old version didn't either... only my update to it did... so this may
be expected behavior at this time.

Otherwise, it seems to work just fine.

I'll restore full account cloning from source through to the target
system via RECREATE\_USERS\_GROUPS /
395\_recreate\_users\_and\_groups.sh as discussed in \#1464

Regarding "copy passwords":  
In general the ReaR recovery system is intended  
to not contain possibly private or confidential data  
so that in general no files like /etc/shadow will be copied  
from the original system into the recovery system.  
I.e. it is the intended behaviour to not have /etc/shadow  
in the recovery system.  
For ReaR only the backup needs to be protected  
against unwanted access but the recovery system ISO image  
should be more or less considered to be "world readable".  
For other examples cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267\#issuecomment-291836695](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267#issuecomment-291836695)

@N3WWN  
I forgot to tell about the reason behind *why* the recovery system  
ISO image should not contain private or confidential data  
(at least not unless the user explicitly configured something):  
As far as I remember the reason behind is that one can burn  
the recovery system ISO image onto a CD or DVD and then  
one can take that recovery system medium anywhere without  
the need to protect it (e.g. against it gets lost).  
E.g. the admin could misuse a ReaR recovery system CD  
after work as beer coaster in the next pub and he could  
even forget it there after his Nth beer but still sleep well ;-)

Only as a proposal this could mean that e.g. a plain  
RECREATE\_USERS\_GROUPS="yes"  
should probably not also copy /etc/shadow by default into the  
ReaR recovery system while e.g. something explicit like  
RECREATE\_USERS\_GROUPS=( "yes" "passwords" )  
could do that (provided what that means is explicitly  
described in default.conf).

In particular when one has both the ReaR recovery system  
plus the backup in the ISO, then it is clear that such an ISO  
usually needs to be protected against unwanted access.  
Accordingly in this case having /etc/shadow also in the ReaR  
recovery system won't make things less secure because  
usually /etc/shadow is in the backup anyway.  
Except one uses backup encryption (see the  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_\* BORGBACKUP\_ENC\_TYPE  
and other variables in default.conf about encryption),  
then /etc/shadow also in the ReaR recovery system  
does make things less secure.

@jsmeix thanks for reminding us about the core beliefs of ReaR, this is
important to keep in mind.

Before this thread runs off, what would be the purpose of cloning
`/etc/shadow` into the **rescue** system? That would IMHO only be
required if all those users should be able to log in via **password**
which I find very strange.

I'd therefore suggest that we abandon the thoughts of including the
`/etc/shadow` in the rescue system.

If the goal is to recover the user accounts in the target system then we
should use the backup system (whatever that is) to transport that
information.

The core and basic design principle for ReaR looks like this:

-   The rescue system contains **metadata** but not data. That means
    that it contains everything required to recreate the target system
    but nothing that goes into the target system. Therefore the rescue
    media is not a secret.
-   The backup system or tool contains all the **data** that goes into
    the target system and therefore it also contains the secrets of the
    target system and must be protected accordingly.

With regard to accounts I would say that `passwd` and `group` can still
be considered metadata but `shadow` (passwords) are most definitively
data.

@schlomo  
I fully agree with your reasoning.

I think @N3WWN does not copy the whole users and groups  
into the recovery system only as a "transport" medium to get  
them back on the recreated target system.

I think @N3WWN needs to copy the whole users and groups  
into the recovery system to have them there while 'tar'  
restores files into the target system and to do that for files with  
special users and groups those users and groups must exist  
with the right UID and GID numbers. Otherwise 'tar' could  
restore files with wrong user/group/UID/GID, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1464\#issuecomment-327287675](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1464#issuecomment-327287675)

But I do not yet understand why also /etc/shadow  
is copied into the recovery system.

I guess @N3WWN has already told us somewhere about  
why also /etc/shadow is copied into the recovery system  
but I don't remember (sorry @N3WWN for my lossy mind).

Perhaps for /etc/shadow @N3WWN copies it into the  
recovery system only as a "transport" medium to get  
it back on the recreated target system?
