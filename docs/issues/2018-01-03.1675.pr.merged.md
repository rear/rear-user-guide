As of ReaR version 2.3, a Debian installation pulls in packages which
are only used in specific configurations:
`nfs-client, portmap, xorriso, isolinux`. Along with indirect
dependencies, this installs lots of unnecessary packages on systems not
requiring the respective functionality.

This PR aims to reduce dependency bloat by default. Unlike recommended
packages, suggested packages will not be installed by default, but can
be pulled in on demand via the `apt` option `--install-suggests`.

The PR includes additional dependencies for \#1659.

Maybe even some required dependencies could be relaxed to suggestions,
for example: `syslinux[!ppc64el], syslinux-common[!ppc64el]`

@OliverO2 Excellent idea. @schlomo suggested this long time ago, but we
never came to it.
