Hi,

Couple of questions:

1.  If we have to restore image of server "host1" onto server "host2",
    assuming that both are Virtual Machines. Have you seen any issues.
2.  If we have to restore the ISO image of a physical server on a
    Virtual Machine or vice-versa, is it possible.

Regards,

1.  Yes
2.  Yes

Please note that there is no "image" to restore. ReaR can create a tar
or rsync backup for you and restore that if you don't want to use or
don't have anything else.
