-   How was this pull request tested?

With the change 'rear -s ...' works again for me.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In sbin/rear in simulation mode the workflow scripts  
`$SHARE_DIR/lib/[a-z]*-workflow.sh` need to be executed (sourced)  
to get the WORKFLOW\_... functions defined,  
otherwise sbin/rear could not run the requested workflow.

In simulation mode a WORKFLOW\_... function is run  
but its called scripts are not executed by the Source function.

Thanks for the prompt fix, @jsmeix, but wouldn't it be better to revert
to use `source` here unconditionally, instead of complicating the code?
It looks like `Source` and `source` have a bit different semantics (the
former skips the actual sourcing in simulation mode) and in the case of
loading library function we actually want the semantics of the latter
instead of the former (the former looks better suited for actual code
execution, i.e. executing scripts, not loading function definitions).

Note that the commit message of 7df7dc6499b7703b98d7293fbbf5de4d514a29ac
says:

> ... we can use Source to source our normal scripts  
> in usr/share/rear/lib

but it does not say why should we use it (merely that we can use it).

Both 'source' and 'Source' seem to work in practice.

'source' is proven to work in practice because we used that  
all the time at that specific code place only in sbin/rear  
until 2 weeks ago when I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7df7dc6499b7703b98d7293fbbf5de4d514a29ac](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7df7dc6499b7703b98d7293fbbf5de4d514a29ac)

On the other hand 'Source' is explicitly meant  
to source ReaR scripts and ReaR config files  
(it provides additional functionality and safeguards)  
and this is also proven to work in practice because  
we use that all the time at several code places.

I think 'source' was used at that code place in sbin/rear  
because before
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424)  
the 'Source' function was not yet available  
at that code place because the 'Source' function  
was defined in /usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh  
so I think plain 'source' was used at that code place  
basically as some kind of "makeshift" because  
the actually right function to source ReaR scripts  
and ReaR config files was just not yet available.  
But I cannot prove why 'source' was used at that code  
place in sbin/rear without a comment at that code  
which explains the WHY.

With my more complicated code here I intend to use  
the 'Source' function for what I think it is meant  
to be used in normal use cases so in the special use case  
of the simulation mode I need additional exceptional code.

Compare how much code was executed in simulation mode before  
with how much code is executed in simulation mode now with  
the changes in this pull request - I mean when we call  
that stuff "simulation mode" we should avoid executing  
code which is not needed for the simulation.

By the way:  
I do not enjoy those endless special case code  
and exceptional stuff handling and whatnot.  
I know "good old times" when computing had been much simpler  
with much less features and all was much less user friendly ;-)  
What really annoys me is that rather often underlying foundations  
behave unpredictably, unreliably, insecure, crude, rude,...  
so higher level programmers must endlessly implement  
tons of additional rather complicated makeshift code  
to somehow mitigate shortcomings in underlying foundations.

In my experience the "complicated makeshift code" and shortcomings in
underlying foundations is often not the fault of the code, but of the
specification - i.e. the problem has not been introduced at the coding
phase but at the design phase - it was not well specified what the code
actually should do and thus how one should implement it and what other
code can expect from it.

Consider this case: to me it is not exactly clear what is the intended
difference of `Source` vs. `source` (your wrapper introduced in ReaR).
You write that `Source` provides additional functionality and
safeguards, but safeguards are introduced in your `source` wrapper
already. Regarding the additional functionality, it needs to be
specified for which use it is intended (e.g. because in this case the
functionality is indeed the problem). You write that

> 'Source' is explicitly meant to source ReaR scripts and ReaR config
> files"

and that you think

> plain 'source' was used at that code place basically as some kind of

I am not sure that this was the original intent though. To me it seems
rather that `Source` has had the more restricted purpose of sourcing the
scripts in the scripting framework stages (from`SourceStage`), so
reading libraries and configuration files would not be included and this
would explain why to use `source` here.

Have a look what `Source` is doing:

        # Simulate sourcing the scripts in $SHARE_DIR
        if test "$SIMULATE" && expr "$source_file" : "$SHARE_DIR" >/dev/null; then
            LogPrint "Source $relname"
            return
        fi

Is this intended for reading configuration files? What about
configuration files under `usr/share/rear/conf` ? To me it looks like
they will get skipped - thus simulation mode will work without default
values of variables defined - is that intended? I have never used
simulation mode, but to me it looks like the steps in the simulation
could be quite different from the actual run, which defeats the purpose
of the simulation.

you write:

> But I cannot prove why 'source' was used at that code  
> place in sbin/rear without a comment at that code  
> which explains the WHY.

and I agree, I think we should take this (otherwise quite trivial) PR as
an opportunity to better specify the intended use of the `source`
wrapper vs. `Source`.

P.S. I am of course also guilty here - I should have noticed the shift
in meaning of `Source` in the review of the PR where you made the
changes.

My main point why I am thinking that 'Source' is explicitly  
meant to source ReaR scripts and ReaR config files is that  
we use 'Source' in sbin/rear to source ReaR config files  
and in 'SourceStage' to source ReaR scripts so I assumed  
that also our usr/share/rear/lib/\*.sh scripts are meant  
to be sourced via 'Source'?

This pull request cannot proceed as intended  
because its root cause(s) are way off-topic,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3438](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3438)  
which is a bigger task for the future as time permits.

What I will do to fix things for our current simulation mode  
is to simply revert my

to just make things working again as they did before.

My bad - I thought that using `Source` for ReaR config files is a recent
change, but in fact it has been like this since the beginning. I also
thought that `Source` is used for `usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`,
but it is not (and this is an irregularity, but it prevents what I
wrote:

> What about configuration files under usr/share/rear/conf ? To me it

)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/a61075364b8f0d92c62d63be71467a31e0d4a39d/usr/sbin/rear\#L414](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/a61075364b8f0d92c62d63be71467a31e0d4a39d/usr/sbin/rear#L414)

The other platform-specific configuration defaults are read using
`Source` though:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/a61075364b8f0d92c62d63be71467a31e0d4a39d/usr/sbin/rear\#L798](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/a61075364b8f0d92c62d63be71467a31e0d4a39d/usr/sbin/rear#L798)  
so simulation mode will work without values defined there. We agreed
that this is a bug.

Therefore, I would not claim anymore that `Source` is not intended for
reading library files, as it is indeed intended for configuration files
(so not just for code snippets under stages). For library files we can
use it or avoid it as we decide.

We cannot use 'Source' in sbin/rear to source default.conf  
because we need to source default.conf before we source  
\_framework-setup-and-functions.sh where 'Source' gets defind.  
The comments in sbin/rear hopefully explain why we do it this way.

In general regarding 'Source' versus 'source' in simulation mode:

See my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436\#issuecomment-2748210435](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3436#issuecomment-2748210435)  
excerpt

    ... I mean when we call
    that stuff "simulation mode" we should avoid executing
    code which is not needed for the simulation

In contrast to default.conf that is not meant to be  
modified by the user, the user config files are meant  
for the user to also (as needed) execute what he likes, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/etc/rear/local.conf)

    # Because 'source' executes the content as a bash script you can run commands
    # within your configuration files, in particular commands to set different
    # configuration values depending on certain conditions as you need like
    # CONDITION_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special_value" || VARIABLE="usual_value"
    # but that means such commands get always executed when 'rear' is run.
    # You must ensure commands in configuration files work always without errors
    # regardless in which environment your commands will be run, in particular
    # on your original system (i.e. during "rear mkrescue" or "rear mkbackup")
    # and also within the ReaR recovery system (i.e. during "rear recover").

By pure luck my wording  
"such commands get always executed when 'rear' is run"  
includes also the simulation mode so we are safe  
from a technical point of view  
"dear user, you have been told so"  
but on the other hand my wording  
"You must ensure commands in configuration files  
work always without errors"  
is not yet sufficiently safe so it shoud better read  
something like  
"You must ensure commands in configuration files  
work always without errors or side effects"  
because a user is likely not so happy when things  
get modified in his system in simulation mode because  
his commands were also executed in simulation mode.
