[\#1149 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1149) `closed`: Better colors for the ReaR issue labels and additional labels
================================================================================================================================

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `fixed / solved / done`

From my point of view the current colors of the  
ReaR issue labels at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/labels](https://github.com/rear/rear/labels)  
could be a bit better so that  
corresponding labels get similar colors and  
for example labels which mark things as done  
like "fixed" should be green i.e. the complementary  
color to red for things that need to be done and so on.

Furthermore I would like to add two labels named  
"external backup tool" or "third party"  
for things that somehow belong to ReaR but are  
no ReaR core functionality  
and something like  
"no ReaR issue" or "invalid"  
for things that do not belong to ReaR.

@gdha  
what do you think about such changes?

I have done the new colors mostly.  
Only "support" is currently while - it should  
get a color that looks promising...
