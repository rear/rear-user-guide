    /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf

-   error starting bareos-fd due to the above error.

I think this one is the fix in current master:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/af3fb70b2bfbd42c0a7a9a6b2c1cd3d8a10bd318](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/af3fb70b2bfbd42c0a7a9a6b2c1cd3d8a10bd318)  
which fixes the whole issue more generally, cf.
