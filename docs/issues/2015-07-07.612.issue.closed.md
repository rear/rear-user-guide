TSM has a bug when

    resour [X] (where x >1)

is set. Hardlinks are not restored corectly

When it is 2, TSM has 2 threads, each thread makes it own hardlinks. So
1 file with 10 Hardlinks gets 2 files with 5 hardlinks. It could only be
resolved by changing or setting "resour 1" in the dsm.sys  
Maybe Rear should set it so it is done correctly

Flavoured Markdown).

Can you say why this bug only affects ReaR? ReaR actually does not do
TSM backups (except of the ReaR result files), so I would expect this
bug to hit the regular TSM usage as well.

I would be very careful to have ReaR modify the users TSM configuration.
An exception could be made for modifying it after it is copied to the
ReaR rescue system.

When we have user TSM we used RESOUR=2 for more speed on Backup. On a  
restore of Hardlink you have to set RESOUR=1. Since Rear Restores a  
Complete Server Resour=1 should be always be set.  
Its a "Feature" (Bug) Of TSM, that restores with RESOUR grater 1
doenst  
work with hardlinks , we had to learn the hard have learnd the hard way.
If  
Someone dosnt know of this "Feature". he will restore the Server, and
most  
likely , dont notice that he has lost his hardlinks.

Good argument. I would go with ReaR changing the setting in the rescue  
image. To make sure that we don't hurt anybody I would suggest the  
following:

1.  You inform/ask on the mailing list (more people read the list than
    check  
    the Github issues) about this topic and see if anybody objects (and
    why)
2.  The code that copies the TSM client and config will patch the config
    in  
    the rescue system and emit a warning or at least info about what it
    is  
    doing so that users can see in the log what happens

Will you do that and send us a pull request?

Thanks for your help in making ReaR better,  
Schlomo

Since we changed to Comvault, i have not test system in the moment, to
test  
it. Ill just rememberd that this was on the TSM checklist , so i
thought  
maby a good idea to let you know.

Out Managemnt has decided to USE Onetouch and Comvault. So rear gets  
obsolated here. I use it for my PC at home, but there i dont have TSM

Hi,

thanks for letting us know. Do you mean 1-Touch Recovery like shown in  
[http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v10/article?p=products/1touch\_linux/recover.htm](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v10/article?p=products/1touch_linux/recover.htm)  
?

Very interesting read. First time that I see YaST outside of SUSE
Linux.  
They also seem to have solved the problems that we also worked on,
like  
mapping storage between old and new system. And Multipath support
(does  
theirs work well?).

Do you happen to have a feature comparison between 1-Touch and ReaR?

Let's keep this bug open as a reminder for this issue - after all this
is  
pretty deep TSM knowledge you share here.

Could I still ask you to write to the mailing list with a pointer to
this  
issue so that the other TSM user will be aware of it?

Kind Regards,  
Schlomo

Most of the Linux Server Are VMs so i couldt test Multipath. It has  
worked with Hardware Server with default Hardware. It works on AIX,  
and Windows es well. Solaris still has to be tested.

Their Boot CD seems to restore the rescue System, and then boot the  
Rescue System within the Booted system.

There have been one Problem. On one Sevrer we used Bonding device.  
Since the Bootcd doenst support Boning, bonding must be removed for  
restoring it.

Thanks. BTW, ReaR handles bonding automatically :-)

:-), i know it sadly hasnt helped to get Rear back :-).

I look forward when we migrade SAP HANA to Comvault. Rear Has worked,
sort  
of  
It is "GPFS", Special Storage Controler,....   . I cant imagine
onetouch  
is working.

Rear works when restoring only the OS, Booting, Seting up the
Filesystem,  
THen Restoring the Data

Another Problem , wasnt aware with TSM Settings  
You can Set TSM to change the Client Password Every Day, for security  
Reasons.  
When doing so every day the file /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD is changed.

Rear Checks by default every day for Changes :

30 1 \* \* \* root /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

So it will generate an new CD every day. Since i dont Overwrite the
Image  
(upload is done by web via php Script that puts a  
timestamp to the iso) My Fileserver got Filled up.

About 1-Touch Recovery :  
[http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v10/article?p=products/1touch\_linux/setup.htm](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v10/article?p=products/1touch_linux/setup.htm)  
Very interesting, but too complicated for simple people - it is not easy
to  
use in a stressed situation like a real DR... And there examples are
VMs,  
so, what about UEFI physical Gen9 systems?

@tyl0re How would you propose the fix for the recover mode with TSM? We
do not have a TSM environment to experiment with...

So far on-one else complained - will not implement this suggestion until
we a report which states this is correct or not...  
We close it for now -re-open if necessary.
