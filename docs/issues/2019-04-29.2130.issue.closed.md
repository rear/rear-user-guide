-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4 / Git (f3157906)

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): x86 compatible

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

    Log file entry:

        cp: -r not specified; omitting directory '/usr/src/linux-headers-4.18.0-18-generic'
        [...] Failed to copy symlink target '/usr/src/linux-headers-4.18.0-18-generic'

    Original system:

        # find / -mount -lname /usr/src/linux-headers-4.18.0-18-generic
        /lib/modules/4.18.0-18-generic/build

In this case it makes sense not to copy the directory. If directories,
which are symbolic link targets, should never be copied by default, the
log message could state that. In any case, it would be helpful to
include the symbolic link source in the message.

I don't know if directories, which are symbolic link targets, should not
be copied.  
I think directories, which are symbolic link targets, must never be
copied recursively.  
But I wonder if a plain empty directory should be recreated in the
recovery system.  
Could an empty directory, which was a symbolic link target, be useful in
the  
recovery system?  
I mean:  
I already create the parent directories of a symbolic link target
file.  
Why not also create plain empty symbolic link target directories?  
Empty directories cost basically nothing in the recovery system  
and in some special cases they might be even needed?
