-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I am confused in the instructions abou this line:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

If i am following the instructions word-for-word and i want to make a
bare-metal backup using an attached USB drive as the target backup
device my question is do i use this line exactly as it is stated per the
instructions:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

I do not understand what /disk/ means and i do not understand what
/by-label/ means.  
are they just placeholders and i am expected to update these labels with
something like:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdb/MyExtUSB/REAR-000

where /sdb is my external usb drive and MyExtUSB is a mount point that i
created with

    mkdir /mnt/MyExtUSB 
    mount /dev/sdb /mnt/MyExtSUB

-   Workaround, if any:  
    N/A

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

In addition, after following the instructions word for word and issuing
the following command: `sudo usr/sbin/rear -V mkrescue`  
I got the following error:

My issue is that these instructions do not appear to work by following
them word for word and attaching an external USB drive to the linux
server.

      # Default is to create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image

@kingpoop  
just do what you say and follow the instructions in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
word for word which read in particular (excerpts):

    OUTPUT=USB

and

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

Cf. the error message you got

    mount: special device /dev/disk/bylabel/REAR-000 does not exist

A precondition that

    /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

does exist is that you did before what  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
describes about `Prepare your USB media`.  
For more details about how to "Prepare your USB media"  
see the section about `OUTPUT=USB` in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L710](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L710)

A general warning when you use a USB recovery disk:  
Caution during "rear recover" when you use a USB disk, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854)  
For me it never happened that my ReaR USB disk  
became `/dev/sda` in my ReaR recovery system  
on my laptop or on any of my virtual machines  
(my ReaR USB disk always was `/dev/sdb`)  
so I was never personally hit by such an issue.

@kingpoop  
as a generic warning when you work on "disaster recovery"  
see in particular the section about  
"Inappropriate expectations" at

@jsmeix  
Thank you for the feedback.  
I got it working per the instructions as i was using /bylabel/ instead
of /by-label/ and so rear scripts did not recognize the path. Once i
updated to /by-label/ it worked as expected.  
Thanks

@kingpoop  
thank you for your feedback that what is described at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
also works in your case.  
I am not a Ubuntu user so things might behave different there  
so that `BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000`  
does not work (some 'udev' magic is needed that creates  
those `/dev/disy/by-...` symbolic links when such kind of  
device is there during booting or gets plugged in later).
