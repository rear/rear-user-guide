In future ReaR release we will gradually phase out old (and perhaps)
obsolete external backup solutions.

Therefore, we have to make a list of these external backup solutions we
want to remove over time.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Make ReaR cleaner and remove support for old external backup solutions.

First deprecate them via `ErrorIfDeprecated()`.

### Deprecation list (WIP proposals)

-   GALAXY (Galaxy 5 and 6) : already deprecated via
    prep/GALAXY10/default/001\_galaxy10\_deprecation.sh

-   GALAXY7 : already deprecated via
    prep/GALAXY7/default/001\_galaxy7\_deprecation.sh

-   GALAXY10 : already deprecated via
    prep/GALAXY10/default/001\_galaxy10\_deprecation.sh

-   ZYPPER : seems to be not used in practice, zero user reports, zero
    issues

-   OBDR: as it doesn't seem to work anymore, we better get rid of it
