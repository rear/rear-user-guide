I think we should try to get rid of using partitioning tools  
that do not support GPT and large partitions because  
otherwise I fear there will be and endless sequence  
of more and more problems in ReaR in the future.

In particular "man sfdisk" reads:

<pre>
sfdisk doesn't understand the GUID Partition Table
(GPT) format and it is not designed for large partitions.
In these cases use the more advanced GNU parted(8).
</pre>

Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1106\#issuecomment-265088912](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1106#issuecomment-265088912)

Currently "sfdisk" is called in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64/200\_install\_yaboot.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/200\_install\_yaboot.sh  
and "sfdisk" is mentioned in comments in  
usr/share/rear/lib/mkrescue-functions.sh  
and "sfdisk" is listed as REQUIRED\_PROGS or PROGS in  
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-i386.conf  
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ia64.conf  
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ppc64.conf  
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ppc64le.conf

Btw. same applies to `fdisk` (which seems not to be currently used in
ReaR code ;-) )

    fdisk does not understand GUID partition tables 
    (GPTs) and it is not designed for large partitions.  
    In these cases, use the more advanced GNU parted(8).

Probably "sfdisk" is still needed for NTFS support  
to get NTFS related data from a 'msdos' partitioned disk  
and sgdisk could be used for a 'gpt' partitioned disk, cf.

Yes, at least until we have complete code for that NTFS/Windows stuff,
I'd put this "on hold".
