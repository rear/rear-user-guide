When including files in the ISO using COPY\_AS\_IS functionality and
some of these are libraries with same name as standard system libraries,
the standard system libraries are not included if an executable included
through COPY\_AS\_IS requires a library.  
This does not happen for executables specified through PROG.

Example: copy /lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0 into /non-standard-dir/lib64/ and
include /non-standard-dir/lib64 in the ISO (COPY\_AS\_IS+=(
/non-standard-dir/lib64 ))

-   /usr/lib/udev/rename\_device which is also included as COPY\_AS\_IS
    (in /usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/250\_udev.sh) requires
    /lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0 but /lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0 is not included,
    only /non-standard-dir/lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0 will be
-   /usr/lib/udev/rename\_device will not be usable in rescue due to
    missing library

If we now add /usr/lib/udev/rename\_device to PROG (PROG+=(
/usr/lib/udev/rename\_device )), the library /lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0
will be included because of code in
/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh, so
there will be no issue in that case.

The root cause of the issue is due to the grep line being used:

grep -q "$required\_library" $copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file && continue

Because $required\_library is "/lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0" and file
$copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file contains
"/non-standard-dir/lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0", this will be a match,
whereas it should not.

The fix consists in modifying the grep line to match a full line instead
(file $copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file contains 1 file name per line).

@gdha  
do you also approve it as it is now?  
If yes, I would like to merge it.
