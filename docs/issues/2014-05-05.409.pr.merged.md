Hi

While reading the source to investigate issue \#408 I fixed some minor
things like not quoted variables, a bit indention and documentation.
Successfully did a restore and recover with this changed version
although it might be a good idea to not merge this branch in version
1.16 since it does not really improve much for the end user. It would of
course be nice to have automated testing on hand (\#38).
