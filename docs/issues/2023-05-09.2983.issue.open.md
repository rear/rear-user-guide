-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I would like to make an ISO file with a complete backup over the net to
a remote clould storage.  
The cloud is accessable via webdav protocoll.  
During the backup process the internal HD runs out of space because the
iso file is created locally and subsequently copied to the backup
target.  
I tried to overcome this shortage by changing the TMPDIR to the webdav
drive by using  
`TMPDIR=/mnt/hidrive/tmp`  
but  
`# rear -v mkbackup `  
leads to errors like

    Script 'default/005_verify_os_conf.sh' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_' is                                                                                           likely run in wrong order
    Script 'default/010_EFISTUB_check.sh' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_' is l                                                                                          ikely run in wrong order
    Script 'default/010_set_drlm_env.sh' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_' is li                                                                                          kely run in wrong order

and then the backup aborts.

What can I do to solve this problem of low local HD-space?

@andreasberner

    TMPDIR=/mnt/hidrive/tmp

and also

    export TMPDIR=/mnt/hidrive/tmp

in etc/rear/local.conf do not work because usr/sbin/rear  
creates its temporary working area (BUILD\_DIR) at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L505](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L505)  
before the config files get sourced later at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L598](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L598)

How to set TMPDIR properly see the description in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
(excerpts)

    # TMPDIR
    #
    # Relax-and-Recover needs a (temporary) working area where it builds in particular
    # the rescue/recovery system ISO image (and perhaps even stores the backup archive).
    ...
    # To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover call
    #   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
    # before calling 'rear' (/prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist).

For me it works as described:

    # mount -v /dev/sda6 /other

    # mkdir /other/tmp

    # export TMPDIR=/other/tmp

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git
    Running rear mkrescue (PID 26919 date 2023-05-11 12:19:23)
    Command line options: usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    Using log file: /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log
    Using build area: /other/tmp/rear.TxZuJW4iSV3Cwpd
    ...

But I do not have a "remote webdav-Drive from IONOS"  
to test how ReaR behaves with that.

The error messages you get like

    Script 'default/005_verify_os_conf.sh' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_' ...

do not make sense because the script '005\_verify\_os\_conf.sh'  
has a leading 3-digit number 'NNN\_'.

The code that does this is in
usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh\#L128](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh#L128)

For me this code works in ReaR and also on command line

    # script='default/005_verify_os_conf.sh'

    # grep -q '^[0-9][0-9][0-9]_' <<< $( basename $script ) || echo "Script '$script' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_'"
    [no output]

    # script='default/05_verify_os_conf.sh'

    # grep -q '^[0-9][0-9][0-9]_' <<< $( basename $script ) || echo "Script '$script' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_'"
    Script 'default/05_verify_os_conf.sh' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_'

    # script='default/0500_verify_os_conf.sh'

    # grep -q '^[0-9][0-9][0-9]_' <<< $( basename $script ) || echo "Script '$script' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_'"
    Script 'default/0500_verify_os_conf.sh' without leading 3-digit number 'NNN_'

Usually such inexplicable error messages indicate  
that the ReaR installation might be somehow messed up  
or that the environment where ReaR is run  
is not sufficiently standards compliant.

You may try out the current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
from within a separated directory as a test to find out  
if things work better then, see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@Johannes

In general, the workaround to set the TMPDIR outside the rear  
configuration seems to work.

I also tried to use the most updated code from GITHIB for rear with
the  
following results:

-   Without changing the TMPDIR to the mounted partiton, the system
    begins  
    to run (and later on runs out of disk space as expected)

-   With the TMPDIR pointing to the mounted partition, all kinds of
    errors  
    occur and the system aborts

I do suspect that the webdav mounting is not compatible with the rear  
software - if any remote mounted at all.

I guess I need to change at least the protocoll to SSHFS but this is
no  
current option of the mounted partition.

Thanks at this time for your really professional answer.

Best

Andreas

@andreasberner  
because you wrote  
"the webdav mounting is not compatible with the rear software"  
I think there could be a misunderstanding what I meant with  
"the environment where ReaR is run  
is not sufficiently standards compliant".

The ReaR software is only bash scripts (and documentation)  
so what ReaR (i.e. usr/sbin/rear) does is to run bash.  
What bash that is run by ReaR does is to call various  
GNU/Linux standard programs as specified in ReaR's bash scripts.  
In the end what is done is that various GNU/Linux standard  
programs are called (in particular with BACKUP=NETFS where  
GNU/Linux standard programs are used for backup and restore  
and no special third party backup software is involved).

So when things work without errors (up to "out of space")  
with the default TMPDIR '/tmp'  
but with the "webdav TMPDIR" all kinds of errors occur,  
then it means that with the "webdav TMPDIR"  
various GNU/Linux standard programs (including bash)  
fail with "all kinds of errors".  
You should get the same failures when you call those programs  
manually on bash command line when you use the "webdav TMPDIR".

So - as far as I understand it - it is the "webdav TMPDIR"  
which is not sufficiently GNU/Linux standards compliant.

Perhaps you can change something how that "remote webdav-Drive"  
is mounted (i.e. use some appropriate 'mount' options) to make  
the mounted thing sufficiently GNU/Linux standards compliant  
to be used as TMPDIR?

A different idea:

What exactly did run out of space with the default TMPDIR?

Relly out of disk space (i.e. physical or virtual harddisk)?  
I.e. in your case really out of space on '/dev/vda1'?

Or is it perhaps actually out of memory (RAM plus swap)?  
Because nowadays /tmp is often mounted as 'tmpfs'  
so /tmp is in RAM (plus swap - '/dev/vda2' in your case).

Check the output of 'df' and 'free' what actually runs out of space.

Because ReaR 2.7 uses by default /var/tmp for its  
temporary working area (BUILD\_DIR) and because /var/tmp  
is normally on the harddisk, it is expected  
that really '/dev/vda1' runs out of space.  
But if one of the programs that are called by ReaR  
uses the default TMPDIR /tmp it may run "out of memory".

When you run ReaR in debug modes (via -d or -D)  
then KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR is automatically set to true,  
(see its description in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
which means old ReaR working areas /var/tmp/rear.\*  
are not removed so you have to manually clean it up.

Hi Johannes,

thanks for your response. There seems to be still a problem in using  
remote filesystems for the TMPDIR.  
While the webdav protocoll sucks with the below given error messages,
a  
sshfs-mounted TMPDIR fails with other error messages like described in

[https://debianforum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=182913\#:~:text=ALLES%20AUSW%C3%84HLEN-,Creating%20recovery%20system%20root%20filesystem%20skeleton%20layout%0AERROR%3A%20Failed%20to%20copy,an%20error%2C%20check%20/var/log/rear/rear%2Ddebian.log%20for%20details,-Das%20o.g](https://debianforum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=182913#:~:text=ALLES%20AUSW%C3%84HLEN-,Creating%20recovery%20system%20root%20filesystem%20skeleton%20layout%0AERROR%3A%20Failed%20to%20copy,an%20error%2C%20check%20/var/log/rear/rear%2Ddebian.log%20for%20details,-Das%20o.g)

When you mention your working example in your reply, can you please  
specify details about the mounted filesystem /other?

Especially, is it a local filesystem or a remote filesystem? If
remote,  
which protocoll is used for the mounting? NFS, SSHFS ?

Thanks in advance and best regards

Andreas

@andreasberner

what is mounted at /other is  
a normal local harddisk partition  
with an ext2 filesystem:

    # lsblk -io NAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
    NAME    TRAN  TYPE  FSTYPE    SIZE MOUNTPOINT
    sda     sata  disk          465.8G
    ...
    |-sda6        part  ext2        8G /other

I never tried a remote filesystem for TMPDIR.  
In

I only liked to show how ReaR works with a different TMPDIR.

I see. My problem is that the server to be backed up is a hosted server
and the internal HDD is almost full or at least not sufficient remaining
capacity to back up the system before copying the result to an other
server.

That is why I am looking for an alternate solution to back up directly
on a remote HDD.

Any idea how to achieve that?

@andreasberner  
I know basically nothing about  
remote storage and remote filesystems  
so I cannot help in this area.

For my tests with ReaR I use almost always

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://NFS.server.IP.address/path/to/rear/backup

which results on 'NFS.server.IP.address'  
in a 'backup/HOSTNAME' directory a 'rear-HOSTNAME.iso'  
plus a separated 'backup.tar.gz' which has the advantage  
that the backup of the files is directly accessible  
and not somehow "hidden" inside the ISO image.  
In general I prefer to keep separated things separated,  
cf. RFC 1925 item (5).  
For ReaR this means I prefer to keep the ReaR recovery system  
(i.e. its ISO image) separated from the backup of the files,  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in
