I am using ReaR version 2.7 on Amazon Linux2 and trying to test a
recovery case.

Backup works but the Recovery AMI wont come up. Anyone tried this ? Any
suggestions.

Thanks in advance

Yes we found solution, make sure you are not using the default syslinux
verion, use the latest 6.4.x version of syslinux. after testing the
recovery process, will keep posted and close the thread.

is a related/dependant issue which in particular shows  
some more details about the used Amazon Linux2 system
