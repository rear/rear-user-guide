I tried to rerun the diskrestore.sh file but to no avail. Running OEL
5.5, REAR 1.17.2.

please help as the server wont boot up without the REAR image.

I think the first line says it all **diskrestore.sh has not been

can re-run it again.

Thank you!. You may close the case now. The document pretty much helped
me.
