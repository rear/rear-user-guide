<!-- -->

    RedHatEnterpriseServer/7 on Linux-i386 (based on Fedora/7/i386)
    there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system or the code
    that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.

    Please contribute this code to the Relax-and-Recover project. To do so
    please take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize,
    for an example you can use the script for Fedora (and RHEL/CentOS/SL) in
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21_install_grub.sh or
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh

I hope

<pre>
grub2-install: warning: cannot open directory `/usr/share/locale': No such file or directory.
</pre>

is what it tells - only a warning but not an error,  
cf. "Character encoding" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
i.e. "grub2-install" must "just work" in POSIX/C locale.

Therefore I assume

<pre>
grub2-install: error: unknown filesystem.
</pre>

is the actual reason why it fails.

@gdha @jsmeix,  
Ain't this issue and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065)
same?

See

@gozora  
yes, I think this one is the same as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065)  
and I wonder why  
@gdha  
uses "rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2"  
and not the current GitHub master code  
where this issue should be fixed.

@jsmeix @gozora @phracek It could be that
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1399487](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1399487)
(ReaR issue \#1065) and
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1390855](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390855)
(ReaR issue \#1174) are the same, but I think it is up to RHEL
engineering to come to the same conclusion. I created this issue to have
a direct link to the BugZilla entries of RedHat so we could back-trace
(and vice versa), and it was logged against rear-1.17.2 (so that
explains this older version number, but still the only RH supported
version).  
And, you are right that both issues were fixed in rear-2.00 that is now
officially available in the main repo's of EPEL 5 and f234, f25 too. I
do hope that RedHat considers to upgrade as well to version 2.00 (and
they have a BugZilla for it
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1355667](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1355667)).

It is perfectly fine for me to have such issues here as reference.  
But I think it should be marked as "fixed" for ReaR v2.00 here.  
Nevertheless we can keep it open as long as needed.

RH confirmed they will re-base ReaR with version 2.00

To the Red Hat people who may listening here:  
Note several (minor) behavioural changes and  
one possibly major change that may cause  
real regressions for some users in ReaR 2.0 in
