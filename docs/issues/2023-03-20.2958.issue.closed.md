-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When plugging in a USB multi-card reader (SD / MicroSD) which has no
card insert, the device (`/dev/sda`) has a 0 size.  
This leads to layout verification to fail:

    No partition label type for 'disk /dev/sda' (may cause 'rear recover' failure)
    /dev/sda size 0 is not a positive integer
    ERROR: 
    ====================
    BUG in /root/rear/usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh line 254:
    'Entries in /root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf are broken ('rear recover' would fail)'

This happens when `AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=n` (which is not the default).

-   Workaround, if any:

None found yet, except excluding the "disk" manually, which isn't always
possible due to non-persistent device naming.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

The root cause is the code snippet in
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh`, which
doesn't skip disks with `$devsize == 0` :

    415                 devsize=$(get_disk_size ${disk#/sys/block/})
    416                 disktype=$(parted -s $devname print | grep -E "Partition Table|Disk label" | cut -d ":" -f "2" | t    r -d " ")
     :
    430                     echo "disk $devname $devsize $disktype"

This leads to creating entry `disk sda 0`, which is invalid entry
(missing `$disktype`).

I think the solution is to skip those 0 size disks completely.

Potentially similar issue: \#2810 , but details seem different. Possibly
because in \#2810 disk access fails with "No medium found", while here
it returns size 0 (@rmetrich can you please check if `blockdev` reports
`blockdev: cannot open /dev/sdb: No medium found` which would indicate
that the drive actually behaves same as in \#2810 ? ) Also please
provide the USB vendor and model (lsusb output).

Yes it returns "Medium not found". But I think whenever the size
returned is 0, the disk should be skipped.

The SD card reader I used for reproducing is:

@rmetrich  
good to hear from you again!

Does "rear recover" work in your case  
with a disk with size 0 in disklayout.conf?  
I.e. when you disable (e.g. via 'return 0' as first line)  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
does then "rear recover" work for you?

The primary reason for the tests in  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
is to avoid known cases where "rear recover" fails.  
Better error out "too often" during "rear mkrescue"  
than possibly let the user learn the "too hard" way  
why he must verify in advance that "rear recover"  
will work for him for his specific use case ;-)

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2958\#issue-1632369838](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2958#issue-1632369838)

    entry 'disk sda 0', which is invalid entry (missing $disktype)

see my test in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810\#issuecomment-1141138162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810#issuecomment-1141138162)  
which shows that "rear recover" even works when there is  
only a 'disk' entry without partition type label value  
but nothing else for this disk exists in disklayout.conf like

    disk /dev/sdb 5368709120

so perhaps "rear recover" also works when there is  
only a 'disk' entry without partition type label value  
and with zero disk size but nothing else for this disk  
exists in disklayout.conf like

    disk /dev/sdb 0

Next test would be if "rear recover" also works when there is  
only a 'disk' entry without partition type label value  
and without a disk size value but nothing else for this disk  
exists in disklayout.conf like

    disk /dev/sdb

Only an offhanded idea regarding the workaroud

    excluding the "disk" manually, which isn't always possible
    due to non-persistent device naming

Because etc/rear/local.conf is executed as bash script  
one can implement therein whatever works in the specific case  
to autodetect the right disk which must be excluded.

I tested how "rear recover" behaves  
when there is only a 'disk' entry  
but nothing else for this disk  
exists in disklayout.conf

To test that I created an empty 1GiB disk on a KVM/QEMU VM.

"rear mkrescue" makes only this one disabled entry  
in disklayout.conf

    #disk /dev/sdb 1073741824 unknown

### (1) disk /dev/sdb 1073741824 unknown

I tested "rear recover" with this entry enabled

    disk /dev/sdb 1073741824 unknown

"rear recover" works.

I got this in diskrestore.sh

    Device sdb has size 1073741824 bytes but 0 bytes is expected (needs manual configuration)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration (GiB sizes rounded down to integer)
    /dev/sda has same size 21474836480 (20 GiB)
    /dev/sdb had size 0 (0 GiB) but is now 1073741824 (1 GiB)
    Using /dev/sda (same name and same size 21474836480) for recreating /dev/sda
    Could not automap /dev/sdb (no disk with same size 0 found)
    Original disk /dev/sdb does not exist (with same size) in the target system
    Cannot check write protection by ID for /dev/sdb (no ID found)

I think the issue is more generic:

I wonder what to do when there is only a 'disk' entry  
but nothing else for this disk exists in disklayout.conf?

Should such a "lonely" 'disk' entry be commented out  
as it happens above for my "empty disk" test case  
OR  
should disks where we cannot detect the usually needed values  
for disk size and partition type label be skipped  
and all what possibly depends on such disks  
(partitions filesystems and so one)  
OR  
should we somehow try to autodetect when  
a disk is an empty SD card slot or the like  
and then skip all of it?

If we skip disks and all what belongs to them  
should we report that to the user so he is informed  
(we may skip things the user expects to be included)  
or would that be only unwanted noise in almost all cases?  
Perhaps report it only via DebugPrint so the user can  
see it when unexpected things got skipped?

My preference. That's how the component exclusion code works now. If
there is nothing useful on the disk (either because there is nothing at
all, or because the components got excluded by the include/exclude
rules) , the entry for the disk is itself excluded (commented out). This
prevents formatting of disks that are not included in the backup. I rely
on it in the s390 code (where the `disk` entry also governs low-level
formatting of the disk). But even outside the context of dasd-specific
stuff it makes sense.

This should not happen - if we can't detect basic stuff like partition
table and size, there shouldn't be anything that depends on the disk
(like partitions and anything on them)? Having a partition on a disk
whose size can't be even determined or which does not have a partition
table is not an expected situation. I would call BugError in this case.

Yes, I think we should skip disk drives without disk media (or with bad
media - I saw a failing SCSI disk that was reported but with a size of 0
- it was not even a removable disk).

Note that as soon as the USB card reader is unplugged from the USB port,
the layout code will fail because of the

    [ -b "/dev/sdb" ] || BugError "Disk /dev/sdb is not a block device."

part.  
So in this case it is indeed better if the `disk` entry gets commented
out. (Of course this does not protect you against the situation where
there is an actual card with data in the reader during backup and then
the reader gets removed for recovery.)

The case when there is an actual card with data in the reader  
during backup and then the reader gets removed for recovery  
is an unsupported migration case:  
Recreating on hardware with different number of disks.  
In such cases the user must manually adapt his disklayout.conf.

If the third field is mandatory, perhaps it is not a big problem if the
code misbehaves without it?

Yes, it is OK that the third field is mandatory.  
But when it is mandatory the code should  
not "blindly proceed" when it is not there.  
In particular because disklayout.conf is meant  
to be edited by the user when needed.

Indeed, `AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=y` is documented as "Automatically exclude
disks that are not used by mounted filesystems" in default.conf

> or skipped?

I would think that invalid disks (zero-sized, missing media) should
still be skipped, even with `AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=n`. It is not documented
that this such a functionality (not even implemented) would depend on
`AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=y`. And since excluding unused disks is a very
different operation than excluding broken disks (even if in practice
they tend to occur together since a broken disk is typically unused as
well), I would not conflate them.

OK from me to automatically exclude or silently skip  
(silent means without user notification in normal modes)  
broken disks regardless how AUTOEXCLUDE\_DISKS is set.

Indeed. I don't have any ambition to extend the code to support this
case. I mentioned it only for completeness.

I think I found a (possibly severe) issue  
with the current behaviour of "rear recover"  
for incomplete 'disk' entries in disklayout.conf

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2958\#issuecomment-1477783731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2958#issuecomment-1477783731)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810\#issuecomment-1141138162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810#issuecomment-1141138162)

The current behaviour of "rear recover"  
for incomplete 'disk /dev/sdb' entries in disklayout.conf  
results in diskrestore.sh (excerpt)

    Log "Erasing MBR of disk /dev/sdb"
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1
    sync

which destroys the first 512 data bytes on the disk.

I am wondering if this might damage data on a disk  
that is not meant to be touched by ReaR?

For example assume during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" there is  
a disk /dev/sdb with removable medium that has no medium loaded  
(e.g. because that disk is not meant to be touched by ReaR)  
which results an incomplete 'disk /dev/sdb' entry in disklayout.conf  
but during "rear recover" there is (perhaps accidentally)  
a medium loaded so "rear recover" will damage the data on the medium.

IMO incomplete entries should not be allowed to occur. Unknown disk
label types are covered by the literal `unknown`, right?  
And if a device should be skipped (e.g. because there is no actual disk
in the drive), I would completely avoid adding it to disklayout, instead
of adding a incomplete entry.

The `dd` command will be problematic in any case, because if there is no
medium, we do not lose any data, but `dd` will abort with the error
message `... No medium found`. And diskrestore.sh runs with `errexit`
set...

EDIT: to answer the question - indeed it is a problem - @jsmeix good
catch!

By the way, after my update of the S/390 code, unformatted DASDs (which
also report zero size, but unlike drives with missing media they can be
opened) are already skipped from the layout entirely (except for the
`dasd_channel` directive that causes them to be activated (to not cause
unnecessary shifts in naming)).

@drakkainenn I believe for CD-ROM drives it should not happen, because
they should not show up as `/dev/sd*`. But for "some other device" it
certainly could, if it has removable media (e.g. a Iomega Zip would
probably fall in this category).

Are you also using `AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=n` ? The problem should not happen
without this setting.
