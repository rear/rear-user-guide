I can run multiple "rear mkbackuponly" and  
multiple "rear restoreonly" in parallel, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-264173077](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-264173077)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-264176438](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-264176438)

But ReaR's current logging is not prepared for multiple  
simultaneous rear runs and also ReaR's current  
progress subsystem is not prepared for multiple  
simultaneous rear runs.

On the terminal the messages from different simultaneous  
rear runs mix up indistinguishable and when the  
current progress subsystem additionallyoutputs  
it basically messes up what there is visible on the terminal  
because of its terminal control sequences.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-264173077](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-264173077)  
I did some quick-and-dirty experimantal logging enhancements  
and progress subsystem changes (mainly showing messages  
with a leading PID and let the progress subsystem output each  
message on a separated line which effectively disables the intent  
of the progress subsystem, cf. lib/progresssubsystem.nosh)  
that make the terminal output work o.k. for me.

Now (for two simultaneous "rear mkbackupony" runs)  
the terminal output looks like

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -C rootbackup -d -D mkbackuponly & usr/sbin/rear -C homebackup -d -D mkbackuponly & wait ; echo done

</pre>

Such changes would be backward incompatible  
because the messages look different now.

Hereby I ask for comments what you think about it?

Are such changes how the messages look  
a severe backward incompatible change  
or is it o.k. to implement it this way?

Personally I think for the ReaR major version bump to 2.x  
such backward incompatible changes should be o.k.

By the way I think we should now really  
get rid of the progress subsystem, cf.

@gdha @schlomo  
what do you think?

It helped to sleep over it over the weekend:  
I have a plan now:

1.)  
I will add support for a new variable MESSAGE\_PREFIX  
that is by default empty so that by default nothing changes  
but the user can set it e.g. to MESSAGE\_PREFIX="PID$$: "  
and all functions that output something will be changed to  
do the output basically via something like

<pre>
echo "${MESSAGE_PREFIX}$*"
</pre>

2.)  
I will add support for a new variable PROGRESS\_MODE  
that can be PROGRESS\_MODE="ANSI" (current behaviour)  
or PROGRESS\_MODE="plain" (needed as described above)  
that is by default empty which means  
PROGRESS\_MODE="ANSI" is used as fallback  
so that by default nothing changes but the user can set it  
to PROGRESS\_MODE="plain" when needed.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1101](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1101)  
merged I consider this issue to be sufficiently fixed.

I added another new variable PROGRESS\_WAIT\_SECONDS  
that specifies the number of seconds between progress messages  
that are aoutput while a longer task (usually backup or restore) runs.  
The default/fallback is 1 second to keep the current behaviour, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1101\#issue-193468978](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1101#issue-193468978)

Documentation of all that happens later when  
"Multiple simultaneous backups or restores"  
work sufficiently well for me, cf.
