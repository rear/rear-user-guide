in particular basically rewrote most parts of  
prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh

@jsmeix did you test if the pull request works well? It is a bit too
much to overview by looking at it. If you are sure it is ok you may
merge the pull request. Thanks Johannes.

@gdha  
it does not yet "work well" but it works  
already "better" than before for me.

It does not yet work o.k. initially (this is no regression, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1062\#issuecomment-259394607](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1062#issuecomment-259394607)  
where after the initial full backup there are no timestamp.txt  
and basebackup.txt files in the NFS backup directory).

I think meanwhile I know the reason:  
When initially prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
is run the commands that should write timestamp.txt  
and basebackup.txt files in the NFS backup directory  
do not work correctly - but I will have to analyze that  
next week...

Bottom line:  
One might merge it right now because it should improve things  
but it is not yet really solved - therefore I would wait until I got
it  
sufficiently solved next week.

Except the initial startup phase incremental backup  
works now very well for me.

For me the only issue is that initially one gets two  
full backups but that is only a minor annoyance.

In prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
writing timestamp.txt and basebackup.txt fails during  
the very first "rear mkbackup" because there is not yet  
the HOSTNAME directory '.../outputfs/d108' that gets  
created much later by output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh

I fixed that during initial incremental backup (i.e. for the first full
backup) timestamp.txt and basebackup.txt get stored in the backup
directory  
by writing them in prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
only to TMP\_DIR and later copy them to the backup directory  
in output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh

This makes the current incremental backup implementation  
even more a dirty hack (several special case handling for it  
spread over several scripts) but for now (i.e. within the current  
ReaR framework) it looks o.k. for me.

In its current state incremental backup works well for me.

It even works somewhat fail-safe together with an  
intermixed non-incremental backup run so that  
a single backup.tar.gz contains a full backup:

If a backup.tar.gz exists in the backup directory  
that one is used for restore regardless of any  
BACKUP\_TYPE="incremental" setting and  
regardless whether or not there are also  
incremental backups in the backup directory  
which are newer than the backup.tar.gz file.

After a simple

<pre>
# mv backup.tar.gz backup.tar.gz.outdated
</pre>

in the backup directory and if needed setting  
BACKUP\_TYPE="incremental"  
in /etc/rear/local.conf in the recovery system  
"rear recover" restores the latest full backup of the  
incremental backups and the latest actually incremental backup.
