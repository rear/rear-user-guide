    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://10.12.0.74/mnt/rear/"
    GRUB_RESCUE=1

I created backup and save it to nfs. Recover should start after system
reboot. When I called `rear recover`, rear stopped because it was not
possible to mount NFS server with backup.

    ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime 10.12.0.74:/mnt/rear/ /tmp/rear.uRiyOcvlGp6Htgf/outputfs' failed.

This problem appears only if networking is on differ interface than
**eth0.**

@phracek are you sure the eth0/1 was not working before you started the
recovery? Did you try ping? You could check the script defining the
network interfaces - `/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh`

Furthermore, what was the content of `/etc/rear/rescue.conf` file (in
recovery mode only).

Hi Gratien,

I tried to reproduce this problem. I run rear mkbackup. Network
interface was tested, eht1 was working and it was possible to ping this
machine.

    # ip address show eth1
    3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000

        inet6 fe80::2e0:81ff:fe31:b352/64 scope link 
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

After this system was rebooting. Recovery mode was started and I run
"rear recover".

    unset TMPDIR

    ip link set dev eth1 mtu 1500

Varianble $USE\_DHCLIENT was checked and it was empty:

    RESCUE p1:~ # echo $USE_DHCLIENT

So script 60-network-devices.sh was run manually and you can see see
that network interfaces was set.

But now it is still not possible to process ping with other machine.
Networking is still down.

    # ping 10.8.174.175
    connect: Network is unreachable

And if I try to run `rear recover` again, the same problem is visible.

@tcerna the `rescue.conf` contained the setting `USE_DHCLIENT=y` which
means that the variable was set during the rear run. I guess there was
an issue with `dhclient` - did you see errors in the `/var/log/messages`
file?

@tcerna Well I have seen it myself when one interface is using dhcp and
the other interface has a static IP address. Then `USE_DHCLIENT=y`
overrules the rest of the script
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh`.  
What I do is run this script manual again on the shell as:

    bash /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

to re-mediate the static IP address. Or, define
`USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=1` in `/etc/rear/local.conf`

@gdha Let me check with @tcerna what we have configured. I guess, it was
only DHCP network interface.

@gdha  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960)
merged  
the new NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
support should be also helpful to override the 'return'  
in 60-network-devices.sh when DHCP was used,  
see my examples in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960\#issuecomment-239448861](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960#issuecomment-239448861)  
so that one does no longer need to run 60-network-devices.sh  
manually again in case of special networking environments.

Of course NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
will not make it "just work" automatically but it is not meant  
this way. It is meant to be helpful to get problems with recovery  
system networking setup more easily fixed - or at least to get  
more easily a quick and dirty workaround in case of  
issues with recovery system networking setup.
