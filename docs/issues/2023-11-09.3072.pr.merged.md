While testing  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070)  
I noticed that UserInput() timeout is 3 seconds  
but I had no idea where that came from  
(default UserInput() timeout is 300 or 30 seconds)  
until I found out that in unattended recovery mode  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
calls `rear --non-interactive recover`  
and in non-interactive mode UserInput() does

    # set timeouts to low but acceptable 3 seconds for non-interactive mode:
    timeout=3
    automated_input_interrupt_timeout=3

with a hardcoded '3' that I could not find easily  
in the whole ReaR code (without knowing where to look for).  
I think having it hardcoded is wrong because for example  
why should UserInput() wait at all when there is no user  
who could see any input request or ever respond to it  
so it should be possible to set it to 1 if needed  
(e.g. for 'unattended' recovery).  
A timeout of 0 would get complicated to be implemented because  
'read -t 0' returns immediately without trying to read any data  
so it seems when 'read' should time out the minimum is '1',  
cf. the "Drain stdin" comment in the UserInput function:

    # That the 'read' timeout can be a fractional number requires bash 4.x
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2866#issuecomment-1254908270
    # but in general ReaR should still work with bash 3.x so we use '-t 1'

and I think a 'read' timeout fractional number is not a sufficient  
reason to require bash 4.x mandatorily for the UserInput function.

-   How was this pull request tested?

Works well for me so far...

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Added USER\_INPUT\_UNATTENDED\_TIMEOUT  
to specify the timeout in seconds (by default 3)  
for how long UserInput() waits for user input  
when ReaR is run in 'unattended' or 'non-interactive' mode.

@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections  
I would like to merge this soon

@jsmeix side note: Didn't we recently determine that all actively
supported distros use Bash 4.x nowadays?

@schlomo  
yes, all actively ReaR upstream supported distros use Bash 4.x  
but in general I do not like to "just break" backward compatibility  
unless there is a reasonable reason for it.

In this particular case support for fractional numbers  
for the 'read' timeout values would require several  
other code changes because

    # USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT=1

    # test "$USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT" -ge 1 && echo OK
    OK

    # USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT=1.1

    # test "$USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT" -ge 1 && echo OK
    bash: test: 1.1: integer expression expected

Currently I think this is not worth the effort, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2866\#issuecomment-1254908270](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2866#issuecomment-1254908270)

    I tested it and for me the one second delay
    is hardly noticeable in interactive mode
    so I think it is acceptable.

@jsmeix I agree with your reasoning about this particular case, I'd just
like to remove the "must work with Bash 3.x" from our minds.

I find it totally fine if Bash 3.x distros will be locked into ReaR 2.7.

@schlomo  
I fully agree with your

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3072\#issuecomment-1805657453](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3072#issuecomment-1805657453)  
I edited  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so that it reads now

    Why

    Relax-and-Recover is written in Bash (Bash version 4 is needed)

and in the section "Maintain backward compatibility" the part

    In particular avoid special bash version 4 features
    (Relax-and-Recover code should also work with bash version 3).

is now removed, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style/\_compare/b79eca6ebc97a75d16e349fe6bf22c6c734be400...52e427de85f2ea36ab888164b992b62c48cdec9a](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style/_compare/b79eca6ebc97a75d16e349fe6bf22c6c734be400...52e427de85f2ea36ab888164b992b62c48cdec9a)

I see now that openSUSE Factory / Tumbleweed has bash-5.2.tar.gz  
but I don't know how far Bash 5 is backward compatible with Bash 4  
so for now I leave the statement "Bash version 4 is needed" as is  
and leave it to Bash 5 users to test and find out on their own  
what that means for their particular ReaR use cases.  
Cf. what I wrote about openSUSE Tumbleweed in our release notes:

    In theory ReaR 2.7 should work on openSUSE Tumbleweed but in practice
    arbitrary failures could happen at any time because the Tumbleweed
    distribution is a pure rolling release version of openSUSE containing the
    latest stable versions of all software
    (cf. https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) so arbitrary changes of any
    software are possible at any time that could arbitrarily break how ReaR works.

FYI: SLE15 has Bash version 4.4
