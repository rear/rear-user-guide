Now restore/default/900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh  
recreates by default some generic directories in any case  
if they do not exist, namely:  
mnt proc run sys dev/pts dev/shm tmp var/tmp

MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE was renamed  
into DIRECTORIES\_TO\_CREATE  
but all should be fully backward compatible - in particular  
if exists MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE is still also used.

@schlomo  
regarding your

"I am against storing multi-word strings in a Bash array  
(wrong tool for the job)"

I am puzzled.

For me a bash array is perfectly right to store  
several strings (a string can have several words or be empty).  
For me a bash array is exactly there to solve  
the problem how to store several strings.  
If I have to store only several words,  
a bash string would be sufficient.  
E.g.

<pre>
things=( 'first thing' '' 'third thing' ' ' 'last thing' )
for thing in "${things[@]}" ; do
    test "$thing" && echo $thing || echo nothing
done
</pre>

What is a better tool for such a job?

@jsmeix What we would want to have is a multi-dimensional dictionary
like

    directories = {
      "/tmp" = {
        "mode" = 1777,
        "owner" = "root",
        "group" = "root",
      }
    }

But Bash of course doesn't have this. So we already have this file that
has this data in table form which I think is a better (= less ambiguous
and confusing) place than a bash array with multi word content. Reason
is that people don't expect such complex data structures in a Bash
array.

If you must use the Bash array to keep that kind of data than please
make it gracefully fall back to sane defaults for mode, owner and group
so that one can add just directories if the default mode of 755 and
root:root are OK.

@schlomo  
I guess with "we already have this file that has this data in table
form"  
you mean the mountpoint\_permissions file?

If yes I think there is a misunderstanding:  
I do not want to replace the mountpoint\_permissions file  
with a bash array.  
I want to use a bash array in default.conf to specify  
the defaults and give the user a way to specify additional  
durectories as he needs to get (re)created.  
Therefore my question would be:  
What else than a bash array should/could I use  
in default.conf to specify such kind of defaults?

In general regarding a file that has data in table form:

Caution with that!

From my experience it does not "just solve"  
the words versus strings issue because  
the usual field separator for data in table form  
is tab or space i.e. essentially the same as $IFS.

Accordingly data in table form where fields can be strings  
also need special care and special handling - in particular  
because 'read' separates fields by $IFS by default.

E.g. simple 'read' does not work for strings:

<pre>
# echo "'first value' '' 'third value' ' ' 'fifth value'" >/tmp/data_file

# read first second third fourth fifth junk &lt;/tmp/data_file

# echo "first=$first" ; echo "second=$second" ; echo "third=$third" ; echo "fourth=$fourth" ; echo "fifth=$fifth" ; echo "junk=$junk"
first='first
second=value'
third=''
fourth='third
fifth=value'
junk=' ' 'fifth value'
</pre>

We already had severe issues in ReaR because disklayout.conf  
is such kind of file where read is used to input words.  
These issues had a related but somewhat different cause:  
The cause was that empty fields are not possible with simple 'read'.  
Some error in code that created disklayout.conf had missed  
to write a field and then the 'read' assigned wrong vaules  
to wrong variables (i.e. field mismatch because of an empty field)  
and as consequence subsequent code in ReaR run mad and  
failed at a totally unexpected place with a totally unexpected  
error message "More than 128 partitions is not supported".

Yes, I see your point. I guess that deep in my heart I think that this
is a fine example of software complexity exceeding the powers of Bash.
If we want to stay with Bash (we discussed this before and the bottom
line was that ReaR should be easily understandable and extensible by
admins who are supposedly most familiar with Bash) then I would ask: How
can we reduce the complexity of this topic?

So in the meantime, I'd be very happy if our configuration variables can
be used also in a simple mode. If you provide only the path then mode
and owner/group should be "sane" defaults.

Let me code something and then I think I can show  
how bash arrays (regardless of their limitations)  
are good enough for us to sufficiently fulfill  
both simplicity for the default case and  
if needed also support additional complexity.

Personally I think when there is real complexity  
nothing can make that go away or even less complex  
in particular no tool or "better programming language"  
can reduce real complexity.

I even think that "powerful" programming languages could  
make programmers too easily introduce needless complexity  
by needless complex code (like pointers to pointers to pointers  
to pointers ... or classes of classes of classes of classes ...)  
which is in the end again my favourite ultimate root cause  
of 90% of software problems:  
"It is always possible to add another level of indirection."

I will merge this on soon because it is a small step forward  
which can be merged right now regardless that it is not yet  
the final solution.

Then I will make a separated new pull request with a  
"grand cleanup and enhancement"  
of the whole "directories to be (re)-created" functionality.

@jsmeix Have just tried that code
(b213ae4ef488c60dc6bd435f93b6c04854b573a2). Some observations:

-   Running `900_create_missing_directories.sh` without having a backup
    configured (`BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE`) brings up lots of errors
    "Failed to chown ..." as `/bin/bash` is missing on the target file
    system.
-   Running IntelliJ IDEA's inspections on
    `900_create_missing_directories.sh` shows several warnings, which
    make sense to me:
    -   *'local' must be used in a function* (appears 4 times)
    -   *variables are used without any quotes* (appears 22 times, first
        example is `$directory_permissions_owner_group` which is quoted
        in line 18, but not in line 22)

@OliverO2  
what is your use-case to run "rear recover"  
without restoring at least a minimal system  
(i.e. even without /bin/bash on the target file system)?

Regarding IntelliJ IDEA's inspections:

The "'local' must be used in a function" is right  
but it is plain wrong that something is wrong here  
because the scripts are sourced by the  
Source() function in lib/framework-functions.sh  
so those 'local' variables are used in a function  
(there are tons of 'local' variables in other ReaR scripts).

Regarding variables that are used without any quotes:  
Please be helpful and do not let me search and guess  
what that "22 times" might be.  
At least the directory\_permissions\_owner\_group looks  
perfectly o.k. to me in particular because I have an  
explanatory comment there why I don't use quotes  
so IntelliJ IDEA might need to understand my comments  
before it reports false stuff ;-)

Finally I have no idea what  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b213ae4ef488c60dc6bd435f93b6c04854b573a2](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b213ae4ef488c60dc6bd435f93b6c04854b573a2)  
has to do with  
restore/default/900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh

@jsmeix  
My use case was initial testing before setting up a full restore. More
specifically, I was just verifying that partitions are set up as
intended. So I chose the option `BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE` in line with
this comment in `default.conf`:

    ##
    # BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE stuff
    ##
    # This mode stops the restore after formatting and mounting the filesystems and expects
    # the backup data to appear by miracle (e.g. you doing something).
    # I use this mode with DMZ servers that are saved with RBME (RSYNC BACKUP MADE EASY) and
    # the magical restore is just me pushing the files back via rsync/ssh. That is the reason why
    # Relax-and-Recover includes an SSH server for your convenience.

I would also use `REQUESTRESTORE` when restoring a system manually from
a historic backup which might not be available in the standard backup
repository. We use an internally developed backup/restore solution which
usually communicates with a central repository server, but can use
repositories on directly attached media, too. So the idea is to
incorporate the standard (automatic) way of restoring into one rear
image, and a non-standard manual restore option into a second rear
image.

Thanks for explaining the use of `local`, I wasn't aware of the
interdependencies. And blame me (not IntelliJ) for not having read your
comment about the unquoted variable use. Regarding the other places,
IntelliJ unfortunately has no easy way of exporting the information, so
I'll try to paste this from IntelliJ-generated HTML. Hope that helps:

Things like that are expected on an empty target system.

The various "Simple variable usage" are all false alarm  
as far as I see because I used unquoted $variable when  
its value cannot contain a space because the entries in  
$VAR\_DIR/recovery/directories\_permissions\_owner\_group  
must consist of words for directory mode owner group,
