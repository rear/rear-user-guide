I'm trying to use ReaR 2.0 to recover a RHEL7 host that boots from a SAN
disk and uses EMC powerpath for the multipathing software. I've been
going around and around trying to get it to work with no luck but then
again I am new to ReaR. Before adding configuration files, I'd like to
know if using EMC Powerpath is something that has already been looked at
and deemed not possible.

Thanks, Tom

@tomcombs SAN disks using EMC powerpath should work with ReaR v2.2 and
beyond.
