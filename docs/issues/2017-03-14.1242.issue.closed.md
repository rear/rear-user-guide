    UEFI

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I was previously using rear (v1.17.2) as installed via "yum install
    rear" on RHEL 7.3. It does not backup/restore capabilities. So I
    downloaded v2.00 and tried to run this version. It gives me this
    error. As I looked through the codes & logs, it complained because
    file, /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader, is missing.

I tried running "rear savelayout" and got the same error.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    I rolled back to v1.18, and I can now run "rear -v mkbackup"

@j100ng Please have a look at script
`/usr/share/rear/prep/default/50_guess_bootloader.sh`. I guess it cannot
find the **bootloader** because it is looking at disks not (yet) known
to the script?

Here's the output of "dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=4 | strings" as called
in /usr/share/rear/prep/default/50\_guess\_bootloader.sh .

\[jacksonl@macso1 sda\]$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=4 | strings

4+0 records out  
2048 bytes (2.0 kB) copied, 4.2139e-05 s, 48.6 MB/s  
\[jacksonl@macso1 sda\]$

So it does not show the bootloader type.  
I change the command slightly

\[jacksonl@macso1 sda\]$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=4096 count=4 | strings  
4+0 records in  
4+0 records out  
16384 bytes (16 kB) copied, 8.4453e-05 s, 194 MB/s  
EFI PART  
5y C  
\[jacksonl@macso1 sda\]$

So I created my own /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader to contain EFI.
But now I got a different error  
"ERROR: Error occurred during grub2-mkimage of BOOTX64.efi"

Is this something new?  
I had run rear v1.17.2 successfully before. However, the recovered
system does not have the proper SELinux capabilities set. Therefore, I'm
using v1.18 & up.

For me "new" is very relative. But this requirement is in ReaR for 8
months or so ...

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-287823867](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-287823867)  
shows that  
without grub2-efi-modules installed there is the  
'Unknown bootloader ()' error on RHEL 7.3.

I wonder if there could be a reliably working automated test  
in ReaR that errors out with a better matching error message like

<pre>
grub2-efi-modules needs to be installed
</pre>

@gozora  
do you think such an automatism is possible  
(with reasonable effort)?

Hello @jsmeix,

I guess you just overlooked a fact that this issue is not longer about
"unknown boot loader". See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-287808505](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-287808505).

For the second problem, ReaR ended with error: "grub2-mkimage: error:
cannot open \`/usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/moddep.lst': No such file or
directory", which is OK to my opinion.

V.

Please note that the original issue where
/usr/share/rear/prep/default/50\_guess\_bootloader.sh does not find the
bootloader info is still there. The root cause is the line

           dd if=$devname bs=512 count=4 | strings > $TMP_DIR/bootloader

had failed. The disk drive on my system needs to use 4092 instead of
512.

I initially used a workaround of manually creating the bootloader file.

I just tried a different solution and seems to work  
`        local block_size=$(get_block_size ${blockd%/*})`  
`        dd if=$devname bs=$block_size count=4 | strings > $TMP_DIR/bootloader`

@j100ng  
when you have a 50\_guess\_bootloader.sh file  
you cannot use "Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git"  
because the old two-digit files were replaced by  
now three-digit files 500\_guess\_bootloader.sh

Regardless what kind of guesswork you use,  
this is just another instance of what hurts us  
again and again:  
ReaR tries to do things silently and automacically right  
without providing final power to the user that he  
can - if needed - explicitly specify what ReaR must do, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-282252947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-282252947)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1213\#issuecomment-285618629](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1213#issuecomment-285618629)

I think I will implement support for a BOOTLOADER variable  
that is empty by default which means 500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
is used but if the user specifies BOOTLOADER his decision  
is obeyed by ReaR, cf. what I did for UEFI\_BOOTLOADER in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212)

@j100ng  
for now just keep your change in guess\_bootloader.sh  
and preferably submit it as GitHub pull request to us, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and "How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262)  
I did a first attempt to implement BOOTLOADER support.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2017-03-27 09:01](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-289394549):

@j100ng  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262)
merged  
there is now some initial support to specify BOOTLOADER  
in /etc/rear/local.conf as follows:

Setting BOOTLOADER is only meant so that the user  
can - if needed - (i.e. when autodetection fails for him)  
enforce ReaR to set up during "rear recover" one of  
the supported bootloaders i.e. one of what is listed in  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh

What is currently listed in  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh

<pre>
GRUB2-EFI
EFI
GRUB2
GRUB
ELILO
LILO
PPC
</pre>

Currently there is no validation check for a BOOTLOADER  
setting so that with unsupported bootloaders e.g. something like  
"BOOTLOADER=grubby"  
ReaR would just fail somehow somewhere, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1261](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1261)

@j100ng  
I also tried to implement your "dd .. bs=$block\_size" proposal in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-288152778](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-288152778)

I would appreciate it if you coud test ReaR  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262)
merged  
and provide feedback to what extent it now works better  
(or even worse) than before and what manual steps you  
still need to make it work for your particular case.

Many thanks in advance!

I have tested the latest version of rear from git under the following 2
scenarios:

1.  run 'rear -v mkrescue' without any pre-configuration  
    500\_guess\_bootloader correctly detected that system is EFI and
    created the necessary bootloader file

2.  run 'rear -v mkrescue' with pre-configuration in
    etc/rear/local.conf  
    I manually deleted var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader. Add
    "BOOTLOADE=EFI" into etc/rear/local.conf  
    Running the command was successful, and the correct bootloader file
    was created.

@j100ng  
many thanks for your prompt feedback!  
I assume you actually added "BOOTLOADER=EFI"  
to etc/rear/local.conf (with an 'R' at the end) because  
otherwise case (2.) would become case (1.).  
During "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" it shows you what it uses:  
When BOOTLOADER is specified in local.conf it shows  
"Using specified bootloader ..."  
otherwise it shows  
"Using sysconfig bootloader ..." or  
"Using PreP boot partition bootloader ..." (only for ppc) or  
"Using guessed bootloader ..."

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-289492981](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-289492981)  
the BOOTLOADER part of this issue is solved  
and according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-288053311](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-288053311)  
a missing grub2-efi-modules is already sufficiently reported  
so that I close the issue.
