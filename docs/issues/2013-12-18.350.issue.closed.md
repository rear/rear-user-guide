starting `rear` on a disaster recovery side (with dangling NFS mounts)
will cause `rear` to hang forever on script
`layout/save/GNU/Linux/51_current_disk_usage.sh` which contains a simple
line of code:

    df -h > $VAR_DIR/layout/config/df.txt

We better replace the `df -h` command with `df -hl` (shows only local
mounted file systems).
