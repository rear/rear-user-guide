-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

A ISO output boots,  
but when i use RAWDISK as an output it wont boot,  
stuck at the syslinux boot EDD line

-   Workaround, if any: Not Sure

@ramzcode  
what exactly do you mean  
with "stuck at the syslinux boot EDD line" ?

If you don't see further (console) output after the line

    Probing EDD (edd=off to disable)... ok

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2955\#issuecomment-1465642166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2955#issuecomment-1465642166)

Check your ReaR recovery system kernel command line arguments  
and look for "console=..." settings.

E.g. for BIOS you can get the  
ReaR recovery system kernel command line arguments  
by selecting in the ReaR recovery system boot menue  
the topmost enty of the form "Recover HOSTNAME" and then  
pressing the \[Tab\] key which shows the kernel command line.

The problem was with the syslinux 4.X version, the bootloader did not
progress further. But after installing the latest version it did work.
Now the RAWDISK boots as expected, yet to test the recovery process
further

@jsmeix It looks like the ReaR missed the Bios partition to include in
the partion layout but it has info inside the parted file. Due to this
the target has not boot partition created and GRUB2 failed to install.

    Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                 Flags
    128     1049kB  2097kB  1049kB               BIOS Boot Partition  bios_grub
     1      2097kB  16.1GB  16.1GB  xfs          Linux

Unfortunately it picked 1 partition and ignored 128 which is my BIOS
boot.

Any idea, is this expected or do am i missing anything ?

Please suggest

I never had a system with a partition number 128  
and in particular I never tried ReaR with such a system  
so I cannot comment how such a system behaves in practice.

AWS EC2 Amazon Linux 2 has this behaviour, it boots into the rescue
environment now, but the problem is that particular partition of 128 is
BIOS kind and it is not recorded by the system or by the ReaR.

This makes the system not to boot and just enter into the grub prompt
