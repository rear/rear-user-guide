This is a follow-up of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2067](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2067)  
which is fixed for its particular use case  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079)
and the subsequent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080)
were merged.

But in general btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic()  
needs some enhancements to make it work everywhere, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080\#issuecomment-472448686](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080#issuecomment-472448686)  
and subsequent comments.

In particular the curent btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic()  
makes diskrestore.sh fail on older systems where  
`btrfs subvolume set-default` needs two arguments, see

@jsmeix  
The remaining underlying issue
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080\#issuecomment-472458530](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080#issuecomment-472458530))
has been resolved by PR \#2119 on May 2, 2019, which is part of ReaR
2.6.

It seems like we could transition to `btrfs_subvolumes_setup_generic` by
default now. The next step would then be to remove the duplicate SLES
implementation.

As far as I remember my latest tests on SLES with its default btrfs
structure  
failed with `btrfs_subvolumes_setup_generic` so we cannot remove  
the special SLES implementation.  
I won't spend much time on this issue.  
The special SLES implementation works for the special SLES default btrfs
structure  
so why change something that works?

What can be enhaced (if needed) to make btrfs steup work better  
out of the box on various different Linux distributions is the part to  
`# Call the right btrfs_subvolumes_setup_* function for the btrfs filesystem ...`  
in layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133\_include\_mount\_filesystem\_code.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133\_include\_mount\_filesystem\_code.sh\#L76](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133_include_mount_filesystem_code.sh#L76)

None of the BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP  
and BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP arrays are described in default.conf  
so we are free to andapt and enhance things as needed (if needed).

I think via the code in layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh
that  
`# Save the updated BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP array variable ... into the rescue.conf file`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh\#L514](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh#L514)  
the special SLES implementation is enforced where needed  
so that using the generic code by default should not break things on
SLES.

At some time in the future a really generic implementation would be done
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2510](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2510)  
which is where I spend now most of my time - at least for now to do some
research.

True some time ago, but this was fixed since.

To me it looks like we can. The "generic" implementation should work
just fine on any configuration of SLES.

1.  `btrfs_subvolumes_setup_generic` is complete and so much simpler.
    You wrote in
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079\#issuecomment-471958783](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079#issuecomment-471958783):

    > Of course the goal is to have only one implementation that is
    > functionally complete and simple and straightforward.

2.  `btrfs_subvolumes_setup_generic` fixes \#2067 (Restoring Btrfs file
    system fails if a snapshot has been used for rollback). A
    non-working restore is a worst-case-scenario, which could happen
    anytime to anyone using Btrfs. Currently, ReaR out of the box comes
    without a fix for this issue. Possibly no one knows the secret
    configuration change required to address this.

I cannot say how this relates to \#2510. I guess we just have to see
what the design will be. But it looks this will take some time. In the
meantime ReaR should not ship with a known restore defect. Btrfs slowly
but steadily seems to gain more traction, as even Fedora now defaults to
Btrfs.
