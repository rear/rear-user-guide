-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I tested `rear mkrescue` `rear -v mkrescue` `rear -d mkrescue`
    `rear -D mkrescue`  
    on my homeoffice laptop and I think the content in the log is now
    less confusing  
    for the user in particular in normal modes (i.e. `rear mkrescue`
    `rear -v mkrescue`).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Normally stdout and stderr are redirected to /dev/null.  
    Only in debug modes stdout and stderr are redirected to the log.

With the current changes the log file contents look good to me when I
run  
`rear mkrescue` `rear -v mkrescue` `rear -d mkrescue`
`rear -D mkrescue`  
on my homeoffice laptop.

I will also adapt the documenation according to the changed verbose mode
behaviour  
when there are no objections against the actual code changes here.

When there are no objections until tomorrow noon  
I would like to merge this noticeable change tomorrow afternoon  
so that users who use our ReaR master code would test it  
and provide feedback if there are issues with this changes.

With recent commits here I adapted the documenation according to the
changed verbose mode behaviour.  
If there are no objections right now I will merge it in about one hour.
