Now the Source function tries using $SHARE\_DIR/$source\_file  
as fallback if $source\_file does not exist so that no longer the  
full path is required to include a file from $SHARE\_DIR.  
E.g. instead of

<pre>
Source "$SHARE_DIR/wrapup/default/99_copy_logfile.sh"
</pre>

one can now use

<pre>
Source "wrapup/default/99_copy_logfile.sh"
</pre>

and the Source function will automatically fall back  
including $SHARE\_DIR/wrapup/default/99\_copy\_logfile.sh  
(provided wrapup/default/99\_copy\_logfile.sh does not exist).

Won't this change add a *lot* of Debug output? Especially if we change
the `SourceStage()` code to actually use the feature?

Another thing: Now this function depends on the `pwd` of the place where
it is called. IMHO this is quite dangerous and IIRC we avoid depending
on the `pwd` in ReaR so far.

In line with this maybe another version of the same idea would solve
your problem: If the argument to `Source()` is a relative path then we
prepend `$SHARE_DIR` and if it is an absolute path then we call it
as-is. That way you get your goal of not writing a full path and we
still don't depend on the `pwd`.

What do you think?

@schlomo  
I fully agree with your reasoning.  
I close this pull request for now and make a different one  
according to what you suggested.
