-   How was this pull request tested?

Ran a backup ensuring that there is not enough space in the destination
to write backup.tar.gz.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Commit 2674807 removed the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_OPTIONS="cat" which
breaks  
the exit code logic because pipes\_rc and backup\_prog\_shortnames does
no  
longer match.

Ensure that the number of elements in both variables are alwas the same.

What I like more with your implementation here  
compared to my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2472](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2472)  
is that this one here avoids the useless use of cat as dummy.

Now I am wondering if we could also get rid of the useless use of `dd`  
in the other default case when the backup should not be split  
with reasonable effort.

On the other hand  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2265](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2265)  
means a complete cleanup of both 500\_make\_backup.sh  
and 400\_restore\_backup.sh needs to be done at some time anyway.

I wonder if that overall cleanup should be done now or if it is better
for now  
to not change too much now at once in an hurry and only fix things as
they  
have been known to work which I tried via

I'm not against a deep overhauling but I'd prefer to do it in baby
steps.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow morning provided there are no
objections.
