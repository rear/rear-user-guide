Without checking the details here  
I think this might cause a severe behavioural change  
because this pull request changes  
"first create new stuff, then remove old stuff"  
to  
"first remove old stuff, then create new stuff".

So it may happen that old stuff was already removed  
but then it fails to create new stuff so nothing is left.

I worry that with the change here one may have no backup left.

In general I am against functionality in ReaR that deals with backups  
(like USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR or NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY)  
because in general any user data is sacrosanct and  
in particular the user's backups are even more sacrosanct  
so ReaR should only call a tool to make or restore a backup  
but ReaR should not deal with backups.

Personally I would drop all functionality in ReaR that deals with
backups  
but I cannot do this because this would be backward incompatible  
so I leave such functionality as is and I try hard to not touch it.

Without checking the details here  
I think the current behaviour is no "bug" but intentional  
(but I am not at all an expert in this specific area of ReaR)  
while the impact of this change could be really a "high" risk.

@jsmeix I agree with you, I didn't thought about loosing all the backups
in the USB drive, what can be undesirable at all... so... I'm retiring
that PR.

@ivarmu  
thank you for your prompt reply.

By the way:

I blindly guess (without checking the details here)  
that the current code does not sufficiently test  
whether or not it is actually safe to remove old stuff,  
cf. the section "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

At least on first glance I don't see appropriate checks  
e.g. a check that tests that there actually is new stuff.  
On first glance it seems it works just because it keeps  
by default the two (by default USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=2)  
topmost directories of the

    ls -dt $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/rear/$HOSTNAME/*

output regardless whether or not there is new stuff  
so when there is no new stuff it keeps the old stuff as is.

In general see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular those excerpts

    ReaR only calls an external tool that does the backup of the files
    during "rear mkbackup" ... (by default that tool is 'tar').
    ...
    It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent ...
    ...
    It is your task to ensure your backups are kept save
    at a sufficiently secure place ...
    ...
    There is basically nothing in ReaR that deals in any further way
    with what to do with the backup
    ...
    After a "rear mkbackup" run the user has to do on his own
    whatever is appropriate in his particular environment
    how to further deal with the backup

Bottom line:  
Don't blindly rely on ReaR to do "the right thing" with your backups.  
Better safe (your backups to a really safe place) than sorry.

In particular the place where ReaR writes to  
(e.g. a NFS share or a USB disk or anything else)  
is not a really safe place to keep old backups.
