#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.5

Hi,

i have come across the same situation as discussed in issue \#1952

It seems the Hardware System in this case has two raid controllers which
in case define two raid levels.  
For some reason, it appears that this configuration looks to REAR like a
Multipath setup, even tho multipath -ll does  
not show any output.

It results in a behavior, where the local disks are excluded from the
disklayout.conf during backup:

> 2020-08-13 11:53:26.163129805 Saving disk partitions.  
> 2020-08-13 11:53:26.168784050 Ignoring sda: it is a path of a
> multipath device  
> 2020-08-13 11:53:26.173146596 Ignoring sdb: it is a path of a
> multipath device

thus, the recovery fails because needed disk entries in disklayout.conf
are missing entirely.

The relevant code is in:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh\#L383](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh#L383)

Unfortunatley that means, that not even a commented out version of the
disk configuration is added  
to disklayout.conf (which would make recovery easy) but also,
AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH='n' does not  
work in such configurations.

The "multipath -l" command on the system does not output anything, so i
think the following statement is the one that might result in the
multipath check function to return true:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh\#L705](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh#L705)

I will request debug logfile.

@abbbi  
you use ReaR 2.5  
but
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2298](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2298)  
was fixed via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2299](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2299)  
for ReaR 2.6  
cf.
