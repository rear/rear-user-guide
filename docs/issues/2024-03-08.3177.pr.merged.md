-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    High impact where needed.  
    No impact esewhere.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

Triggred by my experiments in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175)  
how 'tar' behaves when exact same files or directories  
are provided as 'tar' arguments to be archived.

-   How was this pull request tested?

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-1985907542](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-1985907542)  
But I did not yet test "rear recover".

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/global-functions.sh added a  
new unique\_unsorted() function  
that outputs lines in STDIN or in a file  
without subsequent duplicate lines  
which keeps the ordering of the lines.

@jsmeix there is `sort -u` added in \#3175 , isn't that enough? Should
be, unless we require preserving the order - do we? To us (me and
@lzaoral ) it seemed that the order is quite unpredictable / random
anyway.

I want to preserve the ordering to be on the safe side.

I have no real-world use-case why the ordering is important.

It is just my gut feeling that in some special cases  
the ordering could be crucial because for 'tar'  
the ordering of the arguments does make a difference  
(what is stored where in the archive) and in some special  
cases that could be crucial.

Only what comes to my mind offhandedly right now:

    # tar -czf fullbackup.tgz / /database

might behave rather different during restore compared to

    # tar -czf fullbackup.tgz /database /

(under the assumption that /database is on its own filesystem)  
i.e.  
first the basic system gets restored (some Gigabytes),  
then the database gets restored (some Terabytes)  
versus  
first the the database gets restored (some Terabytes),  
then the basic system gets restored (some Gigabytes)

As an exercise for the reader:  
For both cases estimate the probability  
that restore of the basic system fails  
;-)

Sigh!  
I guess it is ReaR's careless code why  
the order is quite unpredictable / random anyway  
when one leaves such things to ReaR's automatism  
and that is one reason behind why I implemented  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
to provide "final power to the user".

So

    BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE="yes"
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( / /database )

versus

    BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE="yes"
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /database / )

(under the assumption that /database is on its own filesystem)  
should behave rather different during restore  
but I did not test it - something to do for next week.

I avoid false expectations about this pull request:  
This one does not help when when a filesystem/btrfs subvolume  
is mounted more than once at different mountpoint directories  
because this one only skips exactly same duplicated arguments  
what 'tar' and 'rsync' should archive so this pull request  
is meant only to help when by accident exactly same arguments  
are provided more than once to 'tar' and 'rsync'.

I think it can never be needed that same arguments  
are provided more than once to 'tar' and 'rsync'  
so I think it is (hopefully) safe to always ignore  
exactly same duplicated arguments.

@jsmeix I would characterize it as a way to avoid `sort -u` in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175)
and thus preserve the order of tar arguments in cases where the order
matters ( e.g. explicit `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE` setting ). Correct me if I
am wrong.

Great @schlomo I had independently exactly the same idea for the
function's name!

Thank you for the better function name!  
I will use `uniq_unsorted`

I was thinking about a shorter function name  
that still clearly tells what that function does  
but had no better idea than the long verbose name.

I am wondering if an even better function name  
could be `unique_unsorted` with spelled out 'unique'  
to make it more clear that this function  
is something "on its own" which is in particular  
not a wrapper or some enhanced reimplementation  
of the `uniq` program (with all its options)?

And in general I don't like old \*nix style  
crppld wrds lk 'uniq\_usrtd' ;-)

For now I kept the if check for a filename argument  
because in the STDIN case I like to timeout after 5 seconds  
when there is nothing at STDIN or when STDIN does not get closed  
to avoid that 'awk' waits endlessly for (further) input  
which would make ReaR behave as if it hung up, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#beware-of-the-emptiness](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#beware-of-the-emptiness)

@schlomo  
I assume all this can be implemented in a single case  
but I would need time to find out how to do that properly.  
If a proper implementation in a single case  
is obvious to you, please show it to me here.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I will merge it today  
a bit after 15:00 CEST (13:00 UTC).

Looks good to me.

Maybe silly question:

`awk "..." "$@"` doesn't work? It would save you the if clause

@schlomo  
I merged it "as is" because I had tested that at least a bit  
and - at least currently - I don't find time to test a rather  
different implementation.

Furthermore I would have to think about  
if a check if stdin is a tty makes sense, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3177\#discussion\_r1562435947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3177#discussion_r1562435947)  
and if yes if then it helps to have the stdin case  
well separated from the "input from file" case,  
cf. RFC 1925 item (5)

    It is always possible to aglutenate [sic] multiple separate problems
    into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases
    this is a bad idea.
