Hello @jsmeix,  
in
[SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/81757d40349eac2b2c4f7f827f630892f5bef509/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf)
and
[SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/81757d40349eac2b2c4f7f827f630892f5bef509/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf)

    # Files in btrfs subvolumes are excluded by 'tar --one-file-system'
    # so that such files must be explicitly included to be in the backup.
    # Files in the following SLE12-SP1 and SP2 default btrfs subvolumes are
    # in the below example not included to be in the backup
    #   /.snapshots/*  /var/crash/*
    # but files in /home/* are included to be in the backup.
    # You may use a command like
    #   findmnt -n -r -t btrfs | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash' | sed -e "s/$/\/*'/" -e "s/^/'/" | tr '\n' ' '

As I'm far from being btrfs expert, I've used yours `findmnt` command
without problems until now.  
Let me illustrate the problem on following example:  
I have `/home` as btrfs subvolume which is included via:

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/usr/local/*' '/boot/grub2/i386-pc/*' '/var/spool/*' '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' '/var/lib/machines/*' '/var/lib/mailman/*' '/var/log/*' '/tmp/*' '/var/opt/*' '/var/lib/pgsql/*' '/var/cache/*' '/var/lib/named/*' '/opt/*' '/home/*' '/var/tmp/*' '/srv/*' '/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi/*' '/var/lib/mariadb/*' '/var/lib/mysql/*' )

With **BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE** set like this and content of */home* as
follows:

    sp2:~ # ls -alR /home
    /home:
    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  52 Jan 27 11:18 .
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 154 Dec 12 16:57 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  26 Jan 27 10:27 .password
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  20 Jan 27 10:28 placeholder
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  24 Jan 27 11:18 secret

    /home/secret:
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 24 Jan 27 11:18 .
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 52 Jan 27 11:18 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20 Jan 27 11:18 .secret_file

/home/.password will not be backed up because */home/\** does not
represent files that beginning with dot.  
Not sure if this is a big deal or not and how many people used this
example but in my opinion this could backfire in some scenarios.

btw, I did some tests and end up with following configuration directive
working fine:

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( $(findmnt -n -r -t btrfs | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash' ) )

So I have two questions:

1.  Why did you go the extra mile with
    `findmnt ... | sed -e "s/$/\/*'/" -e "s/^/'/" | tr '\n' ' '` and did
    not directly used `findmnt ...` command to expand to
    **BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE** ?
2.  Don't you think that asterisk (\*) should be removed from examples
    as it omits files that begin with dot in subvolume root?

The main important part of that stuff is that it is only a comment

<pre>
# You may use a command like
#   findmnt -n -r -t btrfs ...
# to generate the values
</pre>

where the "you may use \[something\] like" should indicate that the
user  
should care what is actually the right one for his particular needs.

Nevertheless such a comment should not mislead the user  
and I agree to improve it.

I cannot remember why I used the `/directory/*` form  
and not simply `/directory/` or even only `/directory`.  
I guess at that time I was somehow confused  
by tar's own internal pattern matching, cf.  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html\#SEC113](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#SEC113)  
that reads in particular

<pre>
These two pairs of member lists are used
in the following operations:
`--diff', `--extract', `--list', `--update'.

There are no inclusion members in
create mode (`--create' and `--append'),
since in this mode the names obtained
from the command line refer to files,
not archive members.
</pre>

versus bash file name globbing that seems to be applied  
according to how tar is called in  
backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

<pre>
... -c -f - $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) ...
</pre>

so that the contents of the backup-include.txt file  
(which are basically the elements of the BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE array)  
appear 'as is' on the tar command line so that the  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE array values get evaluated  
by bash file name globbing (with "nullglob" set in usr/sbin/rear  
which can have sometimes unexpected "interesting effects"  
but here ist seems o.k.) - as far as I currently understand the code.

On my SLE10, SLE11, and SLE12 systems  
tar behaves consistent as follows:

<pre>
# mkdir /foo

# echo foo >/foo/foo

# echo '.foo' >/foo/.foo

# mkdir /foobar

# echo foobar >/foobar/foobar

# echo '.foobar' >/foobar/.foobar

# find /foo*
/foo
/foo/foo
/foo/.foo
/foobar

# ( echo '/foo/*' >/tmp/files ; set -x ; tar -cv $( cat /tmp/files ) | tar -tv )

</pre>

Because it seems tar works as expected with plain directory names  
I change the comment accordingly.

But I am against autogenerated entries in the  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE array by default  
which would get all currently existing btrfs subvolumes  
automatically into the backup because there are  
certain tools that generate whatever btrfs subvolumes,  
e.g. docker cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1496](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1496)

<pre>
... I'd like to convince ReaR to just ignore anything
that looks like a docker-generated subvolume
(snapshot or not). AFAIK, these btrfs docker-trees
cannot be safely restored anyway in a consistent fashion.
</pre>

Therefore having automatically all existing btrfs subvolumes  
in the backup could suddenly blow up the backup by tons of  
unexpected/unwanted stuff.

It is my assumption that usually the user prefers  
to specify which btrfs subvolumes he actually wants  
to have in his backup (i.e. "whitelisting").

For example in the ...-btrfs-example.conf files /tmp and /var/tmp  
are listed in the BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE example array  
but the user must decide if he really wants to have them  
in his backup.

Hello @jsmeix

Thanks for comprehensive answer!

I was just wondering if there is a technical problem with such automatic
approach. If only concern here is right backup content that would make
my life easier ;-).  
I have currently task to somehow automate btrfs subvolume includes into
ReaR, because explicitly setting includes for each and every subvolume
causes headaches when managed across &gt; 1000 servers.  
Using `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( findmnt ...)` directly, is a good starting
point how this could be solved.

Thanks!

V.

There is no technical problem with such automatic approach  
because basically all files in ReaR are bash scripts.  
E.g. also /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf and /etc/rear/local.conf  
are sourced (and executed) as bash scripts.

But there is the problem that nobody can fully imagine  
how particular things in a bash sctipt actually evaluate  
on a real system - unless one tries it out ;-)

Cf. the comment in default.conf:

<pre>
# Some variables are actually bash arrays and should be treated with care.
# Use VAR=() to set an empty array.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" 'value' ) to add a fixed value to an array.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" "$var" ) to add a variable value to an array.
# Whether or not the latter case works as intended depends on when and
# how "$var" is set and evaluated by the Relax-and-Recover scripts.
# Be careful with values that are globbing patterns (cf. COPY_AS_IS below).
# In general using ${VAR[*]} is problematic and using ${VAR[@]} without
# double-quotes is also problematic, see 'Arrays' in "man bash" and
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068 for some examples.
...
# Files and directories to copy as-is (with tar) into the ReaR recovery system.
# Usually globbing patterns in COPY_AS_IS are specified without quoting
# like COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /my/directory/* /path/to/my/files* )
# so that the bash pathname expansion works as usually intended
# (for details see the build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh script).
# Because usr/sbin/rear sets the nullglob option globbing patterns
# like /path/to/my/files* expand to nothing if no file matches.
COPY_AS_IS=( $SHARE_DIR $VAR_DIR )
</pre>

Enjoy the "warm feeling" in quoting hell ;-)

Yes, I'll do lot of testing on this topic in upcoming weeks.

> Enjoy the "warm feeling" in quoting hell ;-)

I'm really looking forward for all the quoting already :-)

As I currently know everything I needed, I guess we can close this
issue!

Thanks again for your help!

I consider this issue to be sufficiently fixed.

I verified on SLES12-SP2 with before

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/usr/local/*' '/var/spool/*' '/var/tmp/*' '/boot/grub2/i386-pc/*' '/tmp/*' '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' '/var/lib/mailman/*' '/var/cache/*' '/var/lib/machines/*' '/var/lib/mysql/*' '/opt/*' '/home/*' '/var/lib/named/*' '/var/opt/*' '/srv/*' '/var/lib/pgsql/*' '/var/log/*' '/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi/*' '/var/lib/mariadb/*' )
</pre>

versus now with

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /usr/local /var/spool /var/tmp /boot/grub2/i386-pc /tmp /var/lib/libvirt/images /var/lib/mailman /var/cache /var/lib/machines /var/lib/mysql /opt /home /var/lib/named /var/opt /srv /var/lib/pgsql /var/log /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi /var/lib/mariadb )
</pre>

that it works well now - in particular in the latter case  
there are no unexpected additional files in the backup.

A positive side effect of the new way is that the logged tar command in
backup.log  
is now much shorter because with plain directories in
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
nothing gets expanded by bash file name globbing (i.e. the logged tar
command  
contains the BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE array values "as is").

@gozora  
for even more fun of mind confusion with that stuff,  
see my documentation about  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
in current ReaR GitHub master code default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE is an array of strings
# that get written into a backup-exclude.txt file
# that is used e.g. in 'tar -X backup-exclude.txt'
# to get things excluded from the backup.
# Proper quoting of the BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array
# members is crucial to avoid bash expansions.
# In /etc/rear/local.conf use
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/this/*' '/that/*' )
...
# BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE is an array of strings
# that get written into a backup-include.txt file
# that is used e.g. in 'tar -c $(cat backup-include.txt)'
# to get things included in the backup.
# Proper quoting of the BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE array
# members is crucial to avoid bash expansions.
# In /etc/rear/local.conf use
# BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/this/*' '/that/*' )
</pre>

Of course when no bash globbing charaters are used  
quoting is not needed.

But it seems there could be a crucial difference  
when bash globbing charaters are used  
between how BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE is used for 'tar'  
versus how BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE is used for 'tar'  
because I think  
the array members of BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE are 'tar' patterns cf.  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html\#SEC113](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#SEC113)  
while in contrast the array members of BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
are bash globbing patterns, cf. my "tar behaves..." in the above
