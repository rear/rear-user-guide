Hi,

on every server I have the problem that  
/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXX/outputfs/servername/ is not empty,  
because of the file ".lockfile", so rmdir is never successful (see
\#298)

The solution of \#298 was to add `rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs`  
in function `cleanup_build_area_and_end_program()`  
in usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh  
but this lead to problems mentioned in \#465,  
so it was changed to `rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2`

Looking at function cleanup\_build\_area\_and\_end\_program() in
usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh:

    ...
       # line below put in comment due to issue #465
       #rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs
       rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2
       # in worst case it could not umount; so before remove the BUILD_DIR check if above outputfs is  gone
       mount | grep -q "$BUILD_DIR/outputfs"
       if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
          # still mounted it seems
          LogPrint "Directory $BUILD_DIR/outputfs still mounted - trying lazy umount"  
          sleep 2
          umount -f -l $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2
          rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2
       fi
       rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR >&2
    fi
    Log "End of program reached"

Wouldn't it be better to drop the first  
`rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2`  
and to add  
`rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs`  
in case $BUILD\_DIR/outputfs is not mounted?

    ... 
       # line below put in comment due to issue #465
       #rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs
       # in worst case it could not umount; so before remove the BUILD_DIR check if above outputfs is gone
       mount | grep -q "$BUILD_DIR/outputfs"
       if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
            # still mounted it seems
            LogPrint "Directory $BUILD_DIR/outputfs still mounted - trying lazy umount"
            sleep 2
            umount -f -l $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2
            rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs >&2
       else 
            # not mounted so we can safely delete $BUILD_DIR/outputfs
            rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs
       fi
       rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR >&2
    fi
    Log "End of program reached"

So if $BUILD\_DIR/outputfs is not mounted,  
then `rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs` can safely be used,  
otherwise `rmdir $v $BUILD_DIR/outputfs` would be used.

What do you think?

@goldzahn good thinking - why not. Will you prepare a pull request for
this? Thank you for your proposal of a proper fix for the issues around
the cleanup of the temporary directory
