I am not a Bareos user so I cannot actually help  
with Bareos specific issues.

From what I notice at first glance in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/14787463/rear-VL-BPCACSAPP01.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/14787463/rear-VL-BPCACSAPP01.log)  
(excerpts)

    + source /usr/share/rear/restore/BAREOS/default/400_restore_backup.sh
    ...
    ++ mkdir /mnt/local/var/lib/bareos
    mkdir: cannot create directory '/mnt/local/var/lib/bareos': No such file or directory

    ...

    + source /usr/share/rear/restore/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh
    ...
    mkdir: created directory 'etc'
    ...
    ++ chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login -c 'chown -v root:root etc'
    chroot: failed to run command '/bin/bash': No such file or directory

    ...

    + source /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh
    ...
    ++ test -f /mnt/local//boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi
    ++ LogPrintError 'Failed to create EFI Boot Manager entries (UEFI bootloader '\''/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi'\'' not found under target /mnt/local)'

it seems the Bareos backup or the restore was incomplete  
because it looks as if basic directories are missing  
in the recreated system under /mnt/local  
like /mnt/local/var/lib and /mnt/local/etc  
(and many more that 900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh shows)  
and also /bin/bash seems to be missing  
in the recreated system under /mnt/local  
and finally also /mnt/local/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi  
seems to be missing in the recreated system.

Did you actually do what the Bareos restore script  
/usr/share/rear/restore/BAREOS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
tells you to do

    Please verify that the backup has been restored correctly to '/mnt/local'
    in the provided shell. When finished, type exit in the shell to continue
    recovery.
