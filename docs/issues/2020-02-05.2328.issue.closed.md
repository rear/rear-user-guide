#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    Centos 7

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    OTUPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=file:///mnt/REAR

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

    multipath (DM or NVMe):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I mounted the external HDD to my physical machine on /mnt and taken
    the backup under REAR directory backup done successfully. I burn ISO
    on cd and boot from iso and attached the external HDD to my new
    physical server but relax and recovery iso not detecting the
    external disk. So I shifted my backup.tar.gz to nfs but now I am
    unable to change BACKUP\_URL path under bootable disk because iso in
    read-only mode. Please share the solution for the same.

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"

@prasad9920  
I do not understand your situation.  
In particular I do not understand why you like to change the ISO.

When you booted the ReaR rescue/recovery system  
(regardless how you booted it, form ISO, via PXE, whatever)  
the ReaR recovery system runs in a ramdisk on the  
computer where you had booted it.

In the running recovery system you can change whatever you like.  
I.e. after you had logged in as 'root' but before you launch
`rear recover`.  
In particular you can change `/etc/rear/local.conf` in the recovery
system  
before you launch `rear recover`.

The limitation is what files and programs  
you have included in the recovery system,  
i.e. what functionality is possible within the  
running recovery system, e.g. whether or not  
you can access something on a remote host  
via this or that network protocol.

What files and programs get included in the recovery system  
is determined while "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" is run.  
So it would be a dead end if you can change `/etc/rear/local.conf`  
in the running recovery system to something where files and programs  
would be needed that had not been included in the recovery system.

@prasad9920  
In the running recovery system you can also do whatever you like  
before you launch `rear recover`, e.g. whatever actions and  
commands you need to make an external disk accessible.

In particular with `BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/REAR`  
you would have to manually mount that needed thing  
in the running recovery system at `/mnt/REAR`  
before you launch `rear recover`.

Hi Johannes,

Thanks for help. Got confused with vi editor now able to change the file
no issue. sorry for trouble. Once again thanks for help.

@prasad9920  
thank you for your feedback how you made it work.  
It helps us to understand if ReaR works reasonably well  
or if we may need to do some further improvements.

Hi Johannes,

One more query I am taking backup from HP DL360 Gen 9 server details as
under

ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2

OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
/etc/os-release"):  
Oracle Linux 6.6

ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
/etc/rear/local.conf"):

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.1.100/nfs_share/pcrf1
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/Logs' )

when I started the backup it was showing good speed around 8-9 mbps but
after 2GB data backup slowly speed was getting down around 300-400 kbps.
how to troubleshoot further where is the issue?  
I checked the connectivity between backup server and nfs it is good.

@prasad9920  
as far as I can imagine ReaR has no direct influence  
on any kind of speed, regardless if it is local disk speed  
or network speed or memory I/O speed and so on...

E.g. with `BACKUP_URL=nfs://...` ReaR mounts the NFS share  
at a local mountpoint directory and then things therein are  
accessed as in any other directory and speed depends on  
how NFS behaves.

In particular regarding NFS there is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L566](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L566)

    # BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the mount options, do not confuse with BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS=

so you can use `BACKUP_OPTIONS` to specify NFS mount options  
that might help with NFS issues, for an example see

    # BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the NFS mount options and
    # with 'mount -o nolock' no rpc.statd (plus rpcbind) are needed:
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

@prasad9920  
could you provide feedback how excatly you made it work  
because I am interested what special settings  
have helped in this or that particular cases, cf.

Sorry but issue yet not resolved so we changed our plan to create the vm
using vmware converter P2V. may be I will reproduce same issue in local
lab and test the same but thanks for help never ever got such response
before on community support. Really appreciated. Thanks again for help.

@prasad9920  
a general side note regarding things like "P2V":

When your original system is running on bare metal and  
you like to recreate that system on a VMware virtual machine  
you do actually a migration from bare metal to VMware.

In general migrating with ReaR could become a complicated task  
depending on how much the replacement system is different  
compared to the original system.

Regarding migrating a system with ReaR see for example  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html)  
and follow the links therein.
