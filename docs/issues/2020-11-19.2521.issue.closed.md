The "timestamp.txt" file was removed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/eca18f9459ea78d440061e005c35713918985ecd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/eca18f9459ea78d440061e005c35713918985ecd)  
where differential backup was re-implemeted as a precondition  
to get real incremental backup implemented, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1062\#issuecomment-259958396](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1062#issuecomment-259958396)

See the descriptions about incremental and/or differential backup  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf in particular the part at
`BACKUP_TYPE`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1147](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1147)

The "timestamp.txt" file was an implementation detail  
that was never meant to be officially used by users.  
Of course users can use implementation details  
but they may change or go away at any time.

Now the timestams are "encoded" in the different backup file names.  
That is also described in default.conf at `BACKUP_TYPE`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1159](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1159)
