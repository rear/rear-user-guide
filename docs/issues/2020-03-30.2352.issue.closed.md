-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git
-   System architecture: x86
-   Description of the issue:

When using a backup method which is not part of the rear distribution,
`rear mkrescue` fails with

    ERROR: The BACKUP method 'INTERNAL' is not known to ReaR.
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 035_valid_backup_methods.sh:
      2020-03-30 23:13:34.319009171 Including prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh

-   Possibly related to: 8eb72c1d845d2b91fa76f18d47c74454ed5432ec

-   Solution: Instead of checking the contents of `default.conf` for
    lines looking like `BACKUP=<method>`, a more fail-safe solution
    would be to check for the existence of `$SHARE_DIR/backup/<method>`.

How `BACKUP=INTERNAL`is used is described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353\#issuecomment-606585731](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353#issuecomment-606585731)  
that reads in particular

    Yes, there is no INTERNAL backup method in ReaR
    as it's just what I'm using over here.
    Actually, I have these directories, which integrate nicely
    with ReaR updates as there is no common code:

    backup/INTERNAL
    build/INTERNAL
    prep/INTERNAL
    restore/INTERNAL

    Configuration is done entirely via one line in site.conf:

    BACKUP=INTERNAL

so this issue here is fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e98c8adcd75d043672bbed9564bedef377d9639e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e98c8adcd75d043672bbed9564bedef377d9639e)  
because now prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
tests for a `$SHARE_DIR/restore/$BACKUP` directory  
that exists in this particular case here.
