    When tar exits with status greater than zero rear copies the last three
    tar messages from backup.log to its own log. Those lines are also shown
    to the user when rear is invoked with the "-v" option.

    Some tar messages, however, are purely informational, e.g.

        tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
        tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
        tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/discard: socket ignored

    Strip the informational messages and show only actual errors, e.g.

        tar: /etc/grub.d/README: file changed as we read it

@casantos  
could it ever happen that tar exits with exit code 1  
only because of things like

    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/discard: socket ignored

but without anything like

    tar: /etc/grub.d/README: file changed as we read it

?

If yes I won't accept it to suppress messages that would explain to the
user  
that "tar exits with exit code 1" is actually false alarm.

For example  
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1865697](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1865697)  
shows (excerpts)

    # rear -v mkbackup
    ...
    WARNING: tar ended with return code 1 and below output:
      ---snip---
      tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/qmgr: socket ignored
      tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/flush: socket ignored
      tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/showq: socket ignored
      ----------
    This means that files have been modified during the archiving
    process. As a result the backup may not be completely consistent
    or may not be a perfect copy of the system. Relax-and-Recover
    will continue, however it is highly advisable to verify the
    backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system.

The question is if "tar ended with return code 1" only because of

    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/qmgr: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/flush: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/showq: socket ignored

or if there was also an actual issue that is only visible in the backup
log file.

Perhaps the actual root cause is the `| tail -n3` pipe  
that suppresses useful information to be shown directly to the user.

What is also missing is an information where the backup log file is  
that the user needs to inspect to see what actually happened.

Why exactly 3 lines and not e.g. the `tail` default of 10 lines?

Ten lines would still potentially hide the relevant output. In my test,
for instance, the `tar` output is this:

    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    tar: /etc/grub.d/README: file changed as we read it
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    tar: /var/lib/gssproxy/default.sock: socket ignored

No. The "socket ignored" and "Removing leading \`/' from..." messages
are purely informational and tar exits with status if these are the only
messages sent, e.g.

    # tar -cf -  /var/spool/postfix/ > /dev/null
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/discard: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/local: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/virtual: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/anvil: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/scache: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/tlsmgr: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/rewrite: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/bounce: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/defer: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/trace: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/verify: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/proxymap: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/proxywrite: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/private/smtp: socket ignored

    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/pickup: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/cleanup: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/qmgr: socket ignored
    tar: /var/spool/postfix/public/flush: socket ignored

@casantos  
thank you for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2466\#issuecomment-668553552](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2466#issuecomment-668553552)

Now I see and understand.

I agree we need to filter out purely informational tar messages  
to make those tar messages that show the reason for exit code 1  
more easily visible for the user.

I am wondering if we should also omit the `tail -n3` pipe  
so that all tar messages that show reasons for exit code 1  
are directly visible to the user.

Or at least show more than only three lines  
and in this case tell the user that the output is truncated.

This is dangerous, since the output is captured in a shell string to be
printed. A large number of errors can lead bash to crash.

This seems to be a the most reasonable approach.

I just noticed that the fix must be applied to the `else` branch of that
`if` too. Updating the commit.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2466/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2466/files)  
shows that now also `doc/rear.8` is changed which is unrelated.

Furthermore we have  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2265](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2265)

Meanwhile I see what I did wrong via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2674807f6ad48da80b193ae977d345ad2ef5fdd1](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2674807f6ad48da80b193ae977d345ad2ef5fdd1)  
because I removed the `BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS="cat"`  
which breaks the exit code logic around
`pipes_rc=( ${PIPESTATUS[@]} )`  
because `backup_prog_shortnames` does no longer match.

So I need to fix that first by another pull request and by the way I
will  
also integrate what this pull requests intends to do.

Don't worry, I already have a fix for this too.
