By chance I noticed

I know basically nothing about GitHub Actions  
so I can neither check nor verify whether or not  
all those GitHub Actions that are run for ReaR are safe.

In particular I worry about those GitHub Actions  
that produce so called "binaries" from our ReaR sources  
like RPM packages which could be installed by users.  
Is it safe for our users to install  
those "binaries" on their systems?  
Will those "binaries" always contain only our  
unmodified ReaR sources (i.e. same as "git clone")  
or might those "binaries" contain modified ReaR sources?
