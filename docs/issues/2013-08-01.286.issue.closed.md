\`Hi,

I'm trying to backup a live Centos 5.2 system which is using a HP smart
array. I'm not sure why, but I can see parted running trying to access
/dev/hda. I thought it should be using /dev/cciss/c0d0 so I don't know
where it get /dev/hda from! The result is rear -v mkbackup just hangs!!

`fdisk -l` shows:

    Disk /dev/cciss/c0d0: 72.8 GB, 72833679360 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 8854 cylinders
    Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

               Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
    /dev/cciss/c0d0p1   *           1          13      104391   83  Linux
    /dev/cciss/c0d0p2              14        2213    17671500   8e  Linux LVM
    /dev/cciss/c0d0p3            2214        5253    24418800   8e  Linux LVM

Can I force rear to use /dev/cciss/c0d0 ? or is there a better
solution?  
Thanks

Paul

Could it be that `/dev/hda`is your CD-ROM drive?

Yes, you are correct. How can I stop rear from trying to access?  
Thank you

Looking a dmesg I can see there is a problem with ide-cd ATAPI interface
with repeated access and reset. Is there a way I can configure REAR to
exclude /dev/hda from the disklay creation?  
Thanks again.

Temporarily removed hd\* from /sys/block/ search . Line 242
/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/20\_partition\_layout.sh

I want to move to new virtual hardware under hyper-v. Since the
underlying hardware is very different do you have any tips?  
Thanks
