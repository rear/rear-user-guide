The current repository of my OS provides an old version:

    # dnf info rear
    Last metadata expiration check: 1:09:17 ago on Wed Mar 12 21:45:57 2025.
    Available Packages
    Name        : rear
    Arch        : i686
    Epoch       : 0
    Version     : 1.19
    Release     : 1.fc23
    Size        : 415 k
    Repo        : updates

I'm not sure 1.19 will work correctly so I decided to build my own
package with ver 2.9 but it has some problems with detecting /dev/md3.
My RAID has no problem by the way.

Also I have a question. Why my site.conf file is ignoring:

    # cat /etc/rear/site.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://192.168.33.85/Server.Backup/
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=pass"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=pass"

According to the log it creates a local backup archive in
'/var/tmp/rear.847PuuWOmYgyCOY/tmp/isofs/backup/backup.tar.gz' instead
of writing to smb-share =/

Thank you!

P.S. And I'm sorry, I set wrong label... It should be "support /
question" I guess =/  
And I know my OS is too old but before upgrading it I'm trying to backup
everyting via ReaR but got failed :(

In the ReaR log you should see that it does mount the CIFS share.

Run 'rear -D savelayout' and attach the log file as it contains the
script debugging out as I would like to see why:  
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh: line 298: test: -gt: unary operator expected`  
fails?  
Perhaps also attach the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file to
view the result.

I see some CIFS references in log file but don't understand does it
actually mount or not...

@Immick Hum, seems the error is coming from the line:  
`container=$( grep "Container" $mdadm_details | tr -d " " | cut -d ":" -f "2" | cut -d "," -f "1")`  
further in the script the line
`test $container_size -gt 0 && raid_layout_entry+=" size=$container_size"`
will give an error:  
`210_raid_layout.sh: line 298: test: -gt: unary operator expected`

Your mdadm output doesn't contain a **Container** line, but that is a
minor issue, which doesn't has an impact of the disklayout.conf file
(this one looks okay to me).

Be aware that `rear savelayout` doesn't require CIFS as it writes it
localy into `/var/lib/rear/layout` directory.

If you run `rear -v mkbackup` it should write the ISO image to the CIFS
share. Unless it has an issue with the account used for CIFS, but that
should be visible in the rear logfile.

Thank you so much for observing my logs!

I started `rear -v mkbackup` and interrupted it as it still makes backup
on /var/tmp/. And I see no CIFS-references in the rear log file :(  
Could you look into it please?  
[rear-afmgtu.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19249192/rear-afmgtu.log)  
What am I doing wrong?

And one more thing I don't understand. Does this backup mean that I
needed the exact drives structure to restore my backup? I mean, this OS
is on 3x3TB disks with RAID 5, usable storage is 6 TB. Will I need also
3x3TB disks to restore or can I have only one disk with 6TB on it?
Actually I need to migrate that OS to one 6 TB (regardless of original
RAID) disk for experiments with further OS upgrade. Is it possible with
ReaR?

when you see

then it means it mounted the CIFS share. Do'nt you see anything
appearing on the share itself?

Rear is a DR solution to recover on the same or similar HW. Therefore,
going from a 3x3TB to 1 6TB disk is something that ReaR will **not**
cover for you. However, what you can do is install on OS on the new
system and create the exact same mount points and then extract the tar
file created by ReaR (or only the mount points you need) onto the new
system.

Yep, nothing is appearing on the cifs-share. It writes /var/tmp/...
decresing free space on `/` mount but I don't have such space on `/` to
get that backup =/

@Immick Did you ever try to manual mount the CIFS share on your Linux
system?

@gdha Yes, I can succesfully mount this share via:  
`mount -t cifs //192.168.33.85/AFMGTU.Server.Backup /mnt/cifs -o username=KSC,password=123456,vers=2.1 `  
And able to write files here.

So changed my site.conf to:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://192.168.33.85/AFMGTU.Server.Backup/
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=123456,vers=2.1"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=123456,vers=2.1"

Is my configuration file correct?

But it still writes to `/`. And I don't understand why nothing can be
found in the log file regarding issues with mounting my CIFS share:  
[rear-afmgtu.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19289831/rear-afmgtu.zip)

    + source /usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/060_mount_NETFS_path.sh

    ++ local mountpoint=/var/tmp/rear.O2O6PgG97EHS6yv/outputfs
    ++ local defaultoptions=rw,noatime
    ++ local options=username=ksc,password=123456,vers=2.1
    ++ local scheme
    +++ url_scheme iso:///backup
    +++ local url=iso:///backup
    +++ local scheme=iso
    +++ echo iso
    +++ grep -q :
    +++ echo iso
    ++ scheme=iso
    ++ scheme_supports_filesystem iso
    ++ local scheme=iso
    ++ test iso
    ++ case "$scheme" in
    ++ return 0
    ++ local mount_cmd
    ++ case "$scheme" in
    ++ test recover = mkbackup
    ++ return 0
    + source_return_code=0

As can I see, no issues here, right?

Is there a way to debug this mounting somehow manually?

@Immick try commenting these 2 lines:

    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://192.168.33.85/AFMGTU.Server.Backup/
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=123456,vers=2.1"

and see what happens next?

Or, as iso: means creating local ISO image (including backups). you
could also change the OUTPUT lines into BACKUP lines and comment the
BACKUP\_URL line.

@gdha

> as iso: means creating local ISO image (including backups)

Oh, I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner...  
So there is no way to create ISO-image with backups directly on
CIFS-share?

    #OUTPUT=ISO
    #OUTPUT_URL=cifs://192.168.33.85/AFMGTU.Server.Backup/
    #OUTPUT_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=123456,vers=2.1"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.168.33.85/AFMGTU.Server.Backup/
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="username=ksc,password=123456,vers=2.1"

    Creating tar archive '/var/tmp/rear.VcsA98Eyhu79Hbb/outputfs/afmgtu/backup.tar.gz'
    Archived 746 MiB [avg 168 KiB/sec]

Now it writes to the CIFS-share! Will take an year for my 6 TB I guess!
:)

Thank you so much!
