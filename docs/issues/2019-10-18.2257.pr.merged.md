-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2253](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2253)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I tested the plain code by running it as a separated script  
    and for me the input seems to work o.k.  
    but I cannot actually test it with TSM or NBU  
    because I have neither of them.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Let the user enter date and time again and again until the input is
valid  
or the user pressed only ENTER to restore the most recent available
backup.

Replaced 'LogPrint' with 'UserOutput' because  
the former shows messsages only in verbose mode  
while the latter shows messages always to the user  
(this does not matter in practice during 'rear recover'  
but 'UserOutput' is the ceaner code for user output  
and I noticed that in my separated test script).

@schabrolles  
perhaps -if time permits - you could even test it with TSM?

@gdha  
I would appreciate it if you could have a look at the plain code,  
perhaps you notice something suspicious?

There is also

    verify/GALAXY10/default/550_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh

which could benefit from such an enhancement.

The following scripts look also suspicious:

    # find usr/share/rear -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -l WAIT_SECS

    usr/share/rear/restore/DP/default/460_press_y_to_continue.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/DUPLICITY/default/400_restore_duplicity.sh
    usr/share/rear/verify/default/040_validate_variables.sh
    usr/share/rear/verify/DP/default/500_select_dp_restore.sh
    usr/share/rear/verify/DP/default/450_request_gui_restore.sh
    usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/380_request_client_destination.sh
    usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/400_verify_tsm.sh

For next week (if time permits)...

When there are no objections I would like to "just merged" it  
so that things could be tested by users "out there"  
as long as ReaR 2.6 is still under development.

I think this one is sufficiently complete and consistent now  
so that - if there are no objections - I would merge it today afternoon.

I kept WAIT\_SECS as separated user config variable for now  
but I think in the future WAIT\_SECS should be removed  
and only USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT should be kept and  
the remaining direct `read` calls should be replaced  
by `UserInput` in a future ReaR 3.0 version, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1390](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1390)  
and

I "just merged" it so that things can be tested right now  
as long as ReaR 2.6 is still under development.

Please report if there are regressions so that I can fix them,  
ideally each one as a new and separated GitHub issue.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2257](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2257)
merged plus  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/08f59566a968681771b64bfc5c791b34b8384cf5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/08f59566a968681771b64bfc5c791b34b8384cf5)  
I think this issue is solved as far as possible for me for now  
and hopefully even without regressions.

I would appreciate it if ReaR users in particular those who  
use BACKUP=TSM or BACKUP=NBU or BACKUP=GALAXY10  
could test that changes as long as ReaR 2.6 is still under development  
and report if there are regressions so that I can fix them,  
preferably each one as a new and separated GitHub issue.
