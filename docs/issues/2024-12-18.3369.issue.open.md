In current master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/Makefile\#L58](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/Makefile#L58)

        obsproject = Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot

but this OBS project is meanwhile removed.

Because 'obsproject = Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot'  
is used if "Not official build" this issue should not matter for

    make obs OFFICIAL=1

in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process\#preparation](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process#preparation)  
so this issue should not affect  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238)  
so this issue could be fixed after the ReaR 2.8 release
