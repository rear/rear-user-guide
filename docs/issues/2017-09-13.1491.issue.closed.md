#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): **Relax-and-Recover 2.2 /
    2017-07-20**
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): **CentOS
    Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)**
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): **empty**
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? **UEFI**
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    On each run `rear -v mkrescue` or `rear -v savelayout`
    `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` have different number of
    partitions. I have found where is problem in code, but I cannot
    understand why it happened.  
    Command
    `declare -a sysfs_paths=(/sys/block/$sysfs_name/$sysfs_name*)` every
    time return different output, so this is really strange
-   Work-around, if any:  
    Unfortunately at this moment I do not have work-around. If you have
    any idea I can try on my hardware and hopefully fix this issue.

@Kolesar  
I am not at all an expert in this area but in general I assume  
when running a particular command on commandline  
results varying/unstable/unreliable output  
the root cause is likely not inside ReaR but in that command  
or even more likely somewhere in the environment  
(in this case kernel/udev/whatever...).

Does it perhaps help to add an artificial 'sleep' e.g. like

<pre>
sleep 30
</pre>

in the script before that command is run in the hope  
that then what there is in /sys/block/... got stabilized  
so that the command output is also stable and reliable?

@Kolesar  
you wrote "any idea I can try on my hardware"  
but nobody can have such an idea because  
nobody can know what your hardware is  
because you did not tell that.

Is this issue here perhaps somehow related to you  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1460](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1460)  
which is about "Raid Level: container"  
where you told "I have RAID 1 on my environment"  
but not what your environment actually is.

@Kolesar Can you share an example of the differences please? What kind
of disk devices do you have?

@Kolesar As no evidence was delivered there is nothing we can do I'm
afraid - will close it - you may re-open it when sufficient useful
information is provided
