Have an automated unique default user\_input\_ID  
for the UserInput function so that each  
UserInput function call has a user\_input\_ID  
which is some kind of precondition for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366)

Now (at least from my current point of view)  
the UserInput function should be feature-complete.

It needs 'bc' to calculate huge numbers and (fortunately) since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332)  
'bc' is one of the REQUIRED\_PROGS in default.conf  
so that it is also available in the ReaR recovery system.

By the way I enhanced the CallerSource function  
that now also outputs the line number (useful in bigger scripts)  
because I learned how to use BASH\_LINENO correctly  
(there is an unexpected - but documented - "off by one"  
for the BASH\_LINENO array index).

@jsmeix I had another close look at the `UserInput` function and I am
not sure if the automatically generated hash numbers will be useful or
harmful. The reason is that they change if the call is moved to another
script or even **if we change a single letter in the wording**. If
somebody where to create responses for a specific ReaR run and we move
that input query to another script or just fix the wording then his
responses won't work anymore. That means that every such change -
regardless how minor - would be a **breaking change** for the user.

I therefore would like us to consider to remove this automatic feature
with the goal of only having explicit interfaces for users to configure
and not to have implicit interfaces. As we just introduce the
`UserInput` function I think that it is much easier for all of us
maintainers and also for our users if we simply assign those numbers
**manuall**. At the moment there are only very few uses of the function
that we would have to extend with the number (starting from 1) and then
we simply count up as we add more `UserInput` calls. If you want we can
make assigning the number a mandatory argument to force everybody to set
one.

People will still have to update their answers when we change the
wording of the answer they use but at least they won't have to do
anything when we move the code or when we change the default or an
answer that they didn't care about.

Here is the list of files to update, IMHO no big deal:

    $ git grep -cE '^[^\#]+\(\s*UserInput'
    usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200_check_usb_layout.sh:1
    usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh:1

What do you think?

@schlomo  
of course I know how the automated IDs change  
(I made the code and the comments ;-)

The idea is that each different UserInput function is called  
with its own ID explicitly specified in the call like

<pre>
UserInput -I 123 ...
</pre>

The automated default user\_input\_ID is only there  
as fallback for UserInput function calls without '-I'  
so that the user can in any case provide predefined  
automated input even if a UserInput function is called  
without '-I'.

Why I currently do not call UserInput with '-I':

Because IDs of different UserInput function calls  
must be different and currently I have no good idea  
for a reasonable and meaningful numbering scheme.

I think the ID should contain the script number,  
e.g. in 123\_do\_something.sh it should be

<pre>
UserInput -I 123... ...
</pre>

but the script number is not unique so that  
I need more...

As soon as I have a good idea for a reasonable and  
meaningful numbering scheme I will add '-I ...'  
to all UserInput calls.

Note that UserInput calls can even have same IDs  
when those calls have same purpose.

Only a theoretical example (I don't know a real one):  
E.g. in various backup restore scripts  
for various backup methods there could be  
same UserInput calls that have same purpose.  
Like for backup methods where ReaR basically only  
pauses until the admin had restored it manually like

<pre>
UserInput -I 999999 -t 0 -p 'Press [Enter] to continue after restore'
</pre>

Of course this here is only a theoretical example  
because in this case automated user input  
is clearly never ever wanted.

I fully understand and share your concerns, @jsmeix

The more we talk about this the more I get the feeling that a bash array
is the wrong tool for providing the answers to ReaR questions. Bash
arrays are indexed by numbers which is apparently not flexible enough.

How about switching to property files? Let's think about a directory
`/etc/rear/answers` where users can place files named like
`foobar.property` that contain answer like that:

    network.use-network-card=0
    storage.use-disk.sda=0
    storage.multipath.failed-loading=0

And of course the user input function for the multipathing issue we
discuss in \#1449 would be called with
`-I storage.multipath.failed-loading` to make it read that answer.

The idea is semantic naming for the user input ID. With a little magic
grep and sed I will be able to create for you an answer file where
everything is commented out :-)

With such a model (string instead of number as user input ID) you don't
need to keep a precise inventory of existing user input IDs.

And I would still prefer to not have automatic user input IDs because I
don't want to create an interface that will change as we refactor ReaR
code.

Only a side note  
that is related to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1390](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1390)

Bash 4.x supports associative arrays where the members  
are referenced using arbitrary strings,  
e.g. on my SLES12  
(the 'declare -A' is mandatory)

<pre>
# unset USER_INPUT_VALUES

# declare -A USER_INPUT_VALUES

# USER_INPUT_VALUES[first_user_input]='input for UserInput -I first_user_input'

# USER_INPUT_VALUES[second_user_input]='input for UserInput -I second_user_input'

# USER_INPUT_VALUES[third_user_input]='input for UserInput -I third_user_input'

# for user_input in "${USER_INPUT_VALUES[@]}" ; do echo "'$user_input'" ; done
'input for UserInput -I second_user_input'
'input for UserInput -I third_user_input'
'input for UserInput -I first_user_input'

# index='second_user_input' ; echo ${USER_INPUT_VALUES[$index]}
input for UserInput -I second_user_input

# USER_INPUT_VALUES[last user input]="input for UserInput -I 'last user input'"

# for user_input in "${USER_INPUT_VALUES[@]}" ; do echo "'$user_input'" ; done
'input for UserInput -I second_user_input'
'input for UserInput -I 'last user input''
'input for UserInput -I third_user_input'
'input for UserInput -I first_user_input'

# index='last user input' ; echo ${USER_INPUT_VALUES[$index]}
input for UserInput -I 'last user input'
</pre>

If we do not have automatic user input IDs  
it is still mandatory for me that the user can  
always predefine an input for any UserInput call  
which means then a UserInput call must be with '-I'  
otherwise the UserInput function aborts with BugError.

I think with strings as ID this should be acceptable  
so that even the user can ad-hoc add an UserInput call  
in any of the scripts because with strings as ID the  
user could simply use any dummy ID  
e.g. to pause somewhere in a script  
with something like

<pre>
UserInput -I asdfghjkl -t 0 -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
</pre>

when he does not care about the ID string.

@schlomo  
why a directory like /etc/rear/answers?

I think a single file /etc/rear/user\_input\[.conf\]  
that contains lines of bash syntax (as anything in ReaR)  
with string variable assignments like

<pre>
ID_string="arbitrary user input string"
</pre>

should be sufficient.

I would like to source that file in the UserInput function  
but I wonder how to ensure that those assinged variables  
are kept local inside the UserInput function so that  
no other ReaR variables could be accidentally overwritten?

Whatever we do must support multiple configuration / input files so that
people can easily provide different answers from different sources (e.g.
packages). Therefore I'd like to have a directory where users can put
multiple files.

Personally I think that editing a properties file is simpler because
there you have the user input ID as the key without any prefix. But I
don't insist on that. What I do find important is that the user input ID
is something that the user can set "as is" in a file. If the user input
IDs are Bash variables then we must prefix them with some constant and
then the `UserInput` function should also be called with that prefixed
ID and output that prefixed ID in the debug log etc.

So the main question is probably: Do we want to have user input IDs
without a prefix? Then we should put them into a different configuration
namespace which would be a different configuration directory. Even if
the format is Bash (and we read it with `source`), we would need that
different directory to avoid the constant prefix for each and every key.

And I am not sure if `ID_` is enough of a prefix or if it is
sufficiently self explanatory. Maybe `ANSWER_` will be easier to
understand.
