In current ReaR master code some scripts have a last line

<pre>
# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4:
</pre>

which got added by @rmetrich via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b184194f37dd22a7e55655ff388579297239e73c](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b184194f37dd22a7e55655ff388579297239e73c)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/84f03a4a2828ad21a1ab770b5737db9dac41074c](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/84f03a4a2828ad21a1ab770b5737db9dac41074c)

I.e. in current ReaR master code there is

<pre>
 $ find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ | xargs grep 'vim:' 2>/dev/null

usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4:
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/220_include_lvm_tools.sh:# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4:
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110_include_lvm_code.sh:# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4:
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh:# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4:
</pre>

I guess this is some special automatism by the `vi` editor.

@rmetrich  
could you explan the reason behind  
and whether or not I should remove them  
or if it makes sense to have those trailing comment lines.

@jsmeix these directives tell vim to automatically adjust when editing
the file:

-   et : expand tabs
-   ts=4 : 4 spaces when expanding a <tab> found in the file
-   sw=4 : 5 spaces when hitting <tab> on your keyboard

Since most of ReaR's code is indented using these settings, keeping that
would be nice to avoid messing up the files.

@rmetrich  
thanks for your prompt reply!  
Now I understand.

@gdha @gozora @schabrolles  
what do you think:

Schouldn't then such a trailing comment line

<pre>
# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4:
</pre>

be appended to every ReaR script?

Honestly I didn't know about this feature, but I'd personally prefer to
keep editor settings out of source code mainly because other users might
appear with different editors storing another set of "meta-data" which
could lead to mess...

As you wish, although such metadata is widely used among projects, e.g.
mariadb, sos, ruby, rsyslog, gnutls, NetworkManager, ...

Even in rear, it is already used in packaging/arch/PKGBUILD.

Don't get me wrong Renaud, I'm not going to fight to keep this away from
ReaR source code, if you guys think this is a useful idea, let's keep
it, no problem with that from my site.  
My editor for example, keeps meta-data information (e.g. information
about collapsed sections etc.) in separate files (dot prefixed) directly
in source tree and I just thought that it might be disturbing for other
people to deal with them, so I've reconfigured this behavior ...

I hope such comments cannot cause real trouble (because they are only
comments)  
and because they are useful in some cases it is o.k. for me to have
them.  
I think the only real trouble that such comments could cause are the
usual  
"what is the right editor" plus "what is the right indentation style"
wars ;-)

I can answer to "what is the right editor" ;-)

My editor is the only right one that is used by real hard men ;-)

@jsmeix `ed` ?

likely, at his time there was only that ;-)

or even maybe his editor was a puncher, for punch cards ;-)

@gozora  
real Supermen use `super ed` a.k.a. `sed` :-))

@rmetrich  
in ancient times real hard men used a puncher chisel and a big
hammer...

I think this issue is sufficiently discussed so that I can close it  
and the consensus is that it is o.k. to have those comments  
but it is not required to have such comments in every file or script.
