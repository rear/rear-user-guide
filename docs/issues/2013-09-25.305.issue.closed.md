Hi,

We receive following error during the restore attempt:

    No code has been generated to restore device pv:/dev/disk/by-id/cciss-3600508b1001fffffa004f7b3f209000b-part2

The cause is the mismatch of device name in `disklayout.conf` - the
`lvmdev` and `part` definition refer to the different names of the same
device.

    disk /dev/cciss/c0d0 72833679360 msdos
    part /dev/cciss/c0d0 205599744 32256 primary boot /dev/cciss/c0d0p1
    part /dev/cciss/c0d0 72620997120 205632000 primary lvm /dev/cciss/c0d0p2
    lvmdev /dev/vg00 /dev/disk/by-id/cciss-3600508b1001fffffa004f7b3f209000b-part2 7fWwOV-nd4W-G0oA-0SE8-Oy89-NGpH-qHRoN3 141837885

This issue was observed on SLES11 SP3, after we specified

    preferred_names = [ "^/dev/disk/by-id/" ]

in `lvm.conf`.

We can reproduce it with recent 1.15 as well as 1.14 version.

The easy workaround is to edit disklayout.conf manually before the
restore.

@pavoldomin Would be nice to see the logging of a debug session with
savelayout... and perhaps the `ls -l` of the /dev links from the cciss
stuff.  
@jhoekx do you have am idea if there is an easy way to get around?

There is no easy way around. The get\_device\_name function should be
taught to convert by-id names to the format used for the partitions. We
should make sure we call that function when writing the lvmdev line to
disklayout.conf.

@pavoldomin could you attach the log file made by `rear -vD savelayout`
as a gist?

@pavoldomin could you also paste the content of the file
`/var/lib/rear/recovery/diskbyid_mappings` ?

Hi, sorry for latency.
