user\_xattr is the default in btrfs and btrfs does not even allow the
mount  
option user\_xattr (btrfs: unrecognized mount option 'user\_xattr')
the  
previous test did report that the btrfs filesystem is not  
mounted with user\_xattr.

This new test tries to actually create a file with extended attributes.

Tested it with btrfs and tmpfs.
