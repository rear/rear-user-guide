-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hi,  
I have a script for backing up system files with borg, also including
/boot partition etc.  
Would be great to have a rear ISO to recover the system, including the
borg binary, to recover my own backup via NFS mount.  
Means, do my daily borg backup script jobs and from time to time a "rear
mkrescue".  
And in case of a DR, mount ISO, do the rear rescue (partition and
bootloader restore), mount manually my NFS share, start manually my borg
restore.

Tried to create an ISO-only with BACKUP=BORG but all the time, the
rear+borg implementation scripts try to mount an USB stick (which fails)
and stopped.

What worked, for an ISO-only without Borg binary:

    cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    GRUB_RESCUE=n

What I tried and failed:

    cat /etc/rear/local-borg.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    GRUB_RESCUE=n
    BACKUP=BORG

I am not a Borg backup user so cannot  
actually help with Borg backup specific issues.

As fas as I see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)  
therein in the section "ReaR with Borg back end"  
it looks as if several more config options are needed  
to make things work with BACKUP=BORG.

In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:  
Usually we at ReaR upstream do not use third-party backup tools  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.  
Nevertheless we try to help as good as we can from plain looking at the
code.  
You may also have a look at the related general section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
