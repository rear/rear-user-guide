### Requesting support or just a question

Is this a blocksize issue?

### Platform

Debian12,  
rear installed from Debian repository.  
Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git.  
New Lenovo Server with Ultrium9 SAS drive.

See the info in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3448](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3448)

### Output

I'm new to rear with tape storage.

I am trying to backup to my new tape drive and getting the error above.

I looked at dmesg and saw

    st 1:0:0:0: [st0] Write not multiple of tape block size.

a few times.

Makes me think there's a "mismatch" between whatever block size rear is
trying to use vs what my tape drive wants.

I can't seem to find the answer or if I'm on the right track.

@DebianGuru  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf there is

    # Tape block size, default is to leave it up to the tape-device:
    TAPE_BLOCKSIZE=

Perhaps setting this appropriately helps?
