Using ReaR version 2.7 on Amazon Linux 2023.

systemd-networkd is responsible for DHCP and network setup.

ReaR throws error that no binary resalted to DHCP client is found and
yes it is not needed on AL2023. The Array does not contain binary for
AL2023 builds.

systemd-networkd.service and /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd are core
components responsible in this case it seems.

Please suggest if there is a fix or workaround to this.  
Thanks in advance

UPDATE: For AL2023, Using EPEL Repo RPM  
[https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/8/Everything/x86\_64/Packages/d/](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/8/Everything/x86_64/Packages/d/)  
install the DHCPCD agent on the source VM before building the rescue
system and before running the ReaR backups. Once the First restore is
done make sure we remove this RPM for sure.

It worked and i could access the Rescue instance via SSH with no
problem. Yet to do the Full restore. Will update

I think  
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh)  
could be improved to show better messages  
(e.g. DebugPrint, LogPrintError, Error)  
when USE\_DHCLIENT is 'yes'  
but none of the

    dhcp_clients=(dhcpcd dhclient dhcp6c dhclient6)

can be found.

@jsmeix It did have a clear error message but the distro won't have any
of the listed dhcp clients by default cause it handles everything using
the systems-networkd service and it's based components.

As a workaround and to make rear support DHCP on the rescue system I
need to install an extra DHCPCD binary using EPEL repo based binary.

I think rear does its job correctly.
