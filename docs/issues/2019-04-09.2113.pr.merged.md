Dirty hack to keep things still working on SLES11:  
On SLES11 it does not work to bind-mount /dev into TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045\#issuecomment-481195463](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045#issuecomment-481195463)  
because within the recovery system /dev is no mountpoint  
(in a running SLES11 system 'udev' is mounted on /dev) and  
within the recovery system bind-mounting of the /dev directory fails.  
It seems the root cause is that within the recovery system / is no
mountpoint  
like in a normal running system where e.g. /dev/sda2 is mounted on /  
but within the recovery system / is the plain content of ReaR's initrd  
so /dev does not belong to any mountpoint and that lets bind-mount
fail.  
As a dirty hack to keep things still working on SLES11 we do here  
the same as we did in our old finalize/default/100\_populate\_dev.sh

    cp -fa /dev $TARGET_FS_ROOT/

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045\#issuecomment-464737610](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2045#issuecomment-464737610)  
This hack is especially dirty because it copies device node files into
TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
after the backup was restored (i.e. it writes files on the target system
disk) and  
this hack is especially sneaky because usually on the rebooted target
system  
something will be mounted at /dev (e.g. on SLES11 'udev' is mounted on
/dev)  
so that our copied device nodes on the target system disk get obscured
and  
hidden behind what is mounted at /dev in the normal running target
system.

With my latest commit here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2113/commits/82d8d01b73f7ba65aee8c07add4178c1f21c984c](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2113/commits/82d8d01b73f7ba65aee8c07add4178c1f21c984c)  
the code should work reasonably clean even for SLES11  
and it works well for me on SLES11.

Now when /dev is no mountpoint (e.g. in case of SLES11)  
we first mount TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/dev as a tmpfs and then we  
copy all /dev contents from the recovery system into
TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/dev  
which makes the recovery system /dev contents available at
TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/dev  
only as long as the recovery system runs but on the rebooted target
system  
its original unmodified /dev contents will be there again.

This keeps what our old finalize/default/100\_populate\_dev.sh did  
but now without dirty remainders on the user's target system disk.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow.  
Then ReaR 2.5. will again also work on SLES11.
