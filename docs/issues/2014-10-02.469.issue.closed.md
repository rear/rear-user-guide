Hello,

mysqlf I use default /tmp folder but in duply profile this could be
setup:

    # temporary file space. at least the size of the biggest file in backup
    # for a successful restoration process. (default is '/tmp', if not set)
    #TEMP_DIR=/tmp

and needs to be handeld/linked then in  
verify/DUPLICITY/default/20\_check\_tmpfs.sh  
verify/DUPLICITY/default/25\_check\_duply\_profile.sh  
and perhaps also  
restore/DUPLICITY/default/10\_restore\_duply.sh

Also it could/should be helpful to use for duplicity tmp folder not
tmpfs if possible because there could be VMs/"appliances" with low RAM
but huge HDD temp space?

    2014-10-02 11:45:54 Including verify/DUPLICITY/default/20_check_tmpfs.sh
    2014-10-02 11:45:54 File system /tmp not present - try to mount it via tmpfs
    2014-10-02 11:45:54 Including verify/DUPLICITY/default/25_check_duply_profile.sh
    2014-10-02 11:46:25 Including restore/DUPLICITY/default/10_restore_duply.sh

Also it could be helpful to recognize activated ARCH\_DIR settings and
also activate it for ReaR recover to "buffer" the file metadata
temporary to fasten the restore with smaller net links?

    # Modifies archive-dir option (since 0.6.0) Defines a folder that holds 
    # unencrypted meta data of the backup, enabling new incrementals without the 
    # need to decrypt backend metadata first. If empty or deleted somehow, the 
    # private key and it's password are needed.
    # NOTE: This is confidential data. Put it somewhere safe. It can grow quite 
    #       big over time so you might want to put it not in the home dir.
    # default '~/.cache/duplicity/duply_<profile>/'
    # if set  '\${ARCH_DIR}/<profile>'
    #ARCH_DIR=/some/space/safe/.duply-cache

Bests

in rear you can use `TMPDIR` instead (in the local.conf file)

My suggestions came because common/rear TMPDIR variable is overwritten
by duply:

    # grep -nA2 TMPDIR /usr/bin/duply 
    561:DUPL_VARS_GLOBAL="TMPDIR='$TEMP_DIR' \
    562- ${DUPL_ARG_ENC}"
    563-}

and defaults to /tmp:

    # grep -n TEMP_DIR /usr/bin/duply | grep tmp
    288:#TEMP_DIR=/tmp
    972:  TEMP_DIR=${TEMP_DIR:-'/tmp'}

(and the possible size problem compared to HDD and tmpfs space)

In both cases it would be nice to auto-reassign the TEMP\_DIR variable
of duply ?

Just checked: duplicity itself uses only TMPDIR:

At home I got an idea howto solve it - here the short version how it for
the scripts. I do it "reverse" to the duply setting of temporary folder:

    # grep TEMP /etc/duply/*/conf
    #TEMP_DIR=/tmp

    # grep -qE "^TEMP_DIR=\\$\{TMPDIR:-" /etc/duply/*/conf || \
      sed -ie "s/^#\?TEMP_DIR=\(.*\)$/TEMP_DIR=\${TMPDIR:-\1}/" /etc/duply/*/conf

    # grep TEMP /etc/duply/*/conf
    TEMP_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}

This shouldn't (must not?) be used on the original conf file because its
not nice to "fix" something in background without knowlede of the
administrator but could be announced as "should be set" and can be used
onto the conf in the rescue image ?

@Reiner030 sounds logically; will you prepare a pull request? Thank you
for the in-depth investigation. Gratien

yes... but I have small problem here:
[https://github.com/Reiner030/rear/compare/duply-tmpdir-fix-volsize-check](https://github.com/Reiner030/rear/compare/duply-tmpdir-fix-volsize-check)

/usr/share/rear/build/DUPLICITY/default/50\_patch\_duply\_config.sh  
is created and I think it should be included automatically but it's not
used when building the ISO image

@Reiner030 check if the modified scripts were added to the ISO build
(after booting it). perhaps you were the standard installed rear rpm
instead of the local path?

Since I use Debian Wheezy this can't be ;) But I would check the debian
folder for necessary entries.

@Reiner030 can this issue be closed?
