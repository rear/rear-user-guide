Using UserInput in 300\_map\_disks.sh and  
a general overhaul of that script and  
made UserInput less verbose unless in debug mode, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1431](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1431)

Do not yet merge it - it is currently work-in-progress.

FYI  
how that currently looks for me during "rear recover"

</pre>

In my case I have a bigger /dev/sda and an additional /dev/sdb.  
The messeges are not yet perfect, e.g.

<pre>
Original disk /dev/sda does not exist in the target system.
</pre>

should actually be

<pre>
Original disk /dev/sda does not exist in the target system with same size.
</pre>

otherwise the whole stuff looks as if ReaR was a bit stupid.

I added the "Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here"  
choice so that one can switch to a shell to find out what that  
rather meaningless disk choices "/dev/sda" and "/dev/sdb"  
actually are i.e. which real disks are meant with that.

I have a long standing wish to get rid of the pointless questions,
especially the ones that ask me to choose the one single replacement
option. Thanks a lot, we are getting there!

I got rid of the pointless question that asks  
to choose the one single option, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366)

But in migration mode we need a confirmation from the user  
to be safe against wrong automated replacements  
so that I added a general overall disk mapping confirmation  
and disk mapping edit user dialog.

Because the UserInput functions supports user-defined timeout  
settings (not yet officially documented but there for testing)  
it now looks as follows  
for a single replacement disk with different size

@schabrolles  
I would like your review here because recently you used  
and tested the migration mode with multipath devices.

I would like to get a verification from you that  
my completely overhauled 300\_map\_disks.sh  
still works also for your use-cases.

I need this mainly because in my test scenarios  
I have only simple disk device names like '/dev/sda'  
where no actual device name translation via the  
get\_device\_name function happens.

I would liie to know if the overhauled 300\_map\_disks.sh  
still works when device name translations actually happen.

@jsmeix, I made a migration test with your `1434.patch`

-   OS tested: SLE12-SP2
-   Source server: KVM guest with "virtual disk" vda
-   Target server: PowerVM LPAR with SAN disk multipathed (mpatha)

I just use the latest version of ReaR from github (git pull / master
branch) and apply your `1434.patch` with `git am`

Everything looks good, at least with SLE12-SP2 (I may be have to test
also RHEL)

@schabrolles  
many thanks for your testing!

I think it is sufficient to merge this one.  
If issues appear there is time to fix them for ReaR v 2.3  
that is currently planned for end of October 2017.

@schabrolles  
in your 'rear -v recover' output in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1434\#issuecomment-319899757](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1434#issuecomment-319899757)  
I noticed messages that look contradicting

<pre>
Using /dev/mapper/mpatha (same size) for recreating /dev/vda
</pre>

versus later

<pre>
Partition primary on /dev/mapper/mpatha: size reduced to fit on disk.
</pre>

because when the replacement disk /dev/mapper/mpatha  
has same size as the original disk /dev/vda  
I would not expect that a partition size needs  
to be reduced to fit on disk.

The 'size reduced to fit on disk' message comes from the  
create\_partitions() function in 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh

A probably related issue could be  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102)  
where  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102\#issuecomment-149550235](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102#issuecomment-149550235)  
might even explain what happens here.

Accordingly the reason for the "size reduced to fit on disk" here  
could be a (very) small size reduction (e.g. only a few MBs)  
to get the recreated partition aligned on certain "boundaries"  
(such alignment happens only in migration mode).

@schabrolles  
to verify how much it was reduced in your case,  
you need to inspect your log file because  
the create\_partitions() function code is

<pre>
LogPrint "Partition $name on $device: size reduced to fit on disk."
Log "End changed from $end to $device_size."
</pre>

I do not understand why the actual reduction value  
is only in the log but not also directly shown to the user?
