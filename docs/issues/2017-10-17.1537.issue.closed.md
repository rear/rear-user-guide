How about using a multithreaded pigz instead of tar --gzip ?

Just do a GitHub pull request so that we can have a look  
how you made pigz work for your particular case.

To save us all some time, is there a particular reason why pigz would
not work?

@mtxd Article
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12313242/utilizing-multi-core-for-targzip-bzip-compression-decompression](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12313242/utilizing-multi-core-for-targzip-bzip-compression-decompression)
describes nicely the usage. However, it seems `tar` does not yet fully
integrate all functionalities that `pigz` has. You need to combine `tar`
and the pipe command combined with `pigz`. However, I prefer the
`--use-compress-program=pigz` with `tar`  
For basics usage nothing has to be implemented IMHO.

@mtxd However, do not forget to add `pigz` to the binaries to be copied
to the rescue image. Feedback is always welcome of course, or even
better a pull request.

No response after a very long time, therefore, change this to "won't
fix" and close it
