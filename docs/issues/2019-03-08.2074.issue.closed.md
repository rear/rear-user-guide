-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
    follow-up on the discussion held in PR \#2049 it would maybe easier
    to have the RULE\_FILES setting in the GNU/Linux.conf file as
    UDEV\_RULE\_FILES instead of defining these in the 2 scripts
    individual

<!-- -->

-   usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh
-   usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/310\_migrate\_udev\_rules.sh

This way it would be simple to adjust the values according the
end-user's wishes.

@gdha  
I always appreciate any kind of "provide final power to the user"  
which means I always appreciate new user config variables  
so that - if needed - the user can overwrite ReaR's automatisms.

I think if a new user config variable UDEV\_RULE\_FILES is set  
in conf/GNU/Linux.conf it must be at least described in
conf/default.conf  
because all user config variables must be in conf/default.conf.

By the way:  
All variables that are currently set in conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
are also set in conf/default.conf (some to empty values).

I think it is sufficient to set UDEV\_RULE\_FILES only in default.conf.

In general I do not understand why some are set both  
in default.conf and additionally also in conf/GNU/Linux.conf.

I found and find it always somewhat confusing to have two places  
where the defaults are set.

As far as I know ReaR runs only on GNU/Linux systems  
so that I assume conf/GNU/Linux.conf is always sourced  
or are there cases where conf/GNU/Linux.conf is not sourced?

@jsmeix Thanks Johannes - well back in 2006 @schlomo and @gdha were very
optimistic that ReaR could also work on BSD style systems (e.g. OS/X). I
guess we were too optimistic ;-)

@gdha  
thank you so much for your explanation!

Now I understand why there is a separated conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
Should we get rid of it and merge Linux.conf into default.conf?

If at some future time ReaR should work also on non-Linux systems  
we would have to carefully dissect all the current settings in
default.conf  
anyway because I guess many of the current settings in default.conf  
are made with only Linux in mind.

üëç for getting rid of `GNU/Linux.conf` (and similar) as ReaR in any case
only works on Linux as of now. When somebody wants to support other OS
they will reorganize the configuration as necessary.

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2075](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2075)
I will  
merge conf/GNU/Linux.conf (and similar) into default.conf  
after the ReaR 2.5 release (i.e. for ReaR 2.6) because that issue  
is not at all urgent and I fear I may break things if I do it now.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2123](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2123)
merged  
I consider this issue to be fixed.
