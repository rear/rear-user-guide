-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    GRUB that was originally installed on `/boot` (/dev/sda1) is
    reinstalled on `rear recover` to MBR (/dev/sda) which caused
    unbootable system after upgrade from SLE12-SP2-&gt;SLE2-SP3:

![post\_upgrade\_fail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12116358/49937783-2c095400-fed8-11e8-86f4-8a1749574d11.png)

This behavior should not apply to installations where GRUB is installed
to MBR during OS installation.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    `yast bootloader->OK` to reinstall bootloader to its original
    location (`/boot`) or update `/etc/default/grub_installdevice`

<!-- -->

    - /dev/sda1
    + /dev/sda
    activate
    generic_mbr

To reflect new location of boot loader installed by `rear recover`

This is issue is reproducible as follows:

1.  Install boot loader to `/boot` partition during OS installation
2.  backup / restore OS with ReaR
3.  do SP upgrade (e.g. from SP2-&gt;SP3) either offline (by booting
    from SLE ISO) or by `zypper dist-upgrade`

IMHO one sufficient thing would be to patch
*/mnt/local/etc/default/grub\_installdevice* with information from
`finalize/Linux-i386/620_install_grub2.sh` is similar way like done in
`finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh`

I know about this kind of issue since a longer time  
but I never did a thorough analysis.

As far as I know "rear recover" basically installs GRUB2 into MBR  
(or more precisely on the boot disk device node like /dev/sda  
but not into a boot partition device node like /dev/sda1)  
regardless how GRUB2 was installed on the original system  
(I never cared about the GRUB legacy scripts in ReaR, they seem  
to "somehow work good enough" because there are no bug reports).

What I implemented as a generic way to give the user final power  
where GRUB2 gets installed is GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2450](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2450)

@gozora  
does \`GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES="/dev/sa1" help in your case?

Did you re-run "rear mkbackup" after you did the  
upgrade from SLE12-SP2 to SLE2-SP3 ?

You need to re-do "rear mkbackup" and re-test "rear recover"  
after any change of the basic system, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
because you need in particular the new config files  
of the upgraded system in your backup because in particular  
GRUB2 is installed from within a 'chroot' into the up to that point  
recreated system so that GRUB2 gets installed within the  
environment of the up to that point recreated system which means  
GRUB2 gets installed with the config files from the restored backup.

But I think this does not affect the target location whereto  
GRUB2 will be installed (e.g. /dev/sda versus /dev/sda1)  
because that is provided as command line argument  
to the grub2-install command, cf.  
finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_grub2.sh  
and that command line argument can be specified  
via GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES.

@gozora  
perhaps I understand now what you meant with

    1. Install boot loader to /boot partition during OS installation
    2. backup / restore OS with ReaR
    3. do SP upgrade (e.g. from SP2->SP3) 

During `2. backup / restore OS with ReaR`  
the system will be changed by "rear recover"  
from GRUB2 on /boot (i.e. on /dev/sda1)  
to GRUB2 in MBR (i.e. on /dev/sda)  
but the matching GRUB2 config file `/etc/default/grub_installdevice`  
is not updated accordingly so that the actual GRUB2 installation  
does no longer match the GRUB2 config files.

Then `3. do SP upgrade (e.g. from SP2->SP3)` results  
a unbootable system because of what is likely a bug in this step.  
I think there is a bug in that step because I assume the system  
was still bootable after `2. backup / restore OS with ReaR`  
(i.e. the new GRUB2 installation by "rear recover" worked in practice)  
so that `3. do SP upgrade (e.g. from SP2->SP3)` made a bootable system  
no longer bootable.

Nevertheless it seems there is also a generic bug in ReaR  
because it does not autodetect the actual GRUB2 install target  
(e.g. whether it is /dev/sda or /dev/sda1) but by default  
(i.e. unless GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES was specified)  
"rear recover" may change the actual GRUB2 install target  
which it should not do.

I think what is not right is to let "rear recover" silently change  
the actual GRUB2 install target and then even more change things  
and adapt GRUB2 config files on the recreated system because this  
is not what the admin expects to happen.

I don't see any easy way how to completely and correctly fix this
problem.  
I theory we would need similar approach as
[bootinfoscript](http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/), which scans
all devices that can contain boot loader, store them during
`rear mkbackup` and restore it afterwards.

Sweet, this makes my idea in

I assume the root cause is what is described in the section  
"Disaster recovery does not just work" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
(excerpt):

    For example there is the general problem
    that it is impossible to determine in a reliable way
    how a running system was actually booted.

Perhaps it is possible to find something that indicates  
when GRUB2 is not installed in MBR  
(e.g. when it is not on /dev/sda but elsewhere)  
and in this case error out during "rear mkrescue"  
unless GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES was specified  
to enforce the user when things are not clear to  
explicitly tell whereto GRUB2 needs to be installed?

@gozora  
during "rear recover" you should have got LogPrint messages  
from finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_grub2.sh like

    Installing GRUB2 boot loader...
    Determining where to install GRUB2 (no GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES specified)
    Found possible boot disk /dev/sda - installing GRUB2 there

so that you should (theoretically) have been informed  
about the changed location whereto GRUB2 was installed.

Based on that another idea how to deal with such issues is  
to let the user actively confirm whereto GRUB2 gets installed  
by a UserInput dialog.

@gozora  
if you got the above LogPrint messages I will do a pull request (next
week)  
with an added UserInput dialog to let the user actively confirm  
whereto GRUB2 gets installed so that you could try out if that  
would make things behave more fail-safe for you.

Third offhanded idea how to reasonably guess  
where GRUB2 is acually installed on the original system:

In layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh the code part

    # Finally guess the used bootloader by inspecting the first bytes on all disks
    # and use the first one that matches a known bootloader string:
    for block_device in /sys/block/* ; do
        ...
    done

guesses what bootloader is used by inspecting certain disk devices  
(currently as far as I see only e.g. /dev/sda but not yet /dev/sda1)  
so that it is perhaps possible to re-use and enhance that kind of code  
to remember on what disk device the guessed bootloader was found  
and use by default that disk device whereto GRUB2 will get
re-installed  
during "rear recover" unless GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES was specified.

If it finds signs of GRUB2 being installed on more than one disk
device  
we might blindly re-install GRUB2 on all of them (which would be right  
in case of RAID1 consisting of /dev/sda and /dev/sdb)  
or we could let ReaR behave better safe than sorry by default and  
error out with "ambiguous GRUB2 location" during "rear mkrescue" as in

@jsmeix don't waste your time too much on this one. It can be rather
easy to fix in running system.

I'll take a look on Grub installation code and see if there is some way,
how it can be enhanced.
