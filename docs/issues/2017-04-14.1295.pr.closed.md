Force Loading multipath modules when `BOOT_OVER_SAN` is True.  
Before this changes, multipath module was loaded only if multipath
devices were present in `LAYOUT_FILE`.  
So, if you migrate from virtual machine (non-multipath) to
`BOOT_OVER_SAN` system (usually multipathed), multipath is not loaded
during recover/migration.

I propose to automatically the load of multipath modules during recovery
when `BOOT_OVER_SAN` is True.

I also add `/lib*/multipath` which where missing when creating rescue
image with `BOOT_OVER_SAN=y`

@gdha @jsmeix I'm going to close this Pull request and re-open it. (new
pull request is \#1309)  
I've added some other commit not related to this particular issue, sorry
for that.  
So I prefer to separate them in separated issue in order to discuss with
you about them.

I worked a lot this weekend on solving some multipathing issue
(especially during migration on different system). I'm gonna push those
pull request after finishing my migration testing.
