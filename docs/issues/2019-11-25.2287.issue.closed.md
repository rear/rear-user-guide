-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Doing a rescue image of a raid computer, and loading it to another PC
without raid, the rescue image says that UDEV cant load, later on it
says that /mnt/local is not mounted (obviously)

-   Workaround, if any:

None yet

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

`rear -D mkrescue`

[rear-desembarco104119.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3888933/rear-desembarco104119.log)

read `40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh`, and thought that maybe my
systmed\_version was too low, so I forced rear to run the manual method
to deal with modules, but didn't work either.

In the original server I don't have sysmted installed:

    [root@asd rear]# systemd-notify --version
    -bash: systemd-notify: command not found

As an initial quick generic info (I didn't have a closer look here)  
regarding

    Doing a rescue image of a raid computer,
    and loading it to another PC without raid

This may work in some cases but in general it won't work.

See the sections  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" and  
"How disaster recovery with ReaR basically works" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
where the latter reads in particular

    The ReaR recovery ISO image contains
    the ReaR recovery installation system with the ReaR installer
    that is specific for the system where it was made

When you intend to do "rear recover" on different hardware  
you do a so called "migration".

In general migrating with ReaR could become a complicated task  
depending on how much the replacement system is different  
compared to the original system.

Regarding migrating a system with ReaR see for example  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html)  
and follow the links therein as appropriate in your particular case.
