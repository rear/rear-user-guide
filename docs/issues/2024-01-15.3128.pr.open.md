-   Type: **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Low**  
    Hopefully even no impact because I hope  
    nobody uses current ReaR on a system  
    that uses GRUB Legacy as bootloader

-   How was this pull request tested?

"rear mkrescue" still works for me on openSUSE Leap 15.5  
I get

    Using sysconfig bootloader 'grub2' for 'rear recover'

so I have GRUB2 in var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader

@pcahyna  
do you perhaps know what is going on here?  
Does "fedora-rawhide" really still use GRUB Legacy  
or is GRUB in first bytes on /dev/nvme0n1 a false positive?  
See the code in layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh

@jsmeix I will have a look. I am about to change this file anyway
because of other issues.

@pcahyna  
if the guessed bootloader 'GRUB' is a false guess  
could you specify BOOTLOADER in local.conf  
at least as band aid for now  
so that those tests do no longer fail  
and I could then merge this pull request?

@jsmeix please don't. This change would break all Fedora and RHEL
versions on machines using BIOS. (EDIT: By this I mean it would force
all users to specify BOOTLOADER in local.conf.)

I investigated the situation and will send you a PR that corrects the
code, please stay tuned. Sorry for the delay.

@jsmeix by the way, I suppose there is still `/etc/sysconfig/bootloader`
that specifies the correct bootloader on the SUSE Linux versions where
you tested, right? If so that's why you have not seen the problem in
your tests.

Don't worry.  
I will not merge it as long as it breaks things.

You could do a review in GitHub and "request changes"  
to make it obvious for others that it must not be merged  
in its current state.

I considered it, but I don't have any specific changes to request beyond
the general "fix the failure", which would be a much larger work than
this PR, and it is more efficient if I do it in a separate PR, as I have
studied the code in detail already.

@jsmeix could you please mark the PR as Draft?

By the way, I am glad that our CI done by @antonvoznia is showing real
benefits :-)

@pcahyna @antonvoznia  
yes, I am also glad to see that the CI you implemented  
proves to have real benefits - again thank you for that!

In particular for this pull request I did not expect  
that the change here could have a real negative effect.  
I had the false assumption that SUSE SLES is the only  
Linux distribution where really old stuff still exists  
like ELILO that is still there in SLES15, cf.

@pcahyna  
does Red Hat still need support for RHEL 6  
in current ReaR master code?  
Or can we drop support for RHEL 6, CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6  
for the next ReaR 2.8 release?

    I get

    so I have GRUB2 in var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader

@jsmeix sorry, I should have read the message more carefully, as it
already indicates where the code got the value from.

Since SUSE continues to use `/etc/sysconfig/bootloader`, do you please
know what will the file contain on hybrid EFI/BIOS installations? It is
possible to install a system so that it boots correctly both with BIOS
and with UEFI, and such system has effectively two bootloaders: one in
the MBR and one as a file in the EFI System Partition. My main
motivation for changing this code is to support this scenario and fixing
the issue we are seeing will be a side effect. I would like to have a
solution that works on SUSE if possible, but for this I would need to
know how such a SUSE system looks like.

@pcahyna  
currently I neither know what /etc/sysconfig/bootloader  
contains on SUSE hybrid EFI/BIOS installations  
nor whether a hybrid EFI/BIOS installation is supported  
with the SUSE installer YaST.  
For answering this question I need some time.

@pcahyna  
I asked a colleague and he told me that  
a hybrid EFI/BIOS installation is  
neither supported with the SUSE installer YaST  
nor is it officially suppoted by SUSE for SLES.

On my openSUSE Leap 15.5  
/etc/sysconfig/bootloader contains (all its content):

    ## Path:        System/Bootloader
    ## Description: Bootloader configuration
    ## Type:        list(grub,grub2,grub2-efi,none)
    ## Default:     grub2
    #
    # Type of bootloader in use.
    # For making the change effect run bootloader configuration tool
    # and configure newly selected bootloader
    #
    #
    LOADER_TYPE="grub2"

    ## Path:        System/Bootloader
    ## Description: Bootloader configuration
    ## Type:        yesno
    ## Default:     "no"
    #
    # Enable UEFI Secure Boot support
    # This setting is only relevant to UEFI which supports Secure Boot. It won't
    # take effect on any other firmware type.
    #
    #
    SECURE_BOOT="yes"

    ## Path:        System/Bootloader
    ## Description: Bootloader configuration
    ## Type:        yesno
    ## Default:     "no"
    #
    # Enable Trusted Boot support
    # Only available for legacy (non-UEFI) boot.
    #
    TRUSTED_BOOT="no"

    ## Path:        System/Bootloader
    ## Description: Bootloader configuration
    ## Type:        yesno
    ## Default:     "yes"
    #
    # Update nvram boot settings (UEFI, OF)
    # Unset to preserve specific settings or workaround firmware issues.
    #
    UPDATE_NVRAM="yes"

So in particular LOADER\_TYPE must be one of

    grub
    grub2
    grub2-efi
    none
