If some parts are excluded during recovery, the commenting in
disklayout.conf is done inconistently:

    # disk /dev/hdc 4294965248
    # disk /dev/sdb 10737418240 msdos
    # lvmdev /dev/vg01 /dev/sdb JS5o5Z-fV7u-YGkT-t4Wq-y61j-zjNE-T0H4NJ 20971520
    # lvmgrp /dev/vg01 4096 2559 10481664
    #lvmvol /dev/vg01 lvtest 1280 10485760
    # fs /dev/mapper/vg01-lvtest /test1 ext3 uuid=e353949f-1d39-4e43-821b-f81616796dc4 label= blocksize=4096 reserved_blocks=5% max_mounts=23 check_interval=180d options=rw

This is 1. ugly (which I can live with) and 2. - more important -
complicates scripting using this. I prefer the version without the
spaces so that grep| awk '{print$3}' always returns the same fields.

I use this in a script that reports the status after recovery that gives
a readable output about which parts are recovered and which parts are
not.

Hmm, apparently github also does not like this inconsistent commenting.
The lines in bold had a '\# ' (hash space) to start with.

I updated the syntax. You should start and end code blocks with \`\`\` .
Using \# will open a heading.

Good catch. I will fix that.

I also pushed 4d6fac780f9234b55dbb0ca7fa55b56e4fbc7157 so no space
appears after the hash.
