hi,

today i have come accross a situation which i like to share..

Recovery ISO booted, but no memory was available within the boot
image!  
OOM reaper was randomly killing processes resulting in applications to
fail

It appeared that the system in question had an oracle database
installed, and  
oracle or related packages seem to enable the hugepages setting in  
/etc/sysctl.conf:

vm.nr\_hugepages = \[some big value\]

This settings (at least on SLES12) totaly messes up the memory in the  
recovery image (all memory but some left over MB is in use)  
As soon as option is disabled within recovery image:

sysctl -w vm.nr\_hugepages=0

the memory becomes free and everything is working as excpected.  
Maybe that should be documented or during recovery, it might not be the
best idea  
to use sysctl settings as applied to the original system?

@abbbi That is indeed valuable information to take with us (in
documentation) or during the recovery OS image building. Need to think
about it.

especially in enterprise environments. I think other big software
players like SAP do also setup/create sysctl settings that might change
memory behavior in a way that it causes trouble. Yet i fail to
understand why the hugepages setting kicks in in such a way if the
kernel boots via initrd .. Havent done much more testing here yet.

these were the settings that can cause/reproduce the issue:

> /etc/sysctl.conf:  
> fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576  
> fs.file-max = 6815744  
> kernel.shmall = 53687091  
> kernel.shmmax = 219902325555  
> kernel.shmmni = 4096  
> kernel.sem = 250 32000 100 128  
> net.ipv4.ip\_local\_port\_range = 9000 65500  
> net.core.rmem\_default = 262144  
> net.core.rmem\_max = 4194304  
> net.core.wmem\_default = 262144  
> net.core.wmem\_max = 1048586  
> vm.nr\_hugepages = 98304  
> vm.hugetlb\_shm\_group = 488
