##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low** (excessive PBA size)

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

A TCG Opal pre-boot authentication (PBA) system is a minimal operating
system constructed by ReaR to unlock self-encrpyting disks before the
regular OS takes over. Before this PR, it could happen that a previously
created PBA was included in a subsequently created PBA, causing it to be
unnecessarily large.
