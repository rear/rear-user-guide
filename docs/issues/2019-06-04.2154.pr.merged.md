-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The `awk` script on line 43 of
`layout/save/GNU/Linux/260_crypt_layout.sh` was modified to also allow
for an empty third parameter in `/etc/crypttab` (in addition to the
existing values of 'none' and '-').

This difference in the `/etc/crypttab` format is documented in its
openSUSE man page, quoted here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2151\#issuecomment-496575055](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2151#issuecomment-496575055)
(Leap 15.0 version).
