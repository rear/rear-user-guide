Rear works currently only in x86\_64 architectures. The ISO file is not
created in s390x. ISO file is created in ppc64 and ppc64le, but it is
not bootable.

rear-1.17.2-1.el7.noarch

There is output of rear for s390x.

@mmitsugi @k0da Could you do me a favor and have a look if ISO booting
on ppc and ppc64le still works? According RedHat it is broken and I have
no HW to test with.  
Architecture s390x is still unsupported.

Architecture s390x sounds really cool. Please provide pull requests with
code for that. For obvious reasons we don't have one of those standing
under our desk :-)

@gdha sorry for my late reply.  
Regarding the RHEL distro on Power, there are several versions with 2
architectures(ppc64 and ppc64le).

a RHEL6 / ppc64 (yaboot) : it should work. need to check  
b RHEL7 / ppc64 (grub) : not tested yet. still work in progress  
c RHEL7 / ppc64le (grub) : tested / worked when I did pull request. need
to check

@jayfurmanek could you please check that RHEL6 / ppc64 (you created)
still work on current version?

As for RHEL7 / ppc64le, it seems that there is no ppc64le rpm for
current version...  
so we need to patch of rear.spec for ppc64le rpm at first.  
I think ppc64le will be used for OpenSUSE and SLES12, we need to get
review from @k0da

Regarding the RHEL7 / ppc64le, it works fine just by adding ppc64le arch
to rpm spec file.  
I've created the patch \#665.  
Tested platform : PowerVM: RHEL7.1 LE

@gdha After this patch is merged, it would be helpful if your team
upload ppc64le rpm into official site.  
Please let me know if additional verification or support is needed.

@mmitsugi On OpenSuse Build Service I've added *ppc64le*  
Let us wait if it build correctly

FYI:  
currently OBS shows "RHEL\_7 ppc64le excluded" because rear.spec is not
yet up to date in OBS (i.e. currently rear.spec still has
"ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86\_64 ppc ppc64").

I just did a fresh checkout on RHEL6.6 ppc64

$ usr/sbin/rear -V

$ uname -a

$ cat /etc/redhat-release  
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.6 (Santiago)

And it created a bootable ISO just fine. The backup and restore to NFS
works fine as well.

@phracek  
What issues are you seeing? The output of isoinfo on mine looks the same
as yours, but the ISO is indeed bootable.

@phracek

I notice you running RHEL as a VM under KVM. The console may be a bit
different there than under PowerVM. I'll have to give that a shot.

There is one known console bug with RHEL6 when running under KVM on
Power (while using a virtual video card and VNC as the transport). The
console text displays very dark by default. Workarounds are discussed on
this page (Search for 'guest considerations')

I have a question, why rear use Arches (like Exclusive Arch).

I didn't see in code any language or arch specific issues.  
In RHEL 7 we are building rear like noarch. Maybe this is a trouble.

@phracek  
It looks like you are testing RHEL7 (grub) ppc64le.  
I've reconfirmed that REAR does generate a bootable ISO for RHEL6
(yaboot). It also boots fine as a KVM guest - although there may be a
console fix that's needed for KVM.

@mmitsugi  
Have you tested the latest REAR version on RHEL7 (grub) ppc64le on KVM?

@phracek  
I checked latest RHEL7 ppc64le (RHEL7.1 LE :
RHEL-LE-7.1-20150219.1-Server-ppc64le) on KVM, and it works fine in my
environment.

file size seems to be slightly different, but almost same as yours.  
rear configuration is same as well.

libvirt xml description is like following:

        <disk type='file' device='cdrom'>
          <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
          <source file='/var/lib/libvirt/images/rear-mmRHEL71LEk.iso'/>
          <target dev='sdc' bus='scsi'/>
          <readonly/>
          <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='0' target='0' unit='2'/>
        </disk>

I have several questions:

-   Could you provide the contents of ppc/bootinfo.txt in your iso?  
    The bootinfo.txt in my iso is following.

<!-- -->

    <chrp-boot>
    <description>Relax-and-Recover</description>
    <os-name>Linux</os-name>
    <boot-script>boot &device;:\boot\grub\powerpc.elf</boot-script>
    </chrp-boot>

-   size of boot/grub/powerpc.elf in your env seems to be different from
    that in my env.  
    So could you let me know exact RHEL7.1 version you are using?

My ppc/bootinfo.txt is the same:

    <chrp-boot>
    <description>Relax-and-Recover</description>
    <os-name>Linux</os-name>
    <boot-script>boot &device;:\boot\grub\powerpc.elf</boot-script>
    </chrp-boot>

Tested platform: 8 CPUs (virt Power8), 12 GB RAM, KVM guest  
System is RHEL-7.2, though

@phracek  
Thanks for your quick answer. OK, I will check with RHEL7.2 LE Beta.

@phracek  
I tested RHEL-7.2-20150820.0-Server-ppc64le and it seems to work fine.

    # cat /etc/redhat-release 
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.2 Beta (Maipo)

    # uname -a
    Linux mmR72LEbeta 3.10.0-306.0.1.el7.ppc64le #1 SMP Wed Aug 19 16:06:58 EDT 2015 ppc64le ppc64le ppc64le GNU/Linux

So it might be possible that your RHEL beta is too early and has a
problem...  
Please let me know if you have chance to try with other GA version like
7.1 LE and still have a problem.

Well I will try it soon definitely.

And of course I will keep you inform.

Regarding the b RHEL7 / ppc64 (grub), I've created the pull request
\#672 to support.
