Rear version: 2.4  
OS: Centos 7

When im restoring with "rear recover", i see it can talk to Bareos
Director and Start the Job for recovery, but the issue comes when
Director tries to connect to the client to port 9102.

`bareos-dir JobId 47492: Fatal error: lib/bsock_tcp.cc:131 Unable to connect to Client: TEST-CLIENT on 182.11.53.216:9102. ERR=Conexi√≥n rehusada`

On the restoration machine I just see port 22 listening. There's no way
Director can connect to the client if 9102 is not listening. Also I
can't find a service to start bareos-fd

Thanks.

@Theprim0 Please have a look at
[https://gist.github.com/gdha/178504db0f6e0099848c2963ece81b6a\#file-rear-automated-test-sh-log-L197](https://gist.github.com/gdha/178504db0f6e0099848c2963ece81b6a#file-rear-automated-test-sh-log-L197)
for an example local.conf - perhaps your `/etc/rear/local.conf` was not
complete - we cannot tell as it was not attached.

@Theprim0  
I would like to know how you did enter your issue report  
because normally I would assume one uses the \[New issue\] button on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)  
which leads to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new)  
which shows  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
which lists what information we need to be able to do something useful.

In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:  
Usually we at ReaR upstream do not use third-party backup tools  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.  
Nevertheless we try to help - provided we get sufficient information  
so that we have a chance to provide some useful help.

In particular regarding Bareos you may also contact the Bareos team
via  
[https://github.com/bareos](https://github.com/bareos)

I resolved this issue months ago, the problem was:

ReaR could not install/start bareos-fd daemon because on the client, I
had 2 lines commented out:

To make this work, i just commented them both and then made the new iso.

The problem it's because when ReaR tries to recover, it does not
understand the python plugin, so it won't start.

@Theprim0 So, you did not need any plugin for the recovery, right? Could
you briefly explain what these plugins are meant for? And, how do we
know these are not required at all? Otherwise, python and the
`/usr/lib64/bareos/plugins` could be copied over to the DR mediam?

At normal cases, this is not a problem, but it is if you use a plugin
with Bareos.

In my case, I was using the package *bareos-filedaemon-python-plugin* to
make MySql database backups with Bareos.  
There are plugins to backup Postgres, Mysql, LDAP, MSSQL,... databases.

So I guess if there's more people using Bareos with a plugin as this
one, ReaR may not work as expected.

Don't exactly remember if my restore didn't work was because it was
either Bareos trying to load the plugins or Bareos trying to use python.
Or both. (Inside booted ISO)

Maybe if ReaR could come with the needed package, this issue can be
resolved? At least resolved as make it run and restore the files, but
not the database.

More info about Bareos plugins:  
[https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/Plugins.html](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/Plugins.html)

I know this is a specific case, and not too much people using ReaR with
Bareos, and even less with a plugin, but some may, and if that's the
case, this post may help

@Theprim0 Thank you so much for the prompt reply and useful explanation.
I will check it out.
