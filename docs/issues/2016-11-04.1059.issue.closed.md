Point-In-Time-Restore
=====================

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 1.19 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
    OS\_VERSION=6

What about the idea of restoring with rear to an point-in-time?  
So that the user can select or enter an date of point-in-time and the
scripts selects the nearest full backup and the last differential backup
if the date is not the full backup itself.

Hi,  
Since a week or two, ReaR can use
[BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) as
backed. Maybe you can give it a try.  
This might be a good point to
[start](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-iso-with-borg).

V.

Hi,  
From DRLM, we have plans to implement a way to be able to select
available backups in DRLM to restore from rear, is not yet implemented
but we have it on our wishlist/to-dolist.

;)

Hi,  
It is usually possible when running ReaR with a Backup Solution such as
IBM Spectrum Protect (TSM).  
I've tested it, it works well.

@dcz01 Point-in-Time recovery is possible with many backup integrations
that REAR supports (NBU, TSM, DP, NSR, BAREOS, BACULA to name a few).
Only the internal backup programs (like tar and rsync) do not support
this feature in REAR.  
Does this answer your question?

Regarding full backup and differential backup  
see the current ReaR documentation, e.g.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

<pre>
The current implementation supports only to restore
one full backup plus one single incremental backup
so that currently "BACKUP_TYPE=incremental"
actually implements a differential backup
</pre>

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974)

@dcz01  
according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974)  
it seems you actually use "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental"  
with "BACKUP\_PROG=tar".

I think it would be best when you implement support  
for point-in-time-restore with 'tar' in ReaR and  
do a GitHub pull request.

I am not a user of "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" but as far  
as I can imagine it seems a precondition to select a backup  
is that more than one backup.tar.gz is supported in ReaR  
(currently only one is supported in ReaR).

In general regarding issues with the backup:

Relax-and-Recover is neither a backup software nor a  
backup management software and it is not meant to be one, cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover (rear) versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

This means issues regarding the backup usually  
do not belong directly to ReaR but more to the particular  
backup tool that is used by ReaR.

It is very different to what extent support for each  
individual backup tool is implemented in ReaR  
because support for each individual backup tool  
is implemented separated from each other, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1048\#issuecomment-255713645](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1048#issuecomment-255713645)  
and subsequent comments.

Usually only basic support for the various backup tools  
is implemented in ReaR (i.e. plain making a backup during  
"rear mkbackup" and plain restore during "rear recover")  
but even that is sometimes only "very basic", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)

This means when a particular backup tool  
supports point-in-time-restore it is usually  
not (yet) implemented in ReaR, cf.  
"How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

The general basic question is if more and more backup related  
features should be added to ReaR because each feature requires  
that someone volunteers to continuously maintain that feature  
in the future (i.e. fix bugs and adapt it for future changes).

Well i think i understand it now that i should use and external backup
program like tsm for backup and restore and the simply internal backup
solution will not be extended with something like that.  
Then i will close it here now. But thanks for all the answers.
