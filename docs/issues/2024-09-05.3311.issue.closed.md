              Any thoughts why we can't use `find_device` here?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2073e77f1ed213653bbf846d67bef346a9f65da9/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200\_check\_usb\_layout.sh\#L12-L13](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2073e77f1ed213653bbf846d67bef346a9f65da9/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200_check_usb_layout.sh#L12-L13)

It seems to me like our code simply doesn't handle the nvme use case
yet, it assumes a sysfs device path like
`/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.0/host2/target2:0:1/2:0:1:0/block/sdb/sdb1`
whereas in your example we have
`devices/pci0000:c0/0000:c0:03.3/0000:c5:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1`

@xwhitebeltx have you tried creating a partition and specifying that
instead of the whole disk?

@schlomo To use the `find_disk` function in script
`lib/layout-functions.sh` there is a problem in function
`get_parent_components` on line `done < $LAYOUT_DEPS`  
The $LAYOUT\_DEPS is empty.  
When we add in the function
`LAYOUT_DEPS="$VAR_DIR/layout/diskdeps.conf"` then it works better.  
However, that being said it is better not to use `find_disk` function as
it searches the diskdeps.conf file for the parent device. And, in this
case (nvme0n1) it will not find it as it is skipped as an empty device
(by savelayout).  
The reason why LAYOUT\_DEPS variable is empty in above case (with
treating nvme0n1 as an USB device) is because the initialization of
these variables is only done in the savelayout workflow.  
We need to find a better why.

Therefore, I propose to remove the comments in
[rear/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200\_check\_usb\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2073e77f1ed213653bbf846d67bef346a9f65da9/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200_check_usb_layout.sh#L12-L13)
as it is misleading info.

Was able to get it to work - still need to test it with legacy USB
devices.
