When I try to restore a SLES10 SP3 OES2SP2 Linux install from the the
rear rescue iso, I get the error:  
No code has been generated to retore device pv:/dev/mapper/sda2
(lvmdev)  
Here is the output of disklayout.conf:

@microchipmatt I noticed that you are using evms
(`fs /dev/evms/lvm2/system/root / reiserfs`) which to my knowledge is
*not* supported by rear. Personally, I never worked wit evms so I'm not
much of help in this particular case.

That was my fear...was that it wasn't supported....I am struggling to
find a decent way to protect my old oes2 spy servers running on SLES 10
with EVMS/LVM containers...it was the old management system for Novell
OES SLES 10 Linux and NSS before NLVM.

OES2? Long time no see...

I basically can imagine the following options:

-   [Convert EVMS to
    LVM](http://evms.sourceforge.net/user_guide/#evmstocomp)
-   Contribute code to ReaR to support EVMS (IMHO not worth the effort
    as EVMS is a dead project)
-   Use a different backup method for your system, for example based on
    Imaging.
-   If this is a VM, backup the VM on the hypervisor level.
-   ...

HTH,

Need to add to the documentation that EVMS is not supported.
