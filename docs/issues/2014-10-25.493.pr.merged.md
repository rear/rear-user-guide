hi:  
this patch tried to fix when drbd use "/dev/vg/lv" as backend device,
rear won't recognize it's the same device as "/dev/mapper/vg-lv". since
there maybe other situation which also use "/dev/vg/lv" as backend
device, maybe it's better to fix it in the layout-function and other
script can benefit with it.
