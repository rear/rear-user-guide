I just notice that initrd were not correctly created in sles11 since we
change chroot usage (stop using loggin).

mkinitramfs call other tools (dirname, getent, perl ...) without a
correctly configured $PATH, this operation failed.

Here is the way to reproduce it :

    RESCUE sles11sap-144:~ # TARGET_FS_ROOT=/mnt/local
    RESCUE sles11sap-144:~ # mount -t proc none $TARGET_FS_ROOT/proc
    RESCUE sles11sap-144:~ # mount -t sysfs none $TARGET_FS_ROOT/sys
    RESCUE sles11sap-144:~ # mkinitrd_binary=$( chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash -c 'PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bi
    n:/bin type -P mkinitrd' )
    RESCUE sles11sap-144:~ # chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT $mkinitrd_binary

ReaR does no longer use a login shell in chroot  
since I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1171)  
but the root cause of that was to avoid issues  
with basically broken setups of the 'root' user so that

<pre>
chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login
</pre>

fails, see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862)

This issue here shows that my attempt to avoid possible  
issues with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1171)  
may in practice cause more issues that it solves.

Therefore I am now thinking about if I should perhaps  
better revert
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/117](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/117)  
and use a login shell by default for all 'chroot' calls  
and add appropriate documentatiuon in ReaR that

<pre>
chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login
</pre>

is a required precondition for ReaR and I could also  
implement a check in ReaR that tests whether or not  
that actually works (during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue")  
that errors out if it does not work, see  
build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh

@gdha @gozora @schlomo  
I added you as reviewers here mainly because I like  
to know your opinion about whether or not ReaR  
should use a login shell by default for all 'chroot' calls,  
see also my "Reason" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862\#issuecomment-274068914](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862#issuecomment-274068914)

By sleeping over it my mind produced a better idea:  
First things first:  
Accordingly I will merge this one soon because it fixes a bug.  
Then we have all time we need to find out what the best way is  
how 'chroot' commands should be done by default in ReaR.

If there are no objections I will mege it in a few hours.

Strange, at least for me the \[Merge pull request\] button  
here at GitHub does no lnger work.  
Nothing happens when I click it.  
I tried two different Firefox browsers on two different machines  
(one on SLES11 and another one on openSUSE Leap 42.1).

@jsmeix

For me it looks to be working fine ...

Maybe try to clear cache ?

@gozora  
it also worked for me on a third machine (my SLES12 test system)  
where I use Firefox with its out-of-the-box default settings.  
On my workstations where it does not work for me  
I have somewhat more restricted Firefox settings.  
Now I have fun with finding out what exact restriction makes  
GitHub buttons and other interactive stuff like that  
no longer work for me ;-)
