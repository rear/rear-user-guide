    it):  
    With a huge number of users, groups and users in each group (tens of
    thousands), ReaR may abort with this in the log:

        Including rescue/default/900_clone_users_and_groups.sh
        Cloning users:  daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus
        /usr/share/rear/rescue/default/900_clone_users_and_groups.sh: xrealloc: cannot allocate 18446744071562067968 bytes (6635520 bytes allocated)

    The underlying problem is:

    -   /usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf ends up setting
        `${CLONE_USERS[0]}` to `""`:
            CLONE_USERS=( "${CLONE_USERS[@]:-}" daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus )

    -   This then results in the for loop in
        [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/b7a75c3a39ee8cf0402f83da7fca8df231c7b979/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/900\_clone\_users\_and\_groups.sh\#L42](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/b7a75c3a39ee8cf0402f83da7fca8df231c7b979/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/900_clone_users_and_groups.sh#L42)
        doing 'getent passwd' without additional parameters in the first
        iteration, thus dumping ALL users (`$user` is set to `""`)
            for user in "${CLONE_USERS[@]}" ; do
                # Skip if the user exists already in the ReaR recovery system:
                grep -q "^$user:" $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/passwd && continue
                # Skip if the user does not exist in the current system:
                if ! passwd_entry="$( getent passwd $user )" ; then
                    Debug "Cannot clone user $user because it does not exist"
                    continue
                fi

    -   The script then ends up doing a 'getent group $groupID' where
        groupID which is every users GID
            groupID="$( cut -d ':' -f '4' <<<"$passwd_entry" )"
            if ! group_entry="$( getent group $groupID )" ; then

    -   With such a large number of users, groups and users in each
        groups, the output of the last command is so huge that the
        assignment to `group_entry` overflows some internal limit of
        bash.

    The problematic case is hard to reproduce as it requires a really
    large amount of users, groups and users per group. However, the
    underlying problem (which seems mostly harmless in more limited
    settings) manifests itself easily:

        Cloning users:  daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus

    Note the additional space after :. This space is printed in the
    first iteration of the loop with `$user` empty.

    The root cause is the introduction of empty array elements in PR
    \#699 to pacify `set -ue` in bash 3, which can not cope with empty
    arrays - so those were replaced by arrays with one empty member.
    (Since there are more arrays which were changed this way in this
    commit, it is possible that similar errors are more widespread.) See
    our discussion in
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c19647fcd95f0c3f4020f39f5fad428e8359ec92\#r32912187](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c19647fcd95f0c3f4020f39f5fad428e8359ec92#r32912187),

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Not sure about workaround, but there are several possible fixes:

    -   The cleanest would be to revert the parts of PR \#699 that
        introduce those empty array elements. The resulting problem in
        bash 3 and `set -ue` could be dealt with in the following ways:

        -   by ignoring it, i.e desupport bash 3 together with
            `set -ue`.  
            This does not seem to be a big problem, as `set -ue` in
            general (even bash 4) is apparently broken without anybody
            noticing:
            [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1720/files\#r317556097](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1720/files#r317556097)
            and there are further places that probably broke it more for
            bash 3 (non-exhaustive list, and some of them may be false
            positives, i.e. the arrays become non-empty at some point):

        -   by protecting the array expansion in a bash 3 and `set -ue`
            compatible way: i.e. instead of `for i in "${A[@]}"` write
            `for i in ${A+"${A[@]:-}"}`. To test for an empty array,
            write `(( ${#A[@]} ))` or `[ ${#A[@]} -gt 0 ]`. This is
            possible, but would require lots of changes which would make
            the code a bit less readable.

    -   In the present case, a less invasive change would be to replace
        the appending to the array

               CLONE_USERS=( "${CLONE_USERS[@]:-}" daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus )

        by `+=`, i.e.

               CLONE_USERS+=( daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus )

        (I've verified that `+=` works properly even in bash 3 and
        `set -ue`.) This would fix the present case and other cases
        where the problem lies in appending to arrays, but not those
        where the array is already initialized to `("")`.

    -   The most basic fix is to compensate for the fake empty element:

            for user in "${CLONE_USERS[@]}" ; do
                [[ -z ${user:-} ]] && continue
                # Skip if the user exists already in the ReaR recovery system:

        and if similar problems are found or newly introduced elsewhere,
        fix them in a similar way.

        It is also the least desirable fix IMHO, because it pollutes the
        code to work around an artificial element that should not be
        there in the first place, and one will have to remember to work
        around it in every new loop that is introduced.

    I would to like to discuss which path to take and I will then submit
    a PR.

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for your careful analysis of the underlying root
cause  
and for your explanatory and comprehensive description.

Offhandedly I think this is just one more example that shows  
why 'set -eu' looks good in theory but does not work well in practice.

What does in particular not work in practice (with reasonable effort)  
is 'set -u'.

I experienced that yesterday with a privately made and used bash
script.  
While 'set -e' can be quite useful in practice at places where one must
not  
blindly proceeed with the next command unless the current command
succeeded  
(the best example for that in ReaR is the diskrestore.sh script),  
I think 'set -u' is only useful while one is making and testing a
script  
because it helps to detect misspelled variable names (for example  
as in `counter=conuter+1`) but from my experience 'set -u' as a general
setting  
while scripts are run does more harm than good.

So my current conclusion is to revert those things (in particular the
dummy  
array elements) that I had added to make the code work with 'set -u'  
because those added stuff breakes other code at other places.

Furthermore the ReaR code is meant to be adapted and enhanced as
needed  
by the user which means our scripts should be as much as possible in
compliance  
with "the usual way" how a normal bash script is made nowadays in
practice  
to avoid unexpected behaviour for the user when he changed a script.

By the way a related side note:  
Our global `shopt -s nullglob` setting in usr/sbin/rear  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L292](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L292)  
is another example where ReaR scripts do not behave as usually
expected:  
Have "fun" with code like `grep something my*files`  
when nothing matches `my*files` ;-)

@pcahyna  
regarding your

    ... set -ue in general (even bash 4) is apparently broken
    without anybody noticing:
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1720/files#r317556097

Currently only the 'help' workflow should work with 'set -ue'  
all other workflows do not yet work with 'set -ue', cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700\#issuecomment-158332829](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700#issuecomment-158332829)  
and in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/699)

    2.)
    I fixed all what fails because of 'set -ue -o pipefail'
    for the "help" workflow as a very first step into that direction.

Since that time nothing more was done, because it is questionable  
if it is worth the effort to make the code ready for 'set -eu',

What needs to be fixed in any case in

    The most basic fix is to compensate for the fake empty element:

    for user in "${CLONE_USERS[@]}" ; do

because CLONE\_USERS and CLONE\_GROUPS are user config variables

@hartsjc  
many thanks for your laborious analysis of the issue!

I think I will add a new section

    Beware of the emptiness!

to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
because so many tools behave very different if run with empty argument  
for example  
`grep something $some_file` when $some\_file is empty or only blanks  
STDIN is used which lets rear hang up in practice because  
the user won't provide input  
or  
`ls $some_dir` when $some\_dir is empty or only blanks which  
lists the current working directory (cf. above `shopt -s nullglob`)  
which is in practice always wrong because if one wants to list  
the current working directory one would not use $some\_dir  
and so on...

I would not say it is a good idea to clutter the code with such tests
for things that user might do wrong with variables. What if users
accidentally sets it to "-h" or "-V" for example, I doubt that "getent"
will work as expected in this case. If this is really a concern, I
rather propose a shared function to validate arrays.  
I will send a PR for appending using +=, which is IMO the preferable
way, as it is simple yet clean (and does not interfere with your fix).

@pcahyna  
I think there is a practical difference between when the user sets  
a non-empty wrong value where it is visible that this cannot work  
e.g. the value `$( rm -rf * )` ;-)  
compared to an empty or empty looking value where one may  
assume that what one cannot see cannot have a (bad) effect,  
so I think "beware of the emptiness" is reasonable and helpful  
in practice while it would be over the top if we tried to make ReaR  
safe against any possible nonsense values.

I replaced in the comments in default.conf  
`ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" additional elements `)  
with the simpler and more fail safe  
`ARRAY+=( additional elements )`  
according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220\#issue-487102052](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220#issue-487102052)

    I've verified that += works properly even in bash 3 and set -ue

@pcahyna  
do you think it would be a good idea to replace  
`ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" additional elements )`  
with  
`ARRAY+=( additional elements )`  
everywhere in the ReaR code?

I did a quick `find . | xargs grep '=(.*[@]'` in ReaR master code  
which indicates there are more than 400 places where we use  
`ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" additional elements )`

@jsmeix yes, I don't see a reason why not to append using +=, do you
know why it has not been used in ReaR?

`grep something "$some_file"` and `ls "$some_dir"` behave properly, i.e.
fail. Empty parameter is not the same as a missing parameter, which
indeed often has a special meaning. The problem with bash that it makes
way too easy to treat undefined variables as missing values, instead of
as empty values. One more reason to quote variable expansion properly
(one should do it anyway because of blanks in values etc.). I think it
is therefore more productive to focus on quoting parameter expansion
rather than on inserting more and more code to guard against empty or
blank values.

@pcahyna  
I do not know why `+=` was not used in ReaR.  
I guess perhaps because at the time when ReaR started  
`+=` might have been not yet supported in bash?

I would very much appreciate it if you could find an automated command  
(e.g. via `sed` or whatever tool you like) that replaces

    ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" additional elements )

with

    ARRAY+=( additional elements )

everywhere in the ReaR code without changing "false positives"  
i.e. without creating regressions.

You are right that proper quoting is mandatory for fail safe code  
but in practice ... :-(

FYI  
an example where I intentionally do not quote:

    # Ensure $foo is a single non empty and non blank word
    # (no quoting because test " " returns zero exit code):
    test $foo ...

Perhaps there is a better way to do that?

@jsmeix Would it work to use `shopt -s failglob` instead of
`shopt -s nullglob` ?

I think in practice (i.e. with reasonable effort)  
we cannot change our global bash globbing settings  
because we cannot know at which places in all of the scripts  
the `nullglob` behaviour is required to make things work  
because usually there are no comments or other signs  
how we could detect places that need `nullglob`.

An example how `nullglob` behaviour lets things work as intened  
while `failglob` would let things completely fail in a bad way:

    # ( shopt -s nullglob ; set -x ; tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar /etc/issue /optional/stuff* /etc/fstab && echo OK || echo Error $? )

    + tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar /etc/issue /etc/fstab
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    /etc/issue
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    /etc/fstab
    + echo OK
    OK

where `nullglob` gracefully skips non-existent optional files  
versus

    # ( shopt -s failglob ; set -x ; tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar /etc/issue /optional/stuff* /etc/fstab && echo OK || echo Error $? )

    -bash: no match: /optional/stuff*

where the whole command is not at all executed.

But how could one autodetect pieces of code like

    tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar /etc/issue /optional/stuff* /etc/fstab && echo OK || echo Error $?

that require `nullglob` behaviour ?

Searching for any bash globbing patterns in the code would be possible  
but I fear there are way too many places where bash globbing patterns  
are used in the code so I think in practice (i.e. with reasonable
effort)  
we cannot change our global bash globbing settings.
