Bridge interfaces are widely used. This patch enables configurations
as  
shown below:

1.  Bridge over simple Ethernet
2.  Bridge over Bond
3.  Bridger over Vlan interface

Bridges require the 'brctl' utility. This patch automatically includes  
the utility upon need.  
Usually, virtual interfaces are skipped, but for Bridges to work, we  
consider Bridges as physical interfaces, because the Bridge interface  
holds the IP address, not the physical interface attached to the Bridge.

Hello @rmetrich  
First and foremost thanks for this patch!

I have one question though, imagine that original system was setup
without bridge-utils (containing `brctl`) and iproute2 was used instead
(for whatever reason).  
Do we want to force users to install additional packages despite they
are not really needed for restore?

@gozora You are right, I've rewritten the code to use iproute2 only.  
@gdha I don't understand your point, the bridge\_handling function is
used to create the bridge commands in the 60-network-devices.sh
generated script.

Hello @rmetrich,

Just one more remark, bridge configuration requires bridge.ko kernel
module, which I'm afraid is not bundled into ReaR recovery system by
default. So you might consider using
[MODULES](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L762)
(or similar) configuration option somewhere in your code.

@gozora thanks, good point. Was already included in my kernel but who
knows ...

@gdha hello, please advise regarding the bridge\_handling function: I
don't understand your point, the bridge\_handling function is used to
create the bridge commands in the 60-network-devices.sh generated
script.

@rmetrich What I meant with the **bridge\_handling** function is to
*move* the function code itself to a library script (e.g. the
`lib/network-functions.sh`) instead of keeping it inside script
`310_network_devices.sh` (pure cosmetic and easier to read). Functions
should never (well almost never) be part of a script. We have a special
location for it under `lib/` directory.  
Hopefully I expressed myself better then before?

@gdha hmm, here the function adds to generated script
($network\_devices\_setup\_script), same as function vlan\_setup and
bond\_setup, so should likely remain local.

@rmetrich OK then - keep it together if you prefer that.

@gdha Is there something special required from me? Such as squashing the
commits?

A side note regarding functions that are used only in one script:

I prefer to keep local stuff local so that I prefer to have  
such functions defined only in the script where needed  
and not globally defined.

In particular because such functions are often a bit  
"quick and dirty" which is perfectly o.k. for a specific  
script-local function that is not intended to be usable  
in whatever generic ways by arbitrary scripts.

Because bash does not support

<pre>
local function ...
</pre>

such script-local function should be better 'unset -f'  
when leaving the script (also care about 'return'), e.g. see  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh

@jsmeix Sounds reasonable. Added the unset for all local functions in
310\_network\_devices.sh

I'm not satisfied with my code, specially the bridges purely virtual
(e.g. libvirt) get configured, which is useless.
