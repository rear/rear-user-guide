Yes indeed. However, this PR is meant for ReaR v2.6 (RHEL) and would
like to keep the `/etc/inittab` dependency removal for another issue

Hi @gdha , thank you for the PR, but I am not able to reproduce the
original issue. On EL9, sshd works for me in the rescue system without
any changes (but, I am not using Putty, is it doing anything special?).
Do you please have some logs from the failed sshd start-up that might
help with reproducing the problem? Do you have a custom sshd\_config?

Unfortunately, no logs as it was during the boot up and ReaR did enable
the RSA sshd key, but our putty enforce the ed25519 key and that was not
present, therefore, no login via putty was possible.

So the root cause was an SSH key policy on the SSH *client* side that
triggered the problem? And our fix is to also generate modern SSH keys
and not only old SSH keys?

I think that this is good for us to support modern and more secure
standards...

I was wondering if maybe instead of looking for missing keys under a
default name we could either check for missing files from the
configuration or maybe even check the configuration on the source system
and remember the SSH key files and types to re-created?

E.g. something like this could be used to remember the key files and
types:

    # sshd -T | grep "hostkey /" | while read _ key ; do method=( $(ssh-keygen -y -f $key) ) ; echo $key $method ; done
    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key ssh-rsa
    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key ssh-ed25519

and then we generate them all and the code would be a bit more future
proof with regard to key file names and types. As we copy over the
original `sshd_config` this might make ReaR more robust as we don't
depend on hard-coded SSH host key file names.

Thanks for the explanation. Makes sense, with this information I think I
will be able to reproduce it easily (I would not describe the problem as
"On EL9 sshd will not start anymore", though .... )

There is a script in the `build` stage that generates a key if present
on the original system and not present in the rescue ramdisk, but the
algorithm is a bit different (it does not check the configuration, it
checks the existence of the actual files, which could be even better, as
we want to have the rescue ramdisk close to the original system if
feasible).

@pcahyna I suppose that our current approach is based on hard coded
assumptions around the actual file names of the host keys:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/bce2750933fae8c8bd328e5378c8ad435d0166d1/usr/share/rear/build/default/500\_ssh\_setup.sh\#L140](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/bce2750933fae8c8bd328e5378c8ad435d0166d1/usr/share/rear/build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh#L140)

I was wondering if it is safe to assume that these file names are indeed
the same across all distros and SSHD versions?

I am not able to reproduce the problem with the missing
`/usr/share/empty.sshd` though. In my test, the directory exists in the
rescue image. It has been created here:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/bce2750933fae8c8bd328e5378c8ad435d0166d1/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh\#L73-L79](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/bce2750933fae8c8bd328e5378c8ad435d0166d1/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh#L73-L79)  
@gdha is there something unusual on the system if the directory does not
get created? On EL9, `getent passwd sshd` should print this:

    sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separated SSH:/usr/share/empty.sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin

You can check what is in the rescue ramdisk by using `rear -d mkrescue`
without rebooting - the build area will be left under `/var/tmp` for
examination.

`rear -D mkrescue` and the resulting log is even more informative. I see
this:

@pcahyna I see the following:

    ++ mkdir -v -p /oem/rear.BLHLE9eXuu48WDU/rootfs//var/empty/sshd

    mode of '/oem/rear.BLHLE9eXuu48WDU/rootfs//var/empty/sshd' retained as 0700 (rwx------)

and the output of:

    #-> getent passwd sshd
    sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separated SSH:/var/empty/sshd:/sbin/nologin

However, I'm 100% sure that after the failed ssh login session I had to
create on the console the directory `/usr/share/empty.ssh`. I wonder if
this is something embedded in sshd?

Indeed it seems hardcoded:

    # strings /usr/sbin/sshd | grep empty
    (...)
    /usr/share/empty.sshd

sshd(8) manual page reads:

         /usr/share/empty.sshd
                 chroot(2) directory used by sshd during privilege separation in
                 the pre-authentication phase.  The directory should not contain
                 any files and must be owned by root and not group or world-
                 writable.

and it does not mention that the directory is configurable.  
On Debian it reads:

         /run/sshd
                 chroot(2) directory used by sshd during privilege separation in
                 the pre-authentication phase.  The directory should not contain
                 any files and must be owned by root and not group or world-
                 writable.

So apparently the directory is set during build time (and
distro-specific), and the build embeds it both in the `sshd` binary and
the manual page.

I am afraid you have an inconsistent system (wrong user entry for
`sshd`). Do you know where it has come from?

The system was upgraded last year from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9 and for the rest
it is a pretty standard RHEL system. No special software installed that
could impact sshd, except perhaps we enforcing the use of ed25519 key.

Indeed on RHEL 8:

    # getent passwd sshd
    sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separated SSH:/var/empty/sshd:/sbin/nologin

so what we see here is actually a result of a bad upgrade procedure - I
need to check whether it is a bug in the upgrade tooling or the upgrade
was somehow botched.

This - there is apparently nothing in the sshd package to change the
user when the directory changes, same problem on Fedora - older version
used `/var/empty/sshd`, new versions use `/usr/share/empty.sshd`, but on
an upgraded Fedora, the user still has `/var/empty/sshd` as $HOME.

should rather be in the package scriptlet than in Leapp as Fedora needs
it as well. Anyway, a conversion step needs to be somewhere. I will
report it to the openssh package maintainers.
