### Platform

Linux x64

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

When performing a DR on a system with lots of disks it may become
cumbersome to know which disk relates to the original disk, therefore,
it would be nice that in the rear logs also the disk size would be
listed. That makes life a bit easier to tag which disk is linked to what
(of the original ones).

    2025-02-28 09:05:07.483250556 Original disk /dev/sde does not exist (with same size) in the target system
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.489534091 /dev/sda excluded from device mapping choices (is already used as mapping target)
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.495736646 /dev/sdb excluded from device mapping choices (is already used as mapping target)
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.501468133 /dev/sdc excluded from device mapping choices (is already used as mapping target)
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.507184561 /dev/sdd excluded from device mapping choices (is already used as mapping target)
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.509295222 sr0 excluded from device mapping choices (is a removable device)
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.510573838 No device found where to /dev/sde could be mapped so that it will not be recreated
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.515821124 Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/sda => /dev/sda
      /dev/sdb => /dev/sdb
      /dev/sdc => /dev/sdc
      /dev/sdd => /dev/sdd
    2025-02-28 09:05:07.528597125 Currently unmapped disks and dependent devices will not be recreated

**PS**: this script requires that library script
`usr/share/rear/lib/write-protect-functions.sh` is available as well
(could be important if back-ported to ReaR v2.6).

### Describe the solution you'd like

Will create a Pull Request \#3412 . It has been tested out in a real DR
scenario already.

Thanks to the mentioned sizes it was for me much easier to verify it
picked the right disk devices (with the corresponding size). Before it
was not that simple (more guessing).

I dare to close it when it is "fixed/solved/done".
