SLE 11 SP3 **dosfsutils** package does not include **dosfslabel**
utility. This patch obsoletes **dosfslabel** by **blkid** and
**mkfs.vfat**. The installation of no external **dosfsutils** package
would be required on UEFI booting system. See also \#229.

This includes all patches from my fork by mistake. I close the request
and will push another one
