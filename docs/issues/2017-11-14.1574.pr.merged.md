This work is a solution for Issue \#1561.

It consists in a full rewrite of the **310\_network\_devices.sh** script
generating network interfaces for use during the ReaR recovery early
boot.  
It also handles corner cases/odd setups that can be found from time to
time, typically when the administrator uses bonding + bridges + vlans as
well as teaming.  
With that new code, adding new configurations will be very easy in the
future.

I also added interface mapping code to the corresponding
**350\_routing.sh** script generating routes.

In the **tests/** directory, you will 2 setups that I used to verify the
network generation code. It covers quite a lot of setups found.

@rmetrich  
many thanks for your substantial work!

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1561\#issuecomment-343891104](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1561#issuecomment-343891104)  
I set it to "ReaR 2.4"

@gdha @gozora  
I dared to set you as reviewers here. I would very much  
appreciate it if you could have a look if there are perhaps  
immediately visible possible issues with the new code.  
Many thanks in advance!

The only thing that bothers me are the Unit Tests - nice to have but do
they belong in the code? There are pros and contras for it. We can leave
it here for the moment

@gdha  
does your approval mean that from your current point of view  
we could even merge it into ReaR 2.3 or should we wait in any  
case and merge it directly after ReaR 2.3 was released (to get  
it tested by ReaR users until ReaR 2.4 will be released).

@jsmeix I would prefer that we release 2.3 first and then do the merge
as then we will have plenty of time to test the code base.

@gdha I put the unit tests here just for reference.  
Since network configurations can be very tricky, I believe having unit
tests may help in the future, making sure nothing breaks.

I also prefer to release ReaR 2.3 first to stay on the safe side.

@rmetrich I can't tell nothing less then IMPRESSIVE! ;-)

As i'm not much of a "code reader", I'd need to test this directly by
clone and run ...  
I will do that over this weekend and you guys know how it went ...

"Sufficiently", did you find issues?

:-), no but I never actually used all those fancy ReaRs networking
options and if my network is not up properly, I just configure it
manually ;-).  
I've found some problems with
*320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh* where I got following
error:

    2017-11-18 11:21:39.162298984 SED_SCRIPT: ';s/08:00:27:2a:4f:0a/08:00:27:76:fa:e7/g;s/eth0/eth0

I'm pretty sure that this is not related to your work though.

I've tested your PR in vlan over bonded device and it worked well, and
as I did not had time to test it much further I've choose word
"Sufficiently" hope you don't mind ;-)

@rmetrich At a RHEL6.5 server with several bridges and bonding
interfaces here the ip link command mentions an

> bridge: unkown command "stp\_state"?

The version in use is "ip utility, iproute2-ss091226".  
During recovery the created script
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh` thus will not create
the bridges here.

@hpannenb Thanks for reporting. I'll test on RHEL6 and adjust.

@hpannenb Please try the latest code.  
I reworked many things for "ancient" releases.

@rmetrich I tested with Your pull request \#1605 and on the RHEL6 Server
the interfaces, bonding and bridges were created as supposed to. Thanks
for Your coding effort.

@hpannenb Thanks for feedback. I initially didn't test on RHEL6 because
we (Red Hat) do not ship ReaR 2.x on RHEL6 ...
