-   Brief description of the issue

I tried rear for the first time last night. Everything seemed to be
working until rear had finished recovering my MATE 16.04 install and it
said it would not boot because it hadn't installed a bootloader because
there was no code for installing GRUB for Ubuntu 16.04 i386.

The main problem here is that rear incorrectly detected a 64 bit Ubuntu
distro as being i386 but I'm surprised rear doesn't support installing
GRUB for Ubuntu 16.04 i386 / 32 bit! If rear supported any 32 bit
distros at all I expected Ubuntu 16.04 i386 would be supported. Does
this mean rear has dropped support for 32 bit distros?

I was disappointed with MATE 16.04 so I'm going back to Arch. I hope
rear supports installing grub / doing a complete recovery under both 32
and 64 bit Arch?

Hello @danboid  
Ubuntu MATE 16.04 **x64** is kind of new processor type for me (never
had MATE installed ...),

Could you please provide output from `getconf LONG_BIT`, just to be sure
...

Thanks

Hi Gozora

MATE is my fave Linux desktop - its an updated GNOME 2 that now has GTK3
support etc.

I'm not quite sure what you're asking me to do. Is getconf a script that
comes with rear? I've already installed Arch on the laptop I was testing
rear / Ubuntu MATE with but I'm willing to give it another go if you
think we can fix it, even if I don't want to use Ubuntu (MATE) 16.04 any
more. If anything should work with rear, it's Ubuntu.

I think you want me to restore my MATE recovery, manually fix grub to
get it to boot and then run `getconf LONG_BIT`, right?

You didn't answer my question about 32 bit / i386 support. Does rear
still support 32 bit distros? If so, how come it doesn't support Ubuntu
16.04 i386? I thought the grub install procedure was the same on 64 bit
vs 32 bit anyway?

Well, so far I've dealt mostly with 64-bit Linux version which
identified with processor type string **x86\_64** (not x64). That's why
I've mentioned that this kind of string is new for me.  
if you execute `getconf LONG_BIT` on your normally running MATE, it
should return integer 32 or 64, which should definitively answer the
question if you have 32-bit or 64-bit version of CPU.

Regarding your question about support, yes I'd say code for restoring
32-bit and 64-bit should be same and ReaR should not have any trouble
restoring it. My best guess would be that this just some minor issue
coming from your *lsb\_release* output and string **x64**.

Yes, I was running Ubunbtu MATE x86\_64 on an i7 laptop. x86\_64, x64
and amd64 are interchangeable terms. I just use x64 because its quicker
to type.

If the code is the same for restoring 32 and 64 bit (which I believe it
should be. despite not having looked) then I should've never got this
error. If there was a need for such an error, I would've preferred to
get told about it before starting the backup rather than after recovery.

Yes, I agree you should be warned.  
But again, what I see in your output in ReaR issue template is confusing
me:

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Ubuntu MATE
    16.04 **x64**

So before diving any deeper into this, I'd like to see what would be
output of `getconf LONG_BIT`

Seeing as I don't have any Ubuntu MATE installs now I went into
\#ubuntu-mate on Freenode and asked someone runnng Ubuntu MATE 16.04
x86\_64 to run `getconf LONG_BIT` and they got `64`

@danboid maybe one further question.  
Did you use UEFI or legacy boot?

Legacy / BIOS and I installed to a single XFS partition on sda1 with no

Within rear `x86_64` and `i386` are the same and rear uses internally
**i386** as identifier.

@danboid For Arch rear has no up-to-date package so far, perhaps, you
can help us with this?

hmm, looks like I've (again) misunderstood something :-).  
Just installed Mate and *lsb\_release -a* is showing:

    sodoma@mate:~$  lsb_release -a
    No LSB modules are available.
    Distributor ID: Ubuntu
    Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
    Release:    16.04
    Codename:   xenial

So this makes sense now:

> Yes, I was running Ubunbtu MATE x86\_64 on an i7 laptop. x86\_64, x64
> and amd64 are interchangeable terms. I just use x64 because its

ok, ok, ok  
So string **x64** is fully irrelevant!

Will try backup restore now.

gdha:

That's strange that rear should see x86\_64 and i386 as being the same -
I would've thought that was a bug unless you told me it was intentional.
Why does it do this?

If they are the same as far as rear is concerned then the error I got
would mean rear has no code for installing GRUB for Ubuntu 16.04 x86\_64
which is very likely the most popular Linux distro and platform right
now.

I've not tried rear under Arch yet but it is in the AUR and it has been
updated recently:

[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/relax-and-recover-git/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/relax-and-recover-git/)

I will be trying it under Arch soon, this weekend probably. I will let
you know if I have any issues.

Ok, I have my first findings.  
`rear recover` ended up with error (I guess) similar to yours:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login' to access the recovered system.
    Please remember to mount /proc before trying to install a boot loader.

The main problem here is however not missing ReaR code for i386
platforms.  
Message *Installing for i386-pc platform* is coming from `grub-install`.
Meaning that if you would run `grub-install /dev/sda` on your running
system, you'd get very same message.

The problem you are experiencing is that `grub-install` can't detect XFS
filesystem on /dev/sda. I'm currently trying to find out why ...

Hi Gozora!

Yes, I think you're getting the same error I was. Sounds like not many
rear users use XFS if nobody else has reported this. I thought it might
be more popular thanks to it being the default in RHEL/CentOS 7 and its
much faster fsck times vs ext4 but I suppose most distros default to
ext4 still and most people stick with the defaults.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12116358?u=1c5ba9dcee5ca3082f03029a7fbe647efd30eb49&v=4" width="50">[gozora](https://github.com/gozora) commented at [2016-11-11 18:23](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065#issuecomment-260021775):

Now I'm not (again) sure if XFS is the real troublemaker here.  
Once `rear recover` finished, I've try manual `grub-install /dev/sda`
but if failed with:  
`grub-install: error: unknown filesystem.`.  
Then I try MATEs live CD and it failed with same message :-(.

That concludes that `mkfs.xfs` during `rear recover` must have done
something which is not fully OK.  
Anyhow, I'd need to dig a bit deeper into XFS and its options as that
would be probably the key.

But as today is Friday evening I'd need to finish a beer or two first
;-) and will continue to work on this tomorrow.

Will keep you posted.

Hello @danboid,

After doing a bit of research on XFS I've concluded following:

1.  You should not use XFS for booting
2.  You should not use XFS for booting
3.  see pt 1. and 2  
    ;-)

But seriously now. I've setup similar configuration on Ubuntu Mate like
you had, but with one small change. I've created separate /boot
partition with ext3 and ReaR worked as charm.  
I've managed to write a
[patch](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/1e7e4e11315a013461489b1d7f78c7410da94f37)
so if you don't like idea with separate /boot you can
`git clone https://github.com/gozora/rear` and it should work just fine.

The problem you've encountered is quite tricky one. During
`rear recover` following code is executed:

    mkfs.xfs -f $device
    if [ -n "$uuid" ] ; then
       xfs_admin -U $uuid $device >&2
    fi

In case of Ubuntu MATE $uuid is really used, so xfs\_admin sets UUID
right after filesystem is created.  
So far so good. However once you have XFS Self-Describing Metadata
enabled (crc=1), you will get incompatible flag set (this should in
general avoid older kernels to mount this filesystem). With this flag
set `grub-install` will not be able to detect filesystem type and fail.

A small example:

    ### Use xfs_admin to set uuid
    # xfs_admin -U 2d65defa-2593-4542-b293-26cd93f82711 /dev/sda1
    Clearing log and setting UUID
    writing all SBs
    new UUID = 2d65defa-2593-4542-b293-26cd93f82711

    ### Flag is now set and grub-probe (resp grub-install) can't recognize filesystem type
    # grub-probe -d /dev/sda1
    grub-probe: error: unknown filesystem.

    ### Revert uuid back to original 
    # xfs_admin -U restore /dev/sda1
    Clearing log and setting UUID
    writing all SBs
    new UUID = f6cffcf4-49bb-40ed-ad2c-eb754e576e76

    ### All works fine now
    RESCUE mate:~ # grub-probe -d /dev/sda1
    xfs

The patch I've created just removes code where xfs\_admin changes uuid
and delegated uuid creation to mkfs.xfs. As I'm quite new to XFS so I
can't tell if if is good or not. It might be that set uuid option was
introduced just recently to mkfs.xfs so it might not work with older
Linux flavors.

I'd like to ask users in ReaR community who are actively using XFS, if
`mkfs.xfs -m uuid="<uuid>"` was introduced just recently, or it is
present longer.

Thanks for any answer in advance!

V.

It was not so hard after all to find information when was option
`-m uuid=<uuid>` added to mkfs.xfs. Funny thing is that I've discovered
it short after I click comment :-).  
Anyhow, according following
[link](http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=xfs/cmds/xfsprogs.git;a=commit;h=6af48b97f8ef7196e1303996995b3614dde24ec2)
it was added just recently in mkfs.xfs 4.3.0.  
So I'll need to modify patch i've wrote.

@gdha @jsmeix or anybody else out there, I'd suggest following:  
Try `mkfs.xfs -m uuid=<uuid>` as first option and once it fails fallback
to `xfs_admin -U <uuid>` would would you say?

Hi Gozora

Thanks for investigating this. I've never been a fan of boot partitions
so I've always avoided them where possible. I don't really know much
about XFS myself - all I know is that it fscks much faster than ext3/4
and supports larger filesystems so thats why I use it, not that I really
need the latter advantage.

I'm hoping we can find a solution to this that doesn't require me having
to patch my rear installs to run with XFS without an ext /boot
partition. Otherwise a new error message will need to be added to warn
users about this issue.

I'm surprised XFS is still getting new features as it must be 20 years
old now.

hello @danboid  
Well, migrating existing installations to /boot can be indeed painful.
Like I already said, you can use
[https://github.com/gozora/rear](https://github.com/gozora/rear), I'm
pretty sure it will work just fine with your current MATE setup (it will
however fail if you use it with older XFS version resp. kernels).  
I can't tell you if this exact code will (and when) be pushed to
upstream. See
[comment](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065#issuecomment-260149486),
but I'm currently working on XFS code that should work with old and new
XFS versions just fine.

I never followed XFS development but it looks like they are still adding
new featured and what is (for me) more concerning, they are changing
defaults.  
A small comparison on SLES11 SP3, Centos 7.2 and Ubuntu Mate 16.4

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>OS</th>
<th>Self-Describing Metadata (CRC)</th>
<th>Change uuid with mkfs.xfs</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SLES11 SP3</td>
<td>NO</td>
<td>NO</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Centos 7.2</td>
<td>YES (not default)</td>
<td>NO</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Mate 16.4</td>
<td>YES (default)</td>
<td>YES</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I can say now with certainty is that current ReaR code will not restore
(without user interaction) OS that is booting from CRC enabled XFS.

Will I need to install your version or can I run it (under Arch but with
the same local.conf) without installation? Is rear installation
optional? The local.conf would have to be in place, of course.

@danboid  
This patch updates just one file, so all you need is download
[usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gozora/rear/136d112a0c800ce7b436b413cab182d402910066/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130_include_filesystem_code.sh)
from my repo, and replace your local copy. All other files (including
local.conf) can remain unchanged.

Going OT briefly - does incremental backup to a samba share work? Does
rear backup to a flat, uncompressed filesystem to do this?

Is there a panel applet to show the status of rear syncs available?
grsync might be able to do this.

Finally, what is the deal with restoring multi-boot configs? Can rear
restore, or does it plan to ever be able to restore Windows, OSX,
FreeBSD and Haiku etc? I presume it can handle restoring multi-boot
Linux configs already ie triple booting Arch, CentOS and Debian so long
as they don't use ZFS?

I'm not sure how exactly internal incremental backups works in ReaR, I
saw some issues that they are not 100% working but don't follow details
exactly (see e.g. \#1062). We however have support for [Borg
backup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) already implemented so if
you want to save some disk space, be sure to check
[scemarios](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-iso-with-borg)
and
[examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/borg-example.conf).

Linux multi boot should be working, I however never someone with such
request so I'm not entirely sure.  
Regarding other OS restore, I'll let ReaR elders to respond ;-), because
I really don't have any insides about this.

@gozora regarding your

where you propose basically something like

<pre>
# try 'mkfs.xfs -m uuid=...' and if that does not work fall back
# to plain 'mkfs.xfs' plus an additional 'xfs_admin -U ...' call:
if ! mkfs.xfs -m uuid=$uuid ... ; then
    mkfs.xfs ...
    xfs_admin -U $uuid ...
fi
</pre>

plus your very valuable comparison in your

match perfectly what I wrote about  
"Maintain backward compatibility" and  
"Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

We already had a similar issue, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/890](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/890)  
in particular therein see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/890\#issuecomment-228276737](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/890#issuecomment-228276737)  
and how I finally implemented it, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894)

That was basically the same kind of issue as this one.

I had two times 'mkfs.xfs -m uuid=...'

    mkfs.xfs ...
    xfs_admin -U $uuid ...

gozora:

I didn't have time to test your patch yesterday and today looks unlikely
too. Tomorrow night is more likely now.

jsmeix:

It sounds like incremental backups aren't fully implemented yet so I'll
hold out on testing that. It is something I'd definitely want to see
added to rear but I need to see regular, full backup and restore working
first.

It sounds like incremental backup / restore will work with two tarballs.
I don't suppose that rear will have uncompress the main recovery tarball
to disk when creating new incremental tarballs to work out whats changed
will it?

Hello @danboid  
No problem with that, code will be probably adapted soon ;-). So I guess
it would be better to wait for final patch version.

@danboid  
in general please keep separated issues separated, i.e. in case of  
incremental (actually differential - see the ReaR documentation)  
backup / restore issues please submit new separated GitHub issues  
so that this issue here is kept only about what its subject tells:  
"booting from CRC enabled XFS".

I could test this tonight if the patch is considered ready? Otherwise,
please let me know when its ready to test.

Because I'll be testing this with Arch, I formatted the drive myself
(via the Arch install ISO) this time with:

`mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sda1`

Hence this might work around the CRC problem I was having with Ubuntu
MATE? I would expect the other flavours of Ubuntu 16.04+ are also
affected, if the user chooses XFS at install time.

Hello @sandeen,

Thanks for your kind offer!  
I somehow feel that I'll use it in the future ;-), because (as you might
been able to read) most thing I've learned about XFS were by "try - fail
- learn - repeat". So asking someone who actually knows what is going
on, would be a nice change!
