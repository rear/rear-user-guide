See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414\#issuecomment-669115481](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414#issuecomment-669115481)

With this pull request the new behaviour is that when modules are listed
in modules.builtin  
and are shown by modinfo then those modules are now skipped.

Before for such modules the modules file(s) would have been included in
the recovery system.

This would be a backward incompatible change if we had not already  
`MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` by default so the different behaviour  
with this pull request should affect only exceptional cases.
