Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): -

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I tested the pull request on a RHEL7.9 based HPE DL 360 Gen10 with
    integration to a central EMC Networker 8.4.2 based backup/restore
    environment (in our company).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

1.  A new parameter/variable `NSR_CLIENT_REQUESTRESTORE` for the
    `BACKUP=NSR` workflow has been introduced to deal with situations in
    which the NSR client is allowed/granted to perform its recovery
    action "on its own" but does not have full control of the EMC
    networker service/environment. Details are commented in the
    `default.conf` section accordingly.
2.  With this enhancement it is possible to perform a point-in-time
    recovery with EMC Networker client.

@hpannenb  
many thanks for your continuous adaptions and enhancements for ReaR  
in particular for the BACKUP=NSR workflow in ReaR!

Contributions for third-party backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have those third-party backup tools  
so we totally depend on contributions from users  
who use and know about the third-party backup tools.

I wish you a relaxed and recovering weekend!
