When rear is run in debugscript mode via 'rear -D'  
using '2&gt;&1' or '2&gt;&8' for 'select' clauses  
results 'set -x' debug output on the user's terminal.

For example in  
layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
there is

<pre>
    select choice in "${possible_targets[@]}" "Do not map disk." ; do
        n=( $REPLY ) # trim blanks from reply
        let n-- # because bash arrays count from 0
        if [ "$n" = "${#possible_targets[@]}" ] || [ "$n" -lt 0 ] || [ "$n" -ge "${#possible_targets[@]}" ] ; then
            LogPrint "Disk $(get_device_name $dev) not automatically replaced."
        else
            LogPrint "Disk $choice chosen as replacement for $(get_device_name $dev)."
            add_mapping "$dev" "$choice"
        fi
        break
    done 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

which results longer possibly disturbing  
'set -x' debug output on the user's terminal:

FYI: Here the main 'set -x' output comes from the  
evaluation of the fixed $(get\_device\_name $dev)  
inside the 'select' clause (where $dev does not change)  
so that this should have better been done before  
and outside of the 'select' clause.

For comparison how it looks without '-D'

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)  
I implemented using the original fds  
for actually intended user input/output  
in particular for whole 'select' clauses like

<pre>
    select choice in WORDS ; do
        COMMANDS
    done 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

so that nowadays '2&gt;&8' is used.

Before the code had been like

<pre>
    select choice in WORDS ; do
        COMMANDS
    done 2>&1
</pre>

where '2&gt;&1' was needed because the expanded WORDS are  
printed on stderr which is by default redirected into the log file  
so that '2&gt;&1' was needed to get the intended user output  
of the 'select' clause on the user's terminal but then  
also 'set -x' debug output appears on the user's terminal.

Therefore for ReaR v2.3 as many as possible 'select' (and 'read')  
commands should be replaced by the UserInput function  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1399](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1399)  
and this would - by the way - also fix this issue here.

@jsmeix is this issue not fixed in the meantime?

It is fixed where I replaced 'select' by UserInput()  
but not where I used

<pre>
select select choice in ...
    ...
done 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

or

<pre>
read ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

so that it is not yet fixed really everywhere.

But this is nothing that must be done for the ReaR 2.3 release  
because it was this way all the time before so that there are  
no regressions.

I move the milestone to ReaR 2.4. to fix the remaining cases  
(as time provides).

FYI:  
A quick search for 'select choice in' in the scripts found  
verify/RBME/default/540\_choose\_backup.sh  
and  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
where in the latter I had already implemented  
a special workaround some time ago via

<pre>
{ set +x ; } 2>/dev/null
select choice in
    ...
done 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
apply_bash_flags_and_options_commands "$DEFAULT_BASH_FLAGS_AND_OPTIONS_COMMANDS"
</pre>

@jsmeix I think this issue is as good fixed as it possible can be, no?

@gdha  
I think it is not yet fixed at all places where it can be fixed  
so that the issue is still not sufficiently done  
but there is nothing urgent here  
so that I postpone it for the next ReaR 2.5  
and I remove the "minor bug" because I think  
nothing goes actually wrong as it is now.

This issue can wait =&gt; postponing to "ReaR v2.6" milestone.

This issue can wait even longer =&gt; postponing to "ReaR v2.7"
milestone.
