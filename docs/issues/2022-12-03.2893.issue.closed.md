-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

`rear mkrescue` will not work. Verbose shows the error

    /usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 476: type: grub-mkstandalone: not found

Any fix?

Probably this helps:

    # yum -y install grub2-efi-x64-modules

I already installed that package, and I don't think it helps systems
with UEFI.

@E34rrsff  
"`type: grub-mkstandalone: not found`"  
means that a program called `grub-mkstandalone`  
cannot be found in $PATH of the user who runs `rear`.

For example on my system something like:

    # echo $PATH
    /sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin:/root/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

    # cp /usr/bin/true /home/johannes/bin/johannes_true

    # /home/johannes/bin/johannes_true && echo y
    y

    # type johannes_true
    -bash: type: johannes_true: not found

So you need to find out if you have `grub-mkstandalone`  
installed at all and if yes where it is installed  
(i.e. in which directory `grub-mkstandalone` is) and  
then you need to check if this directory is in $PATH  
of the user who runs `rear` (i.e. the user 'root').

I am not a Red Hat user so I cannot check myself  
how things are on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.1

The relevant code parts for

    /usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 476: type: grub-mkstandalone: not found

are for ReaR 2.6  
the function has\_binary() that calls `type $bin` at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L476](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L476)  
and its call `has_binary grub-mkstandalone` at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh\#L59](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh#L59)

Thanks for the extra info. Running `find / -iname *mkstandalone*`
confirms that the file is missing on my system. I found that installing
`grub2-tools-extra` provides grub-mkstandalone in /usr/bin. Running
`rear mkrescue` works now, although
"`Did not find /boot/grub2/locale files (minor issue for UEFI ISO boot)`"
shows up in verbose output. Unsure if that's important.

@E34rrsff  
thank you for the feedback what actually makes it work also for you!  
There are so many Linux distributions each one with its own special
things  
that it is impossible for us to imagine how ReaR behaves on each of
them  
so we appreciate explicit feedback.

The code for  
"Did not find /boot/grub2/locale files (minor issue for UEFI ISO
boot)"  
in ReaR 2.6 is at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh\#L105](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh#L105)

I am not a GRUB expert but I think localization is optional  
so without localization you get GRUB texts only in English  
(or more precisely you get the texts as is  
in the GRUB source code - i.e. untranslated).

On my system I have several GNU message catalog `*.mo` files  
in /boot/grub2/locale

Perhaps you may install one more RPM package that contains those  
localization files for GRUB (if you need localization for GRUB).

@pcahyna  
I assigned this (already solved) issue to you FYI  
because it is a Fedora / Red Hat specific issue.  
Perhaps Fedora / Red Hat specific code might help here  
provided it can be maintained with reasonable effort, cf.
