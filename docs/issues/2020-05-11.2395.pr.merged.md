-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested by me on my SLES15 test system

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Before init/default/050\_check\_rear\_recover\_mode.sh did only error
out  
when in the recovery system an unsupported workflow should be run.  
Now it also errors out when on the normal/original system  
an unsupported workflow should be run.

Rear 2.6 should not be released without that critical bug fix =&gt;
"blocker".
