Let the 'debugscript mode' ( '-D' ) automatically  
also set 'debug mode' ( '-d' ) and 'verbose mode' ( '-v' ).

I never use '-D' alone.  
When I need the debugscript mode I always also  
need debug messages and verbose command output.

Or is there a reason why '-D' alone without  
debug messages and verbose command output  
actually makes sense?

If there are no objections I would like to merge it today  
because I canot imagine that this change could cause  
any regression what ReaR actually does.

@gdha  
I know that doc/rear.8 can be recreate it from doc/rear.8.adoc  
but as far as I know that recreation does not happen automatically  
so that I preferred to also edit doc/rear.8 in this pull request  
to have doc/rear.8 and doc/rear.8.adoc already in sync when  
merging it without the need to wait for doc/rear.8 recreation.

Or is perhaps doc/rear.8 somehow automatically recreated?

@jsmeix if you go in the doc area and type `make man` it will recreate
the man page for you
