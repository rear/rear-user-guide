The user can set LOGFILE in local.conf  
but that setting is not sufficiently used.

It is only used locally at the end of usr/sbin/rear

But the logfile that gets copied to the NETFS location  
has hardcoded name "rear.log", cf.  
usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh

And the partial logfile that gets copied to initramfs  
has hardcoded name "rear-partial-...", cf.  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/910\_copy\_logfile.sh
