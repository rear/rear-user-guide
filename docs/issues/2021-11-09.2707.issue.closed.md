    I have to tried to make a ReaR USB with below details,  
    but always get the same error:

<!-- -->

I dont have any vfat filesystem on my laptop and i could not to find

The `ERROR: Filesystem 'vfat' will not be supported.`  
comes from  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh  
from before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3218e36bbba1782ad8b9587b3fefe579eb3f9b9d](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3218e36bbba1782ad8b9587b3fefe579eb3f9b9d)

The `ERROR: Filesystem 'vfat' will not be supported.`  
is about a filesystem on your USB medium  
not about a filesystem on your disk in your laptop.

I assume you did not prepare your USB disk before with "rear format"  
which will completely overwrite all what there is on your USB device  
and create partitions with filesystems for ReaR from scratch.

The "rear format" workflow has a somewhat special syntax  
(that is caused by what getopt needs for nested getopt calls  
because getopt is first called in rear and then in the format workflow)

    # rear format -- --help
    Use 'rear format [ -- OPTIONS ] DEVICE' like 'rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdX'
    Valid format workflow options are: -e/--efi -f/--force -y/--yes

Hi jsmeix,  
Thanks a lot for your quick response. To be honest I did the format to
USB stick, but I will do double check again.

Thanks a lot.

Hi jsmeix,

you were right, the problem was due to the USB partition. I have to
remove the current partition and do the rear format /dev/sdX again.

Thanks a lot for your support.

@Chownx  
thank you for the prompt feedback what the root cause was.  
It is important for us at ReaR upstream to get such explicit feedback  
so we know whether or not there could be a hidden issue inside ReaR.

@Chownx  
wait - I think I found something - you have

    BACKUP_URL="usb:///dev/sdc1"
    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="512"

which indicates you did `rear format -- --efi /dev/sdc`  
and then /dev/sdc1 will be the EFI system partition (ESP) with a FAT
filesystem.  
But I guess you don't want to store your whole backup in the ESP ;-)  
so I think your BACKUP\_URL points to the wrong partition.  
You need the ReaR data partition as BACKUP\_URL.  
By default the filesystem on the ReaR data partition  
is labeled REAR-000 by the ‘format’ workflow, see  
USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_LABEL in rear/conf/default.conf  
so the usual

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

cf.
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
should "just work".
