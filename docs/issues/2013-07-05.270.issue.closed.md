In the file prep/NETFS/GNU/Linux/20\_selinux\_in\_use.sh, why rear touch
the force.autorelabel file in the case we keep SELinux on during backup
? Because if we have to restore SELinux context, we have to keep context
and not reset by default all files context (the autorelabel file do
this) ?

Was to avoid hanging systems during reboot after the recovery - SELinux
blocked me several times already. And, I believe the behaviour changed
again in Fedora 19 (still under investigation due to lack of time)

Thanks for the information.  
I will investigate on this soon, and I will send you a pull request but
I can only test on RHEL.
