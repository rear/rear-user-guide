Generic support for multiple restore archives  
is needed to properly restore an incremental backup.

Not only differential backup (as it is implemented now)  
but real incremental backup with one base full backup  
plus multiple incremental backups.

For example one base full backup made on Sunday  
plus for each subsequent weekday a separated incremental  
backup so that during a "rear recover" on Friday morning  
first the full backup from Sunday will be restored,  
then the incremental backup from Monday,  
then the incremental backup from Tuesday,  
then the incremental backup from Wednesday, and  
finally the incremental backup from Thursday.

Cf.

This issue is not meant to support multiple backup archives  
for one single "rear mkbackup" run. During "rear mkbackup"  
there will be still only one single backup archive created.

This issue is not meant to support different restore archive types.  
All restore archives must have been made with the same  
backup tool (e.g. by default 'tar').

I am currently replacing the 'restorearchive' variable  
with a RESTORE\_ARCHIVES array that contains  
in case of normal (i.e. non-incremental) backup  
only one restore archive (usually 'backup.tar.gz') and  
in case of incremental backup RESTORE\_ARCHIVES contains  
first the latest full backup file and then the incremental backups  
in the ordering how they must be restored.

With the current  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071)  
the curent semantics of incremental backup  
which was actually only a differential backup  
has changed to real incremental backup, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071\#issue-190056112](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071#issue-190056112)

Now "rear recover" will restore the latest full backup  
plus all incremental backups afterwards.

This means I have - by the way - now real incremental backup  
implemented.

On the other hand it also means I must now also implement  
real differential backup to still provide that behaviour...

I did a lot of cleanup and enhancements regarding  
incremental/differential backup, see

With

merged, I consider this issue to be fixed.
