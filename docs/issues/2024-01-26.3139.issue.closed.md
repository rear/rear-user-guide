Current ReaR from master shows a strange problem with regard to logging
in the rescue system, for example:

    RESCUE rear-u2204:~ # journalctl -u ssh --no-pager --boot
    -- No entries --

(I'm connected via SSH)

whereas the original system shows me the log:

    root@rear-u2204:/src/rear# journalctl -u ssh --no-pager --boot
    Jan 26 13:04:26 rear-u2204 systemd[1]: Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server...

    Jan 26 13:07:38 rear-u2204 sshd[2141]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user root(uid=0) by (uid=0)

Also syslog doesn't work as expected, again on the rescue system:

    RESCUE rear-u2204:~ # logger reartest
    RESCUE rear-u2204:~ # journalctl --boot -g reartest
    -- No entries --

and on the source system it works as expected:

    root@rear-u2204:/src/rear# logger reartest
    root@rear-u2204:/src/rear# journalctl --boot -g reartest
    Jan 26 13:40:34 rear-u2204 root[53389]: reartest

I actually observed this while working on \#3138 but didn't want to add
this problem into that PR. The problem was **identical in appearance**
on all systems (RHEL 7,8,9 and SLES 12,15 and Ubuntu 20,22).

Especially the syslog problem is very strange as it seems that
`/dev/log` is configured correctly:

    RESCUE rear-u2204:~ # systemctl list-sockets
    LISTEN                      UNIT                         ACTIVATES

    5 sockets listed.
    Pass --all to see loaded but inactive sockets, too.

    Notice: journal has been rotated since unit was started, output may be incomplete.

Starting Rsyslog also doesn't work because some rsyslog modules are
missing:

    RESCUE rear-u2204:~ # /etc/scripts/run-syslog
    rsyslog internal message (3,-2066): could not load module 'lmnet', errors: trying to load module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/rsyslog/lmnet.so: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/rsyslog/lmnet.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory [v8.2112.0 try https://www.rsyslog.com/e/2066 ]
    Error during class init for object 'conf' - failing...
    rsyslogd initializiation failed - global classes could not be initialized.
    Did you do a "make install"?
    Suggested action: run rsyslogd with -d -n options to see what exactly fails.
    rsyslogd: run failed with error -2066 (see rsyslog.h or try https://www.rsyslog.com/e/2066 to learn what that number means)

In general the JournalD log looks very different from the one on the
source machine, for example it reports all lines as if they belong to
systemd, for example

(while running this I connected via SSH to this box and no new log lines
appeared)

This problem makes debugging stuff in the rescue system very difficult
and I'd consider it a critical bug.

@rear/contributors do you experience the same? Any ideas what could be
the problem here?

A quick test with ReaR version `2.6` shows unfortunately exactly the
same behaviour üò¢

strange, I saw the problem on RHEL 9 (this was the motivation for fixing
the rsyslog startup in PR \#3041 , which is clearly not a working
solution on Ubuntu) but not RHEL 8. syslog messages went to journal
there.

@pcahyna TBH, I didn't do the `logger` test on all systems - so that it
indeed might have not been a problem on all of them. But I did check for
service logs and that was as described above (service logs missing from
journal) on all systems. The reason for checking was that the PPDM
service fails to start on boot, so I had to check for that.
