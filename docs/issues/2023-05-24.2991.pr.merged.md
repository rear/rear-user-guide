#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    manually on Ubu2204

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

**The PR implements the following things:**

1.  Restrict `RESULT_FILES` upload to specific files using
    `OUTPUT_URL_FILES_FILTER` filter e.g. only iso files
2.  Username `OUTPUT_LFTP_USERNAME` and Password `OUTPUT_LFTP_PASSWORD`
    can now be given to lftp for authentication at the `OUTPUT_URL`

What do you think about converting lftp completely to the heredoc
method?

    lftp "$OUTPUT_URL <<EOF
    $OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS
    mkdir -fp ${path}
    mput ${RESULT_FILES[*]}
    EOF

<s>Then I could make the code a bit simpler (I wanted to keep the
original code for the moment)</s> See

The crendentials are also hidden like \#2986 or \#2985

@rear/contributors  
could you also have a look here to be on the safe side

@codefritzel  
because you did some changes recently  
please tell me when you are finished  
so I could merge it - unless objections appear.

I made a few simplifications to the code and did a rebase. It can merge
now, if the changes are OK.

What is this?  
Did this info already exist while it was not yet merged?

I'll take a deeper look next week, I also need to get used to our new

In

I found

    pcahyna closed this as false positive Jun 2, 2023
    Glob matching is actually intended here, right?
    Codacy seems to have overzealous settings,
    as Differential ShellCheck does not complain.

So it seems that those "github-code-scanning bot"  
implements plain ShellCheck which complains way too often  
in contrast to our carefully setup Differential ShellCheck.

Ugh!  
Seems to be fighting against dumb automated tools :-(

I have not seen it, but the branch codefritzel:output\_improvements
already had Codacy configured (because it was branched after
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3cb64f1262eac953b78eec515b1ca561aa1c5b6b](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3cb64f1262eac953b78eec515b1ca561aa1c5b6b))
. I must say, a tool that complains about code problems in a PR only
after you merge the PR is of rather suboptimal usefulness, if that's
what was happening here ...

@schlomo by the way, is there a reason why you merge the current state
into the PR branch ( [Merge branch 'master' into
output\_improvements](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2991/commits/e9538f9f816b1a19fe05e9f2b85fa4a5f5dde794)

before merging the PR? IMO it is unnecessary, it just introduces one
merge commit more and thus clutters the history a bit.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your analysis!

Phew!  
When it is under our control then all is OK  
because then we can adapt it as we need it.  
I had the fear that it could be something that  
GitHub does automatically "for us to help us".

I agree with you about its current usefulness.  
I think a bot that reports problems in a PR after the merge  
behaves more annoying than actually helpful in practice,  
perhaps better than nothing, but not developer friendly.

@jsmeix @schlomo @pcahyna When you do not like Codacy Security Scans
then just delete the workflow file
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/workflows/codacy.yml](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/workflows/codacy.yml)

Since we know what it is and that it is under our control  
there is no need to rush.

I did not yet read the details in  
[https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action)  
and  
[https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli)

Perhaps the Codacy Security Scans provide  
something additional or something different  
than our Differential ShellCheck already does  
which makes the Codacy Security Scans useful for us?

At first glance I don't find how 'shellcheck' could be configured.

[https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli)  
reads (excerpt):

    Local configuration

    To perform certain advanced configurations,
    Codacy allows to create a configuration file.
    Check our documentation
    https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002130625-Codacy-Configuration-File
    for more details.

The link therein redirects to  
[https://docs.codacy.com/repositories-configure/codacy-configuration-file/](https://docs.codacy.com/repositories-configure/codacy-configuration-file/)  
which lists the tool names which are called by Codacy  
where in particular 'shellcheck' is listed but then there is  
no "Tool-specific configuration" described for shellcheck.

So from my current point of view it seems that  
Codacy simply calls plain 'shellcheck', cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2991\#issuecomment-1573535188](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2991#issuecomment-1573535188)

If calling plain 'shellcheck' is really all  
what the Codacy Security Scans (with plural 's')  
do for ReaR then we do not need them because  
our own Differential ShellCheck setup is better.

I have a theory what went wrong here:

-   the branch had Codacy configured, but an older version.
-   [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3001](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3001)
    got merged to master, updating Codacy
-   master got merged to this branch at 10:17 AM, bringing updated
    Codacy
-   this branch got merged to master at 10:18 AM
-   new Codacy got triggered in the meantime on the first merge
-   it reported the result at 10:21 AM

The key hypothesis is that old Codacy would not have reported the
problem, but new one does (not sure whether this is true). If it is
true, next time we will see the reports already in the PR and not after
merge.

I would still prefer to turn off ShellCheck feature in Codacy, if that's
possible without turning off Codacy entirely (and if there are other
features that Codacy offers and they are useful).

In my current
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006)  
I see those Codacy things

    Codacy Security Scan / Codacy Security Scan (pull_request)
    ...
    Code scanning results / Checkov (reported by Codacy)
    Code scanning results / Markdownlint (reported by Codacy)
    Code scanning results / Pmd (reported by Codacy)
    Code scanning results / Remark-lint (reported by Codacy)
    Code scanning results / Shellcheck (reported by Codacy)
    Code scanning results / Spectral (reported by Codacy)

So it seems there are other features that Codacy offers  
but currently I have no idea what they do (except Shellchek)  
nor whether or not they are meaningful or even useful for us.
