Hello... I could not backup to ISO images &gt;4GB. I set
ISO\_MAX\_SIZE=10000 and that did not help either. Thanks.

It was never the purpose of rear to create *big* ISO images, but with
the above link you could tweak rear to make your problem go away. Keep
in touch on your progress...

I added `-allow-limited-size` to `$ISO_MKISOFS_BIN` in
`/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/81_prepare_multiple_iso.sh` and
the image size was able to go past 4GB, but it looks like 8.6GB is the
limit. I worked around it by tar'ing the large directories and manually
restoring them after recovery. Thanks for your help.

So yes, having `-allow-limited-size` to $ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN will enable
the ISO image to become larger than 4.7 GIGs. However the real issue is
that in RHEL6/CENTOS6 mkisofs is actually a soft link back to
/etc/alternatives that points to genisoimage. The issue is that
genisomage is not infact mkisofs, with the REAL version of mkisofs being
a subset of a tools package called CDRTOOLS. Which is open source,
however because of certain limitations of working for a large
corporation, we do not have the ability to install (./configure make
make install) for the real binary version of mkisofs, so instead, you
can always add a new variable within the
`/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50*` called SPLIT\_COMMAND2 which
references the actual split differently than the normal $SPLIT\_COMMAND
that is called under the tar function sequence of that script.

so inside `50_make_backup.sh` you can put this at the top, or inside the
set\_tar\_features

    SPLIT_COMMAND2="split --bytes=${BKUP_MAX_SIZE} - ${backuparchive}."

Or name it whatever you wish...

`${BKUP_MAX_SIZE}` is a variable that you set in `/etc/rear/*.conf`
(whichever conf file you wish to use, os.conf/site.conf/default.conf,
whatever you currently are running with rear).

    cat /etc/rear/site.conf | grep BKUP_MAX_SIZE
    BKUP_MAX_SIZE=3500MB

Now under the tar section of ${BACKUP\_PROG} section of
50\_make\_backup.sh

    # tar compatible programs here
            (tar)
                    set_tar_features
                    Log $BACKUP_PROG $TAR_OPTIONS --sparse --block-number --totals --verbose \
                            --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system \
                            --ignore-failed-read $BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS \
                            $BACKUP_PROG_X_OPTIONS \
                            ${BACKUP_PROG_BLOCKS:+-b $BACKUP_PROG_BLOCKS} $BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS \
                            -X $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt -C / -c -f - \
                            $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) $LOGFILE \| $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY \| $SPLIT_COMMAND2
                    $BACKUP_PROG $TAR_OPTIONS --sparse --block-number --totals --verbose \
                            --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system \
                            --ignore-failed-read $BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS \
                            $BACKUP_PROG_X_OPTIONS \
                            ${BACKUP_PROG_BLOCKS:+-b $BACKUP_PROG_BLOCKS} $BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS \
                            -X $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt -C / -c -f - \
                            $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) $LOGFILE | $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY | $SPLIT_COMMAND2

see how now I am calling on $SPLIT\_COMMAND2 at the tail end of these 2
lines?

What does this do for RHEL6?

Your backup.tar.gz will go into your tmp directory (you can define this
as well, or leave it default if you think you have enough room), and it
will only allow the backup.tar.gz do grow to 3.5 GIGS, and then it
splits it off and creates a new one, and you wind up with a naming
convention such as this --&gt; backup.tar.gz.aa  
backup.tar.gz.ab  
backup.tar.gz.ac  
backup.tar.gz.ad

so on and so forth. This will keep the backup.tar.gz from exceeding the
4GiB hard limit that is set by the false mkisofs that is really a
pointer back to genisoimage. Then once the ISO is created, it can grow
to as big as it needs, while copying the backup.tar.gz files within the
ISO.

Once it is time for recovery, the recovery section utilizes a for i in
`ls ${BUILDDIR}/path/to/backups/*.tar.gz` which finds the path to those
backup.tar.gz and because of globbing within a native shell it should
extract them in the same order as it had created them. Although some
testing needs to be done.

This simple step will allow much larger than 4 gig ISO images, but keeps
the actual NETFS tar.gz files smaller than 4GIB so that you avoid that
pesky error about the file size being too large.

Uhm. I have run into this problem with an installation on RHEL7.2, using
the version that comes with the OS (1.17.2). I have modified the scripts
as suggested here, and still got the error. The problem file in my case
is ./isolinux/initrd.cgz, which has grown to some 5.8G. Any suggestions?

Thanks.

I have a general question:

Currently I cannot imagine a good reason why  
one would like to have the backup.tar.gz within the ISO?

"BACKUP\_URL=iso://" is mentioned in the documentation  
but without a reason when this could be useful or to what  
extent this is meant to be used.

What is the advantage to mix up the backup.tar.gz  
with the rear recovery system ISO image?

Why not keep separated things separated?

Furthermore in general regarding huge backup.tar.gz see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1006\#issuecomment-248862040](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1006#issuecomment-248862040)

Finally in general regarding issues with the backup:

Relax-and-Recover (rear) is neither a backup software nor a  
backup management software and it is not meant to be one, cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover (rear) versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In particular in this case here rear only calls an external tool  
that makes an ISO image in the usual way as it is normally  
intended for rear i.e. an ISO image that contains only  
the rear recovery system (up to about 500 MB)  
or at most an ISO image that contains the rear recovery  
system plus a backup of the files of the basic operating  
system (up to very few GB - usually less than 4 GB)  
but not to also a backup of huge application files  
like databases and things like that.
