Hello @scienceandhonor,

There might be a problem with ReaR running RPI. (see issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1197](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1197)).

@scienceandhonor  
I have zero experience with Raspberry Pi computers  
but I guess it fails in the same way when you  
use a separated pristine USB mass storage device  
on computer B (the Raspberry Pi computer).

Thanks for letting me know! I doubt that I will be able to help here.
I'd probably fry my RPi in the process without getting anything backed
up ;).

If you are patient and if you are a somewhat experienced Linux user  
ReaR can be made working in principle on any Linux system  
because ReaR is only bash scripts that can be adapted and  
enhanced as needed for any Linux environment. But the  
precondition is that you know how to work directly with  
low-level commands like parted, mkfs.\*, and so on.

In this particular case the first step is to find out why  
"get\_version could not detect parted version"  
which means by inspecting the ReaR code  
(searching the ReaR code for get\_version)  
that in usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh

<pre>
# Function to get version from tool.
get_version() {
  TERM=dumb $@ 2>&1 | sed -rn 's/^[^0-9\.]*([0-9]+\.[-0-9a-z\.]+).*$/\1/p' | head -1
}
</pre>

fails in your case where it is called as

<pre>
get_version parted -v
</pre>

so that you should try out what on your computer B  
the following two commands result (run them as root):

<pre>
parted -v

TERM=dumb parted -v 2>&1 | sed -rn 's/^[^0-9\.]*([0-9]+\.[-0-9a-z\.]+).*$/\1/p' | head -1
</pre>

e.g. on my SLES11 system I get:

<pre>
# parted -v
parted (GNU parted) 2.3

@gozora  
I wonder if the current strict parted version testing code in  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh and  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
must nowadays still error out with a BugError  
or if we could nowadays use a reasonable fallback?

On my SLES10 I have "GNU Parted 1.6.25.1"  
on my SLES11 I have "parted (GNU parted) 2.3"  
on my Leap 42.1 I have "parted (GNU parted) 3.1"

As far as I see on my systems only SLES10 needs  
a working parted version test, all newer systems  
would work with a fallback\_version value so that

<pre>
version_newer $fallback_version 2.0
</pre>

results 'true' (i.e. returns 0), cf. lib/layout-functions.sh

Hello @jsmeix,  
As far as I remember I'm not author of this code, so I really can't give
you qualified answer.

@jsmeix Thanks for the great explanation! I should be able to give this
a go. Sadly time is a bit short right now so I have to postpone this for
a few days...

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25670948?u=83cec304a80cd8c4323d44ce118dfd6fe181940d&v=4" width="50">[scienceandhonor](https://github.com/scienceandhonor) commented at [2017-03-07 21:48](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1210#issuecomment-284870287):

Well, this is a bit embarrassing. Apparently parted was not installed on
my RPi... something that never crossed my mind. Sorry about the
confusion! I'll try to prepare another ReaR backup USB stick on computer
A to be able to try it on my RPi again. If things go smoothly I'll
report within the next hour, otherwise this really has to wait for a few
days. But I assume this is not really a bug but a case of RTFM...

@scienceandhonor  
regarding "parted was not installed":  
I hoped the actual root cause is that simple, see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755)

But I think in such cases (mandatory stuff is missing)  
ReaR should error out early with a meaningful error message  
than to blindly proceed until it errors out at an arbitrary later
place  
with an unexpected error message, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755\#issuecomment-171603580](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755#issuecomment-171603580)

Just to let you know: creating a ReaR backup on my RPi worked fine after
installing parted. Thanks for the help!

@scienceandhonor  
many thanks for your feedback!  
It helps a lot to get a better understanding how ReaR behaves  
on platforms/architectures that we do not personally have.

FYI:  
In general only creating a ReaR backup does not tell  
anything about whether or not later "rear recover"  
will actually work on replacement hardware, see  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular the section about  
"Inappropriate expectations".

I close this issue because this particular issue is solved.

@scienceandhonor  
if there are issues with "rear recover" on Raspberry Pi  
(and I assume there will be issues) please open for  
each separated issue a new separated GitHub issue  
and see in particular  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Currently I get the following error message: Currently only OUTPUT = PXE
is supported on ARM  
Will rear be running on the raspberry in the foreseeable future, so that
a real disaster recovery on usb is possible?  
thank you
