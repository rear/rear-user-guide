There is no `unknown` in
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120\_include\_raid\_code.sh  
so I assume it comes from something in your `disklayout.conf` file  
so we need that too to be able to do the next step in analyzing what
went wrong.

So the culprit is

    +++ grep Layout /var/www/html/imageBackup/iso/rear.sLsjObhTRCeYDd8/tmp/mdraid
    ++ layout=-unknown-

which gets printed by  
`mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md0`  
Looking at the source, mdadm can indeed print `-unknown-` for a RAID
layout and it got recently added to RAID0 (it existed before for RAID5
and RAID6 and RAID10):
[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git/commit/Detail.c?id=329dfc28debb58ffe7bd1967cea00fc583139aca](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git/commit/Detail.c?id=329dfc28debb58ffe7bd1967cea00fc583139aca)  
I suspect we don't support RAID levels other than RAID1 very well...

It is also my gut feeling that (software) RAID0 is not well supported in
ReaR  
because I assume RAID0 is not often used by system admins on their
servers  
in contrast to (software) RAID1 which is more often used but I even
assume  
whatever software RAID is not often used by system admins on their
servers  
in contrast to real hardware RAID or even SAN storage and things like
that  
but I am really not an expert in advanced storage technologies.

By the way:  
I wonder why software RAID0 and not just LVM "as usual"?

@jsmeix : Currently we are having some of the machines in the format of
RAID 0. So i tried to check it out.

As fas as I see from plain looking at the code the relevant code parts
are

during "rear mkrescue" in layout/save/GNU/Linux/210\_raid\_layout.sh

    if [ -n "$layout" ] ; then
        layout=" layout=$layout"
    else
        layout=""
    fi
    ...
    echo "raid ${device}${metadata}${level}${ndevices}${uuid}${name}${sparedevices}${layout}${chunksize}${devices}"

during "rear recover" in
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120\_include\_raid\_code.sh

    for option in $options ; do
        case "$option" in
    ...
            (*)
                mdadmcmd="$mdadmcmd --$option"
                ;;
        esac
    done

So I assume a possible fix in
layout/save/GNU/Linux/210\_raid\_layout.sh  
is to treat `layout=-unknown-` same as if `$layout` was empty i.e.

@cvijayvinoth  
as far as I see your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6630326/rear-vijay.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6630326/rear-vijay.log)  
is only a "rear -D recover" log but my proposed fix in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2618/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2618/files)  
is in usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210\_raid\_layout.sh  
and the `layout/save` stage is run during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"

So to test if
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2618](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2618)
makes things work for you  
you need to test the whole thing i.e.  
first "rear -D mkrescue" or "rear -D mkbackup" and attach its log here  
then boot that new created ReaR recovery system on replacement test
hardware  
and run "rear -D recover" there and also attach its log plus
disklayout.conf here.

After the "rear -D mkrescue" or "rear -D mkbackup"  
check the new disklayout.conf if it still contains `layout=-unknown-`.  
With my changes in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2618](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2618)  
the new disklayout.conf should no longer contain `layout=-unknown-`.
