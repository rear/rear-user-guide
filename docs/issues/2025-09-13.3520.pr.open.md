##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Clean-up**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? Boot of `OUTPUT=ISO` in RHEL 7-10
    and Fedora Rawhide.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   drop support for syslinux &lt;4.04 because 4.04 is the oldest
        release in distros supported by ReaR 2.9, see
        <https://repology.org/project/syslinux/versions> for details.
    -   fix detection of memtest86 for isolinux on RHEL and Fedora
    -   simplify the isolinux config generator

The plan is to merge the PXELINUX and EXTLINUX generators into
`lib/bootloader-functions.sh` in subsequent pull requests as well.

At the moment, HDT entry is not bootable on RHEL8+ and Fedora but that
is an issue not caused by these changes and is tracked in
<https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-114110>.

(Note that I've used Claude Code to detect relevant code to be
removed/changed. However, all edits and commits were done solely by me.)

I'm going to mark this PR as a draft because I'll probably have to make
some minor changes to it as I progress with the extlinux and pxelinux
merge locally. Nonetheless, even if this is a draft, reviews are
welcome!

@lzaoral  
I had only a quick first view.

From your changes in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
it seems you changed the meaning of ISO\_DEFAULT  
(it seems you removed ISO\_DEFAULT completely)  
and merged it into ISO\_RECOVER\_MODE.

But - as far as I see - there is no code which handles  
when the user has set ISO\_DEFAULT  
e.g. after an upgrade from older ReaR to ReaR 3.0.

I think for a ReaR major version upgrade  
backward compatibility is not required  
so no code is needed which automatically maps  
old ISO\_DEFAULT values into new ISO\_RECOVER\_MODE.

But I think it should at least Error out when ISO\_DEFAULT  
is set in a way which is known to be no longer supported  
so the user is informed that his ISO\_DEFAULT setting  
is no longer supported, cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020_translate_url.sh#L25>  
and its reason behind
