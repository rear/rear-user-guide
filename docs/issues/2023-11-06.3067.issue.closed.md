    Hello,

Attempting to create a ReaR recovery environment to perform a restore
using Bacula

Latest output from sudo rear mkrescue -v

I think this is likely to be a configuration error as this system has
Bacula installed and operational.

After troubleshooting suggestions.

Thank you.

Hello,

Possibly the issue might be that I need to define a 'client' that the
ReaR recovery environment will use when performing the restore.

I must admit that I'm not entirely clear on this aspect of the
configuration at present.

What is the return code of the command:

    nc -vz debian11-dr6 9101
    debian11-DR6.zen.local [192.168.200.40] 9101 (bacula-dir) opensudo

Perhaps, we could use this instead of looking for "connected"?

Can you check the syntax of the 2nd line

@ZENAdmin-Ops What you need to do is:

Hi, is the check using "nc" even needed? Isn't the subsequent check
using `bconsole` enough?

I mean, doesn't answering the latter question

    # does the director allow connections from this client? bconsole knows!

also implicitly answer the question

    # check if the director is responding?

above it? presumably, if the director allow connections from this
client, it is also responding.

@ZENAdmin-Ops for future users: what was the problem? And how was it
solved?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62083231?v=4" width="50">[ZENAdmin-Ops](https://github.com/ZENAdmin-Ops) commented at [2024-01-16 17:10](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3067#issuecomment-1894164406):

I never really got that problem fixed, since I switched fairly quickly
to running the restore from a bash script instead of trying to use the
(very minimal) built in bacula support in rear. With that said from
looking at the errors and the source code it looks like the problem is
that Rear is searching for "connected" in the output of "nc" to check if
the director is available, only nc doesn't ever actually say
"connected". I'm guessing this code was written for an earlier version
of nc that always had "connected" in its output if it was able to
connect. Currently that nc command gives output like this:  
Connection to localhost (127.0.0.1) 9101 port \[tcp/bacula-dir\]
succeeded!  
So it should really be searching for "succeeded" instead of "connected".

Probably the issue could be fixed by changing  
DIRECTOR\_RESULT=$(nc -vz "${BACULA\_DIRECTOR}" 9101 2&gt;&1 | grep -i
connected | wc -l)  
to  
DIRECTOR\_RESULT=$(nc -vz "${BACULA\_DIRECTOR}" 9101 2&gt;&1 | grep -i
succeeded | wc -l)

Although if nc ever changes its output it would break again... so it
would seem like there should be a better way for it to check the
connection rather than trying to parse nc's output. Also, a few lines
down it checks the connection again using bconsole... so the first check
is kind of unnecessary.
