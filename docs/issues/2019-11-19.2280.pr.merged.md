-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system:

<!-- -->

    # time usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Copying all kernel modules in /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp150.12.79-default (MODULES contains 'all_modules')
    Copying all files in /lib*/firmware/
    ...
    Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.SrlUTo4b7fvtlHL/rootfs contains a usable system
    ...
    Exiting rear mkrescue (PID 13565) and its descendant processes

plus skip the `ldd` test for firmware files.  
and redirected stderr of `ldd` avoids tons of `ldd` warnings in the log
like  
`ldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for ...`, cf.

Now I also explained the possible `ldd` security issue  
with things like `COPY_AS_IS+=( /home/JohnDoe )`  
in default.conf.

I would like to merge it as is for now because it works  
and I would like to do a mitigation of the `ldd` security issue  
in a separated pull request.

From my explanation of the `ldd` security issue  
as we use it in the RequiredSharedObjects function  
my offanded idea to mitigate this `ldd` security issue is  
to run `ldd` only on files that are owned by 'root' on the original
system  
becaue I think a file can be trusted when 'root' is its owner.
