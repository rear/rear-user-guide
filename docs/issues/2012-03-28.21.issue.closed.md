Was on Sourceforge as
SF\#[3448325](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3448325&group_id=171835&atid=859455)

Currently when "rear recover" runs successfully its log file
/tmp/rear-<hostname>.log in the ReaR recovery system is copied into
/root/ on the recovered system.

But when "rear recover" fails, its log file is not saved to a save plave
so that it is lost when the ReaR recovery system is finished.

For "BACKUP=NETFS" the "rear recover" log file should be saved in any
case to the NETFS\_URL to have it automatically at the same save place
where the backup.tar.gz and the "rear mkbackup" log file and the ISO
image already are.

To make sure a "rear recover" log file exists at the save place in any
case even if "rear recover" breaks at a random stage,  
it is perhaps best to write the "rear recover" log directly into a file
at the save place as soon as this is possible (instead of copying it
just before "rear recover" finishes).

+1

Maybe we should think about renaming the log files as well. I find it
very confusing that both the original log file and the recovery log file
have similar names. Maybe we should think about have a
rear-(hostname).log and a rear-recover-(hostname).log ? We could have
workflows set the prefered log file name (if the default is not ok).

Also the location of the logfile could maybe be harmonized as well, I am
still not very fond of using /tmp for this purpose. But having both
logfiles in the same location seems useful.

I see also the following options/aspects:

-   send failed (and optionally successful) recovery logs via Email
-   if storing the recovery log off-system fails then Relax-and-Recover
    should not abort

Ok, let's summarize what we would like to do:

-   Indicate the workflow (or at least the mode) in the logfile name
    (rear-backup-*hostname*.log and rear-recover-*hostname*.log
-   Move the logfile to the default directory (/var/log/rear) on the
    original host, on the rescue system and on the recover host
    -   original system: rear-backup-*hostname*.log
    -   rescue system:
        -   initrd: rear-backup-partial-*hostname*-*date*.log and
            rear-recover-*hostname*-*date*.log
        -   medium: rear-backup-*hostname*-*date*.log and
            rear-recover-*hostname*-*date*.log
    -   recovered system: rear-backup-*hostname*-*date*.log and
        rear-recover-*hostname*-*date*.log
-   Take into account partial logfiles in the rescue image, and "less"
    partial logfiles on the rescue medium (if available)

will implement this in v1.17

post-pone this to rear-1.18

I will implement it.

I think /mnt/local/root/ is o.k. but probably not really  
the best directory for that.

I think only the plain log file is not fully sufficient.  
I prefer to also keep other recovery-related data.

In the end what I like to keep is all what is needed  
so that the admin or rear upstream can do later  
a full detailled analysis of a recovery.

In particular for professional support  
(e.g. from Relax-and-Recover upstream or  
from our SUSE Linux Enterprise support department)  
the ability to do a full detailled analysis after a recovery  
is mandatory.

This is another reason why I would like to keep  
the 'rear recover' log et alii by default so that this  
information is by default available after a recovery.

As a first step I implemented
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/706](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/706)

But for this issue here I need a bit more time to think about how to do
it.

Because currently it is copied as an exit task I wonder if this is not
yet sufficiently fail-safe - at least for normal error exits.

I assume the exit tasks are called for any exit (i.e. also when there
is  
a normal error exit) as far as I understand \_input-output-functions.sh

<pre>
builtin trap "DoExitTasks" 0
</pre>

and "help trap"

<pre>
trap: trap [-lp] [arg signal_spec ...]
  ... If a SIGNAL_SPEC is EXIT (0)
  the command ARG is executed on exit from the shell.
  ...
</pre>
