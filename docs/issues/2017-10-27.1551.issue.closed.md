On debian stretch installation fails with  
`W: GPG error: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/Debian_9.0  Release: The following signatures were invalid: F532523ADE4BBF1CBFF6523F6B7485DB725A0C43`

This is because repositories may not be signed with sha1 algorithm (to
weak).  
The packages need to be signed with sha256 or sha512.  
For this also a new key is needed as dsa is not supported any more.

I am neither a Debian user nor a Debian packager  
so that I know nothing about Debian specific things  
in particular nothing at all about possibly Debian  
specific signing or Debian specific keys.

Perhaps  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1255\#issuecomment-299871881](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1255#issuecomment-299871881)  
is somehow related?

@jsmeix I think that is an OBS issue as to my knowledge all packages
build on OBS suffer from this. However, no clue how we can fix this?

@gdha  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1255\#issuecomment-299871881](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1255#issuecomment-299871881)  
why I don't think it is about a OBS key so that I think  
it is not an issue in OBS but something Debian specific  
because we only get such issue reports about  
the packages for Debian.

@jsmeix You are right it is not OBS fault, but ours. In \#1255 I added
the evidence of key-signing. Perhaps, it will work better now?

@jsmeix Indeed my problems have been fixed now:

    wget -q -O - download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/xUbuntu_16.04/Release.key | apt-key add -
    # OK
