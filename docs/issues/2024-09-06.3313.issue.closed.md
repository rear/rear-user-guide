-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
    See log file of failed test
    [https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/65b3200a-9a0f-43fe-96f1-9e3131bbe274/](https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/65b3200a-9a0f-43fe-96f1-9e3131bbe274/)

-   Workaround, if any: please have package `grub2-efi-x64-modules`
    installed on the test Fedora VM prior of running ReaR  
    As @pcahyna is a RH person I assign this issue directly to you.

@gdha if the Fedora test VMs switched to UEFI, there is no way to make
the tests work in them. I need to find a way to switch the VMs to BIOS
booting instead.

@pcahyna It is possible to schedule TF tests both for BIOS and UEFI? It
shouldn't be that hard to extend the current tests and `rear` combined
with EFI isn't that uncommon set-up. GRUB2 is able to mount ISO images
and chainload EFI executables (hopefully, that is enough to simulate
real EFI environment):
[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB/Chainloading\#Dual-booting\_Windows\_on\_UEFI\_with\_GPT](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB/Chainloading#Dual-booting_Windows_on_UEFI_with_GPT)
What do you think about this idea?

> It is possible to schedule TF tests both for BIOS and UEFI?

I am trying to do BIOS in \#3314 , so far no luck. I suppose one can
find a way to test with UEFI, but this would require some new test
development and I would like to fix the current test runs first.

As there is apparently no way currently to tell the infrastructure to
give the test the environment that it needs, I am going to disable the
problematic test (\#3317) . I also plan to merge the change in
configuration that requests BIOS (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3314](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3314)
). It does not do anything yet, but it will make the tests ready when
Testing Farm is enhanced to support that, plus it does not hurt to be
more explicit about what the tests need.
