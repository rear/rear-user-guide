@GreenBlood Well I think I wrote the initial code for DUPLICITY back in
2014 (I guess it was around that time-frame), but it seems most of my
code was already overwritten. It was just a proof-of-concept
implementation at that time (for fun) and not paying too much attention
on useability for others.  
I'm actually glad that the ReaR community has mature users on-board who
do care about useability and better code ;-)  
Thank you.  
@jsmeix Also a big thank you for your endless effort in making ReaR a
really mature product.  
@pcahyna Again the same to you - thank you for bringing it to the crowd
(EL ones).
