-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

There is no issue at all, just a question how to include a customized
shell script to ReaR (before or after it kicks in) and store the results
of the script to the same backup folder?

We have PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
and PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
see "custom scripts" in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3129](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3129)

We also have RESULT\_FILES - see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3095](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3095)

I do not understand what exactly you mean.  
What do you mean with "before or after it kicks in"  
and what do you mean with "the same backup folder"?

Thanks for your kind answer.  
That's great to learn about those scripts.  
The same backup folder means BACKUP\_URL location.  
Is there a variable that I can point to that location in the custom
script?

PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT is run during ReaR recovery system startup via  
usr/share/rear/setup/default/010\_pre\_recovery\_script.sh  
which runs before "rear" is called by the user  
so ReaR config files are not yet sourced while PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT is
run  
so you need to source /etc/rear/local.conf in your
PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
to get the BACKUP\_URL value in your PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT.

PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is run while "rear" is running via  
usr/share/rear/backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh  
so ReaR config files are already sourced when PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is
run  
so that the BACKUP\_URL value could be available in your
PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
but I think because PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is run via

    eval "${PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"

the BACKUP\_URL value could be not available in PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
when the BACKUP\_URL variable was not exported so that you may need  
something like

    export BACKUP_URL=...

in your etc/rear/local.conf file to get the BACKUP\_URL value  
available also in PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.

PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is only run for "rear mkbackup" or "rear
mkbackuponly"  
(which run the matching scripts in usr/share/rear/backup)  
but PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is not run for "rear mkrescue"  
(which does not run scripts in usr/share/rear/backup).

FYI if you use `BACKUP=NETFS`:  
usr/share/rear/backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh  
is run before  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/100\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh  
so the NETFS "mountable remote thingy" (e.g. a NFS share)  
is not yet mounted when PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT runs.
