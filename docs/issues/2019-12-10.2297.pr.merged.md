Revert part of \#1961 : move `route` back from REQUIRED\_PROGS to PROGS.
`route` is actually not required, ReaR uses `ip route` everywhere. As it
is not always installed nowadays (e.g. on CentOS 7 Vagrant images),
having it in REQUIRED\_PROGS breaks ReaR on those installs where it
would work just fine.

I can confirm that  
ReaR uses `ip route` (or `ip -4 route` or `ip -6 route`) everywhere  
according to the output that I get:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -w 'route' | egrep -v ': *# |ip route|ip -4 route|ip -6 route'

    usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/095_exclude_non_essential_files.sh:
    progs_to_exclude+=( arping curl dhclient dhclient-script ethtool ifconfig ip nameif netcat netstat nslookup route rsync scp sftp ssh strace tar traceroute vi )

    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/990_sysreqs.sh:
    echo "  Default route:"

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh:
                logmessage "failed to create default route: ${router} dev ${interface} ${metric}"

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh:
                            logmessage "failed to create static route: ${target}/${prefix} via ${gateway} dev ${interface} ${metric}"

    usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh:
                for network_file in $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/sysconfig/*/route-*${device}* $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/sysconfig/static-routes ; do

    usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf:
    route

The last one is what will be changed by this pull request.
