Currently the SourceStage function works based on  
pure "additive thinking", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311\#issuecomment-295276076](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311#issuecomment-295276076)

It goes from very generic (default)  
to distro & version OR distro & arch specific  
(e.g. RedHatEnterpriseServer/7 OR RedHatEnterpriseServer/i386)  
with several steps in between.

The idea is to put each script in a "as generic as possible" place.

But the current way makes it impossible to  
have a generic default script (that works in most cases)  
but use a more specific script INSTEAD of the default script  
in special cases because currently the SourceStage function  
would run both the default script AND the specific script.

Hereby I suggest to enhance the SourceStage function  
to do "additive plus replacing" script sourcing as follows:

The basic idea is that for one task, one script name is used.  
I.e. same task &lt;=&gt; same script name.

The SourceStage function will not source two sctipts with  
the same script name (without the leading script number)  
which exist in one stage (i.e. in the stage directory hierarchy).

When there are several scripts in the stage directory hierarchy  
with same script name (regardless of the leading script number)  
the SourceStage function will source the script in the most  
specific directory of the stage directory hierarchy.

See the following example why the leading script number  
is ignored to check if two scripts implement the same task.

Example:

Assume during the 'finalize' stage  
the task is to rebuild the initrd/initramfs.

The script name (without number) is 'rebuild\_initramfs'.

Then the default script could be e.g.  
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

Additionally for special cases there could be scripts like  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/170\_prepare\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/180\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/200\_install\_yaboot.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

In the default case only  
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
would be run.

For Debian only  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/180\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
would be run after  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/170\_prepare\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
was run.

For Fedora on ppc64 only  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
would be run.

For SUSE\_LINUX on ppc64 only  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
would be run after  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/200\_install\_yaboot.sh  
was run.

This way the pure "additive" part still works as before  
plus a "replacing" part only when scripts have same name.

I once even tried to code that and it became too complex.

To keep things simple I would suggest that the replacement happens only
if the entire script name including the number is identical. In the log
file we should then also write something to that effect.

@schlomo  
meanwhile I think it is probably not really needed to  
exclude the script number because when in special cases  
some additional scripts should be run before,  
those additional scripts can have smaller numbers.

In this case my initial example would become:

Assume during the 'finalize' stage  
the task is to rebuild the initrd/initramfs.  
The script name with number is '500\_rebuild\_initramfs'.

Then the default script could be e.g.  
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

Additionally for special cases there could be scripts like  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/490\_prepare\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/200\_install\_yaboot.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

The advantage when for one same task  
one same script name with same number is used  
is that it avoids confusion between what is run by default  
versus what is run in special cases.

The 'do something' task will be always implemented  
in a 123\_do\_something.sh script.
