Hi.

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover **2.3** / 2017-12-20
-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    Tested on Debian 8 and 9, issue would be present on Ubuntu and
    Fedora too at least.
-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=RAWDISK
    BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
    FULLBACKUPDAY="Sun"


    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORDS="foobar"
    USE_DHCLIENT=yes

    BACKUP_URL=cifs://[SambaShare]/[ShareName]
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs_credentials"

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine):  
    both x86\_64 and 32bit
-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot?  
    BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    It seems there is a file missing in the package building process.
    The folder /usr/share/rear/conf/templates does not contains the
    RESULT\_usage\_RAWDISK.txt file. This file is absent from the
    packages, as a result, when doing a RAWDISK backup, the part where
    rear generates and copies "README" to the backup storage fails, and
    thus the whole backup process too.
-   Work-around, if any:  
    A quick work-around was to create a dummy file in place of
    RESULT\_usage\_RAWDISK.txt, to not trigger the error.

Regards,  
Green

I think i've been misled by the presence of "OUTPUT=RAWDISK" in the
documentation (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc)
), I thought it was already included in the latest version of rear but
it seems its scheduled to be in 2.4 instead.

This issue is now stale I guess, sorry guys.

@GreenBlood  
you can use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".
