[\#3276 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3276) `closed`: Secure Boot with GRUB shim should work automatically
=======================================================================================================================

Currently one must set
`SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=(/boot/efi/EFI/*/shimx64.efi)` or something like
this on every system that uses [secure
boot](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot).

I'd like to enhance ReaR to automatically detect secure boot and
configure the shim.

I just notice that we already have code to read the EFI variables, added
by @jsmeix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9a31a5fa9a75a72bfb01eedabadc104400982667](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9a31a5fa9a75a72bfb01eedabadc104400982667)

Do you happen to remember why reading the EFI vars comes as a fallback
solution instead of trying to do that first?

Hi @schlomo , I did some work to support this but never got around to
complete it, so I am at least pushing it for public review as \#3277 .
IIRC, the code works on RHEL main thing missing was to check
compatibility with all the possible conventions for naming the
bootloader and shim for various distro versions.

Ah, great. I'll have a look. My approach is rather primitive in
comparison
