On openSUSE Leap 15.5 I installed the sedutil RPM  
which provides /usr/sbin/sedutil-cli

Having this program makes normal "rear mkrescue" with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS

fail:

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    ERROR: '/root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/TCG-Opal-PBA/localhost/TCG-Opal-PBA-localhost.raw' is not a regular file, thus cannot be used as TCG Opal 2 PBA image.

From the debug log:

The reason is that the OpalPBA code in ReaR  
gets activated by the existence of any program  
called 'sedutil-cli':

    # mv /usr/sbin/sedutil-cli /usr/sbin/sedutil-cli.away

    # ls -l /usr/bin/false /usr/sbin/sedutil-cli

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    ERROR: '/root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/TCG-Opal-PBA/localhost/TCG-Opal-PBA-localhost.raw' is not a regular file, thus cannot be used as TCG Opal 2 PBA image.

see usr/share/rear/prep/default/380\_include\_opal\_tools.sh  
Sigh :-(

Workaround to run ReaR normally:

    # mv /usr/sbin/sedutil-cli /usr/sbin/sedutil-cli.away

As it seems in practice no ReaR user was hit by it  
(because noone reported it up to now here)  
I think we can safely fix this issue later  
as time permits after the ReaR 3.0 release.

See starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3194\#issuecomment-2175841475](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3194#issuecomment-2175841475)  
about what we think what the intended use case  
of the OpalPBA code in ReaR likely is.

Nevertheless plain installing 'sedutil' on a system  
without a TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disk  
should not make a normal "rear mkrescue" fail  
so the current OpalPBA code in ReaR needs  
some cleanup and enhancement.
