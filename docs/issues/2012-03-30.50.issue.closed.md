When recovering on different hardware with a different scsi controller,
the recoverd system will not find the root volume group and stop with a
kernel panic.

Probably a rebuild of the initrd is needed.

This is planned for a future release and tracked in issue \#45.

For now, you can add a custom script to rebuild it in your `local.conf`.
See this excerpt from `default.conf`.

    # NOTE: The scripts can be defined as an array to better handly spaces in parameters. The
    # scripts are called like this: eval "${PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT[@]}"
    # call this after rear did everything in the recover workflow. /mnt/local refers to the recovered system
    POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=

we added the code into `rear` to fix this on RHEL. However, it is still
untested. We hope to get this tested tomorrow...

We need more feedback on this if we want to get v1.13 out of the door.

For me it works on RHEL 5.8. No more kernel panics after recovery.

Ok, let's close this one :-) Thanks for the feedback.

If someone notices a problem with the implementation, please re-open
