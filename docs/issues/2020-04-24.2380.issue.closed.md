Hi,

I have a installed centos 7 on a usb-stick (32gb)  
On this production environment I have mounted 2 disk as software raid1  
-&gt; /dev/md0 mounted to /raid1

Now I make a rear backup of the centos system (excluding /raid1 and
/mnt  
etc) The location of the backup is /raid1

But when I recover, the system cannot find the backup location to
recover (cannot find backup.tar.gz)

What steps I have to take?

my conf file looks like

------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///raid1/rear-backup/  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///raid1/rear-backup/  
EXCLUDE\_BACKUP=('/media' '/raid1' '/mnt' '/var/tmp' '/var/crash')  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=yes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With kind regards,  
Ismet

@ismetsener  
see what @gdha replied to you on  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2020-April/003753.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2020-April/003753.html)

    On the recovery side you probably need to mount
    the /raid1 manually as  well (I understood from your mail
    that you mounted it manually on your centos7 system).
    Why not using a NFS location instead?

@ismetsener  
if inside the ReaR recovery system before you run "rear recover"  
a command like `mount /dev/md0 /raid1` makes things work  
for your particular use case, you could automate that using  
a `PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT`, see default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2973](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2973)

on the system I mounted via fstab  
but when I recover it eve did not recognize md0  
so if in the recover enviornment there was md0, I would mount it  
but there is no md0 (only /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc , bit are part of
software raid 1 -&gt; /dev/,=md0)

@ismetsener  
during ReaR recovery system startup nothing happens  
like RAID1 setup because there is no 'mdadm' in any of the  
recovery system startup scripts:

    # find usr/share/rear/skel -type f | xargs grep 'mdadm'
    [no output]

and in build/default/502\_include\_mdadm\_conf.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/502\_include\_mdadm\_conf.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/502_include_mdadm_conf.sh)  
there is

    # Include /etc/mdadm.conf without building arrays automatically
    # for the reason behind see
    # https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1722#issuecomment-394746478

where  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1722\#issuecomment-394746478](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1722#issuecomment-394746478)  
explains it why the RAID arrays are not rebuilt automatically  
because that would let creating a multipath mapping fail.

The ReaR recovery system runs completely in a ramdisk  
and the disks of that system are not touched at all during  
recovery system startup.  
So all you have is the plain kernel block device nodes of the disks  
like /dev/sda /dev/sdb and their partitions like /dev/sdb2 if exists.

so i have to create and mount the 2 disks?  
then it is better to make to backup to an external disk (by using nfs)

I am really not a RAID expert but I think  
you need to manually assemble your RAID1, cf.  
[https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/A\_guide\_to\_mdadm](https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/A_guide_to_mdadm)  
and  
[https://www.thegeekdiary.com/centos-rhel-how-to-assemble-a-software-raid-in-rescue-mode/](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/centos-rhel-how-to-assemble-a-software-raid-in-rescue-mode/)

By the way:  
I wonder how you intend to recreate your system  
on pristine new replacement hardware  
where you don't have an existing RAID1?  
Or do I misunderstand your environment?

So after I use rear recover, I have to confgure the raid1 and mounted
manual  
then it is better to make the backup to external system with nfs?

See my above edited  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2380\#issuecomment-618997658](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2380#issuecomment-618997658)  
what I added about  
usr/share/rear/build/default/502\_include\_mdadm\_conf.sh

So when you don't use multipath it might help in your particular case  
to skip what the build/default/502\_include\_mdadm\_conf.sh script
does  
by adding a `return 0` line at its beginning.  
This is only an offhanded blind idea - I did not test anything.

FYI:  
You can check what there is in your ReaR recovery system  
on your original system where you made it with "rear
mkbackup/mkrescue"  
by using KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR, see default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L142](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L142)

In general having the backup on an external system  
(usually via network on a NFS server as a first step)  
is mandatory to ensure the backup is save when  
the original system gets completely destroyed, cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in

thanks I created a NFS and I will test it again  
when I start the recover process I do not see a "MENU" with all the
options like "recover localhost" and "automatic recover" why is this??

I use the REAR backup/restore for my nas machine, installed on USB
32GB  
so when something happens to the operatinal enviromnet (USB 32GB) I like
to have a backup (another USB 32GB)

So if I restore with rear -d -v recover ,  
I took the former USB out the machine (where I made backup from) and
inserted the NEW USB how to tell the rear-sytem where to install??

I have also 2 disks mounted (so I do not hope that it wriets the backup
to this disks)

I know that I can also use dd command to clone one USB to another  
but with "dd" command you have to shutdown the system to make backup,
and with REAR you can make hot backup without shutting down
