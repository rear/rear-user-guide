OS: OEL 6.6  
REAR: 1.16.1-git201503031650  
Kernel: 3.8.13-55.1.2.el6uek.x86\_64

I recently updated from a 1.13 release because mounting nfs shares would
not work. That issue was resolved in the update. Now the issue is in
creating ext4 file systems. The diskrestore.sh script uses a -f for the
fragment size, but the copy of mkfs.ext4 does not support fragment size
and halts. The version f e2fsprogs on the system is
e2fsprogs-1.42.8-1.0.2.el6.x86\_64.

error from log file:

I removed the fragment size and was able to restore. The server came
back online without issue.

Thank you - I'll add it to the release notes to watch out for - will not
change the code as far I could verify all other distro's are OK with the
`-f`option

@cocampbe could you post the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file
please. The fragmentsize must have been listed via `e2label` -
personally I think this is a defect in OEL 6.6 (not being consistent in
options)

@gdha I would think that this would affect RHEL instances as well. OEL
is, for the most part, a binary equivalent of RHEL. And I would also see
CENTOS as having this issue. I don't have a RHEL or CENTOS instance to
test with.

Argh. I am not sure why this is so. The man page for mkfs.ext4 shows the
fragment size option, but compiled binary throws an error. The package
is e2fsprogs-1.42.8-1.0.2.el6.x86\_64. Again, I am going to assume that
anyone with this package installed will see the issue. Balls.

A couple of years ago @dagwieers brought the concept of capabilities
(with regard to syslinux). Maybe this approach would help here as well?
Query which features mkfs.ext4 supports and include only compatible
options?

@schlomo I think that makes sense. But I feel the fragment size is not
necessary. I cannot speak for all cases, but most people do not specify
a block size or fragment size when creating file systems. It seems to me
that needing those for a recovery is more a closet case, than the norm.
But alas, I am not a developer. And you guys have done a great job
maintaining this project. So I don't want to be too critical.

Well, a recovered system will always have some little differences from
the original. But we try our best. I personally could also live with
emitting a warning about the filesystem features that could not be
recovered.

Probably same like sheep cloning is not yet perfect.

However, your initial problem was that recovery **failed** so there I
see a bug which is caused by trying to be too perfect, at least for your
version of mkfs.ext4. I guess that since a successful recovery is the
main objective we either have to use that feature only if it is
available or we have to remove support for setting the fragment size
till we can do that.

@gdha what do you think?

@schlomo @cocampbe @jsmeix Indeed Centos 7 has the same bug with
`mkfs.ext4: invalid option -- 'f'`  
Centos 7 has rpm e2fsprogs-1.42.9-4.el7.x86\_64 containing the
executable and man-page (which do describe the feature). The
fragmentsize was introduced recently via issue \#549. I think it is
better that we just make the variable empty for the moment as it is an
unkown fact when e2fprogs will enable the fragmentsize feauture. Any
objections?

No. Can you make it transparent to the end user that the recreated
filesystem is not 100% identical?

Also, I could imagine the recovery to fail on very large file systems
and the recovered system to be inefficient on 4k hard disks. Or are
these unrelated?

I think rear should remove the newly added actual support for
fragmentsize everywhere which makes rear again work as it actually did
all the time before (i.e. all the time before rear did not actually
support fragmentsize).

Reasoning:

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/549](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/549)
I wrote

<pre>
It seems ${fragmentsize} in usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13_include_filesystem_code.sh is used but nowhere defined.
</pre>

Because in the past ${fragmentsize} was nowhere defined, the value of
${fragmentsize} was empty so that the mkfs command was always done
without any kind of fragmentsize support.

Because I had found out that ${fragmentsize} is used but nowhere
defined, @gdha had added actual support for it by defining it in
13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh and 23\_filesystem\_layout.sh see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ca41fe5046729fd30a7832ad2985adb18896d631](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ca41fe5046729fd30a7832ad2985adb18896d631)

But this issue here now shows that the actually right way how to deal
with fragmentsize is to not use it because it does not work.

Therefore I suggest to remove both defining it and using it from
13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh and 23\_filesystem\_layout.sh

Any time later when the tools not only describe stuff in their man pages
but even actually support it, then rear might even also support it ;-)

I think the rear code should not contain "fragmentsize" when it does not
actually support it (i.e. I think having a variable ${fragmentsize} but
with empty value because actually it does not work is misleading).

@schlomo  
I think it is not possible with reasonable effort to determine the cases
when the recreated filesystem is not 100% identical.

I think in gereral after a system was recreated with rear it is no
longer 100% identical but there are zillions of individual possible
cases what exactly is no longer 100% identical.

Therefore I suggest rear should make it transparent to its end users (by
the way rear is not used by usual "end users" but by experienced admins)
that in general the recreated system will not be 100% identical.

For example after recreation the system performance might unexpectedly
speed up because tons of fragmented files are now contiguous on the disk
and we should really warn the admin to be prepared against possible dumb
questions from his big boss why the system wasn't already as fast before
the recreation ;-)

And don't forget unexpectedly more free disk space after recreation
because this or that big file that was removed but still in use by some
process that runs "since ever" is now really gone after recreation :-)

Fine in script `layout/save/GNU/Linux/23_filesystem_layout.sh` I
disabled *fragmentsize* to be written into the disklayout.conf file.  
I will not change the script
`layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13_include_filesystem_code.sh` as
*fragmentsize* will not be found anymore in the disklayout.conf and is
therefore completely harmless.

@cocampbe thanks a lot for finding this information, it explains a lot.
I think that the man page is the same for mkfs.ext4 and mkfs.ext3, but
of course they should be more specific.

Do you think that ReaR should do `-f` for ext3? Of course provided that
`mkfs.ext3?` actually does support it.

@schlomo Personally, I would leave -f out. Usually the default settings
for mkfs are sufficient. I would think most people are only using rear
for the OS disk.
