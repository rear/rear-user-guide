#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

<!-- -->

    # rear -V
    Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / 2018-06-21

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

<!-- -->

    # cat /etc/redhat-release
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.10 (Santiago)

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

We are migrating systems in the same network while the source system is
running. When we start the REAR restore of the source systems it comes
up to the rear menus. When we type "ip a s" it shows the exact same IP
of the source server. We at this point puts in a new IP and move
forward. However, during the time the source IP is there nobody can log
into the original source server as there are two identical IP's in the
same network.

How can we make the system come up without any IP address?

I saw the below option -

/etc/rear/mappings/ip\_addresses

But I am more comfortable with having no IP when the system comes up.

Regards,  
Niranjan

See `man rear` that reads

    RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    ...
    ip= nm= netdev= gw=
    If IP address plus optionally netmask (default 255.255.255.0),
    network device (default eth0), and a default gateway
    are specified only that single network device is set up.
    Example:
    ip=192.168.100.2 nm=255.255.255.0 netdev=eth0 gw=192.168.100.1

    noip
    Skip network devices setup by the rescue system start up scripts
    (overrides ip= nm= netdev= gw=).

Alternatively  
use `USE_DHCLIENT=yes` in your etc/rear/local.conf - see default.conf
