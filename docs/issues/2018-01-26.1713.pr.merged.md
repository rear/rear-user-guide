Remove the os.conf creation in the rear.spec file and fixed in function
SetOSVendorAndVersion the proper detection of RedHatEnterpriseServer.
Added new script usr/share/rear/init/default/005\_verify\_os\_conf.sh to
create the os.conf if it did not exist yet - issue \#1639

@gdha  
I did not have a closer look how those things work  
but I wonder why os.conf needs to be created at all  
during "rear WORKFLOW" runtime?  
I.e. I wonder why it is not sufficient to only rely  
on the SetOSVendorAndVersion() function  
during "rear WORKFLOW" runtime?

@jsmeix os.conf is important during the **recover** phase as we cannot
trust that the SetOSVendorAndVersion() function will work properly.

Yes, but why is /etc/rear/os.conf autocreated in the original sytem?

Why not only autocreate a $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/os.conf in the recovery
system  
e.g. in the same way as $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear-release gets autocreated
by  
build/default/970\_add\_rear\_release.sh ?

In general I do not like it when any "rear WORKFOLW" automatically  
changes the original system without an explicit user request.  
I think in general the original system should be sacrosanct - except
there is  
really a very good reason to automatically change the original system.

@jsmeix I prefer to have the discussion in \#1639 if that is ok for you?

@gdha  
of course you are right.

@gdha this is old stuff, but I have a very important question: What
needs the `/etc/rear/os.conf` file on the original system? Wouldn't it
be enough to only write that to the rescue system instead?

The reason I'm asking are two problems I encounter:

1.  the file will never change, even if the OS is upgraded to a newer
    version
2.  the file is created in the source tree if I run ReaR from checkout,
    and it stays there forever even if I try ReaR on a different VM

So I'd like to find out if I can move it to the rescue system only. Or
maybe we actually don't need it any more because `/etc/os-release` is
now the de-facto standard in any case?
