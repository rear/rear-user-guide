Currently layout/prepare/default/010\_prepare\_files.sh  
supports CONFIG\_DIR/disklayout.conf

I suggest that also appropriate\_dir/diskrestore.sh  
should be supported in basically the same way.

Reason:

I would like to be able to provide a prepared
appropriate\_dir/diskrestore.sh  
script that can get used as is for "rear recover"  
or such a script can be manually adapted as needed which means  
when appropriate\_dir/diskrestore.sh exists during "rear recover"  
MIGRATION\_MODE is set to 'true' so that the user gets the  
matching dialog where he can adapt it (i.e. same behaviour  
as currently when CONFIG\_DIR/disklayout.conf exists).

Why I like to provide a prepared appropriate\_dir/diskrestore.sh?

I like to be able to use ReaR to quickly set up an arbitrary disk
layout  
via plain commands that I enter into my selfmade diskrestore.sh
script,  
provide that as appropriate\_dir/diskrestore.sh and get that disk layout
directly  
via "rear recover" without any indirection via disklayout.conf.

Basically that means it must be possible to do "rear recover"  
only with a diskrestore.sh and without any content in disklayout.conf.

I need to find out if that is possible with reasonable effort with
current ReaR.

I fear there could be subtle dependencies on the contents in
disklayout.conf  
in various scripts in ReaR that run during "rear recover" so that it is
not  
possible in practice (with reasonable effort) to do "rear recover"
without  
the content in disklayout.conf.

For example currently 'LAYOUT\_FILE' is used in the finalize scripts  
that install the bootloader:

    finalize/Linux-ppc64/540_check_lilo_path.sh
    finalize/Linux-ppc64/540_check_yaboot_path.sh
    finalize/Linux-ppc64le/680_install_PPC_bootlist.sh
    finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660_install_grub2.sh
    finalize/GNU/Linux/240_reassign_luks_keyfiles.sh
    finalize/Linux-i386/630_install_grub.sh
    finalize/Linux-i386/640_install_lilo.sh
    finalize/Linux-i386/650_install_elilo.sh
    finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh

so some adaptions will be needed there  
but at least what I see on first glance in  
finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
at laset GRUB2 installation should work without disklayout.conf  
when GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES is specified...

@jsmeix I would move the script to $CONFIG\_DIR/scripts sub-directory to
distinguish clearly between config files and scripts (albeit that
everything is a script within rear)

@gdha  
it is perfectly fine with me to have "real scripts" in a sub-directory  
to distinguish them from "config scripts".  
But I would like to understand what your reason behind is  
why you like to keep them separated.  
I mean what would be actually wrong or bad in this case when  
different kind of files are in one same directory?

@jsmeix basically that is already possible via
[http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/](http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/)  
Well to be honest I do not like to see any `*.sh` in the **/etc/rear/**
directory as it is forbidden by RPM building rules.

@jsmeix  
thank you for the explanation why we cannot have executables in /etc  
so I will find and use another directory.

Perhaps I could simply use the var/lib/rear/layout/ directory  
and if therein is already a diskrestore.sh during "rear recover"  
then (to be on the safe side) go into MIGRATION\_MODE and  
show a user dialog where the user must decide to  
either use the existing var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh as is  
or let it be recreated anew by the layout/prepare stage.

In the past (when you had mentioned it somewhere) I had already a look
at  
[http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/](http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/)  
but as far as I understand the description that one is about  
to create diskrestore.sh from disklayout.conf  
i.e. basically "rear recover" but aborted just before  
layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh is run  
or in other words only run the layout/prepare stage.

But this issue here is about to be able to manually make a
diskrestore.sh  
and use that during "rear recover" (without any disklayout.conf).

I like to have that in ReaR 2.6 because I do need it  
for efficient testing ReaR with arbitrary disk layouts, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2023\#issuecomment-456866405](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2023#issuecomment-456866405)

It is just such a boring annoyance for me to install  
a test system with a special disk layout setup  
with indirectly working tools like YaST  
when on the other hand I know that with ReaR  
one could do that directly and much faster and 100% reproducible  
if one could provide a ready-made diskrestore.sh to "rear recover"  
that creates the disk layout directly without any indirection.

The basic idea behind is exactly the same as in the sections  
"Generic usage of the plain SUSE installation system for backup and
recovery" and  
"Generic system installation with the plain SUSE installation system"
and  
"Using ReaR as generic installer in the ReaR recovery system" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads (excerpts)

    An experienced admin makes a script that calls
    his specifically appropriate low-level commands directly.
    ...
    this is working in compliance with the KISS principle
    "keep it simple and straightforward" ...
    and it avoids what is best described in RFC1925 ... as
    "It is always possible to add another level of indirection"
    because the primary intent ... is simplicity and control
