If can eventually fail when doing lvcreate because it could detect an
existing filesystem (xfs for ex.) signatureÂ :  
WARNING: xfs signature detected on /dev/vg0/foobar. Wipe it? \[y/n\]  
and wait indefintely for prompting an yes answer.

To fix that, in REAR menu, chose to edit diskrestore.sh and add

    yes | lvm lvcreate ...

instead of

    lvm lvcreate...

Please fix that permanently in your code.

Thanks.
