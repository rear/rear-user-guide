rename GRUB\_RESCUE to DEVEL\_GRUB\_RESCUE  
to make it transparent that this is a development  
and testing feature and not meant for production.

For background information see

I am thinking about an even more explanatory name  
to make it obvious that this is not about something  
in the recovery system but a modification of GRUB  
in the currently running system.

Unfortunately this week I must leave early into the weekend ;-)  
but next week I will work on it...

@jsmeix @schlomo why not having a poll to drop or keep the GRUB\_RESCUE
thingy? I never used it myself (not since it is off by default)

Regarding "poll to drop or keep the GRUB\_RESCUE":

Good idea to ask if GRUB\_RESCUE is actually needed  
by the users.

I do not menn if it is "nice to have", I mean if GRUB\_RESCUE  
is really needed by the users that justifies effort to maintain it.  
After all GRUB\_RESCUE is not an intrinsic functionality of rear  
as far as I understand
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913\#issuecomment-232654462](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913#issuecomment-232654462)

Regarding "renaming GRUB\_RESCUE":

Initially I thought renaming GRUB\_RESCUE could be  
an exceptional case of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/920\#issuecomment-232891776](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/920#issuecomment-232891776)  
but meanwhile I think renaming GRUB\_RESCUE is  
not a good thing (in particular because the name  
GRUB\_RESCUE is not plain wrong).

I think it is sufficient when I only make the documentation  
about GRUB\_RESCUE more clear what it is about.

In particular bevause nowadays GRUB\_RESCUE is  
disabled by default, the user would read the documentation  
before he enables it and I assume when the documentation  
is very clear what it is about everything should be o.k.

I will make a pull request with better documentation  
about GRUB\_RESCUE and then we can decide if  
that is perhaps already sufficient or if more needs  
to be done here...

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/941](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/941)  
I described GRUB\_RESCUE meaning more clearly  
in default.conf (thsi is the only place where  
GRUB\_RESCUE is documented in the rear source files).

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-07-25 09:10](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/938#issuecomment-234899163):

For me GRUB\_RESCUE does not work  
on SLEs12-SP1 (which has GRUB 2):

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
...
ERROR: GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD needs to be set. Run grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 to generate pbkdf2 hash
</pre>

regardless that there is in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="REAR"
</pre>

The rear log file shows:

<pre>
+ source /root/rear/usr/share/rear/output/default/94_grub2_rescue.sh
...
++ [[ ! REAR == \g\r\u\b\.\p\b\k\d\f\2 ]]
++ Error 'GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD needs to be set. Run grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 to generate pbkdf2 hash'
</pre>

I think in output/default/94\_grub2\_rescue.sh the code

<pre>
if [[ ! "${GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD:0:11}" == 'grub.pbkdf2' ]]; then
    Error "GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD needs to be set. Run grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 to generate pbkdf2 hash"
fi
</pre>

is plain wrong.

First I will fix the GRUB\_RESCUE functionality so that it works  
for me because I like to learn how to use it (I never used it)...

@jsmeix see issue \#703 for more details about grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
usage

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-07-25 11:00](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/938#issuecomment-234923675):

Yes, I also found this out by reverse-engineering the code ;-)  
while I implemented automated usage of grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2  
in output/default/94\_grub2\_rescue.sh as needed via

<pre>
echo -e "$GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD\n$GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD" | $grub_mkpasswd_binary | grep -o 'grub.pbkdf2.*'
</pre>

to generate a PBKDF2 hash from a plain text  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD.

Is there a security reason why GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD  
cannot be plain text (if the user wants it this way)  
but must be always in the form of a PBKDF2 hash?

I mean what would be the real security when the user  
already has the password as plain text in /etc/rear/local.conf  
and only if GRUB\_RESCUE="y" rear errors out?

I think nothing in the rear code can actually hinder the user  
to store any plain text secrets wherever he wants.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
it somewhat works for me on SLE12-SP1.

The drawback in its current form is  
that now I get the GRUB 2 password dialog  
also for the default SLES12 boot entry  
but before I could boot default SLES12  
without a GRUB 2 password dialog.

Note in particular that before
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
GRUB 2 failed to boot the rear recovery system  
because its kernel and initrd that are in '/boot/'  
but were falsely specified in GRUB 2 config to be in '/'  
(i.e. GRUB 2 could not load them).

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703)  
it seems whatever error in the user's GRUB\_RESCUE  
can easily result that he can no longer boot anything  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703\#issuecomment-194819540](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-194819540)

Only a blind guess:  
I assume a single "typo" (i.e. a copy and paste error)  
when the GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD value is a PBKDF2 hash  
results that one can no longer boot anything because  
he current GRUB 2 modification via GRUB\_RESCUE  
results that all boot entries are protected by the same  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD.

Therefore I is perhaps an useful fail-safe feature when one  
can specify the GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD as plain text  
and its PBKDF2 hash is autogenerated by rear to ensure that  
the GRUB 2 password config matches the plain text password.

Now I'm starting to get better picture. It looks like GRUB\_RESCUE
(which should be rather called GRUB2\_RESCUE) and GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD
are tightly bind together. So you can't have unprotected ReaR entry.
This is IMHO not correct.  
If you decide to keep this option widely available you should consider
making password optional.

As stated in
[comment](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-235023170)
to issue \#703, when I did test on Centos only password protected entry
was that one ReaR created, but the behavior might differ on SuSE. This
however does not change the fact, that my Centos was not able to boot
"out of the box" (I had to use some manual reconfiguration in grub shell
to make it work).  
I'll test it deeper tomorrow.

@jsmeix @gdha But first I'd like to know whether it gives any sense to
work further on this code as its future is unclear. The poll might be a
good idea here.  
For me I'd say it that this feature not that useful, especially when I
consider that it updates OS related files, which I'd not expect from
backup software.

With my better description of GRUB\_RESCUE  
in current GitHub master cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/941](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/941)  
I think it is sufficiently clear what that thingy does.

Because GRUB\_RESCUE is disabled by default,  
there are no unexpected changes of files in the  
current running system when "rear mkbackup" is done.

What I like most about the GRUB\_RESCUE feature is  
to be quickly able to recover a system from soft errors  
(like deleting all of /lib/) without digging out the rear recovery  
boot media.

Because of this I think the GRUB\_RESCUE feature  
could be in particular of interest for normal end-users  
who do not have compatible replacement hardware available.

With the GRUB\_RESCUE feature normal end-users  
could use rear on their computer to be quickly able  
to recover the system from soft errors.

For normal end-users who do not have compatible  
replacement hardware available a broken hardware  
usually means they go to the shop and buy newest  
replacement hardware which is usually not sufficiently  
compatible so that "rear recover" would work on it.  
I think when hardware breaks for normal end-users  
it usually means a new installation from scratch with  
an original installation system of a Linux distributor.

On the other hand the GRUB\_RESCUE feature  
requires the backup to be available which means  
one must at least "dig out the backup media"  
(e.g. the USB stick where the backup is stored).

But then the GRUB\_RESCUE feature does no longer  
make much sense in practice because it is more  
straightforward to make a bootable USB stick  
that contains both the rear recovery system  
and the backup.

Therefore in the end the GRUB\_RESCUE feature  
might be in practice only be useful for server admins  
to be quickly able to recover a system from soft errors  
without digging out the rear recovery boot media  
when the backup is stored on another server in the network  
(e.g. on a NFS server) so that the backup is always available  
and thre is no need to "dig out a backup media".

Because in business environments recovery speed matters  
the GRUB\_RESCUE feature could be useful there  
to get a messed up system faster back working.

To even more increase recovery speed the server admin  
could set up rear so that it runs "rear recover" fully automated  
when the rear recovery system is booted  
(i.e. without manual login as root and typing "rear recover")  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/915](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/915)

Bottom line:  
From my current point of view the GRUB\_RESCUE feature  
looks useful and at least for rear 1.19 I would not drop it.

@gozora  
regarding "you can't have unprotected ReaR entry":

With my current code in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
you can have an unprotected 'Relax-and-Recover' entry  
via plain "GRUB\_RESCUE=y" without  
any GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD and GRUB\_SUPERUSER  
(the latter default now to empty values in default.conf).

But if you already have a /etc/grub.d/01\_users file  
where a previous rear run had set up a GRUB 2 superuser  
you must manually remove tha file before you get an  
unprotected 'Relax-and-Recover' entry, cf.

fine.

My current
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
should now work sufficiently well for GRUB 2  
on SUSE and Red Hat based Linux distributions  
because I think I fixed  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703\#issuecomment-235404491](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-235404491)  
at least for Red Hat based Linux distributions.

When there are no objections  
I will merge
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
in a few hours to have it in GitHub master code  
so that also other rear users can test it more easily.
