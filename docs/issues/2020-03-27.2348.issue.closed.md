Currently with OUTPUT=USB on POWER architecture  
the USB medium cannot be booted.

In particular as a precondition the "rear format" workflow may need  
enhancements to prepare a USB medium so that it can be booted  
on POWER architecture e.g. a PreP partition could be needed, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344\#issuecomment-600838126](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344#issuecomment-600838126)

With current ReaR GitHub Master code  
we have those scripts for OUTPUT=USB on PC platform:

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep 'i386' | grep '/USB/'

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/830_copy_kernel_initrd.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_check_usb_disk.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_find_syslinux_modules.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/400_check_extlinux.sh

But we have nothing for POWER architecture:

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep -i 'ppc' | grep '/USB/'

    [no output]

We also have nothing for IBM Z (s390) or ARM architecture:

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep -i 's390' | grep '/USB/'

    [no output]

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep -i 'arm' | grep '/USB/'

    [no output]

A workaround to get a bootable USB on POWER architecture  
that only works for Power BareMetal with the petitboot bootloader  
is to make an ISO by using OUTPUT=ISO and  
copy the ISO on a USB device with `dd`, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243\#issuecomment-537354570](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243#issuecomment-537354570)

For comparison what we have for OUTPUT=ISO  
for PC platform

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep 'i386' | grep '/ISO/'

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/800_create_isofs.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/810_prepare_multiple_iso.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/260_EFISTUB_populate.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/820_create_iso_image.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/830_create_iso_image_EFISTUB.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/850_check_for_errors.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300_create_isolinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/ISO/Linux-i386/330_find_isolinux.sh

and for POWER architecture

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep 'ppc' | grep '/ISO/'

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/300_create_yaboot.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/310_create_grub2.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/800_create_isofs.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/820_create_iso_image.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/300_create_grub2.sh

I think as a first step at least the workaround should be documented  
to make an ISO and dump it on a USB device, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243\#issuecomment-537354570](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243#issuecomment-537354570)

I think "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" should even error out  
with OUTPUT=USB on POWER architecture  
because that does not provide what the user expects.  
In general it is better to error out early in "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
when it is known that things will not work this way  
than to let the user find out later by trial and error  
while testing "rear recover" that things do not work,

As far as I see a bootable OUTPUT=USB is not supported  
on any architecture except PC compatible x86/x86\_64 i.e. `Linux-i386`.

Reasoning:

According to

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep -o '/[^/]*/[0-9][0-9][0-9]_' | cut -d '/' -f2 | sort -u

    Debian
    Fedora
    Linux
    Linux-arm
    Linux-i386
    Linux-ia64
    Linux-ppc64
    Linux-ppc64le
    Linux-s390
    SUSE_LINUX
    default
    i386
    s390

we have architecture specific scripts for those architectures  
so I use that to see what architecture specific `USB` scripts we have

    # for arch in $( find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep -o '/[^/]*/[0-9][0-9][0-9]_' | cut -d '/' -f2 | sort -u | grep -v 'default' ) ; do find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep USB | grep "/$arch/" ; done

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/830_copy_kernel_initrd.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_check_usb_disk.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_find_syslinux_modules.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/400_check_extlinux.sh

which are exactly the "scripts for OUTPUT=USB on PC platform"  
in my initial comment here.

So I conclude `Linux-i386` is the only architecture  
where `OUTPUT=USB` is really supported.

On POWER architecture a PreP partition is not always needed, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243\#issuecomment-605506628](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243#issuecomment-605506628)  
and the related comments around it that read  
(excerpts plus \[...\] addons):

    ... according to #2344 [OUTPUT=USB on PPC64le PowerVM not bootable]
    a PreP partition is missing, so the system should not even start booting,
    while here [#2243 IBM Power8 BareMetal rescue USB boot kernel panic: ...]
    it starts booting and can not mount root
    ...
    the reason why the system can boot is because it is using
    petitboot ... on Power BareMetal system (like LC models).
    In a nuteshell petitboot is micro-linux in firmware which load
    and scan disk and network to find grub configuration and
    aggregate then into a single menu (for disk, SAN, network, dvd, usb).
    So, in that case, PreP partition is not needed.
    ...
    #2344 is PowerVM LPAR, in that case, Prep is needed.

@jsmeix You are right we should bail out the code with an error non all
non-Linux-i386 architectures for the moment (with `OUTPUT=USB`) -
perhaps with an ask for sponsoring?

    I think "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" should even error out
    with OUTPUT=USB on POWER architecture
    because that does not provide what the user expects.

I would like to have
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2396](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2396)  
merged before the ReaR 2.6 release.

For now
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2396](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2396)  
only errors out on POWER architectures  
(`Linux-ppc64` and `Linux-ppc64le`)  
because I do not yet know how OUTPUT=USB  
actually behaves on other non-x86 architectures.

@jsmeix go ahead - as long we are not in a change freeze you can commit
whatever you think is reasonable

With

this issue should be fixed.

FYI I don't know about POWER, but I intend to implement `OUTPUT=USB` on
S/390, when more the current important issues get resolved.
