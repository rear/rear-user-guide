@schlomo  
what do you think about this deprecation request?

I ask in particular because (if I understand you correctly)  
you proposed to simply delete it.

I think deprecation has the advantage that  
layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh  
is still there and can still be used "as is" via

    DISABLE_DEPRECATION_ERRORS+=( nsr_check_iso_recoverable )

by users who need it and we (hopefully) learn  
from user feedback how it is used in practice  
and ideally some BACKUP=NSR may even provide  
a pull request with a proper solution.

A possible problem with the deprecation is that  
either ReaR errors out or that script is run "as is"  
(with "`DISABLE_DEPRECATION_ERRORS+=( nsr_check_iso_recoverable )`")  
but (at least in some cases) the latter causes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3069](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3069)

So this deprecation cannot actually fix  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3069](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3069)  
but it can only show the problem to the user  
and tell the user to get in contact with us.
