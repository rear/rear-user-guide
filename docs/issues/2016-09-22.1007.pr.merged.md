See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974)  
in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974\#issuecomment-248895101](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974#issuecomment-248895101)

Additionally I dared to enhance the general comment  
in default.conf about how to use our variable types  
(as far as I see BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED  
has ternary semantics because both is\_true and is\_false  
is used for that variable).

Changes only in documentation cannot cause  
really bad regressions so that I merge it.
