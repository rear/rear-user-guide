OS: Fedora 16 x64

When booting into the rescue mode from a CD it finishes loading with "\*
\* \* Rescue System is ready \* \* \*" with a blinking cursor after it.
Hitting enter creates a new line and things can be typed in but no
commands are accepted and the shell prompt never appears. The only error
on the screen is:  
Running 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
error binding udev control socket  
Waiting for udev ... done.

/etc/rear/local.conf

    # Create ReaR rescue media as ISO image
    OUTPUT=ISO

    # optionally set your backup software
    BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE

Did a quick test on a Fedora 15 image and I also saw the message "error
binding udev control socket", but I did got a login prompt and a working
rescue image.

I just setup a virtual machine running fresh Fedora 16 x64 with a
minimal install and default partition layout. I installed rear's prereqs
and syslinux and 1.14 from
([http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/Fedora\_16/noarch/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/Fedora_16/noarch/)),
ran a mkrescue with requestrestore, copied it to my desktop, burned it
and tried running it on a bare metal machine. Had the same issue.

Seems to be reproducible.

I had the same problem in Arch using systemd BTW, so it's something with
our initialization scripts. I did not have the time to investigate
further yet. What worked was going to the second console ALT-F2 and do
the restore from there.

will try it myself beginning of next week - found a vm with f16 on it.

I confirm that on F16 the fixes of Jeroen doesn't break systemd, but on
the contrary they work very well.  
@jhoekx Thanks a lot.

PS: tested it on OpenSuse 12 too üëç works fine (only systemd-udev
complains, but that is normal as it is only available in f18-beta)
