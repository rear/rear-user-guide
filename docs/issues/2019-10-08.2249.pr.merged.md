\#2248

-   How was this pull request tested?

Support for Rubrik CDM was created and then tested by recovering systems
on vSphere based on the test matrix documented in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/fix-4-issue-2248-add-rubrik-support/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/fix-4-issue-2248-add-rubrik-support/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc).
Not all combinations were tested but enough were tested to give
confidence in the restore process using CDM from each type of Linux
system. Additional testing can be done as needed.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

<!-- -->

-   \[x\] Added support to copy the Rubrik CDM RBS agent to the ReaR
    ISO.
-   \[X\] Added the ability to recover a Linux system using its original
    IP address from the original Rubrik Cluster
-   \[X\] Added the ability to recover a Linux system using a new IP
    (DHCP) address from the original Rubrik Cluster
-   \[X\] Added the ability to recover a Linux system using its same or
    new IP address from a different Rubrik Cluster (replication target)

@DamaniN  
many thanks for your valuable contribution to ReaR.  
It is much appreciated.

I know absolutely nothing about what  
support for Rubrik Cloud Data Management in ReaR would actually mean  
because I have nothing at all to do with Rubrik Cloud Data Management  
so I cannot review or even test your code whether or not it will
actually work.

All what I can do is a review by plain looking at your code.  
I made some comments to your code what I noticed  
what might be improved.

In general - as far as I see - your contribution is a pure addition  
(i.e. no existing code is changed) so that there cannot be regressions  
for others which means we could "just accept" your addition  
(except another ReaR maintainer detects something serious).

Now the crucial question:  
Woud you @DamaniN maintain support for Rubrik Cloud Data Management in
ReaR  
in the future, at least for some reasonable time unit this new feature
has stabilized?

Yes, @jsmeix, I or someone on our team here at Rubrik would maintain
this for a reasonable time until this new feature has stabilized. We
have requested that a number of customers test and use it in the near
future.

I'll review and update the code based on your comments over the next
week or so.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to get at least one second review  
and approvement by another ReaR maintainer  
before I would merge it.
