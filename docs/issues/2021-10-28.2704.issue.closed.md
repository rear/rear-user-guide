all version

redhat enterprise linux 8

i can't do this , is Impossible to force command

    rear format /dev/disk/by-label/USB-KEY-FOO-BAR

You need to tape manually **YES**

if will be great to add force or f option ?

    rear format /dev/disk/by-label/USB-KEY-FOO-BAR -f or --force

i don't want to do something like

    rear format /dev/disk/by-label/USB-KEY-FOO-BAR < echo YES

    rear -v format -- -f -y /dev/sdX

works for me to "format" the whole disk  
(i.e. create partitioning and filesystems from scratch)  
which is what "rear format" is meant for.

The "rear format" workflow has a somewhat special syntax  
(that is caused by what getopt needs for nested getopt calls  
because getopt is first called in rear and then in the format workflow)

    # rear format help
    ERROR: Argument 'help' not accepted. Use 'rear format -- --help' for more information.

    # rear format -- --help
    Use 'rear format [ -- OPTIONS ] DEVICE' like 'rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdX'
    Valid format workflow options are: -e/--efi -f/--force -y/--yes

Usually /dev/disk/by-label/\* cannot work because those  
labels usually mean filesystem labels so /dev/disk/by-label/\*  
are symlinks that point to partitions with filesystems  
but "rear format" needs a whole disk device  
so e.g. /dev/disk/by-id/\* works for those /dev/disk/by-id/\* symlinks  
that point to a whole disk like for me

    /dev/disk/by-id/usb-TOSHIBA_External_USB_3.0_20170521000273F-0:0 -> /dev/sdb

so also

    rear -v format -- -f -y /dev/disk/by-id/usb-TOSHIBA_External_USB_3.0_20170521000273F-0:0

works for me.

I wonder what is wrong with providing the input a program needs at its
stdin like

    echo Yes | rear -v format /dev/sdX

which also works for me.
