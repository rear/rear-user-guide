Hi,  
I try to do a local backup with rear which I then want to copy to
another location with rsync (Together with other files that's why I
don't want to use a remote storage in rear directly).  
However the backup fails with the following error:

> ERROR: URL 'file:///var/backup/fullbackup/actualbackup' has the backup
> directory '/var/backup/fullbackup/actualbackup' in the '/' filesystem
> which is forbidden.

I've seen some reports about that but all got closed and seem to get
resolved, however for some reason it is not working for me. Below please
see my local.conf:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///var/backup/fullbackup
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///var/backup/fullbackup/actualbackup
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/var/backup/fullbackup' '/proc' '/tmp' )

I compiled an rpm from the latest github code and installed it so I
should have the most recent rear version:

    # rpm -qa | grep rear
    rear-2.2-1.git.2502.d8550a0.master.el7.centos.x86_64

Would be great if you could let me know whether it should work with the
most recent version (Which seems to be the case from what I read in the
other Bug reports about this) and I'm simply stupid or whether there
might still be some bug in the code.

Running rear in debug mode I get this (last 300 lines of logfile):

Hi NoelzeN,  
this error is normal because it is not intended to backup a system on
the same machine.  
In this case you would have nothing to restore when the machine dies or
the hhds/raid fail.

Thanks, that makes sense, though I copy the files directly after the
backup via rsync, just together with some other backup files like sql
dumps. So there is no way to force this? Maybe this should be a warning
instead of an error?

@NoelzeN why not using `BACKUP=rsync` method directly?

@gdha good question :) maybe I should do that. Though it'd still be
interesting whether this could be put as a warning instead of an error
(Like bad idea, but there might be some reason why you're doing this so
if you can take the risk, go ahead)

@NoelzeN  
in general ReaR code is meant that the user can adapt  
and enhace it as he needs it for his particular use case  
so that for your particular use case you could change in  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/400\_automatic\_exclude\_recreate.sh  
that 'Error' into what you like e.g. a 'LogPrint' or alternatively  
when you use ReaR GitHub master code into 'LogPrintError'  
(cf. usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh).

Because that 'Error' exit is intentionally there to force the user  
to do something in this case we won't change it into a message.

FYI:  
In general we like to avoid warnings as much as possible, cf.  
[http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

I think the issue is sufficiently answered so that I close it  
but one can still add comments (even when it is closed).
