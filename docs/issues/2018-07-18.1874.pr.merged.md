@gdha  
I have no experience with the particular `net.ifnames=0` kernel command
line parameter  
but that particular case does not matter for what I do not like in
general with your  
current implementation as far as I understand it from plain looking at
the code.

As far as I understand it from plain looking at the code  
with your current implementation things would work as follows:

(1.)  
In default.conf

<pre>
COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS=( 'net.ifnames' 'biosdevname' )
</pre>

results that in rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
a `net.ifnames=0` kernel command line parameter setting  
will be added to the KERNEL\_CMDLINE that will be used  
when booting the recovery system kernel.  
Up to that point there are no changes as things worked in the past.

(2.)  
Now via your current implementation there is your new  
subsequent script rescue/GNU/Linux/700\_persistent\_interface.sh  
that again removes the `net.ifnames=0` kernel command line parameter  
if persistent network interface naming is used on the original system  
from the KERNEL\_CMDLINE that will be used  
when booting the recovery system kernel.

This means the user has no way to specify that the recovery system
kernel  
must boot with the `net.ifnames=0` kernel command line parameter set  
if persistent network interface naming is used on his original system.

This contradicts in general my favourite "final power to the user"
principle and  
it contradicts in particular what default.conf tells about
KERNEL\_CMDLINE

<pre>
# You can add arbitrary kernel command line parameters
# when booting the rescue/recovery system
# as you need it
</pre>

I.e. when the user has in his etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
KERNEL_CMDLINE="net.ifnames=0"
</pre>

then ReaR must obey the user's commandment and boot the recovery system
kernel  
with the `net.ifnames=0` kernel command line parameter set.

To solve the issue I suggest to not implement it in a new  
separated subsequent script but to add code to the existsing  
rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
that does by default (i.e. unless `net.ifnames` is specified in
KERNEL\_CMDLINE)  
not add `net.ifnames=0` to KERNEL\_CMDLINE  
if persistent network interface naming is used on the original system.

Simply put I suggest:  
By default  
if persistent network interface naming is used on the original system  
skip adding `net.ifnames=0` to KERNEL\_CMDLINE  
in rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh

Only an untested proposal to show what I mean:

I think the code in rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
can be enhanced to support what is needed here  
and simplified (no longer the circuitous kernel\_option\_superseeded)  
to something like (excerpt - only the second for loop):

<pre>
# Verify if the kernel option we want to add to KERNEL_CMDLINE are not already set/force by the user in the rear configuration.
# If yes, the parameter set in the configuration file have the priority and superseed the current kernel option.
for new_kernel_option in "${new_kernel_options_to_add[@]}" ; do
    new_kernel_option_keyword="${new_kernel_option%%=*}"

    for rear_kernel_option in $KERNEL_CMDLINE; do
        # Check if a kernel option key without value parameter (everything before =) is not already present in rear KERNEL_CMDLINE array.
        if test "$new_kernel_option_keyword = "${rear_kernel_option%%=*}" ; then
            Log "Current kernel option [$new_kernel_option] supperseeded by [$rear_kernel_option] in your rear configuration: (KERNEL_CMDLINE)"
            # Continue with the next new_kernel_option (i.e. continue the outer 'for' loop):
            continue 2
        fi
    done

    if test "net.ifnames" = "$new_kernel_option_keyword" ; then
        # If we are using persistent naming do not add net.ifnames to KERNEL_CMDLINE
        # see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1874
        # and continue with the next new_kernel_option:
        is_persistent_ethernet_name $( ip r | awk '$2 == "dev" && $8 == "src" { print $3 }' | sort -u | head -1 ) && continue
    fi

    LogPrint "Adding $new_kernel_option to KERNEL_CMDLINE"
    KERNEL_CMDLINE="$KERNEL_CMDLINE $new_kernel_option"
done
</pre>

@schabrolles  
I added you as reviewer here  
because rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
is originally your script, cf.

@jsmeix Thank you for the review! As you see by reviewing each others
code it can only get better. Thanks for the suggestion as it is indeed
easier and cleaner. Will take a day or two before I can change it due to
being off-site.

I have a nitpicking question:

What do you think is best how to split  
the kernel option keyword from the kernel option value:

<pre>
# new_kernel_option="foo=bar=baz"

# echo "keyword='${new_kernel_option%=*}'"
keyword='foo=bar'

# echo "keyword='${new_kernel_option%%=*}'"
keyword='foo'
</pre>

I guess `${new_kernel_option%%=*}` would be better because  
I assume a '=' character never happens in a kernel option keyword  
but a '=' character might happen in a kernel option value  
because one cannot know what arbitrary values could be.  
For example think about values that could contain arbitrary characters  
like `some_password=arbitrary=characters`

@jsmeix @schabrolles I reworked the code in 290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh
script to deal with persistent naming (I also included jsmeix suggestion
of above). It works fine as I tested it via rear-automated-testing.

@gdha  
I approve it because you tested it and it works well for you  
and you have perfectly well documented what the code  
is meant to do.

But - from plain looking at the code - it still seems  
as if the added part at the end of  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
makes it impossible for the user to enforce via  
`KERNEL_CMDLINE="$KERNEL_CMDLINE net.ifnames=0"`  
that the recovery system kernel gets booted with the `net.ifnames=0`  
kernel option set.

Regardless if that works or not I think when the user has explicity  
specified it (all in local.conf is what the user has explicity
specified  
in contrast to what we have in default.conf) ReaR must obey.

Simply put:  
I think ReaR is for root and runs as root and then the user  
can do destructive things if he is careless, e.g. when there is  
`rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` in local.conf the user gets that.

Or I misunderstand what the added part at the end of  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/290\_kernel\_cmdline.sh  
actually does?

@gdha, I don't currently don't have time to deeply look into the code;
but had a quick look on it. If I understand well, the purpose of this PR
is to remove `KERNEL_CMDLINE` parameters from local.conf that could be
set by "mistake" like `net.ifname=0` when biosdevname are currently in
use on the real system. Am I right ?

I think it could happen in a migration mode use case  
(i.e. when `rear recover` is run on different replacement hardware  
or when `rear recover` is run in a different new environment)  
that a `KERNEL_CMDLINE` setting in local.conf is wrong  
for the replacement hardware or in the new environment.

But in this case the user can edit the kernel command line  
in the recovery system boot menue so that a  
wrong `KERNEL_CMDLINE` setting in local.conf  
is not a dead end for the user.

@jsmeix @schabrolles Indeed users can add it anyhow without fully
understanding the meaning of it or the side-effects (=no interfaces
found in recovery mode). This protects them from such mistakes and in
case they really need it they can still add it manually or on the
command level at boot up time.  
Furthermore, it makes my ReaR Automated Testing environment much easier
(less config sets required)
