Hi,

I have changed the script so that initramfs get rebuild for all kernels
mentioned in grub.conf  
I tested it with Rhel5 and it works. (See \#235)

What do you think? Is this an acceptable way to do this?

best regards  
Tim

Oops, sorry. I did some mistake, I wanted to change the file at once,
not with different diffs.  
I am not experienced with git :(

Mh, I think I will have to test a bit more, it worked on some systems,
but today I realised that it didn't work for  
some other. I will have to take a closer look and close this for now

@goldzahn could you share some comments on what you experienced on the
different OS versions? Is the code broken now?
