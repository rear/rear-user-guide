-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Since ssh-agent gets added it makes sense to add ssh-add as well.

@rear/contributors  
I am not at all a ssh expert so I would like to get a review  
from someone who knows more about ssh-agent with and without ssh-add.

ssh-agent without ssh-add was added to PROGS via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a08109ff9ecbc1e7bf530f5f35d0a35576837fb5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a08109ff9ecbc1e7bf530f5f35d0a35576837fb5)  
from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513)  
that is based on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1500](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1500)

So I think ssh-agent works even without ssh-add but according to  
[https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/add](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/add)  
ssh-add is needed for "Adding an Arbitrary Key"  
so it seems ssh-add should be available by default in the recovery
system  
so that by default "Adding an Arbitrary Key" is possible.

According to  
[https://smallstep.com/blog/ssh-agent-explained/](https://smallstep.com/blog/ssh-agent-explained/)  
"ssh-add -x" is needed "to reduce your risk when agent forwarding"  
so it seems ssh-add should be available by default in the recovery
system  
so that it is by default possible "to reduce your risk when agent
forwarding".

Adding ssh-add by default to the recovery system  
increases the default recovery system size by about 500KB  
because on my openSUSE Leap 15.3 system I get

    # ls -lh /usr/bin/ssh-add
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 435K Nov 26 09:30 /usr/bin/ssh-add

    linux-h9wr:~ # ldd /usr/bin/ssh-add
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc58bfe000)
            libcrypto.so.1.1 => /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.1 (0x00007f7404a56000)
            libz.so.1 => /lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00007f740483f000)

            libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f7404046000)
            /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f74051aa000)

    linux-h9wr:~ # ldd /usr/bin/ssh-agent 
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffdd0df6000)
            libcrypto.so.1.1 => /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.1 (0x00007f9679fb8000)
            libz.so.1 => /lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00007f9679da1000)
            libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f96799cc000)
            libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f96797c8000)
            libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f96795a8000)
            /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f967a709000)

so 435K for /usr/bin/ssh-add will be added  
but no additional libraries will be added.
