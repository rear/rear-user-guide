hi,

Im facing a situation where creating the REAR mkrescue backup fails
(version 2.7)  
because the symlink for the device on / is is missing on the system:

    +++ get_root_disk_UUID
    +++ set -o pipefail
    +++ mount
    +++ grep ' on / '
    +++ awk '{print $1}' 
    +++ xargs blkid -s UUID -o value
    ++ local root_uuid=201aaa04-1247-49de-8c0c-3e1274ee9fxx
    ++ test -b /dev/disk/by-uuid/201aaa04-1247-49de-8c0c-3e1274ee9fxx
    ++ Error 'root_uuid device '\''/dev/disk/by-uuid/201aaa04-1247-49de-8c0c-3e1274ee9fxx'\'' is no block device'

clearly, this is an issue of the system itself, partprobe does not
create the required symlinks.  
Is this however mandatory in REAR, or is the symlink only used if
/etc/fstab contains UUID entries?  
Im searching for a workaround, if any.

Thanks

@abbbi  
I cannot imagine how your storage layout looks like  
so please provide the output of

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,UUID

and what /dev/disk/by-uuid/201aaa04-1247-49de-8c0c-3e1274ee9fxx  
actually is (i.e. its symlink target)

hi,

as it stands, there was an missing udev rule on the system involved,
which resulted in  
the symlink missing.
