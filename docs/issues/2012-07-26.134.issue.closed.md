The 31\_network\_devices.sh script has a number of mentions of things
that need to be fixed up for bonding. I have a SLES10 bonding setup
(both production and lab) and I'm happy to work on this, testing and/or
submitting patches, if the problems can be specified.

I've yet to try this with a multi-bond server, but so far I haven't had
a problem using the bond0 interface when in the recovery environment. I
don't have SIMPLIFY\_BONDING defined.

Be aware that we want to support the case where bonding is using LACP
(and also VLAN-tagging), and we want to auto-detect the different links
by doing an ARP request to the gateway (of possible). This was discussed
in issue \#3.

Anything that improves the current implementation (without fixing every
use-case) is also welcome, provided that it acknowledges the cases that
are not supported *and* does not make a more complete implementation
more difficult.

Hmm. This is more complicated than I anticipated and perhaps beyond my
expertise in some cases. I'm not using LACP (only active-backup because
we only need redundancy, and didn't want to reconfigure the switch
ports), so I can't test LACP or VLAN-tagging setups.

I can confirm that on my system, the bond0 interface takes on the MAC
address of the first ethernet device in the bond. But this is from
experience, and I have not confirmed this from reading the bonding
documentation or code.

Regarding:

    # Note: Some users reported that this works only for the first bonding device
    # in this case one should disable bonding by setting SIMPLIFY_BONDING

Can you provide any details on the nature/symptoms of the failure, or
references to an issue number? If I can recreate the problem, I might be
able to help fix it.

I put in some TODOs when I knew that I was dealing only with certain  
"working" configurations but could see already where this code would
fail  
in other configurations...

I guess with regard to bonding/vlan/... we need to slowly build up
working  
scenarios and document them. The code should be also clean enough to
not  
mix up link level and stuff like vlan and bonding and ip level stuff
like  
ip rule and ip route and ip addr things.

VLAN support is in rear-1.16 already - we better close this issue and if
other (new) issues occur a new issue can be opened
