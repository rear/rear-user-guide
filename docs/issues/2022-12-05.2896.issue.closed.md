@will-code-for-pizza  
without a "rear -D recover" debug log file  
we at ReaR upstream cannot guess why it  
"Failed to install GRUB2 on /dev/vda".

This error message comes from  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
for current ReaR upstream GitHub masetr code at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh\#L105](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh#L105)

    if ! chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "$grub_name-install $grub2_install_device" ; then
        LogPrintError "Failed to install GRUB2 on $grub2_install_device"

so what failed was the command

    chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "$grub_name-install $grub2_install_device"

With "rear -D recover" there should be sufficient debug messages  
in the ReaR log file in particular some (error) messages of  
grub2-install or grub-install (what $grub\_name-install evaluates to)  
that hopefully point to the root cause wha it fails.

This code worked well for me for my tests  
but I am not a Ubuntu user so when things are  
different on Ubuntu there is not much what I can do  
in practice (I won't find time to install Ubuntu  
and try out how things behave there).

FYI:  
See the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads (excerpts)

    When "rear -d -D recover" fails,
    you need to save the log file
    out of the ReaR recovery system
    (where "rear -d -D recover" was run
    and where it had failed) before you
    shut down the ReaR recovery system
    ...
    See the "First steps with Relax-and-Recover"
    section above how to access the ReaR recovery
    system from remote via ssh so that you can
    use 'scp' to get files out of the ReaR recovery
    system.

The "First steps with Relax-and-Recover" section

The issus is that ReaR calls in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh

    chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login -c 'grub-install /dev/vda'

which fails in your case with

    grub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.
    grub-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..
    grub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.

So it seems Ubuntu 22.04 installs itself without a BIOS Boot Partition  
which is needed by `grub-install /dev/vda`.

I am neither a booting expert nor am I a Ubuntu user  
so I cannot tell how Ubuntu 22.04 bootloader setup is done  
so that it works on the original system.

What puzzles me is that GRUB2 talks about a BIOS Boot Partition  
while there is /boot/efi mounted on /dev/vda1 which indicates  
that UEFI is used with an EFI system partition (ESP) /dev/vda1  
and I think that BIOS and UEFI somewhat contradict each other  
but I am not a sufficient booting expert to make educated  
statements here - in particular not off the top of my head.

From my current point of view I think ReaR may need some  
Ubuntu specific enhancements so that the bootloader setup  
at the end of "rear recover" also works on Ubuntu 22.04.

@jsmeix , thanks for your support...

Probably, the "This GPT partition label contains no BIOS boot partition"
message suggests that the rescue media was booted in legacy BIOS style,
and as a result, it will wind up trying to install a BIOS version of
GRUB onto a GPT-partitioned disk.

It' s just a suggestion. My crystal ball is in the wash right now :-(

Cause I use a KVM VM for testing, I will search now for how to activate
EFI boot mechanism for ISO.  
Probably this would fix it.

Thanks a lot so far.

@will-code-for-pizza  
as far as I know the ReaR recovery medium must use the same  
booting mechanism (either BIOS or UEFI) as the original system  
otherwise it is not possible to intstall the right booting mechanism  
(i.e. the same as on the original system) during "rear recover".

When you use UEFI on your original sytem  
but "rear mkrescue" creates a ReaR recovery medium  
with BIOS booting mechanism you may have to explicitly  
specify things like  
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
and when you use UEFI with Secure Boot  
you may have to additionally specify  
SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER

In general see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for various things that are described therein  
which are related to \[U\]EFI (and Secure Boot).

@jsmeix since my changes to format and grub install it should be
possible to create a recover media with one method of your choice or
both boot methods (bios/uefi). The uefi case however is buggy see \#2883

@will-code-for-pizza what was your `rear format` command used? or does
iso mode not require that command?  
also you may need more grub packages depending on what you try to
achieve.

Whoops!  
Now I see it: `OUTPUT=ISO` with `BACKUP_URL=usb:...`  
@DEvil0000 thank you to mention `rear format` and "iso mode"!

I think

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

does not "just work", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)

What should work is

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

cf.  
[https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
and see what I had tested e.g. in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829)  
where I had tested `OUTPUT=USB` with BIOS and UEFI  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662)  
but there I had only tested `OUTPUT=USB` with BIOS.

Alternatively there is

    OUTPUT=RAWDISK

see its description in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2698](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2698)

I don't think I ever tested the combination of `OUTPUT=ISO` with
`BACKUP_URL=usb:...` but I think this should be valid.  
I would in such a case expect a ISO getting build and then written to a
device with `dd` using the device in `BACKUP_URL`. If this combination
is not valid we should document it/print a log line.

I am however not sure if this is the actual issue since it is very
similar to USB related issues I faced when testing UEFI see \#2883

Some general info:

Our various ReaR recovery system bootloader setup things  
are long grown rather complicated / convoluted pieces of code  
that behave different depending on "these or those" conditions.

As far as I can remember I never tested the combination  
of `OUTPUT=ISO` with `BACKUP_URL=usb:...` and I don't know  
whether or not that combination should work or had ever worked  
(if I knew it cannot work I would add a check and error out  
when a user specified this combination).

As far as I can remember I only tested  
mostly `OUTPUT=ISO` with `BACKUP_URL=nfs:...`  
and less often `OUTPUT=USB` with `BACKUP_URL=usb:...`  
the latter mostly with BIOS and only a bit with UEFI, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829\#issuecomment-1165584336](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829#issuecomment-1165584336)

Furthermore I am not a Ubuntu user  
(and I won't find time to test things on Ubuntu) and  
we at ReaR upstream do not have an active maintainer who uses Ubuntu  
(and it seems Canonical is not sufficiently interested in ReaR)  
so ReaR support for Ubuntu can be only as good as voluntary  
contributors who use Ubuntu contribute - which is much appreciated!

As far as I see from plain looking at what is written in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2883](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2883)

    grub-install: error: cannot find EFI directory

the error message there at least looks to me  
as if the issue there is a different one.  
But I am not a sufficient booting expert  
(and even less an UEFI and/or Secure Boot expert)  
to make educated statements here.

Hi together, after beeing ill for 2 weeks, I found time to test and my
specific problem depends on the boot/EFI config of my virtual machine...
:-(

Sorry for bothering you because of an environmental issue.
