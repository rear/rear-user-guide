Hi, Duplicity restore script seems to be missing the extended arguments
from BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_OPTIONS on the command line call.

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.6-git.4355.3a699396.master.changed (still valid in current master)

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

    -   Install rear and configure it with a Duplicity backup
    -   Include specific BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_OPTIONS arguments
        -   In my case it was duplicity's --s3-endpoint-url as I don't
            use AWS S3 storage
    -   Build rescue image and start recover
    -   Duplicity might fail if the additionnal options are required for
        the backup data to be accessed (e.g S3 endpoints)

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Haven't found any easy one, apart from modifying
    400\_restore\_duplicity.sh by hand (pull request to come)

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):  
    [rear-reard2c.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/6545818/rear-reard2c.log)

As mentionned, I'll create a pull request with what I did on my files to
make it work,

Regards

@GreenBlood  
I am not a BACKUP=DUPLICITY user so I cannot reproduce or test
anything  
and all what I write here is only from plain looking at the code.

Could BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_OPTIONS while the backup is made  
be different compared to options that are needed during restore?  
If yes would it perhaps be better to have a separated  
BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS  
config variable or is that overkill?

Could BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_OPTIONS contain sectets  
like whatever kind of passwords/passphrases or things like that?

@GreenBlood  
by the way:

I had a quick look at the counterpart script  
usr/share/rear/backup/DUPLICITY/default/500\_make\_duplicity\_backup.sh  
I noticed the strange looking DUP\_OPTIONS usage therein.  
Do you perhaps know why the extra variable DUP\_OPTIONS is interposed
there  
and why not just BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_OPTIONS is directly used as is?  
To me this looks like yet another RFC 1925 item 6a implementation  
"It is always possible to add another level of indirection".

Looking at the arguments listings, I'm not sure this would be very
helpful, but I'm not a very advanced duplicity user either so I may not
see the full picture. Anyway adding a restore-specific option (maybe
"cloning" it from backup options by default) does not seems technically
very hard.

> Could BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_OPTIONS contain sectets

Encryption password are generally either prompted when running the
command, or passed through environment variable. For example the basic
case, rear uses the setting named
"BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_GPG\_ENC\_PASSPHRASE", which is transferred to
"PASSPHRASE" when passed to duplicity (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/DUPLICITY/default/500\_make\_duplicity\_backup.sh\#L41](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/DUPLICITY/default/500_make_duplicity_backup.sh#L41)
).

Likewise, in my case the backup storage backend I'm authenticating
against is an cloud object storage and I have to use environment
variables to connect to it, as there is no specific option to do that.

Some duplicity options are security-related (like specifying which GPG
key to use when using asymetric encryption) but from what I can see in
the arguments, nothing ressembling a passphrase or something that would
be VERY private.

I saw this variable usage too and assumed it was related to the
`# todo: check parameters` a few lines above. But like you said, is it
seems there is no other processing of those variable involved, it looks
to me that both variable are exactly the same. (BKP\_URL in the same
file has the same weird usage)

Regarding `BACKUP_DUPLICITY_GPG_ENC_PASSPHRASE`  
it seems the `ENC` therein does not mean the passphrase value is
encrypted therein  
but that it contains the unencrypted passphrase to `ENC`rypt the
backup  
as far as I can imagine what its little comment in default.conf means.

When a variable can contain a secret value special code is needed  
to avoid that the secret value leaks out, see the issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2155](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2155)  
and the special code that is used to fix it in

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2620](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2620)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

@GreenBlood  
thank you for your issue report and even more thanks for your fix!
