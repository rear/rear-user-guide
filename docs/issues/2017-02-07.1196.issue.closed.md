@gozora  
only for the fun of it:  
It was me who added that text  
but it is your pristine original typo ;-)  
that I blindly copy&pasted, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1153\#issuecomment-270638388](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1153#issuecomment-270638388)  
I really did not notice the typo at that time  
regardless that I had read the text  
which tells a lot how good I am in finding typos.
