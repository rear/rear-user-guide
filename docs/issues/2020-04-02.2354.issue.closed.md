`58-start-dhclient.sh` currently will not start `dhclient` unless
`USE_STATIC_NETWORKING` is explicitly set to `no` (or its variants).

Expected behavior: As of release 2.5, *not* setting
`USE_STATIC_NETWORKING` did start `dhclient`. Starting `dhclient` was
only skipped if `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING` was explicitly set to `yes` (or
its variants).

I suspect that this line is contrary to intentions:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/161be72fcd89f2af23f49f32c21d2b049aae803d/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh\#L9](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/161be72fcd89f2af23f49f32c21d2b049aae803d/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh#L9)

It should probably read:

    is_true $USE_STATIC_NETWORKING && return

That way, an empty value (the default) will not turn off DHCP.

I think this was my fault  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2325\#discussion\_r374721559](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2325#discussion_r374721559)

Too much ternary logic plus negations for my poor mind :-(
