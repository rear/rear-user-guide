-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Removing forcibly (with '--force' passed twice) just works.
Additionally, activation of the VG was missing in the original code for
\#1806

@pcahyna Any concern?

I disagree. One should not just increase the amount of --force to
attempt to solve the problem. One should not use vgcfgrestore if the VG
contains anything else than linear or striped volumes (and then try to
fix the inconsistent configuration by removing other volumes) in the
first place.

Using `vgcfgrestore` then removing thin pools is always better than
using `vgcreate/lvcreate` commands from the beginning, because we don't
have the code yet to reproduce what was created initially.

@schabrolles Any thoughts from your side?

@rmetrich I guess you can merge the PR if no-one disapproves...

@pcahyna For now I prefer to merge this which is a quick fix to the
issue. In the future, I will try enhancing the gathering of LVM
informations to stop relying on vgcfgrestore which is a mis-use of the
tool.

@rmetrich @pcahyna  
thank you for all your time and contributions  
to fix and improve the LVM support in ReaR!
