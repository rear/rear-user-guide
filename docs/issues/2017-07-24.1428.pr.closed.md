Generated AUTHORS file according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1427\#issuecomment-317380362](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1427#issuecomment-317380362)

I don't see a reason to omit contributions with less than  
about 15 lines of code according to  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Legally-Significant.html\#Legally-Significant](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Legally-Significant.html#Legally-Significant)  
because I assume that contributions with less than  
about 15 lines of code are not legally significant  
applies perhaps only fot U.S. laws but for other countries  
any contributed line of code could be legally significant  
so that I like to be on the safe side and list all contributors.  
It costs nothing to list them all in a generated AUTHORS file  
compared to carefully exclude some of them.

@schlomo addresses have been exposed already :-) so not much we can do
about it now ...

@jsmeix  
I've run your script as follows, just to sum up lines of individual
contributor(s) and compare them to [contributors
page](https://github.com/gozora/rear/graphs/contributors).

    ./jsmeix.sh | grep gratien | awk '{ sum += $1} END {print sum}'

For @gdha I've got 16 307 lines, comparing to Githubs 21 945 lines.

I basically don't care about this, but it might become confusing to have
two quite different numbers for one metric ...

@gozora I don't want my old emails, partially also from companies I
don't longer work at, to be exposed and made visible in this fashion. In
the git history it is obvious to the reader when this email was current.
In such a summary file it is not.

What about people who changed their name or email? We'll list them
multiple times even though this is the same person. Pulling this info
from GitHub would actually normalize it as GitHub tracks (I hope at
least) the person and not the name or email.

The more I think about it the more I don't feel well about putting the
list of names and emails like this without the context (on the time
line).

@schlomo I guess you've just misunderstood my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1428\#issuecomment-317462874](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1428#issuecomment-317462874)
...  
All I was referring to what that once you put something publicly on the
Internet it is exposed. So once this PR was created, these data are out
and we don't need to ask anybody if he allows us to publish his/her mail
address or not ;-).

I know that there are people out there who really care about all the
things you've mentioned, and I fully understand that!

@gozora time does play a role. If we delete this PR quickly then not all
search engines will have picked it up. And all search engines drop pages
that disappear so that those emails would not be so prominently in the
search index.

A static AUTHORS file with all the emails carries much more weight with
the search engines. And it looks like "official" data.

@schlomo I think that 5 hours is long enough to have this PR already
indexed, apart from that you'd need to remove branch of @jsmeix as
well.  
But if you think that this is really bad thing, you should close/remove
it ...

I close this one because it is superseded by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1429](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1429)

@gozora  
regarding the different numbers in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1428\#issuecomment-317462874](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1428#issuecomment-317462874)  
I think my numbers are lower because I omitted  
certain things like whitespace changes as I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1427\#issuecomment-317380362](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1427#issuecomment-317380362)  
but there could be also a bug somewhere in my script.  
I am a mathematician - I cannot count ;-)

For the fun of scariness:  
I guess search engines already dig through source code archives  
(from plain tar archives up to git checkouts and things like that)  
to harvest personal data like names with e-mail addresses.
