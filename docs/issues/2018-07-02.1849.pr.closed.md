##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-July/003572.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-July/003572.html)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested on laptop running Slackware 14.2 with UEFI. Used "rear -v
    mkbackup" to USB drive. The USB drive booted OK but I did not test
    recover function yet. The backup tar was available on the drive.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Added code to support Slackware 14.2 distribution. This was a brute
    force approach and my mktemp changes may break compatibility with
    other OSs. Requesting feedback to improve quality.

@gozora  
I requested your review here because it is about UEFI.

@schlomo  
I requested your review here because currently it shows

<pre>
Merging is blocked
The target branch requires all commits to be signed.
</pre>

but this is a pull request from an external contributor.

I would like to know how we should handle pull requests from external
contributors.

I would prefer when external contributors are not forced to sign their
pull requests.

I would prefer when it is sufficient that pull requests from external
contributors  
are reviewed by us and if the changes are o.k. for us that then we can
merge it.

Is that possible or would that contradict our improved security in

Hi Johannes,

I like your suggestions and will implement the cleaner one. I used the  
process of muntzing to reduce the grub modules and would like you to  
consider that the eliminated modules were not required and maybe should
be  
left out? Let me know your preference.

In the 300\_copy\_kernel.sh I will be happy to use the
OS\_MASTER\_VERSION in  
my test. I thought I was following convention by using  
"/etc/slackware-version" since the following elif tests all use file  
references: /etc/redhat-release, /etc/debian\_version,  
/etc/arch-release,... Please let me know if you want this test to be
the  
only one using OS\_MASTER\_VERSION.

Thanks for considering my pull request.

I'd prefer not to messing up with existing code and keep modules as they
are, at lest for non-Slackware distributions. We did not had issues with
non-booting ReaR recovery system because "this and that" for a quite a
long time, and I really like it that way ;-).

Interestingly enough, when I have this PR open on my phone, I have
"*Merge pull request*" button active.... :-)

@wdmsde  
regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1849\#issuecomment-402148149](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1849#issuecomment-402148149)

You are right.  
For this pull request just follow the existing convention in the current
code.

Unfortunately sometimes the ReaR code is such a mess  
that has grown over the time where things need to be cleaned up.  
We try to do as much as we can as time permits but as long as things
work  
there is no pressure to clean up code that works - "never change ..."
;-)  
Right now I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851)  
to clean up our various 300\_copy\_kernel.sh scripts as time permits in
the future.

@jsmeix  
I upgraded my grub version to 2.02 on Slackware and was able to reduce
my  
patch size. I submitted another pull request that incorporates your  
suggestions.
