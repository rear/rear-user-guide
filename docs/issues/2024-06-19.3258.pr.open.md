-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Critical**  
    Critical impact because with it we do no longer  
    basically carelessly "just source" various files  
    so it is security related.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    For now I only tested "rear -D mkrescue"  
    which works as before for me.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/framework-functions.sh  
new SourceTrustworthy function  
to source only a trustworthy file.

A file is considered trustworthy to be sourced  
when its file owner is one of the TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS.

Because only the file owner can 'chmod'  
cf. "man 2 chmod" that reads

    The effective UID of the calling process
    must match the owner of the file,
    or the process must be privileged
    (Linux: it must have the CAP_FOWNER capability).

we can sufficiently safely assume that a file  
which is onwed by one of the TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS  
can be trusted to be sourced without further additional checks  
(e.g. if other users may have permissions to modify the file)  
and it should not be ReaR's task to prevent TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS  
from doing what they want (a.k.a. "final power to the user")  
or simply put: TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS means we do trust them.

Currently this is WIP.

I need to replace 'source' with 'SourceTrustworthy'  
at the 43 places where we basically carelessly "just source"  
various files, see

Additionally I like to rename the 'Source' function  
into a more descriptive name that better tells  
for what use case that function is used.

Here where the 'Source' function is used:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f \
     | xargs grep 'Source ' \
     | grep -v ': *#' \
     | egrep -v 'CallerSource|Netbackup Client Source'

    usr/sbin/rear:
        Source "$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf" || Error "Failed to Source $CONFIG_DIR/os.conf"
        Source "$CONFIG_DIR/$WORKFLOW.conf" || Error "Failed to Source $CONFIG_DIR/$WORKFLOW.conf"
            Source "$SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf" || BugError "Failed to Source $SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf"
            Source "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" || Error "Failed to Source $CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf"
                Source "$config_append_file_path" || Error "Failed to Source $config_append_file_path"
                Source "$config_append_file_path.conf" || Error "Failed to Source $config_append_file_path.conf"

    usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh:
                        Source $SHARE_DIR/layout/recreate/default/150_wipe_disks.sh

    usr/share/rear/lib/rear-shell.bashrc:
    Source .../script.sh        runs a single ReaR script
    WORKING_DIR=$SHARE_DIR # ensure that we can run Source ...script.sh via tab completion and that the Source function will stay there

    usr/share/rear/lib/savelayout-workflow.sh:
        Source $SHARE_DIR/prep/default/320_include_uefi_env.sh

    usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh:
    function Source () {
        test -d "$source_file" && Error "Source file '$source_file' is a directory, cannot source"
            LogPrint "Source $relname"
        test "0" -eq "$source_return_code" || Debug "Source function: 'SourceTrustworthy $source_file' returns $source_return_code"
            Source $SHARE_DIR/$stage/"$script"

From this use cases I think a better name could be

    SourceScript

because also ReaR config files are sourced as bash scripts.

Oh - how interesting - I gain trust in our CI tests again:

My yesterday evening (I had to leave) blind guess in

Of course also `rear -D dump` and `rear dump`  
"just work" for me.

The matching code in usr/sbin/rear is ('cat -n' output):

       745  for config in "$ARCH" "$OS" \
       746          "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR" "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR_ARCH" "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION" "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH" \
       747          "$OS_VENDOR" "$OS_VENDOR_ARCH" "$OS_VENDOR_VERSION" "$OS_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH" ; do
       748      if test -r "$SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf" ; then
       749          Source "$SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf" || BugError "Failed to Source $SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf"
       750      fi
       751  done

But again it seems the root cause of this CI failure  
is not actually in my code changes here  
(my code changes here only trigger it)  
but the root cause is actually in the environment  
where usr/sbin/rear is is run for this CI task.

I guess that in this environment

    stat -c %U /rear/usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-i386.conf

results 'UNKNOWN'.  
I have no idea how this could happen.

    # strings /usr/bin/stat | grep UNKNOWN
    UNKNOWN (0x%lx)
    UNKNOWN

indicates that 'UNKNOWN' really comes from 'stat'  
and "man 2 stat" indicates it its "EXAMPLE" code  
that 'unknown' could/should be printed as fallback.  
But I have no idea how it could happen that

    %U     user name of owner

(from "man 1 stat") could be 'UNKNOWN' for a file,  
cf. the "EXAMPLE" code in "man 2 stat"  
that prints the "Ownership" unconditioned  
(but that prints only the numerical value).

Regardless how this could happen  
it seems the CI failure

    Build Packages / build (push) Failing

is nothing but false alarm  
which only wastes my precious time  
and distracts me from getting done what I want to get done  
because I have to do time consuming investigations  
where I need to prove that CI failures  
are not caused by my code changes.

So I am back to ignoring CI failures :-(

I will keep separated issues separated  
so this pull request will be only  
to implement the new SourceTrustworthy function  
plus adaption of the Source function  
to use the new SourceTrustworthy function.

I will replace 'source' with 'SourceTrustworthy'  
at the 43 places where we basically carelessly "just source"  
various files via a separated second pull request  
after this one here was merged.

Finally - as time permits - I may optionally do

as a third pull request.

Maybe I missed some info or discussion, so I need to unfortunately ask
again: I don't fully understand how this change will significantly
increase our security posture? I'd assume that an attacker who can place
a script into `/usr/share/rear/foo/bar` can also `chown` it to belong to
`root`.

I'm not aware of world writeable directories that we `SourceStage()`
from. So I'm afraid that this check won't really do much in real life.

About the implementation:

-   Maybe a simpler change would be to add the file owner check into the
    `Source()` function?
-   Maybe simply rename 'Source()`→`SourceScript()\` if you want the
    function name to be more specific?

Finally, can it be that the finding in
`usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh` is
actually a bug? Like could we reorder the scripts so that this explicit
call is not required.

The assumption that ReaR code is always located  
under a system directory with sufficiently secure  
permissions, groups, and file owners does not hold.

In particular I do not know what could be possible  
for "git clone" things done by whatever user and  
stored under arbitrary directories and then  
"just run" that via 'sudo' or something like that.

On the one hand I think it is not ReaR's task  
to protect 'root' against any foolish things.

But because ReaR is meant to be run as 'root'  
I think we must implement some reasonable protection  
to avoid at least too obviously bad things  
which can be easily avoided.

In the end I think we are back at where we had been in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967)  
where @schlomo basically doesn't care  
and leaves security things to the user while  
I have an opposite point of view as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1498627825](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1498627825)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1510856524](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1510856524)

In this case I think when making software this means  
that one's program must not knowingly omit to  
provide basic protection against something bad  
in particular when it became known that  
basic protection against something bad  
is missing in a particular specific case  
and it is known how basic protection  
can be implemented with reasonable effort.

Ah, maybe a much simpler check would be to ensure that we only source
files that have the same owner as the `rear` main script? For installed
ReaR that will typically be root and for a git checkout it will be some
user ID. However, I'd also allow sourcing files owned by the effective
UID, in addition to the user owning the `rear` main script (so that you
can include `/etc/rear/*.conf` from ReaR running out of a git checkout
via sudo.

BTW, I'm not opposed to adding a security check to `Source`, I'm more
thinking about the question how to make that as simple as possible.
Hence my suggestions for simplification.

Actually using SourceTrustworthy in the Source function  
was more or less a "side effect" of my original intent  
to implement a reasonable simple and sufficiently safe  
function that should replace the plain 'source' calls  
of various files that we do at 43 places in our code.

While or ReaR scripts are sufficiently under our control  
those various third-party files that get "just sourced"  
are basically out of our control.  
Primarily for those I implemented SourceTrustworthy.

As a test how far SourceTrustworthy may work  
I used it in the Source function and because  
it "just works" there I kept it there.

In contrast implementing better protection  
directly in the Source function would not help  
for those actually scaring 43 cases.

Wouldn't it be safer to reduce the amount of configuration files in
place?

@gdha  
perhaps I misunderstand you but I assume you mean that  
instead of only replacing the plain 'source' calls  
by calling SourceTrustworthy  
if it wouldn't be safer to actually fix each  
plain 'source' call individually  
as needed at each place?

Yes, of course that would be better and safer.

It just requires several people who just know about  
each one of those 43 places what each code there  
is meant to do and WHY it is implemeted there  
by plain 'source' calls and not better/safer  
which also requires understanding of the  
contents of each one of those sourced files  
(some cases are clear like 'source default.conf')  
but some cases look rather obscure - at least to me.

So, yes, when someone contributes that major cleanup  
to ReaR, I would much appreciate it because that  
would allow me to do more pleasant things than trying  
to somehow generically mitigate old mess in ReaR  
that I unfortunately detected by accident so now  
it is me who tries to mitigate it as far as I could  
with reasonable effort within reasonable time.

I feel this one will end same as

@jsmeix I looked at that and I actually don't see how checking file
ownership relates to the original problem of \#3203 (reading shell-style
config files).

I'd suggest holding back on this change till we understand what exactly
we are trying to protect against. And I'd suggest for us to be careful
to add more complexity to ReaR without a clear user requirement.

Personally, I'd be much more happy to add a security check for a problem
that was either reported by a user or that we understood from threat
modeling.

BTW, It seems to me that the file owner check came much later into
\#3203 compared to the issue description of the PR. Maybe our discussion
got carried away there?
