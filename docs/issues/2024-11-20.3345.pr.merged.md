-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Security Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Critical**

"Relatively" critical impact for two reasons:  
It is a required security enhancement and  
it is a backward incompatible change.

It is only "relatively" critical because  
it is only when BACKUP=DUPLICITY is used  
so it is not a backward incompatible change  
that hits all or a lot of users.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Cannot test it because I neither use duplicity nor duply.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Overhauled prep/DUPLICITY/default/200\_find\_duply\_profile.sh  
so that now only an explicitly user specified DUPLY\_PROFILE  
will get sourced to avoid that some automatism  
finds and sources whatever it may have found.

Error out when DUPLY\_PROFILE is empty or does not exist  
to make the user aware that he must explicitly specify  
his correct DUPLY\_PROFILE.

Next steps within this pull request  
(to keep together what belongs together)  
are:

Removal of the find\_duply\_profile function call in  
restore/DUPLICITY/default/110\_check\_temp\_dir\_with\_duply.sh

Removal of the find\_duply\_profile function  
from lib/global-functions.sh:function

Change the DUPLY\_PROFILE description in default.conf

Tomorrow I will try to test it in a generic way  
even without having duplicity or duply installed  
e.g. by things like using artificial placeholder  
programs for duplicity and/or duply (e.g. /bin/true)  
so that I could only see in the ReaR log file  
(with debugscript mode) if my changed scripts  
seem to work as intended.

While testing I found out that the DUPLY\_PROFILE  
is not included in the ReaR recovery system  
and I wonder how it ever was included  
because I see nowhere in the old DUPLICITY code  
(i.e. the DUPLICITY code without my changes here)  
that it could be included:

    # for f in $( find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep DUPLICITY ) ; do grep COPY_AS_IS $f ; done
        COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/fuse.conf )
    COPY_AS_IS+=(
            [ "x$SKRIPT_FILES" != "x" ] && COPY_AS_IS+=( "$SKRIPT_FILES" )

Tested again "rear -D mkrescue" plus "rear -D mkbackuponly"  
with latest changes here on a test VM  
which both finished for me without error  
with this etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://192.168.178.66/nfs
    BACKUP=DUPLICITY
    DUPLY_PROFILE="/root/qqqq/duply.profile"
    ...

and again /usr/bin/true as placeholder program  
for duplicity and duply and python  
and same /root/qqqq/duply.profile as above.

Then I booted on another test VM  
the ReaR recovery system ISO  
and did "rear -D recover"  
which also worked for me without error  
up to and including the point of the backup restore  
with restore/DUPLICITY/default/150\_restore\_duply.sh  
i.e. via

    duply "$DUPLY_PROFILE" restore $TARGET_FS_ROOT/restore

But after the backup restore things failed as expected  
because I use /usr/bin/true as placeholder for duply  
so nothing was restored (/mnt/local/ is basically empty)  
so that certain things could not work in the subsequent  
'finalize' stage, in particular recreating initrd and  
installing a bootloader cannot work on empty /mnt/local/.

@loyeyoung  
could you test how far ReaR with my changes here  
works for you with real duplicity and duply?

See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how you could try out the current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code without conflicts with a  
normally installed ReaR version.

To test my changes in this pull request here  
(which is not yet merged into GitHub master code)  
you would have checkout my branch e.g. like

    git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    mv rear rear.github.master.jsmeix-source-DUPLY_PROFILE

    cd rear.github.master.jsmeix-source-DUPLY_PROFILE

    git checkout jsmeix-source-DUPLY_PROFILE

    vi etc/rear/local.conf

    usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup

@rear/contributors  
from my point of view my changes seem to be OK  
but I could not test them in real practice  
because I am not a duplicity and/or duply user  
so I would appreciate it if you could have a look here,  
perhaps you spot problems from plain looking at the code?

@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections  
I would like to merge it on Monday afternoon
