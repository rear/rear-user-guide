##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): closes \#2945

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `spectool -g packaging/rpm/rear.spec` downloads the correct tarball

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Change the URL in the Source tag in the RPM spec file to point to
    the tarball on GitHub instead of SourceForge (where the tarball is
    not updated anymore).  
    AFAIK GitHub creates the tarballs automatically from tags.

This won't work properly, because `make dist` constructs a tarball named
e.g. `rear-2.7-git.4965.531d9074.githubsourceinspecfile.changed.tar.gz`
under `dist`, so the `Source:` line needs to be updated to point to this
tarball, otherwise `rpmbuild` invoked from `make srpm` would not find it
(just tried that). But I can update the `sed` line to use a working URL
(i.e. GitHub) for `Source`.

it won't, because Makefile does not touch `packaging/rpm/rear.spec`, it
constructs a temporary spec under `dist` (the message
`Rewriting packaging/rpm/rear.spec, packaging/debian/rear.dsc and usr/sbin/rear`
is misleading).

Good catch. I was also fighting our `Makefile` yesterday and would love
to find a way how ReaR can run from source without modifying the source
area at all.

For the `Source:` entry in the spec file, is any valid URL OK or must it
actually match the content and the dist archive file name? I find it
very important that the dist archive file name can continue to carry the
full git branch and version info.

It does not need to be a URL at all. I would actually prefer the
Makefile to keep only the file name in Source. URLs of type
`https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/2.7/rear-2.7-git.4965.531d9074.githubsourceinspecfile.changed.tar.gz`,
which the current Makefile produces, have never been correct even when
SourceForge download was working and won't became more correct by
changing them to github.com. I would prefer just
`Source: rear-2.7-git.4965.531d9074.githubsourceinspecfile.changed.tar.gz`
which expresses clearly that the tarball has been built locally and
can't be found anywhere on the Internet.

have a look at the `dist` target - it produces modified sources under
`build` without touching the original sources (except `man`).

by the way, I believe ReaR can already run from source checkout without
modifications -

The problem is that ReaR running from source add os.conf and the log
files  
into the source tree. And uses it to build the rescue image.

And yes, running make shouldn't randomly recreate the manpages and
docs  
with a different asciidoc heading embedded.

if by `dist archive file name` you mean the archive file name that
`rpmbuild` will actually use to build the source RPM, the last component
of the `Source` URL must match it. This is because the last component of
the URL is THE way to determine the source tarball name that rpmbuild
uses. There is no independent way to provide it. OTOH, the URL does not
need to be valid and indeed, as I wrote above, it does not need to be an
URL at all, a local file name is enough.

So the problem is that the rescue image will contain `os.conf` and log
files? But IIRC this will be the case also for installed ReaR.

The usual RPM build automation (`rpmbuild` and `koji`) do not use the
full URL, only the last component (at least in Fedora, maybe the tooling
for other distros is actually using it). The full URL is there mostly to
document where the source can be obtained. Note that
[https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/SourceURL/\#\_troublesome\_urls](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/SourceURL/#_troublesome_urls)
mentions cases where a URL can't be used, so only the file name is used
in `Source` and the full URL is in a comment.

There is a tool though called `spectool` that automates the download of
the source file : so instead of downloading the tarball manually, you
can execute `spectool -g packaging/rpm/rear.spec`. For this, it is handy
to have a correct URL. There may be other tooling that needs valid URL.
(Packit builds executed from PRs do not need it though, because Packit
rebuilds the tarball including the changes and changes `Source` to point
to the tarball that it has built, in analogy with `make dist`.)

All in all, this PR is less important than it may seem. The incorrect
URL was not causing any failure.

In the openSUSE Build Service projects  
Archiving:Backup:Rear and Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot  
I removed the build repository "SLE\_11\_SP4"  
so ReaR gets no longer built there for SLE11, cf.

and old stuff for SLE11 in packaging/rpm/rear.spec  
can be safely removed.

@jsmeix thank you for showing us how this Makefile target is actually
being used in the release process. If we decide to change the
functionality of the target, we should definitely consider how it fits
into the release process.

I think that the tag name is actually OK and one should use a different
release branch name to avoid ambiguity.
