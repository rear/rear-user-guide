I encounter an issue last time when trying to migrate a VM from oVirt on
POWER to PowerVM.  
After booting the LPAR (PowerVM guest) on the ReaR recue image, I can't
log into the console.  
To solve that issue I had to connect via SSH and start `agetty` on
`hvc0` manually (or run again `/etc/scripts/system-setup`).

oVirt VM use VNC console (`tty1`) while PowerVM partition need to use
`hvc0` serial console.  
Because backup was done on oVirt VM, `hvc0` was not present, but this
means that hvc0 was not automatically detected by ReaR =&gt;
`serial console detection` is not working.

(This was working in the past.... may be a possible regression ...
\#1398)

Anyway, I dig a bit this and realized that this problem only exist on
`systemd` based OS (RHEL7 or SLES12); and discover that
`/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-getty-generator` was
responsible to detect console and serial console to activate them
automatically.

I propose then to add this file to `COPY_AS_IS` variable when running on
a `systemd` OS.  
After doing that, my `hvc0` console was automatically detected and
activated with `agetty` when booting in recovery.

I also propose some cleanup by removing unnecessary KERNEL\_CMDLINE
option (this could may be satisfy \#1420)

**tested successfully with:**

-   SLE12-SP2
-   RHEL7.3
-   SLES11-SP4 (to test possible regression with a non-systemd OS)

**The next question is:**

-   There some other systemd-generator scripts in
    `/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/`, we may be need to check if
    there is some other script we should add.

@schabrolles  
regarding possible regressions because of redirected STDOUT:

Currently STDOUT is not redirected, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398\#issuecomment-315325470](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398#issuecomment-315325470)  
in particular it is not redirected in the ReaR 2.2 release.

But I intend to re-enable redirected STDOUT soon  
while ReaR 2.3 is under development and fix as much  
as I can there.

Whether or not STDOUT will be redirected in the ReaR 2.3 release  
depends on our experience how redirected STDOUT behaves  
while ReaR 2.3 is under development.
