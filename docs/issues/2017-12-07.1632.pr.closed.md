Replacing 'blkid' with 'lsblk' is a backward incompatible change  
because at least on SLES10 there is only 'blkid' but no 'lsblk'  
so that this pull request belongs to

@ProBackup-nl Good point, but as @jsmeix said we still have to carry
older versions of Linux. For this reason we are declining this PR.
However, when we decide to cut-over to v3.0 we might get rid of the
older releases of Linux and then we are free to clean up the code.

The next ReaR major version 3.0 would be really a good opportunity  
for a "ReaR major version that does away with all the old stuff", cf.
