Hello,

Is there an option that could delete and old backup after a period  
I put the variable NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=y , but i need to keep
only 5 instances, so the oldest one could be deleted and replaced by the
new one

is there a way to do this with rear please ?

Thank you in advance

Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) is neither a backup software  
nor a backup management software  
and it is not meant to be one.

See the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If i understand rear is a disaster recover, so what i want to keep not
one iso, but many ones, and if there is a way that rear could delete the
previous iso starting after a period
