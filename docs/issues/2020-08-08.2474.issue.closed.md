    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    PC (ThinkPad X395)

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    UEFI / GRUB

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

The Opal PBA image includes modules from the running system but omits
firmware. During boot, KMS is enabled by default, and the amdgpu module
attempts to enable it. However, without firmware, this process hangs,
resulting in an unusable PBA.

-   Workaround, if any:

`OPAL_PBA_KERNEL_CMDLINE="nomodeset"` in local.conf prevents amdgpu from
attempting to configure KMS and prevents the hang. Alternatively,
editing `prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001_configure_workflow.sh` to prevent
`FIRMWARE_FILES` from being set to `no` results in a raw image that
works when booted off of a flash drive, but which is too large to be
used as a PBA.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

N/A

I know nothing about Opal PBA but I guess some code as in  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/420\_copy\_firmware\_files.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/420\_copy\_firmware\_files.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/420_copy_firmware_files.sh)  
might be also useful when creating the Opal PBA image?

@OliverO2  
could you have a look at this issue here?

@bmastenbrook Thanks for this detailed report and @jsmeix thanks for
pinging me. I'll look into this.

My first idea would be to edit
`usr/share/rear/prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001_configure_workflow.sh` as
follows:

-   change `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )`
-   to `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'amdgpu' )`

@bmastenbrook Could you check if this change works?

If so, I'd envision to introduce a variable `OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES`
which would enable overriding the current configuration for the PBA
only. In addition, maybe it would be a good idea to set
`FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` only if the initial setting has been
`FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'yes' )` or `FIRMWARE_FILES=()` as these would make
the PBA become too large.

@bmastenbrook Thanks again for opening this issue. Just a friendly
reminder: Could you please respond to the suggested solution above or
state if you have lost interest, so that we have an idea on how to
proceed?

@OliverO2 Sorry, I've been pretty busy. I'll give this a try next week,
but I can't promise anything sooner. Apologies for the issue-and-run ðŸ™ƒ

@bmastenbrook That's OK ðŸ˜Š. As you came up with a high quality issue
report and seems a permanent fix is just a few steps ahead, I justed
wanted to grab the occasion. Take your time, it would still be great if
you could test the above suggestion. Maybe you could even report the
output of `lspci | grep VGA`. If we could auto-configure the
`FIRMWARE_FILES` setting you (and others) would never have to worry
about this again.
