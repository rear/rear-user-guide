Regarding installing GRUB Legacy as bootloader  
overhauled finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh and  
improved finalie/default/01\_prepare\_checks.sh  
(see issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895))

It is still not fully reliably installing the right bootloader:  
When GRUB 2 is installed in addition To GrubLegacy  
it still prefers to install GRUB 2 as bootloader  
even if the BOOTLOADER variable tells "GRUB"  
(which means GRUB Legacy).

I.e. further work is needed...

According to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895\#issuecomment-230271596](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/895#issuecomment-230271596)
I merge it.

There should be no changes for other bootloaders.  
Only GRUB Legacy bootloader installation should be affected.
