-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**  
    High impact only when docker is used.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1989\#issuecomment-456054278](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1989#issuecomment-456054278)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I do not use docker and I get exactly the same  
    var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf as before  
    so I assume there are no regressions.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    In usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh  
    ensure docker\_root\_dir is not empty because otherwise any  
    mountpoint string matches "^" which would skip all mountpoints

@gdha  
I did even more:  
Now it kills 'docker info' with SIGTERM after 5 seconds  
plus with SIGKILL after additional 2 seconds.  
I can change it as you like.

@gdha  
only FYI:

On my old SLES10 system there is no `timeout` command  
(at least not by default) and it is not in the 'coreutils' RPM on
SLES10.

Since SLES11 there is by default a `timeout` command that is  
provided by the 'coreutils' RPM which is installed by default.

Accordingly since this pull request the command in the line

    docker_root_dir=$( timeout -k 2s 5s docker info | grep 'Docker Root Dir' | awk '{print $4}' )

will fail so that docker\_root\_dir gets empty but I assume that  
nobody uses Docker on SLES10 so that in practice this should  
not add another regression on SLES10 because the above line  
is only run

    if service docker status

and that even works on SLES10:

    # service docker status && echo Y || echo N
    service: no such service docker
    N
