I use the current ReaR GitHub master code.

I never used `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` before so  
perhaps I do not understand how it meant to be used  
but my excuse is that its usage is not really documented.

I noticed its usage in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495010023](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495010023)

With `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` I get  
(excerpt - only the `ouput` scripts)

    # usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue
    ...
    Source output/default/010_set_umask.sh
    Source output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh
    Source output/default/150_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh
    Source output/default/200_make_boot_dir.sh
    Source output/default/200_make_prefix_dir.sh
    Source output/default/250_create_lock.sh
    Source output/default/400_copy_disk_struct_files.sh
    Source output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900_copy_ramdisk.sh
    Source output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh
    Source output/default/940_grub_rescue.sh
    Source output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh
    Source output/default/950_email_result_files.sh
    Source output/default/970_remove_lock.sh
    Source output/default/980_umount_output_dir.sh

where both

    output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900_copy_ramdisk.sh

and

    output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh

are run but as far as I see both scripts do basically the same.

Therefore I wonder if output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh  
is needed at all or if that should be better integrated into  
the output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh

Furthermore the only `RAMDISK` scripts are

    usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900_copy_ramdisk.sh
    usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT_usage_RAMDISK.txt

so that I wonder what `RAMDISK` is meant to be used for.

@rear/contributors  
can you help me to understand how `RAMDISK`  
is meant to be used?

It seems

    output/PXE/default/820_copy_to_net.sh

is another one that seems to duplicate what

    output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh

does.

But as for `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` I may also misunderstand  
something because I never used `OUTPUT=PXE`.

@jsmeix @jhoekx I believe RAMDISK was developed by Jeroen to have a
faster test cyclus (booting from RAM is faster then from ISO)

But the only files that contain `RAMDISK` are

    usr/share/rear/restore/DUPLICITY/default/400_restore_duplicity.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900_copy_ramdisk.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/validated/Arch/rolling/i386.txt
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

so that output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh  
is the only script for `OUTPUT=RAMDISK`.

As far as I see it does not create any kind of bootable ramdisk.

What is does is to only copy ReaR's initrd and the kernel  
to an OUTPUT\_URL location.

This matches what `man rear` tells

    OUTPUT=RAMDISK
        Create only the Relax-and-Recover initramfs.

i.e. nothing about creating a (bootable) ramdisk.

To mee it looks as if `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` is basically  
what @mutable-dan and I need for ReaR on IBM Z  
where we like to get the plain ReaR initrd and the kernel  
copied as is to our OUTPUT\_URL location which is done via  
output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
provided RESULT\_FILES contains KERNEL\_FILE and  
ReaR's initrd (via $TMP\_DIR/$REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME).

To get that done I made a quick and dirty new script  
usr/share/rear/output/IPL/Linux-s390/800\_create\_ipl.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)  
plus I used a new `OUTPUT=IPL` for it because at that time  
I did not know about `OUTPUT=RAMDISK`.

Now I think I may better cleanup and adapt the existing  
output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh  
and use `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` - provided I understand  
how it is meant to be used to avoid regressions if I adapt  
output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh

I wonder why 900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh is an architecture dependent script  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495196467](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495196467)

I think there should be no usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386  
but only a usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/default/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh

An initial proposal for a completely overhauled 900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh  
as an architecture independent script

    usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/default/900_copy_ramdisk.sh

is shown in

this issue is (hopefully) fixed.
