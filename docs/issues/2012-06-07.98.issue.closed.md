During a `rear restore` I noticed that not all screen output is correct
in the log file. For instance we see things like:

    2012-06-06 19:48:10 Including layout/prepare/default/32_apply_mappings.sh
    2012-06-06 19:48:10 This is the disk mapping table:
    2012-06-06 19:48:10 Including layout/prepare/default/40_autoresize_disks.sh

Or:

    2012-06-06 20:13:30 Including finalize/GNU/Linux/15_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh
    2012-06-06 20:13:30 Patching '/mnt/local/boot/grub/grub.conf' instead of 'etc/grub.conf'
