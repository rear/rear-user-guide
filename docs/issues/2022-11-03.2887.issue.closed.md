This issue is triggered by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2886](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2886)  
therein in particular my comments (excerpts):

    the USB disk content has to be sacrosanct during "rear recover"
    ...
    during "rear recover" nothing of what there is
    on the USB disk should ever be changed by ReaR.

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)

    During "rear recover" all what matches ReaR sources
    like /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 or BACKUP_URL=usb://...
    must be sacrosanct

So I would like to investigate if it is feasible  
and possible to implement with reasonable effort  
to mount things read-only during "rear recover"  
when things are only needed to be read  
e.g. to restore a backup.tar.gz.

I think during "rear recover" some things may need to be  
written (e.g. a some log file or something like that)  
which could make it rather complicated to mount things  
read-only.

The log gets written into the recovered system, not on the medium,
AFAIK. (Writing to the medium would be USB-specific.)

Also, one may even improve this by setting the device read-only at the
block device level, i.e. by `blockdev --setro`. This should prevent the
layout code from accidentally reformatting it.

I think some log might be written to a mounted NFS share  
(this issue is not only about USB but meant in general)  
but that is a totally offhanded (untested) guess.

I'm also in favour of mounting all external media/file shares read-only.
That is a good example for defensive programming and it can save some
users from accidentially erasing their backups

not sure if all backup tools would be happy with a `ro` filesystem. The
for the system partition/image `ro` may make sense but for data/backup
partition/files this hardly depends on the mechanism/tooling used. Also
I would personally like to have a log file on the recovery media as
well. Sometimes it is a good thing being able to install packages on a
recovery system later - for example because the HW like RAID controller
or network card changed.  
If it would be a `ro` filesystem we may want some kind of persisted or
temporary overlay `rw` partition as well.

I do not see a big plus in a `ro` recovery filesystem and you can get
this already by kernel parameters or fstab entries without the need to
change any line in rear, just config.

Note: I hate being the conservative voice -.-

@DEvil0000 I think the question was not about the `rootfs` of the rescue
system (which is in-memory in any case and ephemeral) but about external
media, e.g. NFS shares or USB drives, that contain backup data and that
we currently mount read-write even though we only need to read from
them.

"sacrosanct" meaning that we should mount those read-only to prevent
potential coding or configuration errors from accidentally erasing the
backups.

I know that this is your reasoning - which is very valid. I however do
not know all the backup backends possible with rear but I can think of
one organizing the data in some kind of database and needing some sort
of `rw` for example to mark which files got restored and when.  
This may be a hypothetical and not so much a real case but we should at
least check for all backends if they are fine with `ro`.  
Also as said one can configure rear to mount things `ro` even with the
current version so is there a real need for such a change?
