"I have installed a standard system with RHEL6.

I installed "rear" (Relax and Recover) from the epel. No problem.  
I installed the dependencies (genisoimage, syslinux, and mtools) No
problem.

If I run "rear mkrescue" with the standard configuration (OUTPUT=ISO),
all is well.  
IF I run "rear mkrescue" with the additional configuration option
(BACKUP=NSR), it breaks any further attempt to use YUM.

It does this, as far as I can tell, because it changes the standard
library association from

/lib64/libexpat.so.1 -&gt; libexpat.so.1.5.2

to

/lib64/libexpat.so.1 -&gt; ./libexpat.so

I can get YUM working again by putting the original link back in place.

Strange story - `rear` should not touch the live system. However, the
subject and content saying something different - `OUTPUT=NSR` and
`BACKUP=NSR` ?  
Obviously, only `BACKUP=NSR` is valid.  
Perhaps, show us the `local.conf` file and add (via gist) a full logging
and debugging session to proof your case? I really cannot belief it so
far.

Yes, the subject should say BACKUP=NSR, not OUTPUT=NSR. Is there a way
to change that?

local.conf simply contains the following two lines:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NSR

For completeness, os.conf contains:

    OS_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer
    OS_VERSION=6

The rear logging doesn't indicate that anything is wrong:

    [root@wedjat tmp]# rear -v mkrescue
    Relax-and-Recover 1.15 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-wedjat.log

    =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= [...I inserted dashes in this line...]
    ddservers       03/22/14 /var/lib/rear/output/rear-wedjat.iso

One might be lulled into thinking that everything is OK at this point,
since the system is running without incident.  
However, to illuminate that all is not well, simply type a YUM command.
I use something simple like asking YUM to list it's repos:

    [root@wedjat tmp]# yum repolist
    Plugin "subscription-manager" can't be imported
    Loaded plugins: product-id, rhnplugin, security
    /usr/lib64/python2.6/xmlrpclib.py:612: DeprecationWarning: The xmllib module is obsolete.  Use xml.sax instead.

This happens because the /lib64/libexpat.so.1 has been changed.  
Changing the link back (as explained in my first post) fixes the
problem.

Would you prefer a "rear -dv mkrescue"?

I changed the title. I am a newbie at using GIT, so my learning curve is
a little slow.  
Is there a way to upload and attach a file (like
/var/log/rear/rear-wedjat.log)?

@pteegarden perhaps you could install `yum-plugin-verify` (not sure is
has the same name on CentOS) and then verify

    [gdha@fedora20 ~]$ ll /lib64/libexpat.so.1
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 17 Dec 18 09:05 /lib64/libexpat.so.1 -> libexpat.so.1.6.0
    [gdha@fedora20 ~]$ rpm -qf /lib64/libexpat.so.1
    expat-2.1.0-7.fc20.x86_64
    [gdha@fedora20 ~]$ yum verify expat
    Loaded plugins: langpacks, refresh-packagekit, verify
    verify done

If it shows some non-compliant then re-install the package and verify it
shows the correct information before running `rear` again. After running
`rear` do the `yum verify` again. It could be that EMC NetWorker is
responsible for changing the link. We need to eliminate the one or the
other. Does this sound like a plan?

Installed yum-plugin-verify and ran it:

    [root@wedjat lib64]# ll libexpat*
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 139368 Aug  6  2012 libexpat.so
    lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     17 Apr  4 13:29 libexpat.so.1 -> libexpat.so.1.5.2
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 167648 Apr 27  2012 libexpat.so.1.5.2

    [root@wedjat lib64]# yum verify expat

    This system is not registered to Red Hat Subscription Management. You can use subscription-manager to register.

    verify done

    [root@wedjat lib64]# rpm -qf /lib64/libexpat.so.1
    expat-2.0.1-11.el6_2.x86_64

I then ran `rear -dvS mkrescue` and looked at the `libexpat.so.1` link
after every step.  
The original link was OK up to this question:

`Press ENTER to include '/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/10_copy_as_is.sh' ...`

After I pressed enter, the link changed to  
`lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Apr  4 13:45 /lib64/libexpat.so.1 -> ./libexpat.so`

It surprised me that `yum verify expat` actually executed with this
"bad" link in place:

    [root@wedjat lib64]# yum verify expat
    Plugin "subscription-manager" can't be imported
    Loaded plugins: product-id, rhnplugin, security, verify
    /usr/lib64/python2.6/xmlrpclib.py:612: DeprecationWarning: The xmllib module is obsolete.  Use xml.sax instead.

"yum repolist" or "yum check-update" fails at this point, as noted
before.

The only reference I found was `/usr/lib/nsr/lib64/libexpat.so` in the
log.  
If you could redo the exercise with options
`/usr/sbin/rear -DdvS mkrescue` then we see the real debugging. The
above libexpat must be dealt with wrongly somehow? But, now I cannot see
it . Thank you for your investigation time.
