Hello,

I tried to create a backup with rear on a usb device and got:

    Relax-and-Recover 1.15 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-host7.log
    ERROR: BUG BUG BUG!  Unable to determine raw USB device for /dev/dm-18

    === Stack trace ===

    Message: BUG BUG BUG!  Unable to determine raw USB device for /dev/dm-18

device mapper ...

Should I blacklist the USB Stick? Or is the a better solution?

What can it be?  
Andy

Please give us your configuration (what you changed), the full log and
the output of `rear dump`. You can also use gist.github.com to upload
files.

Please give us

-   your configuration
-   the log
-   the output of `rear dump`

Maybe create a [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) for
those files, easier that pasting all that into the ticket.

... config is just like this:  
OUTPUT=USB  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

and nothing more in the log. Solution is: multipath blacklist for the
USB Stiick.

Do you mean blacklisting usb-storage in your MPIO configuration? Yes,
that seems like a good idea.

Please reopen if you have more to add to this. Thanks a lot for
providing the solution.
