Hello @gozora,

as today is really awful weather I looked around the rear-source.  
There I found this script which creates the lib-environment.  
I'm not sure what else breaks with this - so this PR is more meant
like  
a question/pointer start of discussion than a real merge-request.

But with this fix my chrooted rootfs looks better (for /usr/lib64 at
least)

    RESCUE osa:/usr # ls -l /usr
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    6 Oct 29 08:36 bin -> ../bin
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   60 Oct 27 18:13 include
    drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4340 Oct 29 08:36 lib
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    3 Oct 29 08:36 lib64 -> lib
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    6 Oct 29 08:36 sbin -> ../bin
    drwxr-xr-x 8 root root  180 Oct 29 08:36 share

and the `ldd` of course also works now.  
Maybe this helps, greetings  
Frank

Yep, hell of a weather here as well.  
I'm installing Arch right now :-).  
I know about that script, problem is that such approach would most
probably introduce some regression, so we must be 100% sure that other
distros will not suffer with such change.

ReaR can distinguish between distros and can run some scripts if it
matches. (see e.g. */rear/usr/share/rear/build/Debian*).So I think this
might be a way to go ...

Hello @efwe,

I've created PR
[https://github.com/efwe/rear/pull/1](https://github.com/efwe/rear/pull/1),
can you check if it works better ?

@efwe  
Your patch have some side effects:

    ++ target=usr/lib
    ++ [[ ! -e /tmp/rear.ninx3H9jappyoDX/rootfsusr/lib ]]
    ++ mkdir -v -p /tmp/rear.ninx3H9jappyoDX/rootfsusr/lib
    mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.ninx3H9jappyoDX/rootfsusr'
    mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.ninx3H9jappyoDX/rootfsusr/lib'

Which creates some directories *rootfsusr and rootfsusr/lib* which are
not desired.  
I did not study it further but this might be the recursion I was talking
about earlier.

Btw. forget about my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1556\#issuecomment-340247597](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1556#issuecomment-340247597),
this is certainly a bug which can affect any distro, so we should not
cover but fix it instead ...

Hello @gozora,

I tested with your patch and no errors during copy. The `lib64` links
looks great and no errors for `ldd` later of course. But I haven't
booted or restored from it yet.  
Especially because I now have other warnings

    2017-10-29 13:27:52.630054166 There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries

but I will investigate first and open another ticket if needed.

So should I close this PR here and you can double check with someone
else and use your patch? Thanks for the prompt effort. Very tough
response time :)

Have a nice weekend,

Hello @efwe

> Especially because I now have other warnings

AFAIK we don't have many Arch users, so ReaR is not heavily tested here,
hence you might run into some difficulties for sure ;-).

> but I will investigate first and open another ticket if needed.

Sure, do so, If we know we help ;-)

> So should I close this PR

Yes, please close it, I'm very far from being GIT guru and I really
don't how to handle such situation correctly. So best would be to close
this PR and I'll create new one with my changes and ask for review of
other members.

> Thanks for the prompt effort. Very tough response time :)

Anytime.

> Have a nice weekend,

Have a nice weekend too.

Hello @efwe,

Just came across same problem. Solved by `pacman -S libmicrohttpd` ...
