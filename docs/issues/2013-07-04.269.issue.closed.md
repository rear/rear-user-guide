I have tested both rsync and default NETFS backup methods and I have had
more issues with rsync. I would like to use default (tar), but I want to
store my backups on datadomain with depuplication, hence the requirement
to disable gzip compression. Is this something possible?  
Thanks

The `default.conf` file contains the variable
`BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS="--gzip"`  
You could redefine this in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file as
`BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=""` and give a shot again.

Hi, I was sure I had tried that without success... But it does work,
feel dumb now ;)  
Thank you
