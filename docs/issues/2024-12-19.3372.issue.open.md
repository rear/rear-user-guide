When I examine the partitions, /dev/sdb is of the correct type:

\[root@sas02 rear-master\]# parted --list /dev/sdb

Disk /dev/sda: 107GB

3 1082MB 17.2GB 16.1GB ext3 primary legacy\_boot

I'm uncertain if I've chosen the wrong output type or if I'm missing a
dependency. Is there documentation on how to use each of the OUTPUT
types? For instance, I could write this out as an ISO instead and then
attach that file to the virtual CDROM device. I have no idea how RAWDISK
is supposed to be used.

Any assistance would be much appreciated.

> Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.6

I am afraid that current ReaR will not support it - the last working
version on RHEL 6 was ReaR 2.4, according to @didacog .

By the way, have you formatted the disk using `rear format` before? Is
there anything at `/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000` ?

I did format the disk according to the getting started section of the
README. It did throw an error the first time around, but I then compiled
sgdisk for the system and added it to the path. After that, the format
succeeded with a warning that it used sgdisk as a fallback.

I basically created a 16GB virtual disk on the VM and then proceeded
with the quick start. Are there any directives that need to be changed?
Anything I'm doing wrong here?

I can try the older version and see if that succeeds. I would really
like to get this working because doing bare metal the old way is very
time consuming. I appreciate the effort.

I asked in my prior submission about the various output formats. Is
there any documentation on how to use RAWDISK or the other output
formats?

I don't think so, looks good at first glance (you are using `BACKUP=NBU`
so you will of course need proper NBU backups, but that's not the issue
here).

Your problem is caused by a too old lsblk that does not support
`PKNAME` - you can try to set `USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt` as a
workaround, but I suspect you will hit other issues.

@frustratedsignup You could try the old git code of
`https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/rear-2.4` and do a checkout of that
branch and give it a shot directly from the git code as
`sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkrecscue`. Do not forget to edit the
`etc/rear/local.conf` file before kicking off rear.
