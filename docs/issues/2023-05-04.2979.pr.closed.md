##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    manually on Ubu2204 and OL8

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR adds a non-interactive mode in ReaR.  
This mode is intended when ReaR is started with an external automation
tool like Ansible and there is no possibility to do an user input.  
If a user input is needed, ReaR should abort with an error and not get
stuck in user input loop.  
The `UserInput` function has been modified so that it returns the
dafault value in non-interactive mode otherwise an error is thrown.  
In the scripts the mode can be checked and handled with the variable
`NON_INTERACTIVE`.  
For example, see
`usr/share/rear/verify/GALAXY11/default/420_login_to_galaxy_and_setup_environment.sh`:

    is_true "$NON_INTERACTIVE" && \
                Error "Login is not possible in non-interactive mode. Set variables GALAXY11_USER and GALAXY11_PASSWORD."

The non-interactive mode mode can be activated with the command line
option `-n` or `--non-interactive`.

Unfortunately in current ReaR code the UserInput function  
is not the only way how ReaR may ask for user input.

There are some code places left where 'read' or 'select'  
is called directly to get user input, for example  
in the ReaR recovery system startup scripts like 'select' in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh)  
but I think also for some third-party backup methods  
and at some other code places.

The UserInput function is intentionally made  
to be ready for automated usage via the  
USER\_INPUT\_... config variables  
so no additional special code should be needed  
for UserInput() for automated usage.

I.e. from my current point of view I don't see  
why this pull request is needed - or in other words:

@codefritzel  
what does not work for you with  
the USER\_INPUT\_... config variables  
for your particular automated use case?

As far as I see nowhere is UserInput called without '-I'

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep -h 'UserInput ' | grep -v '^ *#' | grep -v ' -I '

    [no output ]

so for all cases where UserInput is called  
it is possible to specify a predefined user input value.

I see there are perhaps some cases where  
any predefined user input value cannot make sense  
e.g. because any predefined value would be wrong  
or any predefined value would be a security issue.

So I could enhance the UserInput function to error out  
when a special predefined user input value is specified,  
for example when that value is 'ERROR\_ABORT' e.g. like

    USER_INPUT_GALAXY10_RESTORE_PIT="ERROR_ABORT"

then the call

    UserInput -I GALAXY10_RESTORE_PIT ...

would just error out.

In general see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#it-should-be-possible-to-run-rear-unattended](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#it-should-be-possible-to-run-rear-unattended)

So in theory all code in ReaR should be so that it can run unattended.

In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.

I think it is more helpful in practice to fix those code places  
where ReaR cannot run unattended one by one as they become known  
than a new generic mode which does not work in general, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1534762436](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1534762436)  
because currently a non-interactive mode would be  
just one more false promise to the user.

@codefritzel there is a lot of wisdom in what @jsmeix says here.

Maybe another aproach would actually provide an easier solution? what
happens if you call ReaR like this

    yes "" | rear recover -v

In thise way every prompt will be answered with ENTER and I imagine that
your login prompt would also quickly lead to a failure, which you could
then detect from Ansible.

Or, rather:

    bash -c "exec rear recover -v < <(yes '')"

(bash creates the stdin input redirection and then replaces itself with
rear)

to easier get the return code of `rear`.

This could be an alternative, but the user must know all possible inputs
before.

@schlomo in my opinion these are "dirty" workarounds which only work if
the inputs are not validated.  
Here is an example with GALAXY11\_PIT\_RECOVERY:  
ReaR was called by ansible and there was no feedback for a long time.
The reason was that a UserInput was requested for
GALAXY11\_PIT\_RECOVERY and this was validated in a loop. This had
created an infinite loop because of this code section:

    until IsInArray "$GALAXY11_PIT_RECOVERY" "${job_end_times[@]}"; do
        GALAXY11_PIT_RECOVERY=$( UserInput -I GALAXY11_PIT_RECOVERY -p "Select point-in-time restore to use (ENTER for latest):" "${job_end_times[@]}" )
    done

This has already been fixed in
[0ebb2c](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ebb2c62739c6c973b1c9d4d0682bdd48e3825fb)
but there is still a concern that this problem will occur somewhere
else. In this case the desire for ReaR is to abort in such a case.

I think with the non-interactive mode this would be the cleanest way to
do it. If this it implemented in the relevant sections.

@codefritzel  
as far as I understand it currently  
I think the generic functionality you need  
is to monitor a running process ('rear' in this case)  
whether or not it is actually doing something  
in contrast to only endlessly useless waiting.

I think the problem with that is how to distinguish  
between deliberate waiting (for something that will happen)  
and endlessly useless waiting.

For a nice example of deliberate waiting see your  
recent "nfs\_server as new restore method"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2973](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2973)  
via restore/NFS4SERVER/default/400\_restore\_with\_nfs\_server.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NFS4SERVER/default/400\_restore\_with\_nfs\_server.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NFS4SERVER/default/400_restore_with_nfs_server.sh)

The good thing of this deliberate waiting is  
that is is gentle busy waiting via

    while WAIT_CONDITION ; do
        ...
        sleep 5
        ...
    done

so the waiting process is not totally idle  
i.e. the waiting process does not appear to be dead(locked).

Note that there is the `USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT` variable, which can be used
to shorten waiting for input that never arrives

I think that this infinite loop case warrants some extension of
`UserInput`: either one would be able to specify in the code that user
input must be provided, or the function would abort if called some
number of times for the same input and timed out (or some combination of
both).

Note that there is already the `unattended` command line option, which
implements a sort of non-interactive mode. Could you check whether it
does what you need and if not whether it would make sense to extend it?

Here is another idea:

Extend the `UserInput` function so that it will automatically abort on
repeated calls on the same variable. That way interactive prompts can be
answered with the default response but loops that keep asking for the
same `UserInput` will then abort automatically on the second try.

What do you think about that?

@jsmeix what do you mean? That this example would not work with my
suggestion? Yes, of course not.

I'm still trying to find a solution for making ReaR work better in
unattended mode, and especially preventing endless `UserInput` loops.
The one during recovery \#2984 is maybe one of the worst examples, but
there may be others.

I don't mind modifying my suggestion so that calling `UserInput` 10
times with the same variable will lead to an abort. And we can also make
it a configuration option that must be activated via a parameter, e.g.
the `--non-interactive` parameter.

yes, it is similar to what I meant by "or the function would abort if
called some number of times for the same input and timed out" - by "same
input" I meant "on the same variable" - and I meant to abort on a
specific number of calls and not necessarily already at the second one.
Also, to abort only if the fucntion timed out multiple times, not when
the input has been entered properly. Aborting always would basically
prevent using UserInput in a loop, which could also have its would also
have its merits and possibly disadvantages.

Good idea, we can count the "nobody took care of me for the N-th time"
when triggering the timeout in `UserInput`. That way it really happens
only without user interaction

@pcahyna  
thank you for your proposal.

@schlomo  
thank you for your summary reason why this proposal works.

Now I agree with the proposed method.

Regarding using the same UserInput in a loop:

This is what I meant with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1541609286](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1541609286)  
where same input '\[Enter\]' is needed several times in a loop  
with same UserInput ID 'WAIT\_UNTIL\_ENTER'.

A real-world example is similar as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2984](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2984)  
but in interactive mode when diskrestore.sh  
needs to be run several times in a loop  
with same UserInput 'LAYOUT\_CODE\_RUN' and  
same input "Rerun disk recreation script"  
because the user could also fix things  
by only calling command line tools via another shell  
which he could do on a second terminal (e.g. via ssh)  
so that via the terminal where 'rear' is run only the  
UserInput 'LAYOUT\_CODE\_RUN' is run several times in a loop  
with several times same input "Rerun disk recreation script".

We'll rework this PR to

1.  abort in the `UserInput` function if the **timeout** is hit too many
    times (configurable)
2.  activate non-interactive together with the unattended recovery

Any other wishes to include?

I'm actually wondering if we can have (1) always active but with a
higher count, e.g. 10, and then reduce that to 1 together with setting
the `USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT` to 3 seconds as the main action of the
`--non-interactive` flag? I can't imagine where somebody would want to
cycle more than 10 times through the same question and this approach
makes it simple to manually test ReaR with convenient timeouts and then
use ReaR "in production" and non-interactive with short timeouts and no
timeout-driven retries, without changing the configuration files.

I think when there is a --non-interactive flag,  
then the maximum number of timeouts for the same UserInput  
could be even unlimited when --non-interactive is not set.  
In contrast when --non-interactive is set,  
then the maximum number of timeouts is what the user specified  
or as fallback what is specified for it in default.conf.

Or in other words:  
Keep the current behaviour when --non-interactive is not set.  
Do whatever is needed when --non-interactive is set.

My reason for unlimited number of timeouts  
when --non-interactive is not set is that  
I think it could be rather unfriendly behaviour  
for the user if it all of a sudden aborts ReaR  
after a relatively small number of timeouts  
(and a big number of timeouts behaves in practice  
same as unlimited number of timeouts).

In particular during "rear recover" any automated abort  
because of something that is not an actual hard error  
would be rather unfriendly behaviour for a user  
who is interactively struggling with "rear recover".

Simply put:  
In interactive mode only the user should abort ReaR.  
(It is a different thing when ReaR must error out.)

BTW, I'll keep the `Error` if non-interactive is used and a `UserInput`
has no default choice, as this affects only very few cases:

I'll have a look at those and add defaults where possible.

@jsmeix I just realized: Not an issue as the stuff in `skel` runs before
`rear recover` starts, while `--non-interactice` only works *within*
`rear` itself.

@schlomo  
regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1546922558](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1546922558)

I think you may have misunderstood.

I think in general a non-interactive / unattended mode for ReaR  
is meant to let ReaR either continue or abort automatically  
whenever user input is needed.

But in general when 'read' or 'select' is called directly  
to get user input the current implementation of those calls  
may not yet automatically continue or abort.

Off the top of my head I know at least about  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/dd0c7111c76f48c21e53f5184ede6aa5f07d6865](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/dd0c7111c76f48c21e53f5184ede6aa5f07d6865)  
so that at this code place it currently continues  
automatically only when there is only one choice  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh\#L145](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh#L145)  
but when there is more than a single choice it calls 'select'  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh\#L177](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh#L177)  
which waits endlessly for an input, cf.
