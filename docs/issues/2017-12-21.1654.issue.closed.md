@kodiss  
where did you run the "rpm -qa" command?  
In the recreated system i.e. after 'rear recover' finished  
and after you rebooted or after 'rear recover' finished but  
before the reboot i.e. still in the ReaR recovery system?

@jsmeix  
Oh, Sorry. Our system's root fs is btrfs. And it have subvolume.  
I omit the var in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE.  
After add it, I success to recover.

Thank you and sorry.

@kodiss  
many thanks for your feedback what the actual  
reason was on your particular system and  
for your confirmation that ReaR per se works.  
It helps (at least me) a lot to have an explicit feedback  
when there is no (possibly obscure) issue in ReaR.
