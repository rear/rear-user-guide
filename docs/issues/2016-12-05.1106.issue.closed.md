    `sfdisk -c` is deprecated in favour of --part-type which might make

    commit 8eab3194ce1737a167812d5e84d83b0dfc253fac

        sfdisk: add --parttype
        
        The patch also makes --{id,change-id,print-id} deprecated in favour
        of --parttype. The original --id is too generic option name and the
        --print-id and --change-id are unnecessary and inconsistent with
        another sfdisk options (e.g. we don't have --change-bootable)

New output from `sfdisk -c /dev/sda 3` looks as follows:

    sfdisk: --id is deprecated in favour of --part-type
     5

Warning message "sfdisk: --id is deprecated in favour of --part-type" is
not that bad (as it was returned on stderr), I however had trouble with
returned partition type prefixed with space (' ') which made following
condition to evaluate incorrectly:

    if [[ "$partition_id" = 5 || "$partition_id" = f || "$partition_id" = 85 ]]; then
       sed -i /^$partition_nr\ /s/\ primary\ /\ extended\ / $TMP_DIR/partitions
    fi

As a result extended partition was not detected correctly which resulted
to failed partitioning during `rear recover`

-   Work-around, if any  
    I've temporarily fixed code as follows:

<!-- -->

    if [[ "$partition_id" = 5 || "$partition_id" = f || "$partition_id" = 85 || "$partition_id" = " 5" ]]; then
       sed -i /^$partition_nr\ /s/\ primary\ /\ extended\ / $TMP_DIR/partitions
    fi

But for some reason I don't like it that much ...

In general:  
I never had a detailed look at the partitioning code  
but from my little experience with it (mainly when  
I worked on that SUSE sepecific 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' stuff)  
I think the whole partitioning code is fragile.  
When something does not work during "rear mkbackup"  
it blindly proceeds (no 'set -e') and one gets wrong  
data in disklayout.conf (e.g. missing entries) and  
then it fails at a random place during "rear recover".

In particular regarding 'sfdisk':  
On my openSUSE Leap 42.1 system "sfdisk --version"  
shows "sfdisk from util-linux 2.25" and "man sfdisk" reads:

<pre>
sfdisk doesn't understand the GUID Partition Table
(GPT) format and it is not designed for large partitions.
In these cases use the more advanced GNU parted(8).
</pre>

If sfdisk from util-linux 2.26 does also not support GPT  
I think we should try to get rid of sfdisk in ReaR because  
tools that do not support GPT and large partitions  
will cause and endless sequence of more and more  
problems in ReaR in the future - until we get rid of  
such tools.

I don't know if  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1105](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1105)  
is directly related but at least it is about huge disks that  
requires tools that support GPT and large partitions.

Hello @jsmeix ,  
Actually this bug can hit you ONLY if you are using extended partitions,
so I really don't think that many users will be affected by it.

\#1105 is IMHO not related to this.

Regarding a quick workaround that makes it work for now  
until the general sfdisk issue is cleaned up:

What about making the output safe against intermixed  
unwanted characters and - by the way - fix the deprecated '&8'  
usage, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887)

<pre>
declare partition_id=$( sfdisk -c $device $partition_nr 2>/dev/null | tr -c -d '[:alnum:]' )
</pre>

Another by the way:  
I wonder why there is 'declare' here?  
I do not understand why it is not simply

<pre>
partition_id=$( ... )
</pre>

I meant that in general as long as ReaR uses partitioning  
tools that do not support GPT and large partitions  
in general users would be hit by this or that shortcomings.

This particular issue is only about extended partitions  
which - as far as I know - do not exists for GPT  
(or are at least not supported by GPT).

I was thinking about using `tr` as well it is certainly nicer comparing
to what I've used.

Exactly my thoughts ...

@gozora  
because you can test what fix actually makes it work,  
I will basically blindly accept your pull request.

@jsmeix , sure I'll prepare it.
