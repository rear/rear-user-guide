See the `y` that the user had to enter to continue the recovery
process:

I'll fix this issue with the next release.

Good grief!  
Many thanks for finding that special case!  
I think this explains why '&gt;&2' was not used  
for 'mkfs' commands, cf.

<pre>
You will notice that the mkfs commands do
not have >&2 appended (I guess that was done
on purpose so that the user see something on the screen).

Now we do no longer need to guess what that purpose was ;-)

@schlomo  
out of curiosity: How do you intend to fix it?

If the current '&gt;&2' is removed from the 'mkfs' calls  
it leads usually (i.e. when it does not need a 'y' response)  
to unintended blabber on stdout, see what I got for btrfs

I plan to add `-F` to the mkfs calls. IMHO any mkfs output should rather
go to the logfile. If it fails then the user should expect to find all
relevant infos there. If it doesn't fail then the output of mkfs is not
interesting.

I fully agree!

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
added a  
"Careful with tools that may (sometimes) prompt for user input!"  
to the "What to do with stdout and stderr" section.
