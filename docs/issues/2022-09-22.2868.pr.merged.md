FYI  
what "help read" shows on SLES11 SP4 with bash version 3.2.57

    # help read
    read: read [-ers] [-u fd] [-t timeout] [-p prompt] [-a array] [-n nchars] [-d delim] [name ...]
        One line is read from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD if the
        -u option is supplied, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME,
        the second word to the second NAME, and so on, with leftover words assigned
        to the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word
        delimiters.  If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY
        variable.  If the -r option is given, this signifies `raw' input, and
        backslash escaping is disabled.  The -d option causes read to continue
        until the first character of DELIM is read, rather than newline.  If the -p
        option is supplied, the string PROMPT is output without a trailing newline
        before attempting to read.  If -a is supplied, the words read are assigned
        to sequential indices of ARRAY, starting at zero.  If -e is supplied and
        the shell is interactive, readline is used to obtain the line.  If -n is
        supplied with a non-zero NCHARS argument, read returns after NCHARS
        characters have been read.  The -s option causes input coming from a
        terminal to not be echoed.
        
        The -t option causes read to time out and return failure if a complete line
        of input is not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  If the TMOUT variable is set,
        its value is the default timeout.  The return code is zero, unless end-of-file
        is encountered, read times out, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as
        the argument to -u.

I simplified it to a single command

    test -t 0 && while read -t 0 ; do read -s ; done

This does not drain characters not terminated by ENTER, try

    sleep 5; while read -t 0 ; do read -s ; done

and press some keys (without ENTER) during the `sleep`. You will see
that the characters remain.

Yes this is a known drawback of how `read -t 0` is implemented.  
It only looks if there is something in stdin.  
It does not look if there is something  
in the terminal buffer that is not yet in stdin.  
See my comment in my last commit.

I tested it right now and it behaves "good enough" for me.

During my test I typed plain '9' without ENTER  
(note the `9Marking component...` line)  
before another UserInput dialog appeared and got  
(with MIGRATION\_MODE="true" to get those dialogs):

    RESCUE localhost:~ # rear -D recover
    ...

    9Marking component '/dev/sda' as done in /var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf

    6) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)

when I hit only ENTER in that dialog  
because that dialog got '9' and ENTER at its stdin  
when ENTER was hit (which triggers to move the '9'  
from the terminal buffer into rear's stdin).

By the way:  
I hit ENTER many times between dialogs  
and typed lots of stuff during backup restore.  
All behaved sufficiently well for me.

I also wonder why `-t` in the second read is not needed. I would be
afraid that `read -s` without `-t` would block forever if there is no
more input at this point, but apparently this does not happen.

My question is, why not add `-n 1000` back? It seemed to get rid of this
drawback.

I also wondered why `-t 1` in the second read is not needed.  
I also expected it to wait endlessly for input.  
I got that from a colleague and tried it and it works for me.

[https://superuser.com/questions/276531/clear-stdin-before-reading](https://superuser.com/questions/276531/clear-stdin-before-reading)

When I call this on command line it waits for input.

Next week I try out how it behaves with re-added `-n 1000`.  
And perhaps I should add `-t 1` just as a safety net.

Hmpf!  
I hate this fragile terminal IO stuff.

I can produce an endless 'read' loop with

    while read -t 0 ; do read ... ; done

on comandline with bash 4.4.23  
depending on how the process that does the 'read'  
is connected with the process that provides read's input  
and additionally depending on some (weird) 'sleep':

    # ( echo start ; sleep 2 ; echo -en 'foo\nbar' ; sleep 2 ; echo end ) | ( while read -t 0 ; do echo reading ; read -t 1 -n 1000 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" ; sleep 1 ; done )
    reading
    'start
    '
    reading
    'foo
    bar'
    reading
    'end
    '
    reading
    ''
    reading
    ''
    ...
    [continues endlessly]

versus

    # ( echo start ; sleep 2 ; echo -en 'foo\nbar' ; sleep 2 ; echo end ) | ( while read -t 0 ; do echo reading ; read -t 1 -n 1000 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" ; done )
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe

or

    # { echo start ; sleep 2 ; echo -en 'foo\nbar' ; sleep 2 ; echo end ; } | { while read -t 0 ; do echo reading ; read -t 1 -n 1000 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" ; sleep 1 ; done ; }
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe

Because I cannot know how the user will connect  
the process that does the 'read' (usr/sbin/rear)  
with the process that provides read's input  
(the users's normal terminal or something else  
where `test -t 0` still results zero exit code),  
I will not risk any possibility to hang up ReaR  
only because to avoid possible bad outcomes when  
a user carelessly types things on his keyboard  
regardless that he should not type randomly  
while a program is running that uses stdin.

So I will not use any kind of unlimited loop.

Meanwhile I think a single

    read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d ''

is sufficient for what is actually needed here in practice  
which is primarily to drain some accidental additional ENTER  
which can accidentally happen also to experienced users  
(in contrast to random typing things on the keyboard).

Of course it happened to me during the sequence of user input  
dialogs during "rear recover" with MIGRATION\_MODE="true"  
where most dialogs are OK so one gets used to hit ENTER  
until the one dialog appears where one needs to select  
something specific (instead of the default via ENTER).

How `read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d ''` behaves for me:

On SLES10 with bash 3.1.17:

    # for i in $( seq 10 ) ; do echo $i ; done | ( read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   1  nl   2  nl   3  nl   4  nl   5  nl   6  nl   7  nl   8
    0000020  nl   9  nl   1   0  nl   '  nl

    # for i in $( seq 10 ) ; do echo $i ; done | ( read -s -t 1 -n 10 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   1  nl   2  nl   3  nl   4  nl   5  nl   '  nl

    # time read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d ''
    real    0m1.002s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.000s

On openSUSE Leap 15.3 with bash 4.4.23:

    # for i in $( seq 10 ) ; do echo $i ; done | ( read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   1  nl   2  nl   3  nl   4  nl   5  nl   6  nl   7  nl   8
    0000020  nl   9  nl   1   0  nl   '  nl

    # for i in $( seq 10 ) ; do echo $i ; done | ( read -s -t 1 -n 10 -d '' ; echo "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   1  nl   2  nl   3  nl   4  nl   5  nl   '  nl

    # time read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d ''
    real    0m1.000s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.000s

This causes again a one second delay when there is no input  
but that should not matter in practice in interactive mode.  
This one second delay might even be useful in practice  
because this way the user may not too easily get used  
to carelessly hit ENTER ENTER ENTER... when there is  
a sequence of dialogs.

What matters first and foremost is: "It Has To Work."

    Preferably use simple generic functionality

    Better very simple code than oversophisticated

@jsmeix I agree with the reasoning that simple code covering the most
problematic case is preferred. One question, why have you added `-d ''`?
That was not in any of the previous attempts and experiments as far as I
could see. According to the manual, "The first character of DELIM is
used to terminate the input line, rather than newline. If DELIM is the
empty string, 'read' will terminate a line when it reads a NUL
character." So, are you counting on the fact that the NUL character
should never appear in the input and therefore this allows the command
to skip multiple ENTERs ?

Yes, that's the intent behind `-d ''`.  
I have that from  
[https://superuser.com/questions/276531/clear-stdin-before-reading](https://superuser.com/questions/276531/clear-stdin-before-reading)  
which reads (excerpt):

    read -d '' -t 0.1 -n 10000

    This reads multiple lines of inputs,
    if the user inadvertently pressed enter multiple times

For me `-d ''` seems to also work with bash 3.x  
but neither "man bash" nor "help read" tell about  
what 'read' does when the delimiter is the empty string.  
This is only described in  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html\_node/Bash-Builtins.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html)  
which is currtently "for Bash, Version 5.2.", see  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html\_node/index.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)

Previously I had tested `-d '~'` see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2868\#discussion\_r978452551](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2868#discussion_r978452551)

    What works for me even with bash 3.x is
    using an artificial delimiter character
    that is sufficiently unlikely
    to be accidentally entered by the user:

    # echo -e 'One\nTwo\nThree' | ( read -t 1 -d '~' -n 10 D ; read R1 ; read R2 ; echo D "$D" ; echo R1 "$R1" ; echo R2 "$R2" )
    D One
    Two
    Th
    R1 ree
    R2

I think I can avoid  
the one second delay when there is no input  
in a simple and fail safe way via

    test -t 0 && read -t 0 && read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d ''

When `read -t 0` falsely results non zero exit code  
but there is someting in stdin, then  
draining stdin would be falsely skipped which is no big issue  
because then UserInput() falls back to working as before and  
normally there should be nothing accidentally pending in stdin.

When `read -t 0` falsely results zero exit code  
but there is nothing in stdin, then  
the subsequent `rear -t 1` times out after one second.

`read -t 0` may not work sufficiently reliably  
when automated input is provided (here with bash 4.4.23):

    # for i in $( seq 5 ) ; do echo -n $i ; done | ( read -t 0 && read -s -t 1 -n 100 -d '' ; echo -n "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   '
    0000002

    # for i in $( seq 5 ) ; do echo -n $i ; done | ( read -t 0 && read -s -t 1 -n 100 -d '' ; echo -n "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   '
    0000002
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
    bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe

I think this happens  
when `read -t 0` is called in the pipe consumer  
before the pipe producer made actual output  
and the "Broken pipe" happens when the pipe consumer  
already finished so the 'echo' in the pipe producer  
writes into a "Broken pipe".

With a sleep in the pipe consumer it works:

    # for i in $( seq 5 ) ; do echo -n $i ; done | ( sleep 1 ; read -t 0 && read -s -t 1 -n 100 -d '' ; echo -n "'$REPLY'" | od -a )
    0000000   '   1   2   3   4   5   '
    0000007

I think in ReaR such a race condition cannot happen  
because the stdin producer process  
(usually the user's terminal emulation program)  
is already running when the usr/sbin/rear process  
gets started by the user on his termial.

When usr/sbin/rear is run where stdin is not a terminal  
the `test -t 0` won't let the 'read' calls happen.

When usr/sbin/rear is run by the user in whatever special  
way where stdin is a terminal and somehow automated input  
is fed with a little delay into usr/sbin/rear, then  
the 'read' calls should happen late enough to work OK.

during "rear recover" with MIGRATION\_MODE="true"  
and it behaves perfectly well for me.

@pcahyna @rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it  
tomorrow afternoon in its last state which is

    test -t 0 && read -t 0 && read -s -t 1 -n 1000 -d ''

If issues appear later I will of course fix them.
