Our source tarball rear-2.3.tar.gz at sourceforge  
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/)  
is about 4.8 MB.

In contrast our source tarball rear-2.3.tar.gz in OBS  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.3](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.3)  
is about 500 KB.

Unpacking both and comparing them with 'diff -r' shows:

<pre>
#  diff -r -U0 rear-2.3.sourceforge rear-2.3.OBS

Somehow additional RPMs and tarballs are in  
our rear-2.3.tar.gz at sourceforge.

Ideally our source tarballs should be exactly the same  
at sourceforge and in OBS.

Indeed strange - `make dist OFFICIAL=1` works better. Uploaded a new
tar-ball

Now  
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/)  
shows

<pre>
Looking for the latest version?
Download rear-release-notes.txt (49.0 kB) 
</pre>

where "Download rear-release-notes.txt (49.0 kB)" is a link to  
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/latest/download?source=files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/latest/download?source=files)  
and after clicking on "Download rear-release-notes.txt (49.0 kB)"  
one really gets only the rear-release-notes.txt file.

That is now fixed as well - thanks for pointing this out - it was
automatically selected when I deleted the bad tar-ball.

I can confirm it is o.k. now.

FYI:  
The tarballs at sourceforge and in OBS are not exactly the same  
but when unpacking them there are no differences.  
Something makes the two tarballs still somehow different.  
Ideally all our tarballs at any place are exactly the same.
