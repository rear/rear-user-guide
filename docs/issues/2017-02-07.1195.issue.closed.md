-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When I try to restore my server using ReaR, I got an error when
    attempting to recreate the disk partition.

    +++ parted -s /dev/sda mkpart '"rear-noname"' 180623507456B 9592801067007B
    Error: The location 9592801067007B is outside of the device /dev/sda

My server has 3 600G HD configured as RAID 5. The total disk space
should have been 1.2T.  
Attached is the output of fdisk:
[fdisk-sda.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/758593/fdisk-sda.txt)

I tried tracing the log when ReaR created the backup ISO. It reads from
/sys/block/sda/size and got 2341994496 as the \# of blocks on disk
array. It then reads from /sys/block/sda/queue/logical\_block\_size and
gets 4096 as the \# of bytes per block. This explains why the wrong
calculation of getting 9+ TB.

I am new to RHEL & ReaR, any suggestion on how come fdisk gets the
correct disk size calculation but not ReaR? Is there a configuration
error when I set up ReaR?

-   Work-around, if any:

@j100ng could you paste the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file
please?  
Interesting bug - could you also tell us what should be the corrective
actions?

Attached are the disklayout.conf as requested and also the actual log
file when recover error occured.

My disk configurations has nothing special and thus can't understand why
encounter such error. I'd like to establish is it a configuration issue,
or a software bug or system error? I have also open up a case with
RedHat in parallel cause it seems like the info in /sys/block/sda/ are
wrong, thus leading to ReaR calculated the wrong partition size. I'd
appreciate your help to determine if it's not configuration or software
bug.

To summarize we see with `fdisk` the following:

    Disk /dev/sda: 1199.1 GB, 1199101181952 bytes, 292749312 sectors
    Units = sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
    Disk label type: gpt


    #         Start          End    Size  Type            Name
     1          256       128255    500M  EFI System      EFI System Partition
     2       128256       194815    260M  unknown         Basic data partition
     3       194816      5437695     20G  Linux LVM       Basic data partition
     4      5438976      5512191    286M  Microsoft basic primary
     5      5512192    292749055    1.1T  Linux LVM

And, the `disklayout.conf` file has:

    disk /dev/sda 9592809455616 gpt
    part /dev/sda 4194304000 8388608 EFI0x20System0x20Partition boot /dev/sda1

    part /dev/sda 9412177559552 180623507456 rear-noname lvm /dev/sda5

During `rear recover` we see in the log file:

@j100ng Perhaps, you could run `rear -dD savelayout` to capture the
debug output? Maybe, we can see where it goes wrong? That kind of input
will RedHat also require. It could be helpful to attach the RH bugzilla
reference number to this issue as well.

I have attached 2 files here

debug output of "rear -dD savelayout"  
[rear-macso1.log.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/774316/rear-macso1.log.txt)

tar file of related info like /etc/rear/*.conf & /sys/block/sda/*  
[rear-env.tar.gz](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/774332/rear-env.tar.gz)

I don't have a RH bugzilla reference since I raised my issue, Case \#
01787845, into RH Customer Portal. Don't think anyone else can read it.

RH confirms that there is an issue with detecting the disk layout. See
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1426341](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426341).
The workaround RH support suggested is for me to modify
/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh to hard code get\_block\_size()
to always return 512 on my servers.

Cannot be fixed until ReaR 2.3 release  
so that I postpone it for ReaR 2.4.

Yes, it is somehow related to issues  
like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102)

But I think this issue here is not the same issue.

I cannot fix and clean up the whole disk layout code  
in one single pull request, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733\#issuecomment-368488004](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733#issuecomment-368488004)

In general in relation to the whole disk layout code  
you may also have a look at what I had written about  
"ReaR's disk layout code skeleton in the closet" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1603\#issuecomment-347860869](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1603#issuecomment-347860869)  
in particular my currenly latest reasoning  
about a "clean design" (of the disk layout code) in

1.17.2 is an old release, and has been replaced with the 2.0 within
RedHat. This is not a show stopper and it might be fixed, but we cannot
promise any date. Change milestone also to '*ReaR future*'

I think this issue here is the same as
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1884](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1884)  
where the latter should get fixed by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885)  
so that I will close this issue here  
when
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885)
got merged.

Issue \#1885 has been merged. Red Hat is official supporting their
version of rear-2.00.  
We can close this issue here. With the latest RH
**rear-2.00-6.el7.x86\_64** it could be fixed. If not, please submit a
software case at RH
