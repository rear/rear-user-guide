    I'm using rear with TSM.

    The problem is, "rear recover" doesn't run to the end - unexpected ssh disconnects
    occur during the TSM recovery job and rear job goes broken.

    The TSM restore takes most of the time > 60 minutes. 

    Is it possible to run the TSM restore job in the background?

    P.S.
    no other access methods are avaible exept ssh

@geksi just from top of my head, you could try to include `screen` using
`PROGS` configuration variable and start restore inside `screen` ...
