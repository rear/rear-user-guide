@gdha  
I wonder if the currently unconditioned test for /etc/fedora-release  
to skip the linuxefi GRUB module is sufficiently backward compatible  
so that things still work with Fedora before 29?

By Googling for "Grub linuxefi module" I found only  
[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2014-01/msg00120.html](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2014-01/msg00120.html)  
as the best explanation what that Grub linuxefi module is.

By Googling for "GRUB\_USE\_LINUXEFI" (cf. /etc/default/grub) I also
found  
[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2016-08/msg00014.html](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2016-08/msg00014.html)  
which reads (excerpt)

    linuxefi.mod ... I need that for the EFI based boot

so that you may have to test on UEFI systems if things still  
work with older Fedora even without the Grub linuxefi module.

If someone here may know more about it I could only think of

It might very well be, that it is working because
`linuxefi and initrdefi options` might be built in directly into Grub or
might be part of other module, even more interesting is that
`linuxefi and initrdefi options` might be substituted by
`linux and initrd options`

In general I would say that if you can boot ReaR rescue system, you did
not broke anything.

In my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001\#issuecomment-446258448](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2001#issuecomment-446258448),
I was partially right ...  
I've installed Fedora29 and used UEFI boot, my default entry in
*grub.cfg* looked something like this:

    ...
    linux   /vmlinuz-4.19.7-300.fc29.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/fedora-root ro resume=/dev/mapper/fedora-swap rd.lvm.lv=fedora/root rd.lvm.lv=fedora/swap rhgb quiet LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    initrdefi /initramfs-4.19.7-300.fc29.x86_64.img
    ...

However, I've noticed entry for rescue which showed something like this:

    ...
    linux   /vmlinuz-0-rescue-1acdfce117504294b63a270c24b2afc8 root=/dev/mapper/fedora-root ro resume=/dev/mapper/fedora-swap rd.lvm.lv=fedora/root rd.lvm.lv=fedora/swap rhgb quiet
    initrd  /initramfs-0-rescue-1acdfce117504294b63a270c24b2afc8.img
    ...

When I've tried to change *initrdefi* to *initrd* for my default entry,
everything booted just fine.

Apart from all this, *initrdefi* looks to be part **linux.mod** on
Fedora29

    [root@fedora29 x86_64-efi]# grep initrdefi *
    command.lst:initrdefi: linux
    Binary file linux.mod matches

    [root@fedora29 x86_64-efi]# grep linuxefi *
    Binary file chain.mod matches
    command.lst:linuxefi: linux
    Binary file linux.mod matches

So for Fedora 29 it is save to omit linuxefi.mod as it functionality was
moved to linux.mod.

I'll now download Fedora 28 (unfortunately my test Fedora 28 is booting
Legacy BIOS) to check Grub behavior there ...

Will keep you posted.

Every day you learn something new is a good day!  
I just found out that on Fedora 28 you can safely omit *linuxefi.mod*
since it looks to be somehow replaceable by *chain.mod*. This IMHO makes
this PR backward compatible.

I've successfully created UEFI bootloader (*test1.efi*) and booted with
following options:  
**Fedora 28**

    grub2-mkimage -O x86_64-efi -o /boot/efi/EFI/tst/test1.efi -p "/EFI/BOOT" part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal boot configfile linux chain multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs

**Fedora 29**

    grub2-mkimage -O x86_64-efi -o /boot/efi/EFI/tst/test1.efi -p "/EFI/BOOT" part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal boot configfile linux chain jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs

Notice also that on **Fedora 29** I had to drop *multiboot.mod* as it
does not exist on my installation.

@gdha, @rmetrich  
Are you missing */usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/multiboot.mod* as well on
your Fedora 29 ?

I would propose to keep the actual list of modules and modify that as a

directory computation (/usr/lib/grub/$(uname -r)-efi) on Fedora,
different on SuSE ...)

@rmetrich @gozora  
could you post where GRUB modules are located  
on your various systems that you currently can access  
like I did in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996\#issuecomment-446246942](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996#issuecomment-446246942)

@gozora  
regarding the GRUB modules directory e.g.
/usr/lib/grub2/x86\_64-efi/linuxefi.mod  
versus /boot/grub2/x86\_64-efi/linuxefi.mod see my question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996\#issuecomment-446246942](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996#issuecomment-446246942)

If the GRUB modules that are actually used by GRUB when booting  
are in general somewhere under the /boot/ directory it is probably  
much simpler to search for them only in /boot/ by something like

    grub_modules=""
    for grub_module in part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux linuxefi multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs ; do
        test "$( find /boot -type f -name "$grub_module.mod" )" && grub_modules="$grub_modules $grub_module"
    done
    ...
    $gmkimage $v -O x86_64-efi -c $TMP_DIR/mnt/EFI/BOOT/embedded_grub.cfg -o $TMP_DIR/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi -p "/EFI/BOOT" "$grub_modules"

When on Fedora and RHEL (7, 8)  
there are no GRUB modules below /boot/

FYI regarding "what this Grub linuxefi module is":

Sleeping over things always helps :-)

I remember now that I had asked our GRUB maintainer  
about `linuxefi` some time ago and here excerpts  
from my mail and his reply:

    NO. It's a UEFI Secure Boot specfic thing.

    We have to support UEFI Secure Boot
    so we have to use linuxefi as it implemented
    the need verification mechanism via
    shim-lock protocol to loaded the grub2 image ..

    Moreover it leverages the kernel UEFI handover
    protcol to boot the kernel via its own efistub and
    beneficial from kernel bug fixing for firmware issues. ..

    It's not upstreamed for various reasons .. Although
    down-stream distros like SUSE and RedHat already
    used that for a while, upstream is still have problem
    accepting it ..

    Please consider it a standard to boot
    in UEFI Secure Boot for now, until someone
    could convince upstream to include it,
    there no other grub command could be used
    for now in UEFI Secure Boot as Microsoft only
    recongize linuxefi as a they audit the code
    to issue their certifcates for shim loader ... 

Hmmm... somehow this looks very similar to

There is yet another complication. On Fedora 29, it looks like
*multiboot* module is available for Legacy boot but not for UEFI boot:

    [root@fedora29 grub]# pwd
    /usr/lib/grub
    [root@fedora29 grub]# ll
    total 32
    drwxr-xr-x.  4 root root    39 Dec 11 17:31 .
    dr-xr-xr-x. 33 root root  4096 Dec 11 17:16 ..
    drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root 12288 Dec 11 17:15 i386-pc
    drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root  8192 Dec 11 17:31 x86_64-efi
    [root@fedora29 grub]# find . -name "multiboot*"
    ./i386-pc/multiboot.mod
    ./i386-pc/multiboot2.mod

Should user have (for whatever reason) installed Legacy boot modules
next to UEFI modules, output would give false positive for presence of
(at least) *multiboot* module:

    # for grub_module in part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux linuxefi multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs ; do

    > done
    # echo $grub_modules
    part_gpt part_msdos fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo btrfs

Notice *multiboot* module presence, despite it is not available in
x86\_64-efi.

from @gdha indicates that on "fedora29" GRUB modules exist in /boot/  
so that we would not need to search also elsewhere (like in
/usr/lib/grub\*)  
but it contradicts what @rmetrich wrote in

And there is still my question from

where I wonder if the GRUB modules that are actually used when booting  
must be under /boot/ and not elsewhere (like in /usr/lib/grub\*).  
But I don't know how GRUB finds its modules when booting.  
I would like to search in ReaR for GRUB modules at the same place(s)  
where GRUB will look for its modules when booting.

Because we are here in the function build\_bootx86\_efi  
we know we are in the UEFI case here so that we could  
restrict where to search for GRUB modules  
e.g. as a quick and dirty hack additionally check  
that what was found contains 'efi' (ignore case) like

    grub_modules=""
    for grub_module in part_gpt qqq part_msdos QQQ fat ext2 normal chain boot configfile linux linuxefi multiboot jfs iso9660 usb usbms usb_keyboard video udf ntfs all_video gzio efi_gop reboot search test echo qqq btrfs ; do
