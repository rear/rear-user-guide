-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

1.  updated links to Borg documentation
2.  documentation update `lzma,9` to `lzma,6` because according
    `man borg-compression`

<!-- -->

    Giving levels above 6 is pointless and counterproductive because it does 
    not compress better due to the buffer size used by borg 
    but it wastes lots of CPU cycles and RAM.
