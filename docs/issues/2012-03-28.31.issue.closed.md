Original report
---------------

This issue appears in both 1.11 and 1.12 but does not appear in 1.10.

Setup  
Intel machine with RAID5 root disk, (sda) and four paths to a single SAN
LUN, (sdb, sdc, sdd, and sde), presented using multipath, (mpatha). The
device */dev/mapper/mpatha* was partitioned to a single partition,
*/dev/mapper/mpathap1*, and presented to LVM. A single volume group was
create and a single logical volume created. The logical volume was then
formatted as EXT4 and mounter to the system.

ReaR 1.12 was installed and the */etc/rear/local.conf*, (attached), file
was put int place from the original 1.10 installation. (IPs have been
changed to protect the innocent. :-) )

Every time the command 'rear mkbackup' is run, the following is
displayed...

    [root@server ~]# rear mkbackup
