Hi

95\_copy\_result\_files.sh wants to copy files to /var/lib/rear/output
which does not exists on a new system. Consequently the job fails. I
searched the issues but did not found anything, is this by design to not
create the directory, or just went unnoticed until now?

Regards  
Ben

How did you install ReaR?

Please provide the output of "rear dump"

@BenGig it works for me. If you remove rear (via `rpm -e rear`) and
re-install could you verify if the directory `/var/lib/rear` content?

Sorry about the vacation related delay.

After rpm -e rear: /var/lib/rear remained with the three subdirs output,
layout and recovery. I then cleaned up with rm -rf /var/lib/rear.

Reinstalled with yum install rear, the installation created
/var/lib/rear as an empty directory.

I found that configuring OUTPUT=ISO does indeed creates all the
directories necessary. But: the option OUTPUT=PXE is triggering the
problem, I could verify it on RHEL6 and on Fedora 20.
