-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

This is my first time working with ReaR. I'm working with a "test"
system and running through the "rear -v mkrescue" and it appears the iso
is being written but I'm getting three errors or "warning" messages. It
looks like It'd be safe to delete the symlinks in message 1, but I'd
like to verify that it's safe to delete the symlink for message 2, or
does it need to link to a valid grub.cfg file? Does the warning in
message 3 need to be or can it be corrected?

Message 1) Failed to copy all contents of
/lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7.x86\_64 (dangling symlinks could be a
reason)  
Since there the symbolic link point to non-existent files (there are 4
of them).

Message 2) Broken symlink '/etc/grub2.cfg' in recovery system because
'readlink' cannot determine its link target  
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 22 Sep 26 08:37 /etc/grub2.cfg -&gt;
../boot/grub2/grub.cfg  
The target link does not exist, the only thing in /etc/grub2 is grubenv.

Message 3) Did not find /boot/grub2/locale files (minor issue for UEFI
ISO boot)

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Have not tried the recovery yet.

@RLDuckworth Did you already try to boot from the ISO image as a test? I
think it should work.

Good morning,

I was able to boot the ISO image, select Relax-and-Recover (UEFI and
Secure Boot) and it looks like it’s ready to run rear recover. Before I
had been selecting the Relax-and-Recover (BIOS or UEFI without Secure
Boot) and it would not boot.  
Should I be able to boot either one?

I will go ahead and run a rear recover and see what happens. This is all
trial and error right now. Is there a way to determine exactly what
backup will be restored from Rubrik?

We’re making progress. Thanks very much!

Rubrik is an external backup program where I do not have any knowledge
of - sorry.

But should we be able to boot from either menu item - Relax-and-Recover
(UEFI and Secure Boot) or Relax-and-Recover (BIOS or UEFI without Secure
Boot)? I noticed in the ISO creation output, it said Using
'/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi' as UEFI Secure Boot bootloader file
but didn’t say anything about without Secure Boot bootloader file.

You configured it to use **Relax-and-Recover (UEFI and Secure Boot)**,
therefore, that's the way to boot from then.

However, you have a point as well and the ReaR team is aware of it and
it is on our to-do list for improvements. The ISO booting architecture
is 20 years old and need a proper rewrite! However, as always there is a
but, lack of sponsoring, which forces us to lower its priority.

*End users always forget that Open Source contributors need food as well
and that is not free. This is a general remark and is not meant for
you.*

@RLDuckworth  
regarding

    But should we be able to boot from either menu item
    Relax-and-Recover (UEFI and Secure Boot) or
    Relax-and-Recover (BIOS or UEFI without Secure Boot)?

Both items are there because what works on your specific  
replacement hardware (physical or virtual "hardware")  
depends on your specific replacement hardware  
which could be a bit different compared to your  
original hardware so try out what works for you.  
Both may work or only one or even none may work.  
As far as I can imagine what is used to boot  
does not change what later "rear recover" does.

FYI:

My "boilerplate" regarding third-party backup tools:

    In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:

    Usually we at ReaR upstream do not have or use
    third-party backup tools (in particular not if
    a third-party backup tool is proprietary software)
    so usually we cannot reproduce issues with
    third-party backup tools.

    In case of issues with third-party backup tools and ReaR
    we at ReaR upstream can usually do nothing but totally
    depend on contributions and help from those specific users
    who use and know about each specific third-party backup tool.

Hi [jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix),

I really do appreciate your assistance and what you guys do as I
continue learning about this product!

What I'm working with -  
I have two Lenovo SR630's so my hardware is exactly the same. We'll call
them server A (a test server), and Server B (a production server). I'm
fixing to do an in place upgrade from RHEL7 to RHEL8 on server B. My
goal is to be able to create the ReaR ISO on server B, boot it on server
A, and recover the system.

On server A, I'm able to create the ISO, boot the ISO, and recover the
server. All is good.

On server B, I create the ISO and it looks like everything is good and I
should be able to boot it on server A but it will not boot using the
UEFI Secure Boot option (or any option).

I get this error

    No filesystem could mount root, tried:

    Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

I think it's probably a simple issue but I don't understand what it is
just yet. The hardware is the same. The only difference is the firmware
on server B is older than the firmware on server A. Do you think this
could be the part of the issue?  
[rear-.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17335159/rear-.log)

I'm attaching the log file for review / reference.

Thanks very much,  
Randall

@RLDuckworth  
I know nothing about Lenovo SR630 server hardware  
and/or its firmware so I cannot really help  
when the issue depends on that specific  
hardware and/or its firmware.

Did you try out (only as a test) if it perhaps works  
when you disable Secure Boot within the UEFI firmware  
on your test server?  
When it works without Secure Boot you know at least  
that "something related to Secure Boot" is the reason.

When it works to boot the ReaR recovery system  
without Secure Boot on the replacement hardware,  
I think it should work to recreate the system  
with "rear recover" and then shut down the  
ReaR recovery system, re-enable Secure Boot  
within the UEFI firmware of the replacement hardware  
and reboot the recreated system with Secure Boot enabled.

If reboot the recreated system with Secure Boot  
enabled fails, it should (hopefully) at least work,  
to "just reboot" after "rear recover" so that the  
recreated system boots with Secure Boot disabled,  
then in the booted recreated system reinstall its  
bootloader (which hopefully does "the right thing"  
to reinstall its bootloader so that booting will also  
work with Secure Boot enabled), then shut down the system,  
re-enable Secure Boot within the UEFI firmware of the  
replacement hardware and reboot the recreated system  
with Secure Boot enabled.  
If that also fails I am at my wit's end.  
But I am not a booting expert in general  
and even less a UEFI Secure Boot expert.  
Perhaps asking Lenovo or Red Hat for support is then  
the only feasible way out of "UEFI Secure Boot hell"?

For the (not so) fun of it:  
Recently I installed for a friend Linux beside  
the existing Windows on his Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and  
its UEFI firmware (together with Windows) annoyed me  
a lot, but finally - after a terrible fight - I won ;-)  
What I hate with basically all firmware and bootloaders  
that I ever had to do with is that firmware and bootloaders  
do not verbosely tell what is going on when they search  
and load a program and start it e.g. when the firmware  
searches and loads a bootloader like shim or GRUB and  
starts it and then what shim is doing when it searches  
and loads a second stage bootloader like GRUB and then  
what GRUB is doing when it searches and loads initrd  
plus kernel and finally starts the kernel which is the  
first program that verbosely tells what is going on  
but when the kernel fails to start up the root cause is  
usually that one of the steps before had silently failed.  
Either it (somehow) boots or it silently fails somewhere  
without meaningful error message and then one is left alone  
to imagine where and what might have gone wrong and  
to also imagine what the root cause might be :-(

@RLDuckworth  
above I wrote that I would be at my wit's end  
if things also fail with Secure Boot disabled  
but - as always - sleeping on an issue helps  
so I remembered my  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec"  
section in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

It describes a generic way how one could boot  
the ReaR recovery system without the need for  
a proper setup of bootloader stuff (EFI programs  
and first/second stage bootloaders setup)  
within the ReaR recovery system because for  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec"  
only the ReaR recovery system kernel and its  
matching ReaR recovery system initrd is needed.

I was able to get past the boot issue. I had opened a support case with
Red Hat and the support engineer led me to a KB article that  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7010813](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7010813)

Excerpt of the KB -  
Because of the hardware limitation, you must make sure that the initrd
file is as small as possible, to get a chance to be loaded properly. For
this to happen, ReaR must be tuned to limit the number of files embedded
in the initrd.\_

The fix in my case was the MODULES=() stanza added to the local.conf and
rerun mkrescue -d -v. I was then able to boot the ISO. Now I'm on to
attempting the recovery of Server A to Server B which is new hardware.

Thanks very much for your assistance!

@RLDuckworth  
I am confused because in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3324\#issue-2557402429](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3324#issue-2557402429)  
you wrote

    System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact ARM device):
    x86_64

which matches what I see at the Lenovo site about their  
Lenovo SR630 systems that the CPU is Intel Xeon.

In contrast  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7010813](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7010813)  
is about POWER architecture (PPC64LE)  
where it is known that there are rather low limits  
of the maximum size of the initrd, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189)

But - at least as far as I experienced up to now - there  
are no such limits of the maximum size of the initrd  
on x86 compatible architectures like x86\_64.

Yes, my architecture is x86\_64 but the Red Hat engineer suspected  
that it could be the same issue as what was described in

Ah!  
That's interesting.  
It means that also on x86\_64 a ReaR recovery system initrd  
can become so big in practice that it hits certain limits  
how big an initrd can be on x86\_64.

Your initial posting shows

    Created initrd.cgz with gzip default compression (447 MiB) ...

which doesn't look overly huge - in contrast to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2386](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2386)  
where the initrd became falsely far too big (more than 3GB).

By quick "googling" for `initrd maximum size x86` I found  
[https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2015-02/msg00007.html](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2015-02/msg00007.html)  
(dated Feb 2015) which reads (excerpt)

    We have a special application (GNU/Linux 3.4.47, x86_64, BIOS,
    PXE, OpenSuSE  grub2-2.00-1.6.1) that requires large initrds.
    We are approaching the 462M size limit that appears to exist
    on our architecture.

and by "googling" for `GRUB_LINUX_INITRD_MAX_ADDRESS` I found  
[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2019-07/msg00068.html](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2019-07/msg00068.html)  
(dated Jul 2019) which reads (excerpt)

    So 32 bit arm requires kernel + initrd less than 512MB,
    64 bit arm requires kernel + inirrd [sic] less than 32GB.
    If I read the code correctly, booting x86 in efi mode
    the max initrd file allocation is 1GB (0x3fffffff).
    Seems the code is shared for 32 and 64 bit EFI and
    doesn't allow anything more on 64 bit than 32 bit.

I didn't research what the maximum size of the initrd  
is nowadays but it shows that there are some limits  
at least in GRUB is one.  
I don't know what "max initrd file allocation is 1GB"  
means for the actual maximum size of the initrd  
(in particular because 447MiB is much less than 1GB).

Hi Johannes,

I've been able to create the ISO, boot the ISO, and do a simple restore
from Rubrik so I'm going to call it good from here. I do need time to
"absorb" all the material you sent and or mentioned. I mainly wanted to
say thanks for your assistance and for all you guys do.

Thank you so much!  
Randall
