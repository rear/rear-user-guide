Hello,

Just a minor issue to report:  
milestones link
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/milestones))
in the bottom of  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
page is not working. Should be
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones)
:)

regards

Pavol
