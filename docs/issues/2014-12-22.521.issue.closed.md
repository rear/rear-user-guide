Hi

I am experimenting with RedHat EL 7 and thin provisioned LVs. I noticed
that thin provisioned LVs are not supported yet. Is there a plan to add
the support in a future release?

I managed to recover the system with some manual intervention:

-   do a forced restore of the VG (required to restore thin LVs)
-   create a temporary LV for thin Metadata
-   restore thin LV metadata in temporary volume
-   swap thin LV Metadata with restored Metadata in temporary LV
-   activate VG

Seems interesting (from what I read on
[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red\_Hat\_Enterprise\_Linux/6/html/Logical\_Volume\_Manager\_Administration/thinly\_provisioned\_volume\_creation.html](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/thinly_provisioned_volume_creation.html)),
but for the moment there are no plans to get this integrated with rear

No plans so far; no further requests received; can only be done when
serious spondored (paid)
