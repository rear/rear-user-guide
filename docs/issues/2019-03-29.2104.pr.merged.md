    Manually on corresponding hardware (Z83-F Mini PC)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    For eMMC devices strip the trailing "p" in the disk device name,  
    so that during recovery the efibootmgr call will not fail, but
    create an UEFI boot entry.

@fabz5  
from plain looking at the code your changes look o.k. to me.

But currently it looks as if your additional conditional code  
somehow belongs to the `have 'mapper' in devname` case.  
Technically the `elif` makes it separated but  
it doesn't make it look separated,  
cf. "Code must be easy to read" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Therefore I suggest this changed code

    # /dev/sda or /dev/mapper/vol34_part or /dev/mapper/mpath99p or /dev/mmcblk0p
    Disk=$( echo ${Dev%$ParNr} )

    # Strip trailing partition remainders like '_part' or '-part' or 'p'
    # if we have 'mapper' in disk device name:
    if [[ ${Dev/mapper//} != $Dev ]] ; then
        # we only expect mpath_partX  or mpathpX or mpath-partX
        case $Disk in
            (*p)     Disk=${Disk%p} ;;
            (*-part) Disk=${Disk%-part} ;;
            (*_part) Disk=${Disk%_part} ;;
            (*)      Log "Unsupported kpartx partition delimiter for $Dev"
        esac
    fi

    # For eMMC devices the trailing 'p' in the Disk value like /dev/mmcblk0p
    # needs to be stripped, otherwise the efibootmgr call will fail
    # because of a wrong disk device name. See also
    # https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2103
    if [[ $Disk = *'/mmcblk'+([0-9])p ]] ; then
        Disk=${Disk%p}
    fi

to keep the eMMC devices case more clearly separtated  
from the 'mapper' cases and have the `/dev/mmcblk0p` also  
in the comment at `Disk=$( echo ${Dev%$ParNr} )`  
plus a better readable comment for the 'mapper' case.

You are right of course, the coding was a bit sloppy. I guess it was too
late at night when I did this. I will test your suggested changes and
then recommit.

(Facepalm) Sorry. This is not my day. I will fix this.

After learning how to remove commits from pull requests I hope now it is
fine.

@rear/contributors
