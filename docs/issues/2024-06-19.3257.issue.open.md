-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.7

Currently the have the following parameter configured:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=TSM

This creates the iso as well as the grub/efi entry.  
So fine, so good.

On certain systems we want to disable the iso creation.  
How can we achieve this?

@damm620 not sure what you are trying to achieve? Perhaps,
`OUTPUT_URL=null` could help?

I will try this in the coming days, thank you :)

We do not want to have a EFI entry in places where we cannot access it
(e.g. VM in Azure cloud)
