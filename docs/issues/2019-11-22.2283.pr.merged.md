-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Currently, ReaR is using hard-coded set of Grub2 modules for UEFI  
    boot-loader. This patch introduces global GRUB2\_MODULES variable,
    so  
    that user can add or remove modules according his needs.

**Rationale:**  
If one uses `GRUB_RESCUE=y` in `UEFI mode` (yet another nice combination
:-)), *rear.efi* will be created with [different set of
modules](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/4e2a1819d54e0e1a9800a9405907c17253cec7f2/usr/share/rear/output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh#L152)
compared to *BOOTX64.efi*.

It is not so important for user to have possibility to add/remove Grub2
modules to *BOOTX64.efi* because *BOOTX64.efi* serves mainly for ReaR
recovery system and doesn't need to be changed that much. *rear.efi* on
the other hand might need some modification from time-to-time.

In my particular example, I was not able to boot *rear.efi* because I
was using BTRFS on LVM (don't ask me why, I know it is nasty ;-)), and
*rear.efi* was not able to boot because `lvm` module was missing. For
this reason I think there should be possibility to configure what
modules should be included into \*.efi boot-loaders.

I'd like to use this PR as corner stone for my future PR that will unify
way how\_rear.efi\_ and *BOOTX64.efi* are created and what modules are
they using.

Hello, FYI I would like to revisit this code in next few days (try some
of the approaches that I proposed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2199\#issuecomment-518201001](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2199#issuecomment-518201001))

Hello @pcahyna,

I'm happy to accept any solution that will make ReaR rescue system boot
simpler or better, although I don't really believe that it can be done
in any automatic way.

If this PR conflicts in any way with your work, I can of course withdraw
it. Just let me know.

@gozora  
could you also describe in default.conf more explicitly  
where the `Grub2 based UEFI boot loader` is used.

At least I get almost always confused about which bootloader  
this or that bootloader related stuff in ReaR is about.

Is it the bootloader of the ReaR recovery system  
or the bootloader of the recreated target system  
or both?

As far as I see in this case the build\_bootx86\_efi function  
is only called in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
which indicates in this case the `Grub2 based UEFI boot loader`  
is (only) the bootloader of the ReaR recovery system.

Hello @jsmeix,

Many thanks for your review!  
I've adapted PR according your request and added some extra bit ;-).

When time allows, I'll do some additional cleaning in
[100\_create\_efiboot.sh](https://github.com/gozora/rear/blob/grub_modules/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh)
which is another spot where Grub2 module set is hard coded.

My promised PR is \#2293, please review. One thing that it changes from
this PR is that it makes GRUB2\_MODULES a bash array.  
@gozora I believe that the added autodetection in \#2293 fixes your case
"In my particular example, I was not able to boot rear.efi because I was
using BTRFS on LVM (don't ask me why, I know it is nasty ;-)), and
rear.efi was not able to boot because lvm module was missing." without
the need of setting anything special in GRUB2\_MODULES, please try it if
you want.  
I haven't looked yet at 100\_create\_efiboot.sh .
