Original report
---------------

I just tried to make the ISO of an RHEL x64 6.2 Installation with ReaR
version 1.12. But during the execution of `rear mkbackup` I always get
the following error:

    [root@ws11 tmp]# rear -d mkbackup

The same procedure with version 1.11 does work. We use IBM Tivoli as
Backup solution.

The error log reports a file duplication ...:

What could be the problem here?

The original report on Sourceforge at

contains a lot more details.

What is happening here is this:

    [dag@moria test]$ vim a.txt
    [dag@moria test]$ ln -sf a.txt b.txt
    [dag@moria test]$ cp -a a.txt b.txt
    cp: `a.txt' and `b.txt' are the same file

The reason this is happening is because both file's device and inode are
the same (the device and inode of the symlink are those of the file):

    [dag@moria test]$ stat --printf '%n %D %i\n' a.txt
    a.txt fd02 1705409
    [dag@moria test]$ stat --printf '%n %D %i\n' b.txt
    b.txt fd02 1705408
    [dag@moria test]$ stat -L --printf '%n %D %i\n' b.txt
    b.txt fd02 1705409

Which means that cp is dereferencing TARGET.

Why the symlink already exists, that is the real question, I thought the
list of files to copy would be sort'd/uniq'd. Either we prevent the same
file to be copied twice, or we check if the file already exists (and
points to the same file). If not, error out...

Or we could simply use:

    cp -a --remove-destination a.txt b.txt

or

    cp -au a.txt b.txt

OK, after talking this through with Jeroen, we understand what is
happening and the cause of the issue is that /usr/bin is a symlink to
/bin. Let me explain:

-   If a binary file in /opt is symlinked to both /bin and /usr/bin, our
    copying will first copy the symlink in /bin and then the symlink in
    /usr/bin, since /usr/bin is a symlink to bin we are replacing two
    identical symlinks (and we are dereferencing both SOURCE and
    TARGET), **BOOM** same file
-   Imagine a binary file in /bin that is symlinked to /usr/bin, our
    copying will first copy the original file to /bin, and then the
    symlink in /usr/bin, since /usr/bin is a symlink to /bin we are
    trying to replace the real file with a symlink (to itself). **BOOM**
    same file

The exact same thing happens for /lib and /usr/lib, which is what we
believe are seeing here. Which means that none of the proposed solutions
would actually help:

-   we cannot remove the destination, because we might replace a binary
    with a symlink to itself
-   we cannot update the file (if newer) because the original could be
    the symlink, not the real file
-   we cannot harmonize (sort -u) the complete list of files, because
    those files look unique but are not because of the
    /bin-and-/usr/bin-symlink

Which brings us to the heart of the matter: **Why are we symlinking
/usr/bin to /bin and /usr/lib to /lib ?**

Maybe we should leave the merge of /bin, /lib and /usr up to the
distribution and is it better to leave everything as it is working on
the system ?

Hi,

as the one who originally decided upon the file structure in the
rescue  
system I can try to shed some light on the history...

Thanks for analyzing this, I concur that this sound like the likely
root  
cause.

Back then we found that different distros spread the binaries a little
bit  
differntly through /bin and /usr/bin. Instead of faithfully copying that
I  
decided to unify everything into /bin and /lib and symlink all other  
locations to support software that uses hard-coded paths. Back then
this  
decision significantly simplified the code.

Maybe we should revisit this decision and think about faithfully
cloning  
the source OS. Maybe it is enough to simply not fail ReaR if cp meets
the  
same file and rely on cp to dereference symlinks. That way we could
keep  
our simplified rescue root.

I would say that the final decision is up to those who write the code
and  
validate it...

We have moved this issue to Rear v1.15 milestone since it has worked for
so long without any issues. Since a change to the core of Rear is
something that needs to be well tested, we will wait until we have the
automated testing infrastructure (Rear v1.14) in place so we can see
what the effect is of our changes on the various supported and tested
distributions.

So while I would like to see this fixed asap, let's make sure we get our
priorities right.

Be aware that in Fedora 17 /bin is a symlink to /usr/bin (so fedora
reversed the logic). In rear we keep the symlink to /bin and create
other directories if required. That piece of code has already been
changed (especially for F17)
