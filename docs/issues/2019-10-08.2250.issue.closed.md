@Ronjr21  
please attach both a `rear -D mkrescue/mkkbackup`

The code that fails in the ReaR recovery system is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh\#L50](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050_start_required_nfs_daemons.sh#L50)

    # check that RPC portmapper service is available and wait for it as needed
    # on some systems portmap/rpcbind can take some time to be accessible
    # hence 5 attempts each second to check that RPC portmapper service is available
    for attempt in $( seq 5 ) ; do
        # on SLES11 and on openSUSE Leap 42.1 'rpcinfo -p' lists the RPC portmapper as
        #   program vers proto   port  service
        #    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
        #    100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper
        rpcinfo -p 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'portmapper' && { attempt="ok" ; break ; }
        sleep 1
    done
    test "ok" = $attempt || Error "RPC portmapper '$portmapper_program' unavailable."

@Ronjr21  
therefore I would like to know what on your original system  
the following command outputs:

    rpcinfo -p

Perhaps the above code that checks if RPC portmapper service is
available  
does no longer work on Debian 10 and needs to be adapted.  
I do not use Debian so I cannot try out or verify things on Debian.

You could also try out if "rear recover" works when you disable the
error exit  
in that above code that checks if RPC portmapper service is available  
by replacing in your  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh  
the line

    test "ok" = $attempt || Error "RPC portmapper '$portmapper_program' unavailable."

by

    test "ok" = $attempt || LogPrint "RPC portmapper '$portmapper_program' unavailable."

so that it does no longer error out here.

Changes made to 050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh as suggested, but
there is error on creating disk layout on LVM now, attached debug log.

I think the LVM problem may be related to \#2222 (you are using a thin
pool).

@Ronjr21  
thank you for your prompt reply and  
@pcahyna  
thank you for having a look regarding LVM  
(I am basically a LVM noob).

@Ronjr21  
regarding LVM thin pool something is already fixed  
in current ReaR GitHub master code.  
Perhaps those fixes are already sufficient in your case  
so that you should try out if things work for you  
with current ReaR GitHub master code,  
see "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" at

Curently I have no idea why

    rpcinfo -p 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'portmapper'

does not succeed with zero exit code  
but the same seems to work on the original system  
according to the `rpcinfo -p` output there  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2250\#issuecomment-540952665](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2250#issuecomment-540952665)

@Ronjr21  
could you additionally change in your  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh  
the line

        rpcinfo -p 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'portmapper' && { attempt="ok" ; break ; }

to

        rpcinfo -p | tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE | grep -q 'portmapper' && { attempt="ok" ; break ; }

and re-run `rear -D recover` and attach its new debug log file here.

@Ronjr21  
thanks for your prompt
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3717145/rear-prx6-done.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3717145/rear-prx6-done.log)

Therein is now (excerpts)

    + source /usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050_start_required_nfs_daemons.sh
    ...
    ++ for attempt in $( seq 5 )
    ++ rpcinfo -p
    ++ tee -a /var/log/rear/rear-prx6.log
    ++ grep -q portmapper
    rpcinfo: can't contact portmapper: RPC: Remote system error - Connection refused
    ++ sleep 1

which nicely shows why in general `2>/dev/null` is unhelpful  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#discussion\_r282784504](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#discussion_r282784504)  
because it needlessly suppresses error messages in the log  
that would be helpful to see that something fails.

Currently I do not know why in this particular case  
`rpcinfo` fails in the ReaR recovery system with

    rpcinfo: can't contact portmapper: RPC: Remote system error - Connection refused

@Ronjr21  
thank you for the feedback that now things work for you.

Could you describe in more detail what you actually changed  
to make it work for you?  
I would be interested to see if we could improve things in ReaR  
so that such issues could be avoided in general in the future.

What did you do regarding the LVM thin pool issue?

Did you perhaps find out why in your particular case  
`rpcinfo` fails in the ReaR recovery system or do you  
just ignore that?

@jsmeix LVM thin partition is removed from source server as we do not
intend to use it. FYI we are trying ReaR bare metal backup on Proxmox 6.
As for rpcinfo I just ignore it. Server is able to obtain backup files
from NFS during recovery.
