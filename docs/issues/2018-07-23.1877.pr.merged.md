-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now the `Error` function shows the last 5 lines of stdout and stderr
messages  
of the called programs on the user's terminal that should hopefully  
make the root cause of an error exit more obvious to the user  
without the need to analyze the log file in any case.

Additionally I adapted output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh  
to provide a better Error function text that now talks about  
`Failed to create ... directory under the mounted network filesystem share`.

As always sleeping over it improved things.

With my recent commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877/commits/32525a172ec580cdeed09ce5e7c4221e2c31ab68](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877/commits/32525a172ec580cdeed09ce5e7c4221e2c31ab68)  
I canged what log messages are show  
from only the normal stdout and stderr messages of the last called
programs  
to all latest log messages (including stdout and stderr of the called
programs)  
but only from the last called script (except 'set -x' low-level debug
lines).

Reason:  
I assume that for the user it is more helpful to see  
the latest log plus stdout and stderr messages  
but those only from the last called script  
compared to see only stdout and stderr messages  
but also from previous scripts  
because I think messages from previous scripts  
may cause more confusion than help.

Things can look bad in debugscripts mode (e.g. `rear -D mkrescue`)  
when it aborts with BugError (then it greps useless lines from the
log)  
I like to fix that...

With my latest commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877/commits/111bb691ff19bf2cf54c9aada71e488ee2b853d9](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877/commits/111bb691ff19bf2cf54c9aada71e488ee2b853d9)  
things look o.k. even in case of BugError function i.e. when the Error
function is called  
multi line messages and debugscripts mode is used.

To simulate BugError I changed in
output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh

<pre>
Error "Failed to create ...

to

<pre>
BugError "Failed to create ...

@rear/contributors  
now things look o.k. to me  
so that I would like to merge it soon  
if there are no objections.

As far as I see there cannot be real regressions because  
it should be all only about what messages are shown.

It still does not work as expected when the Error function  
is called with a multi line error message like

<pre>
Error "Failed to
create '$OUTPUT_PREFIX' directory
under the mounted
network filesystem share"
</pre>

I think I have already a fix which is even simpler than before...

As always sleeping over it one more time improved things one more time.

Still not working as good as I like it because sometimes Error or
BugError  
is not called in an actual script but in a lib/whatever-functions.sh  
and then the current implementation shows whatever-functions.sh  
but I like to show the actually last sourced script to the user  
because I think the latter is much more helpful for the user.

I think I have already a fix which is not simpler but more
straightforward than before...

By the way I also simplified all 'rear -d -D ...' to 'rear -D ...'  
because since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1577](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1577)  
the 'debugscript mode' ( '-D' ) automatically also sets 'debug mode' (
'-d' )  
and 'verbose mode' ( '-v' ).
