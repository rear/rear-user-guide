I would rather see that verbose output in the log and enjoy the periodic
XXX MB stored messages that are now hidden in the quickly scrolling
rsync output.

Yes, I fixed this one. It should auto-close with the merge.

@gdha according to
[https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
"fixes" also should work, together with a lot of other common words.

@schlomo @gdha  
I cannot find any of the commits  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ae30d617ec4048a3c0a3943844528d0e920eff73](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ae30d617ec4048a3c0a3943844528d0e920eff73)

in a current "git clone
[https://github.com/rear/rear.git](https://github.com/rear/rear.git)"  
but I can find the last commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2b40e0fa845ef5e29184c5ec356bcd469790ec83](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2b40e0fa845ef5e29184c5ec356bcd469790ec83)  
in the schlomo-2017-06 branch but not yet in the master branch.  
To get the issue fixed in ReaR 2.2 the schlomo-2017-06 branch  
would need to be merged into the master branch.

@schlomo @jsmeix sorry I must have been confused with the mails I got
(not used to work with branches within rear master itself)

I think it depends on what we think  
which exact conditions must be fulfilled  
to set an issue as 'closed'.

On the one hand the fix is there (in the schlomo-2017-06 branch)  
but on the other hand the fix is not yet normally available  
for ReaR users who use the current GitHub master code  
via 'git clone' as described on relax-and-recover.org

I think an issue could be 'closed' when the fix is in a branch  
but I think to set an issue to 'fixed/solved/done' the fix  
must be available as usual in the master branch.

FYI:  
At openSUSE we have the same kind of problem with bugfixes:  
When a Bugzilla bug entry is closed as "fixed" it means  
a fix was submitted into whatever appropriate project  
but that does not mean the fix is available for the users.

@jsmeix good point. I think if we "just" use GitHub it all works out
well:

-   A user creates an issue
-   Somebody creates a fix and closes the issue in the commit message
-   As soon as this commit is merged into master, the issue will auto
    close

As a result the user gets all the feedback he needs. And the issue is
only closed when the fix is actually in master and available in the next
release or snapshot build.
