Hello, I'm trying REAR considering to meke my default BACKUP SOFTWARE.
I'm non a professional but usually I can get by using computer.  
THAt's my issue: I installed REAR and configured confif file this way

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="nfs://192.168.0.20/ServerNFS"

I have a NFS server running under openmediavault at 192.168.0.20 ad a
shared folder named ServerNSF

Anytime I try to run rear -v mkbackup it terminates with this error

ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime
192.168.0.20:/ServerNFS /tmp/rear.amNNbHNL0kIW3gr/outputfs' failed.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advice

Massimo from Italy

Really hard to say from the info you have provided. First and foremost,
try to check/provide `/var/log/rear/rear-uefi.log` for more
information.  
My best guess would be that there is something wrong with your NFS
server setup. If log file does not provide any reasonable information,
try to trigger mount command separately:  
`mkdir -p /tmp/rear_test && mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime 192.168.0.20:/ServerNFS /tmp/rear_test`

Output from command `showmount -e 192.168.0.20` can help you to see what
is actually exported from your NFS server.

Check your NFS exports file:

    $ cat /etc/exports
    /exports 192.168.122.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)

Users usually forget about the default setting `root_squash`, which
disallow root (of the client system) to write on the exported file
system.

Thank you very much for the fast answer. I appreciate that.  
I agree that my NFS server configuration must be wrong...  
Being non familiar with NFS, I moved to SAMBA, than I know certainly
better.

on my NASLEGAL with static IP adress 192.168.0.20 I creater a shared  
folder named sambauser  
and an user with the same name sambauser

I tred with this /etc/rear/local.conf

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=cifs://NASLEGAL/sambashare

and also trying with IP NAS address

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=cifs://192.168.0.20/SAMBASHARE

configuring also the //etc/rear/.cifs file as follows

username=sambauser  
password=xxxxxxxxxxxxx  
domain=WORKGROUP

I keep having this at rear-LaMiaNuvola.log (LaMia Nuvola is my Ubuntu  
Server name)

Hello, I forgot: seeing in the log file that the mount command in
dosing  
with a "guest" name, I gave to the SAMBA folder the GUESTS
permissions.  
Same result....  
Thanks

@maxbur1960 no reason to be desperate ;-).  
Despite I'm not running ReaR on CIFS anywhere, I've took a quick look
into ReaR
[docu](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc#using-netfs-as-backup-strategy-internal-archive-method):

Do you have `BACKUP_OPTIONS` variable set correctly? (e.g.)

    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"

Hello, sorry for bothering you.  
After the changes you suggested me, now Ubuntu Server stacks on this
message

Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git  
Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-LaMiaNuvola.log  
Creating disk layout

and doesn't go further.

In I CTRL-C the backup I get nolog

But If I try to access via command line to the SAMBA SHARED FOLDER with

smbclient //server/share -U user%password

I have access granted and I can read and write files with no problems at
all.

I'm beginning to think that REAR and its awsome feature are beyond my
possibility.

Thanks in advice for answering

Massimo

sometimes it it takes a while (couple of minutes) until layout/boot ISO
is created.  
Are you sure you just wasn't too hasty with ^C ?

@maxbur1960 Use rear with verbose option to see what is happening:

    rear -v mkbackup

Hello, now with SAMBA/CIFS it works!  
Is it a good protocol standard or have I to study NFS until I can get  
by? Since now with NFS it semms to fail 'cause is unable to mkdir to
the  
"rsync destination".  
Mistery... Sound Japanese to me!  
Anyway, I'll give a try to REAR and hope I can use as my Backup. In
case  
I'll make for sure a donation, that is not enought to pay your help,
but  
is a simple way to tell THANK YOU.  
I'll keep in touch.  
See you

Hello Massimo,

Samba vs NFS is a matter of view. I personally prefer NFS as it is
easier to configure, have better performance and permission/user
mappings are not pain in the a\*\* (however it have lot of cons as
well). You can certainly find lot of pages on the Internet, comparing
all pros and cons of both protocols, so the decision is yours ;-)

I'm happy that it works for you finally.

Good luck with your further studies!

Vlado
