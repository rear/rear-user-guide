When using the following configuration:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://nas02/rear/

Rear asks for a password, while it should not ask for one (or at least
it should try first without).

For NETFS\_URL we supported additional options and had an example that
would  
use credentials=<file> for this purpose... Maybe we should clone this
for  
OUTPUT\_URL as well?

Ok, I am confused. I would like to put the ISO image onto a CIFS share.
I assumed the above configuration would in fact do that. However when
looking in *output/ISO/Linux-i386/90\_transfer\_image.sh* the statement
**\# The ISO has already been transferred by NETFS.** assumes that I am
using NETFS (?).

So I wondered, should I have used **OUTPUT=NETFS** instead ? But that
leads to:

    [root@moria rear]# rear -v -D mkrescue
    Relax and Recover 1.13.0 / $Date$
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-moria.log
    ERROR: You must specify either BACKUP_URL or BACKUP_MOUNTCMD and BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD !
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-moria.log for details
    Finished in 1 seconds

Which in itself is very strange too, since I ran **rear mkrescue** so it
shouldn't bother me about any BACKUP configuration. (BACKUP= is in fact
empty)

If I then change it to add *unwanted* BACKUP variables:

    OUTPUT=NETFS
    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://nas02/rear/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://nas02/rear/

This happens:


    [root@moria rear]# rear -v -D mkrescue
    Relax and Recover 1.13.0 / $Date$
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-moria.log
    Creating disk layout
    Creating root FS layout
    Copy files and directories
    Copy binaries and libraries
    Copying kernel modules
    Checking udev
    Create initramfs
    Password: 
    Copying resulting files to cifs location
    ERROR: Could not copy usage file to cifs location
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-moria.log for details
    Finished in 50 seconds
    Terminated

So it doesn't work as expected, and I don't even know whether I am doing
it correctly either...

I think the OUTPUT\_URL stuff is not complete and that we need to enable
it  
to use more code from NETFS\_URL e.g. to support mount options.

So the following configuration did what I wanted:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=cifs://nas02/rear/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://nas02/rear/

Although I was only interested in having the rescue environment on the
CIFS share using *rear mkrscue*. What is weird is that the BACKUP=NETFS
part seems to have taken care of copying my OUTPUT file to the
OUTPUT\_URL ?

So conclusion:

-   Using cifs:// makes Rear ask for a password (even on public shares)
-   Using cifs:// in OUTPUT\_URL requires a BACKUP=NETFS to work !?!
-   Command *rear mkrescue* requires a BACKUP\_URL (anything really)
    even if an OUTPUT\_URL is defined

I am convinced now that we need to reassess how this is supposed to
work.

Another weirdness is that if I do not specify an OUTPUT\_URL in the
above example, my rear output on screen says:

    Excluding component fs:/var

I don't seen a connection there...

@schlomo You are right, the documentation does not mention CIFS or NFS
support for OUTPUT\_URL. Although it happens to work if you push the
right knobs...

What do you think of:  
If OUTPUT\_URL is set, then
"./output/ISO/Linux-i386/90\_transfer\_image.sh" should do the work. If
not, then the chosen BACKUP workflow cares about transferring the image.

I moved the discussion wrt. the current OUTPUT\_URL and BACKUP\_URL mess
to issue \#37. So that this issue only relates to the CIFS password
issue.

When we have defined a `BACKUP=NETFS` method and we also defined a
`BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path` then a setting like
`BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"` will make sure that no
credential will be asked.

I guess we only need to check the BACKUP\_URL and BACKUP\_OPTIONS and
making it not dependent of a BACKUP method. This way we can easily use
the same code for the OUTPUT\_URL.

The bottom line is I'm in favor of using a credential definition (file).

I guess the expectation for a **public** share is that you don't need
credentials, and thus not need a credential definition file.

Isn't putting your backups on a *public* share setup for failure? I
actually don't understand what is bad about the credentials file...

@schlomo That is not the point, this obviously was part of me testing
the CIFS code internally (triggering more than one issue). But it does
make sense to put the recovery images on a "public" share. (Or at least
a share that has certain ACLs set to not require a password)

BTW There is nothing bad about a credentials file per se, except maybe
if you have no need for credentials ? What do you put in the credentials
file for a public share ? Do we leave it empty ? Do we add empty values
? Do we add something that's not used ? It does not seem very obvious
and need to be fixed or documented...

Also, it's not because I open a ticket that it should get the highest
priority or that it requires someone to fix it in their own time. Issues
are listed so someone who does think it is valuable to fix, can look
into it. Or as a reference to others with a similar problem to chime in.
Or so we do not forget about it.

With the default `,guest` option my `cred=` option is broken:

    2012-06-25 12:17:21 ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -o cred=/home/gdha/projects/rear/rear-1.13.0/etc/rear/.cifs.phist,guest //hpx189.ncsbe.eu.jnj.com/phist /tmp/rear.d5jqHyre7SMb0CL/outputfs' failed.

To be honest for security reason I would not add `guest` option to cifs.
Is it possible to revert this change?

it works with guest also. I leave it this way...

Hello,

I can not mount the cifs target. The command from gdha:

> With the default ,guest option my cred= option is broken:

When i remove the guest parameter from global\_functions.sh it works.
