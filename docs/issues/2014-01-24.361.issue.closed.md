Sometimes upgrading rear is not quite successful (e.g. rear-1.10 to
rear-1.15) and frankly doesn't work.  
Also referring to issue \#355 where old traces of rear screwed up a
successful run.  
Perhaps, we need to foresee a pre-install section to clean up the
/usr/share/rear part?

We should not just wipe /usr/share/rear because users might have added  
their own customizations (as we also advice them to do).

Better to have a %pre that specifically deals with known problems.

OK, good idea. We should list up what must be removed:

1.  output/NETFS directory is obsolete  
    other items?
