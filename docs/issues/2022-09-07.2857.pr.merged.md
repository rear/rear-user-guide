@gdha @pcahyna  
I would also like to clean up the indentation in  
output/PXE/default/810\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh  
and likely some more "cosmetic" code changes.

Personally I would "just do it by the way"  
together with this pull request.  
Would this be a problem for you?

@pcahyna  
I think I remember that you prefer separated  
pull requests for "cosmetic" code changes  
which is clearly the more accurate procedure  
from a revision control system point of view.

In contrast usually I do "cosmetic" code changes  
"just by the way" while I am working on some code  
because separated pull requests for "cosmetic" changes  
is duplicate administrative work (two times editing same files  
plus two times the revision control system related work)  
but usually I don't find time for anything more than  
what is really needed so usually I would not do any  
"cosmetic" changes as a separated additional task.

I think what could be a good compromise for me  
are "cosmetic" changes as a separated commits  
but all together within one same pull request.

@jsmeix No problem at all.

@gdha @pcahyna  
I cleaned up output/PXE/default/810\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2857/commits/a634c44d679a7005fa3585862d009d879c32bf10](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2857/commits/a634c44d679a7005fa3585862d009d879c32bf10)  
so I would appreciate it if you could have a look (as time permits)  
if you spot obvious mistakes because of my cleanup changes.

@pcahyna @rear/contributors
