Currently we support the following syntax for `BACKUP=RSYNC` workflow:

    #### rear needs a destination path which is the SRC (or DST)
    # BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST:PATH                   # using ssh (no rsh)
    # with rsync protocol PATH is a MODULE name defined in remote /etc/rsyncd.conf file
    # BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST::PATH                  # using rsync
    # BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using rsync

However, the `OUTPUT_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST/PATH` only support our
general syntax (the same rules as in our NETFS stuff). By the way, the
`OUTPUT_URL` only supports the *ssh* rule (of *rsync*).  
This is confusing, and therefore, perhaps we better simplify it to NETFS
rules?  
Suggestions?

I would suggest a similar structure as subversion:  
rsync://\[USER@\]HOST\[:PORT\]/PATH \# rsync protocol  
rsync+ssh://\[USER@\]HOST\[:PORT\]/PATH \# rsync over ssh protocol  
Seems much clearer to me.

Worth adding, that `BACKUP=RSYNC` and protocol set as `ssh://` would
also use *ssh* as *rsync* protocol.

I like @wdpoorte suggestion. I could even imagine just `rsync://...` and
rear will try both *ssh* & *rsync* protocol, which ever works first.

I think the URL should not differ from rsync Usage:  
Usage:  
rsync \[OPTION\]... SRC \[SRC\]... \[USER@\]HOST:DEST  
rsync \[OPTION\]... SRC \[SRC\]... \[USER@\]HOST::DEST  
rsync \[OPTION\]... SRC \[SRC\]... rsync://\[USER@\]HOST\[:PORT\]/DEST

The ':' usages connect via remote shell, while '::' & 'rsync://' usages
connect  
to an rsync daemon, and require SRC or DEST to start with a module name.

BACKUP=RSYNC  
BACKUP\_URL=\[user\]@host:path \# using the SSH protocol  
BACKUP\_URL=\[user\]@host::path \# using the RSYNC protocol  
BACKUP\_URL=rsync://\[user\]@host/path \# using the RSYNC protocol  
BACKUP\_URL=rsync://\[user\]@host\[:port\]::path \# using the RSYNC
protocol

The `RSYNC` backup method is the only one in rear not following our
`BACKUP_URL` methodology using a `scheme` keyword, and that is
confusing. We should align this and follow our own standards.

From `duplicity` man-page:

      rsync://user[:password]@other.host[:port]::/module/some_dir
      rsync://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/relative_path
      rsync://user[:password]@other.host[:port]//absolute_path

or,  
*using rsync daemon* :
`rsync://user[:password]@host.com[:port]::[/]module/some_dir`  
*using rsync over ssh (only key auth)* :
`rsync://user@host.com[:port]/[relative|/absolute]_path`

@pavoldomin using only the scheme keyword `ssh` for *RSYNC over ssh* is
not a good idea as within `duplicity` `ssh` is a synonym for `scp`

@wdpoorte I do like the idea to also foresee *using rsync over ssh (only
key auth)* :
`rsync+ssh://user@host.com[:port]/[relative|/absolute]_path`

We should keep the current RSYNC definitions (at least 'till version
1.17) to avoid breaking current customers settings.

We redesigned script `prep/RSYNC/default/10_check_rsync.sh` to accept
the following:

    #### OLD STYLE:
    # BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST:PATH           # using ssh (no rsh)
    #
    # with rsync protocol PATH is a MODULE name defined in remote /etc/rsyncd.conf file
    # BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST::PATH          # using rsync

    #### NEW STYLE:
    # BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using ssh
    # BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]::/PATH  # using rsync

We still need to adapt the documentation for the updated standard.
