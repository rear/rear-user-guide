REAR: 2.5  
SLES4SAP: SLES12 SP2

hi,

trying to recover a SLES4SAP System with Multipah SAN Setup fails
because the diskrestore script  
passes a wrong argument to parted. Following is the setup:

1.  Multipath SAN setup
2.  SLES4SAP installation with regular partitioning Sheme, no LVM is
    used for OS installation

The recovery of the first partition is OK, however, during the Second
Partition  
it passes the name of the Partition to the parted call and not the
partition  
type (primary/logical):

    +++ parted -s /dev/mapper/mpatha mkpart ''\''mpatha-part2'\''' 268435456B 107374165503B
    parted: invalid token: mpatha-part2
    Error: Expecting a partition type

This can be work arounded by editing the diskrestore.sh and then
recovery works.  
Not sure if this is a known issue. What logfiles would be needed?  
As the Logfiles are related to a System whose internal Configuration  
should not be publlic, what Informations are needed?

Probably is an already known issue and was fixed already?

In the layout file following is to be seen:

    multipath /dev/mapper/MYOS 107374182400 /dev/sda,/dev/sdae,/dev/sdak,/dev/sdaq,/dev/sdg,/dev/sdm,/dev/sds,/dev/sdy
    part /dev/mapper/MYOS 251658240 16777216 primary boot /dev/mapper/OS-part1
    part /dev/mapper/MYOS 107105730048 268435456 rear-noname none /dev/mapper/OS-part2

So it probably seems the "rear-noname" is the issue already?

@abbbi  
in general when full debug log files cannot be provided because  
the user's system "internal" configuration should not be public  
(what is "internal" configuartion - e.g. comparted to "external"?)  
there is perhaps not much what we at ReaR upstream can do  
so that you or the user may have to report his issue directly  
to SUSE provided you or the user have an appropriate support  
contract, cf. "SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Nevertheless perhaps we can help:

Because you have the "old" `multipath` syntax in disklayout.conf
before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/793d096a61b97334a2e9c3ac62077c7926ef41cf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/793d096a61b97334a2e9c3ac62077c7926ef41cf)  
I would first and foremost recommend to try out if things  
behave better with our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code,  
cf. "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

When you try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
you need to do both `rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup` and then  
`rear -D recover` to use the new `multipath` syntax in disklayout.conf.

When you cannot try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do both `rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup` and then `rear -D recover`  
and inspect the debug log files regarding `rear-noname` to find out  
what goes on in relation to that.

The fallback value `rear-noname` appears in those scripts

-   usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
    that is run during `rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup`
-   usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
    that is run during `rear -D recover`

In our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh\#L170](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh#L170)  
we have this comment

    # But on s390 'parted mkpart fs-type start end' requires a valid file system type
    # so that the above fallback type="rear-noname" that gets during "rear recover"
    # replaced with $(basename "$partition") via 100_include_partition_code.sh
    # does not work on s390 and lets parted fail with "invalid token",
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494742554
    #   +++ parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart ''\''dasda1'\''' 98304B 314621951B
    #   parted: invalid token: dasda1
    #   Error: Expecting a file system type.
    # Therefore we use a hardcoded fixed file system type 'ext2' as dummy for 'parted' which works
    # because the real file systems are set up afterwards via 'mkfs' commands during "rear recover"
    # and also YaST uses a fixed 'ext2' dummy file system type for 'parted mkpart' on s390,
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494813151

which is about IMB Z (a.k.a. "s390") but it seems to be about  
the same kind of issue where parted fails in the same way.

I can confirm that after replacing

    part /dev/mapper/MYOS 107105730048 268435456 rear-noname none /dev/mapper/OS-part2

with

    part /dev/mapper/MYOS 107105730048 268435456 primary none /dev/mapper/OS-part2

in the disklayout.conf, the recovery works without issue. I do currently
not have the debug log from mkrescue, i will try to get it for you.
Using master is out of scope currently unfortunately :)  
OS is on Intel, so no special Power or S390.

@abbbi  
also check and report what kind of partitioning type  
is used on the affected disk, e.g. provide the

    parted -s /dev/XXX unit MiB print

output. If it shows "Partition Table: gpt" you may need recent fixes
like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/793d096a61b97334a2e9c3ac62077c7926ef41cf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/793d096a61b97334a2e9c3ac62077c7926ef41cf)

@jsmeix

On the system in question, the parted command does not print any type of
information (primary or logical) for the partition in question,..:

> /dev/mapper/OS:107GB:dm:512:512:gpt:Linux device-mapper
> (multipath):;  
> 1:16.8MB:268MB:252MB:fat16:primary:boot;  
> 2:268MB:107GB:107GB:btrfs::;

so probably the issue is related and already fixed with the newer commit
you mentioned.

@abbbi  
your parted's "machine parseable output" in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2319\#issuecomment-577088441](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2319#issuecomment-577088441)  
is hard to read for me (because - surprise - I am human - not a machine
;-)

I would prefer to get human readable output as in

    parted -s /dev/XXX unit MiB print

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2319\#issuecomment-576738628](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2319#issuecomment-576738628)

For comparison how things look for me on my openSUSE 15.0 system:

    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print

    Model: ATA WDC WD10EZEX-75M (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 953870MiB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags: 

    Number  Start      End        Size       File system     Name  Flags
     1      1.00MiB    501MiB     500MiB     fat16                 boot, esp
     2      501MiB     937911MiB  937410MiB  ext4
     3      937911MiB  953870MiB  15959MiB   linux-swap(v1)        swap

and I get the same formatting also on SLES12 and older versions.

Because in your partitioning info in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2319\#issuecomment-577088441](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2319#issuecomment-577088441)  
I can decipher `gpt` I think you need (at least) our recent  
ReaR upstream fixes for multipath with GPT disks.

What is the reason why you cannot try out our  
current ReaR upstream GitHub master code as described in  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"  
at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
I.e. what is the reason why you cannot

    ... have several ReaR versions in parallel
    each one in its own separated directory
    without conflicts between each other
    and without conflicts with a normally
    installed ReaR version via RPM package

?
