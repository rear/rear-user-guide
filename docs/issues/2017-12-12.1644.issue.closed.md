    we see issues with serial ttyS0 on ubuntu16 and with fedora26

**fedora 26** had the following issue with a recover VM that contains a
serial console (libvirt)(timeout after a couple of minutes), but
afterwards everything seems normal:

**fedora26** *without* a serial console has the following problem:

    Dec 12 15:23:37 fedora agetty[525]: /dev/ttyS0: not a tty
    Dec 12 15:23:40 fedora kernel: random: crng init done

    Dec 12 15:23:47 fedora agetty[528]: /dev/ttyS0: not a tty

**ubuntu 16.04** : The serial ttyS0 is getting re-spawned continuously.
The test VM has no serial ttyS0 defined (in virtual box). We see the
same messages as we saw in fedora26.

Has to do with \#878 and PR \#1615 - @didacog is aware of the issue and
is looking into it.

@gdha

I've already tested with StartLimitBurst but it not worked in my test,
I'll try with more effort if works.  
Nevertheless I tested with **Restart=no** and it worked fine, with
serial port started OK and without serial no errors in journal and the
service is not present in systemctl status output. (with ubuntu 16.04 in
virtualbox)

Tomorrow I will test it on real HW with RHEL7.2

On the other hand I've detected that, at the recovery boot process, the
serial console has no output in last steps, and with
Before=getty.service configured you get the serial console prompt before
the whole process ends. But if not this way, with After=getty.service if
you are only connected to the serial the wait is long and seems it
hanged.

What option seems better in your opinion?  
IMHO I prefer getting a fast login prompt, maybe is possible to put some
warning to check if finished before run rear recover or better, if
possible, mirror the ouptut form serial and console :P.

Regards,

Hi again, I found a cleaner solution than **Restart=no**.

/usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service

<pre>
#  This file is part of systemd.
#
[Unit]
Description=Serial Getty on %I
BindTo=dev-%i.device
After=dev-%i.device

# We must wait for ReaR boot script to finish.
# this prevents the login serial prompt to
# be ready before the whole recovery boot process is done
After=getty.target


[Service]
Environment=TERM=vt100
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -s %I 115200,38400,9600
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=0
StartLimitAction=none
StartLimitBurst=3
StartLimitInterval=60
UtmpIdentifier=%I
KillMode=process


# Some login implementations ignore SIGTERM, so we send SIGHUP
# instead, to ensure that login terminates cleanly.
KillSignal=SIGHUP

[Install]
WantedBy=getty.target
</pre>

The key is **Restart=** action, now is on-failure (see this:
[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html))
and in case of failure will use StartLimit\* settings ( finally worked
after some attemtps :P ). This prevents restarts of the serial if not
present, and also aviods weird messages in console like "... Failed to
start getty on ttyS0 ..." when StartLimitInterval is reached and no more
auto-restart attempts will be done.

On the other hand, improving this also reduced some of the waiting time
for login prompt in the serial console with the **After=getty.target**
clause set. Now I rather think that is better to keep it <after> and
avoid running rear recover by mistake from serial connection before rear
boot script is finished.  
Maybe a future improvement could be possible to show the rear boot
script output to console to provide better feedback to the user.

During the debugging of the issue I found that the **getty.service**
clause **DefautInstance=tty0** was not recognized because a typo (my
fault), I also adjusted it to Defau**l**tInstance=%I (see:
[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html\#DefaultInstance=](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#DefaultInstance=))
and now is working Ok.

All this was tested on VBox with Ubuntu 16.04 VMs with and without
serial connected. All tests worked well, and there are no more infinite
serial-getty respawns in journal.

Tomorrow I will test these changes on physical HW with RHEL7.2 and
serial console. If no issues a PR will be ready by tomorrow evening, I
guess.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but a new PR is needed, isn't it?

@didacog great news indeed! I think you have found the fix üëç And, yes
please prepare a fresh PR which will be accepted with great pleasure :-)

@gdha, last changes worked also on SuperdomeX servers with RHEL7.2 with
serial console.

Later today I will send the PR with updated changes, this should solve
all problems from issue \#878 and PR \#1615 without the infinite respawn
problem. :-)

@didacog did you have a look on
`/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-getty-generator` ?  
It should be responsible of serial console detection and automatically
create `serial-ttyS0@.service` or `serial-hvc0@.service`. Have a look on
\#1442 and \#1448

@schabrolles yes I've tested, as it is, with
"/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-getty-generator" in
COPY\_AS\_IS without changes, but issue \#878 happens.

Maybe with some bigger changes/cleanups in getty services in systemd
could work with the generator at the end, but at least for now, I prefer
to solve these issues and after, with them solved, we may start a
discussion in how to improve it to have a better implementation?
