@John-Leone

You need to upgrade to **ReaR 2.3**, that is first version where
*DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER* was implemented.

@gozora  
After doing some testing it seems like i encountered a similar problem
below.  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2359851](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2359851)  
I'm going to open a case with RH and let you know how it goes

@gozora  
This problem only happens during a virtual to physical server migrations
for RHEL 7 servers.  
Our workaround is to select the rescue shell and rebuild the initial
ramdisk for the impacted kernel.  
Please close this case.  
Thanks,  
John
