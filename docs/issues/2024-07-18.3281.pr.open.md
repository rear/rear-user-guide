##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3144](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3144)

-   How was this pull request tested? Recovery of RHEL 9 in z/VM

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The `conf` directory is the expected location for architecture-specific
settings. Moreover, the `305_include_s390_tools.sh` script contained a
potentially harmful check that could result in all s390/s390x tools
being omitted from the recovery image with disastrous results.

Fixes: cba3590b27bedb526e5b439cd8d4d01e1ec0169a ("pull \#2142")

I've marked this only as a draft for now. @pcahyna, if some of these
programs should be marked as required, let me know!

@lzaoral I don't think you need to do a complete review of all the tools
here - your code matches what used to exist before (except for the
SELinux tools, which I suppose are included elsewhere), so it should be
ok. But if you want to do this review at the same time, the tools are
used at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0fa49b3089ad0015f1ab67335c596fc28066f2df/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh\#L29](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0fa49b3089ad0015f1ab67335c596fc28066f2df/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh#L29)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/0fa49b3089ad0015f1ab67335c596fc28066f2df/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/Linux-s390](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/0fa49b3089ad0015f1ab67335c596fc28066f2df/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/Linux-s390)
(although most of their use at the latter happens only if there actually
is a DASD, so when we add support for SCSI disks, they won't be needed
in case you have no DASDs, the `lsdasd` use is an exception and could be
actually made conditional, as it is purely informative). The use in the
former also does not seem to happen if
`"$OS_MASTER_VENDOR" = "SUSE_LINUX"`.

@lzaoral is the removed
`usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-s390/305_include_s390_tools.sh` really
completely obsolete?
