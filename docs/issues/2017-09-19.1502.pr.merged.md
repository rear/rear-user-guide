This is a band-aid fix for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494)  
that should still keep  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/772](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/772)  
working - but I do not test on Fedora 23.  
Now only an error is reported when 'ldconfig'  
fails at the end of 390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
but that is no longer fatal.

@gdha  
if on Fedora 23 there must not be a 'ldconfig' call  
at the end of 390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
I would rather implement distibution specific code here  
(by using things like OS\_VENDOR and OS\_VERSION)  
to get it fixed for now at least on SUSE.

I will merge it right now because I think it is o.k.  
(at least it should be a better default behaviour now)  
and if not (e.g. for special things on Fedora 23 or 25)  
we can later fix it especially there.
