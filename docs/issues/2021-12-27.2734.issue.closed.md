    reaplce vi by nano

-   Workaround, if any:  
    in rear recover shell :

<!-- -->

    $ cd /bin
    $ mv vi vi_BAK
    $ ln -s nano vi
    $ rear recover

I dont like vi so i would like to replace vi by nano.  
The command `export EDITOR="/bin/nano"` doesnt work  
so i replace the vi binary with a link to nano in the /bin directory.  
This is a quick 'n' dirty sollution but it works.

Can i replace the vi default editor in the rear iso by nano  
using the rear config file by an option ?  
Must write the config line `export EDITOR="/bin/nano"`  
to the rear config or can i create an "auto execution script"  
when building the ISO which does the vi/nano substitution  
like above discriped ?

We won't set `nano` as default editor for "rear recover"  
i.e. the editor one gets when nothing was specified.

The traditional Unix/Linux editor used by system admins is `vi`  
so `vi` must be kept as default editor in ReaR because  
ReaR is first and foremost meant for system admins.

It is a different question if a user can use another editor  
when he does not like to use the default `vi`.

I think this is currently already sufficiently solved via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298)  
therein see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298\#issuecomment-423070755](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298#issuecomment-423070755)

What is not yet done is that all hardcoded places that call `vi`  
(mainly user dialogs that offer choices to edit files  
like disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh)  
would have to be cleaned up and enhanced  
to call a different (and available) editor, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298\#issuecomment-299864994](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298#issuecomment-299864994)

When there are user dialogs where the generic choice  
`Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here`  
makes sense but is missing I could add it (as time permits).

But I won't implement REAR\_EDITOR support as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298\#issuecomment-299864994](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1298#issuecomment-299864994)

When REAR\_EDITOR support is wanted someone else would have to  
implement it and provide it as a GitHub pull request according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
and "Contributing" in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and "How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in

Pickung up on this old thread because I recently had the fun to work
with `vi` (not `vim`) during recovery, and it was no fun.

I'm thinking about adding some code to make sure that something provides
`/bin/editor` similar how to some distros set a `/usr/bin/editor` symink
via `update-alternatives` to point to some editor. And then the code
would look at `$(type -p editor)` on the source system and replicate
that, falling back to `vi` of course.

The result would be a closer match of the rescue system to the source
system.
