ReaR 2.7

When using the `rear mkrescue -C /path/to/conf/coutomname.conf` the
`rear recover` will use the `default.conf` file and not the custom
config file.

Please note that i can't use the `/etc/rear/local.conf` as I'm using it
in a dynamic system that can execute multiple `rear mkrescue` at the
same time with different configs.

In my custom config I've set the `BACKUP=MYINTEGRATION`, and when
recover is executed it uses `BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE` as this is the
default in `default.conf` file.

Is this a normal behavior?

usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
gets sourced by sbin/rear in any case  
because ReaR won't work correctly without its default settings  
and there is no need to change usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
because the defaults can be changed as needed by user config files.

What config files get sourced by sbin/rear is same  
for all workflows (in particular same for "rear mkbackup"  
and "rear recover") because the same code in sbin/rear  
is run for all workflows.  
The only difference is that during "rear recover" an  
additional config file "rescue.conf" is there which  
was created by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup".

See "man rear"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
how to use a different directory for user config files  
and how to specify additional user config files  
(excerpt):

    -c DIR
    alternative config directory; instead of /etc/rear

    -C CONFIG
    additional config file; absolute path or relative to config directory

For me it seems to work  
(but I did not test "rear recover" with that):

    # cat /tmp/foodir/foo.conf

    MYVAR=MYVALUE

    # usr/sbin/rear -D -C /tmp/foodir/foo.conf mkrescue

    Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git
    ...
    Using build area: /var/tmp/rear.gHTk4xo2616VVcy
    Sourcing additional configuration file '/tmp/foodir/foo.conf'
    ...

    # chroot /var/tmp/rear.gHTk4xo2616VVcy/rootfs/

    bash-4.4# cat /tmp/foodir/foo.conf

    MYVAR=MYVALUE

    bash-4.4# rear -D -C /tmp/foodir/foo.conf help

    Sourcing additional configuration file '/tmp/foodir/foo.conf'
    ...

My blind guess is that perhaps your implementation  
of your BACKUP=MYINTEGRATION is not yet right?

Or is the issue perhaps actually that  
when you call

    # rear -C /path/to/conf/myconfig.conf mkrescue

then calling only plain

    # rear recover

will (of course) not use /path/to/conf/myconfig.conf  
because you would have to call

    # rear -C /path/to/conf/myconfig.conf recover

to tell the program `rear` to use the additional config file  
also for the 'recover' workflow.

Maybe we should add a line like `source /path/to/conf/myconfig.conf` to
`$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf` so that the rescue system will
automatically use the same extra configuration files that had been used
to create it?

I think that this would help a lot to make the rescue → recovery
workflow be more consistent with itself.

I wonder what the DRLM perspective on this is, @didacog and @proura what
do you think?

@schlomo  
in general I am very much against all those  
"well intended automatisms" all over the place.

What when a user wants to do

    rear -C /path/to/mkrescue1.conf mkrescue

    rear -C /path/to/mkrescue2.conf mkrescue

    rear -C /path/to/mkbackup1.conf mkbackup

    rear -C /path/to/mkbackup2.conf mkbackup

    rear -C /path/to/mkbackuponly1.conf mkbackuponly

    rear -C /path/to/mkbackuponly2.conf mkbackuponly

    rear -C /path/to/recover1.conf recover

    rear -C /path/to/recover2.conf recover

Most automatisms work against "final power to the user"  
unless automatisms would have been implemented  
very carefully and very thoroughly  
but most are not.

@jsmeix

I do understand you point, However If i created the ISO with
`BACKUP=MYINTEGRATION`, shouldn't it restored automatically with
`BACKUP=MYINTEGRATION`?

I agree with @jsmeix and with @idanbenezra as you talk IMHO about
different scenarios:

1.  on the original system a user might have multiple configurations →
    need to manually specify it for every command
2.  on the rescue system the main intention for ReaR is that everything
    is predefined and even an inexperienced user should be able to
    perform a recovery → the "right" configuration files should be used
    without specifying them

For the "final power to the user" perspective we need to provide a way
how to achieve what @idanbenezra needs.

Personally I'd make this the default behaviour but maybe the following
is a suitable compromise:

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/sbin/rear\#L614-L624](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/sbin/rear#L614-L624)
we start sourcing the additional configuration files **after** reading
the `local.conf`, `site.conf` and **`rescue.conf`** files. That means
that instead of providing `-C file` on the command line you can
configure that behaviour into your configuration via the
`CONFIG_APPEND_FILES` variable.

So we could introduce a new configuration directive like
"CONFIG\_AUTOLOAD\_EXTRA\_FILES" or such that simply adds sets
`CONFIG_APPEND_FILES` in `/etc/rear/rescue.conf` from
`CONFIG_APPEND_FILES_PATHS` which is a new variable that I introduced
with \#2932 to record the extra configs that we read successfully during
ReaR initialisation. Setting that configuration directive would induce
the automatic behaviour that @idanbenezra wants.

Hello @schlomo,

As far as you simply add `source <path_to_configs>` before
`/usr/share/rear/init/default/010_set_drlm_env.sh` will not cause any
problem to DRLM provided configurations. The only concern is that if the
config to source is not present, then rear must continue, not exiting.
but if is controlled by `CONFIG_AUTOLOAD_EXTRA_FILES=yes|no` should be
under control.

thanks for taking us into account!  
Kind regards,  
Didac

I agree with what @schlomo wrote in his  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2936\#issuecomment-1434376825](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2936#issuecomment-1434376825)

    2. ... an inexperienced user should be able to perform a recovery ...

In sbin/rear the additional config files are  
intentionally sourced after the ususal config files  
so that the user can overwrite settings in his  
ususal config files by different ones in his  
additional config files so he can have settings  
in his ususal config files as his specific defaults.

I think what @idanbenezra wants can be done without  
any changes in ReaR code because sourcing config files  
means to run them as bash scripts so the user can run  
any commands as he needs for his specific use case, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)

For example to automatically source an additional config file  
when no '-C /tmp/foodir/foo.conf' was specified  
in etc/rear/local.conf like

    if ! [[ "$CONFIG_APPEND_FILES" == */tmp/foodir/foo.conf* ]] ; then
        LogPrint "Sourcing /tmp/foodir/foo.conf"
        test -s /tmp/foodir/foo.conf || Error "/tmp/foodir/foo.conf does not exists or is empty"
        Source /tmp/foodir/foo.conf || Error "Failed to Source /tmp/foodir/foo.conf"
    fi

which seems to work for me  
(but I didn't test with "rear recover"):

    # usr/sbin/rear -D help
    Sourcing /tmp/foodir/foo.conf
    ...

Currently one cannot set CONFIG\_APPEND\_FILES in etc/rear/local.conf  
because CONFIG\_APPEND\_FILES is set readonly in sbin/rear before  
etc/rear/local.conf is sourced.  
Perhaps that readonly is superfluous and can be removed?

@idanbenezra  
be careful with sourcing config files:  
Sourcing the same config file more than once  
can lead to trouble when settings are not idempotent,  
e.g. when things are appended to variables.

Currently ReaR behaves as usual traditional commands do  
which means that a subsequent call of a command does not inherit  
command line option settings from a former command call.  
E.g. nobody expects that after one 'cat -n ...' subsequent  
calls of plain 'cat' automatically number output lines.

In contrast to usual traditional commands modern GUI stuff  
often behaves with "automated inheritance" of former calls.  
E.g. after a GUI tool to play some music was run once  
a subsequent run starts with the volume setting of the  
former run (which is often rather unexpected volume).

I do not want such "automated inheritance" in ReaR.

On the other hand I understand that  
"an inexperienced user should be able to perform a recovery".  
In particular because this should help the user to avoid  
accidental errors during a real disaster recovery  
in case of emergency and time pressure.

As far as I see both conflict so I think  
careful and thorough investigation is needed  
to find out step by step what a right solution is  
(or to show that no right solution exists in this case).

Good point about GUI apps, @jsmeix

I think ReaR is somewhat a special case, it is neither just a CLI tool
nor a GUI app.

On top of that I take the **ReaR Rescue System** to be a very special
tool, which is custom built for a single job and purpose: Recover the
original system as easy as we can make it.

For that purpose the `rear mkrescue` phase takes a large amount of
decisions and pre-configures the rescue system in a way that ensures
that `rear recover` works well. And we don't support changing course
mid-way, e.g. starting a rescue system and then changing the backup
method to something completely different via command line option. At
least we don't provide that kind of functionality by default.

With regard to extra configs that thinking makes me lean towards adding
a configuration option that automatically includes the extra configs for
recovery, to follow the existing approach that a `rear mkrescue` run
pre-configures the rescue system for the intended job.

The result would be that calling `rear mkrescue` with different
`-C conf` options would yield different rescue systems that also behave
different. After all, in that extra config everything can be changed to
the extend that calling `rear recover` *without* that extra config won't
actually work.

As the recovery is intended to be used even by less technically skilled
people I would choose "reliably run recovery as configured" over "the
admin must choose the recovery extra options if he did so during
mkrescue"

Makes any sense?

All what you describe in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2936\#issuecomment-1436879543](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2936#issuecomment-1436879543)  
"just works" with current ReaR with  
BACKUP=MYINTEGRATION in etc/rear/local.conf  
It works because you talk about "the system" (singular).

The issue here is that for obscure reasons @idanbenezra  
cannot have BACKUP=MYINTEGRATION in etc/rear/local.conf

I do not at all understand what is meant with

    a dynamic system that can execute multiple rear mkrescue
    at the same time with different configs

Multiple rear mkrescue at the same time  
are normally explicitly forbidden via

    SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS=( 'mkbackuponly' 'restoreonly' )

in default.conf.

FYI:  
The primarily intended use case behind '-C' is described in

perspective? What - **and why** - would be your expectation with regard

@schlomo

I'm integration ReaR into our own product (JetBackup
[https://www.jetbackup.com/](https://www.jetbackup.com/)).  
Our product can execute multiple backup jobs simultaneously, However
after @jsmeix last replay that `rear mkrescue` can't be executed
simultaneously I've disabled it on our end also.

Our software creates custom config for ReaR during the backup process
and then provides it to the `mkrescue -C`.

The end user that will use it won't know that he need to use
`recover -C` on the rescue system, also the "Automatic Recover" will
never work.

By the way  
(sleeping on an issue always helps - if not sleep more ;-)

I found a real issue with our current '-c' and '-C':

The 'automatic/auto\_recover' and 'unattended' modes  
currently call only

    rear $rear_debug_options recover

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L155](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L155)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L192](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L192)

So '-c' and '-C' are ignored / not possible  
with our current 'automatic/auto\_recover' and 'unattended' modes  
which is a bug that needs to be fixed.

@idanbenezra  
yes,  
I also found out that the 'automatic/auto\_recover'  
and 'unattended' modes currently don't work  
with '-c' and/or '-C'  
(which tells a lot how often '-c' and/or '-C'  
plus 'automatic/auto\_recover' or 'unattended'  
are actually used by users "out there").

My current offhanded idea how to fix that generically  
is to store the whole 'rear \[options\] workflow' command line  
of each last called workflow in the ReaR recovery system.

Because only "rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackup" create  
a ReaR recovery system only those workflows can store  
their command line in the ReaR recovery system.

So some "rear special\_option mkbackuponly" cannot  
store its command line in the ReaR recovery system.

@idanbenezra  
I do not understand what you actually mean with

    Our product can execute multiple backup jobs simultaneously

How could it make sense to execute multiple backup jobs  
simultaneously on one same system?

What exactly is a "backup job"?

I can imagine to run multiple file backups like 'tar'  
simultaneously on one same system when each one  
backups a different part of the files, cf. my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

But I cannot imagine what the use case could be to  
create multiple times simultaneously on one same system  
a rescue/recovery system (e.g. a ReaR recovery system)?

@jsmeix

A "backup job" define a set of configurations that can be executed at a
user configurable schedule.

For example, a user can set 2 different accounts backup jobs (will
backup the entire account - homedir, databases, Email accounts and etc)
that runs at the same time and backs up the data to 2 different offsite
destinations.

@idanbenezra  
so with "backup" you mean making a backup of some files  
but not creating a rescue/recovery system.

We use the same meaning of "backup" in ReaR.  
But often users confuse the meaning of "backup" in ReaR  
with ReaR's native task: "creating a rescue/recovery system"  
cf. the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in
