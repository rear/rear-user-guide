I was attempting to recover a CentOS 7 machine to the same machine with
different (larger) hard drives. My general setup is as follows:

-   two drives each with 2 partitions:
    -   512 MB partition that held /boot a long time ago - now unused
    -   80 GB partition
-   the 80 GB partitions are pulled into a a RAID 1 software raid array
    (/dev/md127)
-   the /dev/md127 array is defined as an LVM physical volume, and holds
    a volume group with my root, swap, and any snapshot logical volumes.

rear -V shows: `Relax-and-Recover 1.16.1 / Git`

/etc/rear/local.conf contains the following additions:  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
OUTPUT=USB  
I also included the following line in the same file and commented it out
in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf. I realize I probably should have
just appended the "/data01/" directory here, but I didn't and I don't
think it's relevant to any issues I'm having.  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' $VAR\_DIR/output/\*
'/data01/\*')

Recovery seems mostly successful, except when I reach the part when it
is time to install Grub2:

    Installing GRUB2 boot loader

    WARNING ! For this system
    RedHatEnterpriseServer/7 on Linux-i386 (based on Fedora/7/i386)
    there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system or the code
    that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.

    Please contribute this code to the Relax-and-Recover project. To do so
    please take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize,
    for an example you can use the script for Fedora (and RHEL/CentOS/SL) in
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/20_install_grub.sh

    --------------------  ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION -------------------
    |                                                                     |
    |          IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL A BOOT LOADER MANUALLY,              |
    |                                                                     |

    |                                                                     |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login' to access the recovered system.
    Please remember to mount /proc before trying to install a boot loader.

I'm curious to know if the cause of this is:

-   there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system  
    or
-   the code that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly

Are there known issues surrounding the ReaR Grub2 install on
RedHat/CentOS 7 systems? I've run into Grub2 installation problems
multiple times now using completely different sets of machines. I've
been consistently using the same setup though with similar partitioning,
software raid, and LVM. I've had to manually install Grub2 and it's been
a pretty painful procedure each time, so I would love to see if I can
get this part automated. I likely have more information I can provide
such as the disklayout.sh, diskrecovery.sh, and logs, but I want to make
sure I don't start pasting too much information yet that may not be
relevant.

Feel free to request more information from me if it will help confirm. I
can run more backups and recoveries and add debug flags if possible.
Meanwhile, I'll see if I can understand what is going on in issue \#473.

My last comment could be perhaps sufficient from mentioned issue.  
@gdha has added common grub2 support but it was failing in my test
environment with automatic recovery. When I tested some days ago with
manual recovery it was working fine.

I believe I have the same issue whether I choose the first option under
my hostname, or the second one labelled with "AUTOMATIC RECOVERY." Are
these the manual and autorecovery methods you are referring to? It
actually took me a while to figure out exactly what you meant by manual,
but I think I understand. Under the first option, I end up typing "rear
-v recover" and then everything seems about the same as the second
option.

My issue is that my partition table comes back differently. The
disklayout.sh script shows the correct number of bytes (I believe the
units are bytes). But, the diskrestore.sh script ends up with different
numbers, in effect, shifting the partitions back to the first track. My
first partition /dev/sda1 for example originally began at 4096. Upon
recovery, the disklayout.sh file reflects the partition beginning at the
4096 sector boundary, but gets created at the 64 sector boundry. It
seems like this shouldn't be a big deal since the partitions do get
created with the correct size. (I was going for filesystem alignment and
SSD cell alignment, but in a disaster recovery situation, that probably
wouldn't be the highest priority concern.)

So, all goes well until the Grub2 installation where I get the above
mentioned error. I also saw a message about the reason being that my
core.img was too large to fit in the embedding area. So, my solution
right now is to simply edit the parted commands in the diskrestore.sh
script so that the partitions are created as they were on the original
machine (beginning at the 4096 boundry instead of 64). This isn't too
bad, it's just something I'll need to document for our recovery plan.

Is it expected that ReaR wants to create the partition right after the
first track? It would seem reasonable, except for maybe the issue I am
running into with Grub not able to fit.

I should mention that one thing that caused me to pull my hair out a bit
while troubleshooting was that multiple times I ran into an issue where
it would (seem to) hang while creating the LVM volumes. I finally
figured out what was going on by opening another terminal, realizing I
could access the log file, and saw that it was just waiting for a (y/n)
response due to seeing previous LVM info on the disk. So I just hit 'y'
and 'enter' where I thought it was hanging, and the recovery scripts
kept going. Don't get me wrong, I'm just giving some feedback - not
complaining. This software is awesome!

Perhaps you could check if the code from  
[https://github.com/gsbit/rear/commit/f5ef907e7cc54f2cfe486bf98479fd3649420d4f](https://github.com/gsbit/rear/commit/f5ef907e7cc54f2cfe486bf98479fd3649420d4f)  
merged with rear (issue \#487) could have caused the shift in disk
boundary?

I tried adding the new code from \#487, but it didn't work for me and I
don't think it applies since I'm only working with primary partitions. I
looked through the rest of the code in `10_include_partition_code.sh`
and I see the "while" loop where the partition start information
($pstart) is read, but it looks like $pstart only gets set if I'm not in
"Migration Mode." Otherwise it just remains set to 32768 which is what
it was initialized to. In my case, I am migrating to slightly larger
disks, so my MIGRATION\_MODE variable is set to true. I didn't get the
chance yet to try altering the "if" statement to force it to use the
$pstart value, but I'll try this next.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9383158?v=4" width="50">[zwilliams360](https://github.com/zwilliams360) commented at [2014-11-03 21:31](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/492#issuecomment-61552278):

I just tried updating this line of the code (line 134) in
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10\_include\_partition\_code.sh:  
`if [ -z "$MIGRATION_MODE" ] && ! [ "$pstart" = "unknown" ] ; then`  
to be  
`if ! [ -z "$MIGRATION_MODE" ] && ! [ "$pstart" = "unknown" ] ; then`  
Notice the "!" in front of the test for whether or not
"$MIGRATION\_MODE" is an empty string.

This allowed the script to progress into the "if" block and set $pstart
to the correct value instead of leaving it as its initialized value of
32768. If I do this, I can proceed through the remaining recovery steps
and the partitions get created as expected.

Edit - I changed the line number above from 124 to 134.

@jhoekx Jeroen - I value your feedback concerning @zwilliams360 tests
with
`/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10_include_partition_code.sh`
modification.

@zwilliams360 concerning the statement *waiting for a (y/n) response due
to seeing previous LVM info on the disk* above: do you still remember
which LVM command is was (in the `diskrestore.sh` script?)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9383158?v=4" width="50">[zwilliams360](https://github.com/zwilliams360) commented at [2014-11-04 16:29](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/492#issuecomment-61667452):

The y/n issue comes from:
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/11\_include\_lvm\_code.sh  
Line 107: echo "lvm lvcreate -l $nrextents -n ${lvname} ${vgrp\#/dev/}
&gt;&2"

This is in the create\_lvmvol() function. A quick search suggested
adding a --yes parameter to lvcreate would force the volume creation,
but maybe just sending it to stdout instead of stderr is better here?

I found a picture I took of one the messages related to this. It said:
"WARNING: xfs signature detected on /dev/centos/root at offset 0. Wipe
it? \[y/n\]" The message before this one was while creating the swap LV
and it was similar except saying a swap signature had been detected.

@jhoekx could you please give your feedback on above mentioned migration
topic?

Sorry, didn't see your previous question...

I think we can just increase the default start to be at 4096\*512. I
don't see problems there, but I might of course be wrong. If we restore
the original system to equally sized disks, we use the old value. In
case we're migrating we need to be prepared for the common scenario,
which in these days means we need a little bit of extra space for grub2.

That would solve @zwilliams360 's problem and let the code keeps its
original intent?
