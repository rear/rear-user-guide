-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?

In current GitHub master code since DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED="" cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2859](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2859)  
there is in layout/recreate/default/120\_confirm\_wipedisk\_disks.sh  
a UserInput() dialog like

    Disks to be wiped: /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdd
    ...
    Confirm disks to be wiped and continue 'rear recover'

which has usually (i.e. when not in MIGRATION\_MODE)  
a timeout of USER\_INPUT\_INTERRUPT\_TIMEOUT.

During my tests with current GitHub master code  
I learned that 10 seconds is far too little time  
to read and understand that UserInput message and  
then some more time to make a decision whether or not  
the automated action is actually the right one.

I.e. 10 seconds was far too little time even for me  
where I expected that UserInput dialog but even I  
could not actually comprehend what disks will be wiped  
and I could not at all make a decision whether or not  
those are the right disks.

So the same applies to any UserInput dialog  
(in prticular to any unexpected UserInput dialog)  
where USER\_INPUT\_INTERRUPT\_TIMEOUT is used  
i.e. any UserInput() dialog with a predefined input.

In general a default timeout is useless when it is too short  
to let the user understand what is going on and let him  
make a decision so in practice such a too short timeout  
behaves very user unfiendly.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In default.conf increased the default USER\_INPUT\_INTERRUPT\_TIMEOUT  
from 10 seconds to 30 seconds because 10 seconds is far too little
time  
to read and understand a possibly unexpected UserInput() message  
and then some more time to make a decision whether or not  
the automated action is actually the right one.

@schlomo  
thank you for your review.  
I fully agree with your above comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2981\#pullrequestreview-1414902682](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2981#pullrequestreview-1414902682)

Additionlly  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4437573/bash-assign-default-value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4437573/bash-assign-default-value)  
explains why

    VAR="${VAR:-default value}"

is better in practice than

    : "${VAR:=default value}"

cf. my comment in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2981/commits/a436ad55e5dc437f173eb3c253341fd4d3c59551](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2981/commits/a436ad55e5dc437f173eb3c253341fd4d3c59551)  
excerpt:

`VAR="${VAR:-default value}"` is found by 'grep' for 'VAR=' and  
with 'set -x' it shows `VAR='default value'` (instead of
`: 'default value'`)  
which makes this code easier to understand, debug and maintain,  
cf.

I am wondering why we use

    VAR="${VAR:-default value}"

and not

    VAR="${VAR-default value}"

i.e. why we assign 'defult value' via `:-`  
if VAR is unset or null (i.e. unset or empty)  
instead of assigning 'defult value' via `-`  
only if VAR is unset?

In the former case the user cannot set an empty value via

    export VAR=""

which he could do (if needed) in the latter case.

As far as I see this does not matter with the current  
config variables that are set this way because  
for none of those which get a non-empty default set  
it makes sense for the user to set them to be empty.

So my question is currently only out of curiosity.

I have another question:

What is "the best" way to assign a string of words  
via bash parameter expansion?

Currenly I use an unquoted string

    VAR="${VAR:-default value}"

in

    USER_INPUT_PROMPT="${USER_INPUT_PROMPT:-enter your input}"

because we do it this way already in  
rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280\_create\_bootable\_disk\_image.sh

    "${RAWDISK_GPT_PARTITION_NAME:-Rescue System}"
    ${RAWDISK_BOOT_SYSLINUX_START_INFORMATION:-Starting the rescue system...}

and  
rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/270\_create\_grub2\_efi\_bootloader.sh

    "${RAWDISK_BOOT_GRUB_MENUENTRY_TITLE:-Recovery System}"

Alternatively

    VAR="${VAR:-"default value"}"

would work but the nested double quotes look confusing.  
In contrast single quotes like

    VAR="${VAR:-'default value'}"

do not work because (at least with bash version 4.4.23)

    # unset VAR

    # VAR="${VAR:-'default value'}"

    # declare -p VAR
    declare -- VAR="'default value'"

the single quotes become part of the assigned value.

@jsmeix the examples in

led me (long long time ago and now again) to always use `:-` syntax as
it also handles `null` set variables.

What is bad with `VAR="${VAR:-default value}"` if it works as
expected?  
Even `VAR=${VAR:-default value}` works the same.

I don't see a need to change anything from our current use of this
parameter substitution and it seems to me that there is no need for
inner quotes around multi word default values either.

By the way regarding `${VAR-value}`:

As far as I found we have only one case where this is used:  
rear/lib/layout-functions.sh

    function get_device_from_partition() {
        ...
        partition_number=${2-$(get_partition_number $partition_block_device )}

It seems to be allowed to call get\_device\_from\_partition  
with an empty second argument?

get\_device\_from\_partition is only called in  
finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh

@pcahyna  
as far as I see from  
`git log --follow -p usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh`  
this `${VAR-value}` parameter expansion is from you in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fae98be14d0a7de30128f896c879f19259a96ad7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fae98be14d0a7de30128f896c879f19259a96ad7)  
that belongs to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608)  
which has very many comments.  
Do you perhaps remember why not `${VAR:-value}` is used in this case?

No memories, most likely I did it wrong. Off the top of my head I'm not
aware of any reason to use `VAR-value` instead of `VAR:-value`

Personally, I also find `:-` easier to read and notice

I will do a new pull request to clean up in default.conf  
all cases of config variables for confidential values  
i.e. have a generic explanation comment at the beginning  
instead of several similar comments at each place:
