I could successfully created backup (mkbackup) of OS (SUSE 11 SP3 with
rear-1.17.2-1) and sent to NFS share.

My site.conf:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://#######/reear"
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nolock"
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( vg0 )
    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n

I'm try to recover my system and recover ended successfully.

    ....fi;
        done < "${TMP_DIR}/backup.splitted"; kill -9 $(cat "${TMP_DIR}/cat_pid"); rm "${TMP_DIR}/cat_pid"; rm "${TMP_DIR}/backup.splitted"; rm "${TMP_DIR}/backup.md5";
    fi )

    But in recover log I get the following errors:

And in next step OS didn't boot from recovered system disk! (server
boots in 'Red Screen' with illegal opcode)  
If you can guide me the right direction, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Hi,  
Seeing "Red screen" term, I guess you are using some kind of HP(e)
hw....

Try to boot system using Standard SLES11 ISO to **Rescue mode**, and
trigger:

`/usr/sbin/grub-install.unsupported <path_to_your_bood_disk>`

Ok, but why Rear improperly setup bootloader?

Not sure if this is fault of ReaR ...  
I've faced something similar in the past (but only with particular
Generation of HW), unfortunately I didn't had time for deeper
investigation.

The grub tries to setup a multipath device:

    grub> device (hd0) /dev/mapper/mpatha

Is this correct?

yes it's correct

I think grub does not understand **/dev/mapper/mpatha** - perhaps it
should be */dev/disk/by-id/scsi-...*  
That could explain the error by grub

It's also worth testing with the recent snapshot version, as there were
some improvements since the August version.

it's seems to be true about grub. So we must to boot using Standard
SLES11 ISO and reinstall bootloader after OS recover? there are no other
options in rear to solve this issue?

@yunsr **SAN boot disks** are not yet 100% fully integrated into rear. I
cannot do it blindly without doing hands-on. If no-one do it for us then
the community (customers) can buy time do implement this for them
(remotely or on-site).

@yunsr PS I have changed the title accordingly, if that was ok for you?

It's not true. We havn't Boot from SAN in our case. Boot partition
reside on local disk but it was named as mpath device.

@yunsr Check your `cat /proc/cmdline` output. To avoid internal disks
being recognized as mpath devices add `multipath=off` to the
initrd/kernel parameters

Could you tell pls why after recovery OS ReaR:

1.  in /mnt/local/boot/grub original device.map and menu.lst move to
    device.map.rearbak, menu.lst.rearbak. It's not correct configs
2.  also rear changed /mnt/local/etc/sysconfig/kernel  
    How i can disable it ?

As solution was written script which was added to rear config with
POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT option.  
This script recover original menu.lst,device.map,/etc/sysconfig/kernel
and run grub-install  
After that everything is okay, OS booted successfully

The target disk device must be a different one then the original one.
That is the reason why disk migration happens and therefore a different
UUID is in use. Did you executed a `diff` and those 2 files?

I agree with you (or when restoring to a new disk will be new UUID).  
Take another attempt and after recover used Rear generated device.map
and menu.lst. Only run grub-install. System booted without any problems.
