rear version 1.19 with bareos 16.2.4 on debian 8 using the following
local.conf

OUTPUT\_URL=/mnt/x  
BACKUP=BAREOS  
BAREOS\_CLIENT=bareos-fd

runnig rear -v mkrescue results in "ERROR: No restore job defined in
Bareos for server\_01"

also initially complained about not finding bareos-fd.conf so I manually
copied it to the /etc/bares from /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/

I also tried previous version of rear1.17 with same result, it seams
some issues related to the new bareos release and the new directory
structure for configuration files. I also tried copy bareos-dir.conf to
/etc/bareos from /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/director, and than populating
it with all my jobs including the default "Restore Files" job yet I
still get the error.

You should follow a REAR workshop sometimes (see
[http://osbconf.org/workshops/](http://osbconf.org/workshops/)). Well,
your problem might be fixed when you use the config file as shown at
[https://github.com/rear/rear-workshop-osbconf-2016/blob/master/rear-configs/local-with-bareos.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear-workshop-osbconf-2016/blob/master/rear-configs/local-with-bareos.conf)  
Pay attention to the last 2 lines (these are in comment, but that was
the exercise to understand the issue).

I should like to go over the workshops, as for my issue manually
defining the restore job name and client fileset as your example
suggested does indeed fix my problem. That is the rescue creation
process completed successfully Thank you.
