##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Packit will test it, see the Checks tab.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Update build targets for Packit (the Fedora ones were obsolete). Add
    Koji scratch builds (Koji is the Fedora build system) as an
    alternative to the usual Copr builds, and EPEL and CentOS Stream
    build targets in order to produce packages for CentOS / RHEL. Add
    openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed build targets (using Copr).

This will greatly increase the diversity of systems that we perform test
RPM builds for.
