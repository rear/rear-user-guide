##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **New Feature**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested with rear release `2.6` on Debian Bullseye (patched
    `usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh` file with this changes)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This PR implements a new variable `BORGBACKUP_IGNORE_WARNING` which
    ignores borg warnings.  
    Borg warnings can happen if a file changed while backing it up
    described here:
    [https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html\#return-codes](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html#return-codes).
    Because borg return code is 1 in such case `rear mkbackup` fails.

@jsmeix thank you for your inputs!

I changed the `borg_create` function to just return the borg rc and
`usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500_make_backup.sh` does now check
if warnings should be ignored or not.

`BORGBACKUP_IGNORE_WARNING=no` gives the following output:

    root@testhost:~# rear mkbackup
    Cannot include default keyboard mapping (no KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY specified)
    Cannot include keyboard mappings (neither KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY nor KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES specified)
    To log into the recovery system via ssh set up /root/.ssh/authorized_keys or specify SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD
    Symlink '/usr/share/misc/magic' -> '/usr/share/file/magic' refers to a non-existing directory on the recovery system.
    It will not be copied by default. You can include '/usr/share/file/magic' via the 'COPY_AS_IS' configuration variable.

`BORGBACKUP_IGNORE_WARNING=yes` gives the following output:

The borg warnings get logged in the rear log file:

@l4r-s  
thank you for your other commits.  
I was not in the office - therefore my late reply.

@rear/contributors

@l4r-s  
thank you for your contribution that improves ReaR!

Contributions for third-party backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have or use those third-party backup tools  
(in particular not if a third-party backup tool is proprietary
software)  
so in case of issues with third-party backup tools and ReaR  
we can usually do nothing but totally depend on contributions  
from those who use and know about the third-party backup tools.
