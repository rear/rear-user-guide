This issue is intended as follow-up of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/795](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/795)

In particular the root partition size is missing, cf.

@gdha  
see my inital "FIXME" in 99\_sysreqs.sh

<pre>
# FIXME: Provide a leading comment what this script is about.
</pre>

Can you provide me some explanatory information what  
the purpose of this script is.

I see at its end that it outputs text to  
$VAR\_DIR/sysreqs/Minimal\_System\_Requirements.txt  
but I have no idea what it is good for.

Is it just mean as textual information or is the content of  
$VAR\_DIR/sysreqs/Minimal\_System\_Requirements.txt  
used by other scripts?

I cannot find the hardcoded file name "Minimal\_System\_Requirements"  
nor can I find e.g. "TOTMEM" is any other script so that I wonder  
what the purpose of 99\_sysreqs.sh is.

@jsmeix Updated the script to make more sense on all Linux distro's. If
you could review the end result? The
`/var/lib/rear/sysreqs/Minimal_System_Requirements.txt` file is **not**
used by rear in *recover* mode. The purpose is to have an idea in a
remote DRP center what are the minimal physical requirements of a system
to foresee to perform a successful recovery from the rear image
provided.

@gdha  
many thanks for your nice cleanup of 99\_sysreqs.sh.

Its resulting var/lib/rear/sysreqs/Minimal\_System\_Requirements.txt  
looks good on my system.

With your cleanup of 99\_sysreqs.sh this issue here  
is sufficiently fixed from my point of view.
