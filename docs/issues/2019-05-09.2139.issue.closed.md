In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1892](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1892)
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/89a8f18ec402b439caf4800421644f5bf5d174e5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/89a8f18ec402b439caf4800421644f5bf5d174e5)  
the /etc/cron.d/rear/ related things were removed for ReaR 2.5  
(see that issue for the reasoning behind)  
and instead a systemd service and timer to run

    /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

should be provided and described in the documentation for ReaR 2.6.

    ...
    This automatic cron is broken and leads to
    having broken ReaR ISOs at the end,
    in my opinion, we should remove this file and
    provide a systemd service + timer instead,
    which wouldn't be enabled by default.

    Example:

    rear-rescue-iso.timer
    -------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=ReaR ... Creation Timer Task
    Documentation=man:rear(8)
    After=network.target

    [Timer]
    OnCalendar=daily
    RandomizedDelaySec=14400

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    -------------------------------------------------------

    rear-rescue-iso.service
    -------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=ReaR ... Creation
    Documentation=man:rear(8)
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue'
    Restart=no
    WatchdogSec=600
    BlockIOWeight=100

Just some small input for future systemd units:

-   `rear mkrescue` is not a continuously running service, right? So
    `Type=oneshot` would be correct.
-   A ReaR service requiring the network to be operational should
    probably run after <code>network<b>-online</b>.target</code></span>
    as (AFAIK) ReaR does not support waiting for network services to
    become available. Cf. [Running Services After the Network is
    up](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/NetworkTarget/).
-   If a timer should work on laptops and desktops which are not always
    on, it could be made persistent to avoid missing scheduled times.
    Also, it could be made to avoid running on battery power.

This is modeled after services and timers I use for backups (though I
use different timers for desktops and servers):

`rear-rescue.service`:

    [Unit]
    Description=Relax-and-Recover Rescue System Update Service
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    # lowest CPU priority
    Nice=19
    # lowest I/O priority among 'normal' processes
    IOSchedulingClass=best-effort
    IOSchedulingPriority=7
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue'

`rear-rescue.timer`:

    [Unit]
    Description=Relax-and-Recover Rescue System Update
    ConditionACPower=true

    [Timer]
    OnCalendar=19:15
    AccuracySec=1 second
    Persistent=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=timers.target

@OliverO2 You are right. Feel free to create a PR and I'll be happy to
merge it :-)  
From my proposal, I would keep the following properties:

    WatchdogSec=600
    BlockIOWeight=100

@rmetrich I'll take a closer look and submit a proposal once ReaR 2.5 is
released.

I'm fine with the intention of your parameters, but if I understand
correctly, they might need to be tweaked a bit:

-   `WatchdogSec` would be ineffective with `Type=oneshot` as such
    processes (from a systemd point of view) do nothing but start up,
    and
    [systemd.service(5)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man5/systemd.service.5.html)
    says: *The watchdog is activated when the start-up is completed.*
    I'd guess that ` TimeoutStartSec=10 minutes` would do the job of
    limiting total run time accordingly.
-   `BlockIOWeight` is deprecated and now superceded by `IOWeight`.
    Nevertheless it might be a good idea to keep it for some time, but
    we should probably first take a look at systemd versions and control
    group interface versions (v1 or v2) on systems supported by ReaR.
    See NOTES section in
    [systemd.resource-control(5)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html)

Sorry @OliverO2 , I wasn't clear enough. Here is the proposed service
unit:

    [Unit]
    Description=Relax-and-Recover Rescue System Update Service
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    # lowest CPU priority
    Nice=19
    # lowest I/O priority among 'normal' processes
    IOSchedulingClass=best-effort
    IOSchedulingPriority=7
    BlockIOWeight=100
    WatchdogSec=600
    Restart=no
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue'

Regarding `IOWeight` property versus `BlockIOWeight`, I don't know if we
should use the first, because there may be incompatibilities with some
OSes running older systemd releases, such as RHEL7 that only recognizes
`BlockIOWeight`.

What do you think of using `systemd-inhibit` on the `ExecStart` command
to prevent the system from being suspended or shutdown while mkrescue
(or even a backup) is being run?

Also, is there a reason why `RandomizedDelaySec` seems to have been
dropped even though `Persistent=true` is proposed?

There is a similar discussion over at borgmatic
[https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic/issues/205](https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic/issues/205)

Also, I agree with the decision to remove `/etc/cron.d/rear`, and I hope
the systemd service and timer provided or documented will be optional
and not enabled by default. Having it enabled by default could result in
useless ISOs made without proper configuration, and also compete with
alternative backup solutions.

As an example, my plan is to:

-   use ReaR to create system recovery media
-   use Borg for system backup
-   use borgmatic to run Borg backups AND run
    `rear checklayout || rear mkrescue` in a pre-backup hook
-   schedule borgmatic with a systemd timer and service

@rmetrich @adatum Could you agree on the content of the systemd script
to include in our documentation so we can close this issue?

I have posted
[here](https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic/issues/205#issuecomment-1835)
the systemd scripts I have been running for the past couple of weeks
mostly based on what @rmetrich already suggested. So far so good.

Main differences are:

-   launching with `systemd-inhibit` to prevent interrupting backups
-   combining a X minute sleep and setting the timer X minutes earlier
    as a workaround to avoiding starting a backup immediately upon
    system startup in case Persistent=true were triggered

With respect to my suggestion above to come up with a PR: After
rethinking the scenario, I have decided against using an automatic
service to update recovery media. While my backup media contents are
automatically and regularly tested for completeness and integrity, I
cannot do likewise with ReaR-generated recovery media. These have to be
hand-tested or else I'd risk losing recovery capability.

If the intention remains to come up with a systemd service, I'd suggest
to have this disabled by default and to provide user information about
the implications of enabling it. In that case, the above suggestion of
@rmetrich seems to be OK with the exception of `WatchdogSec` which
should be removed for clarity. Just my 2 cents...

@OliverO2  
at least for SUSE and openSUSE our packaging rules forbid  
in general (except a few carefully evaluated and approved exceptions)  
to have any kind of "service" (i.e. some "thingy" that runs
automatically)  
enabled by default (i.e. it is active after plain installing the RPM
package),
