@OliverO2

by chance from plain looking at the code I noticed the following:

rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/095\_exclude\_non\_essential\_files.sh
contains  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/095\_exclude\_non\_essential\_files.sh\#L16](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/095_exclude_non_essential_files.sh#L16)

    # ReaR
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( "$REAR_DIR_PREFIX" )

but "$REAR\_DIR\_PREFIX" is only set in usr/sbin/rear  
if `rear` is running from a git checkout  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L78](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L78)

    # Find out if we're running from checkout
    REAR_DIR_PREFIX=""
    readonly SCRIPT_FILE="$( readlink -f $( type -p "$0" || echo "$0" ) )"
    if test "$SCRIPT_FILE" != "$( readlink -f /usr/sbin/$PROGRAM )" ; then
        REAR_DIR_PREFIX=${SCRIPT_FILE%/usr/sbin/$PROGRAM}
    fi

so in particular when `rear` is running from an installed RPM package  
"$REAR\_DIR\_PREFIX" is empty so that

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( "$REAR_DIR_PREFIX" )

won't exclude anything as far as I see from plain looking at the code.

According to how "$REAR\_DIR\_PREFIX" is used in the code  
(`find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'REAR_DIR_PREFIX'`)  
I think what should work in any case to exclude ReaR is

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( "$SHARE_DIR" "$CONFIG_DIR" "$VAR_DIR" "$LOG_DIR" )

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L86](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L86)

    # Program directories - they must be set here. Everything else is then dynamic.
    # Not yet readonly here because they are set via the /etc/rear/rescue.conf file
    # in the recovery system that is sourced by the rear command in recover mode
    # and CONFIG_DIR can also be changed via '-c' command line option:
    SHARE_DIR="$REAR_DIR_PREFIX/usr/share/rear"
    CONFIG_DIR="$REAR_DIR_PREFIX/etc/rear"
    VAR_DIR="$REAR_DIR_PREFIX/var/lib/rear"
    LOG_DIR="$REAR_DIR_PREFIX/var/log/rear"

and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L501](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L501)

    # Now SHARE_DIR CONFIG_DIR VAR_DIR LOG_DIR and KERNEL_VERSION should be set to a fixed value:
    readonly SHARE_DIR CONFIG_DIR VAR_DIR LOG_DIR KERNEL_VERSION

@jsmeix  
Thanks for pointing this out. Will look at this one next week, too.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for catching this and explaining the underlying mechanism in
detail. My new PR deals with the issue (and others) as far as reasonable
for me. As my testing has shown, not every copy can be avoided via
`COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE`. Some parts are hardcoded differently. For example,
excluding `$CONFIG_DIR` that way has no effect. The PR works around this
limitation.

With the PR's changes, `rear mkopalpba` and `rear mkrescue` run pretty
silent over here. The latter still produces this output:

    Symlink '/lib/modules/5.4.0-39-generic/build' -> '/usr/src/linux-headers-5.4.0-39-generic' refers to a non-existing directory on the recovery system.
    It will not be copied by default. You can include '/usr/src/linux-headers-5.4.0-39-generic' via the 'COPY_AS_IS' configuration variable.

This is due to the way
`usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh` works when
configured with `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`. No big deal for me.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2448](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2448)
merged this issue is fixed.

@OliverO2  
thank you for your continuous adaptions and improvements of the  
TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disks support in ReaR!
