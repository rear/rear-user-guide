FYI:  
This is not yet finished.  
Currently it is my very first steps so that you can see early what I
do  
and provide early feedback if I do something plain wrong.

Should be better now but still not finished.

@schabrolles  
see my current
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
where now both stdout and stderr are redirected into the backup restore
log file,  
see the comments in the code for the reason why.

Perhaps also for
usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
both stdout and stderr should be redirected into the backup restore log
file  
if you like it this way?

@jsmeix  
I agree with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1803\#issuecomment-387800158](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1803#issuecomment-387800158).
We should also redirect stderr to the log file.

@schabrolles  
if you have time for it I would appreciate it if you could test  
my latest enhancements regarding TSM backup restore.

@schabrolles @gdha  
feel free to postpone this one to ReaR 2.5  
or "just merge" it into ReaR 2.4 if you like it as is.

I think currently not all relevant places are fixed but  
I think the current state may be already sufficient  
for 'tar' and TSM backup.

@schabrolles You may decide to merge the PR for 2.4 or not.
