-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current GitHub master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

One method to reporoduce it is to e.g.

    # export TMPDIR=QQQ

where the directory QQQ does not exists.

On a SLES15-SP5 test VM with default btrfs structure  
I get the following excerpts on the terminal  
(i.e. also the 'set-x' output is on the terminal  
because it `Could not create build area ''`):

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue

    tac: failed to create temporary file in 'QQQ': No such file or directory

    Something is still mounted within the build area

    You must manually umount it, then you could manually remove the build area

    To manually remove the build area use (with caution): rm -Rf --one-file-system
    ...
    Terminated

The "tac: failed to create temporary file" comes from

    function get_bash_flags_and_options_commands () {
        ...
        set +o | tac | tr '\n' ';'

because 'tac' needs TMPDIR when called in a pipe

    # cat /etc/os-release | tac
    tac: failed to create temporary file in 'QQQ': No such file or directory

in contrast to when 'tac' is called with a regular file  
(at least for me with /usr/bin/tac from coreutils-8.32).

I also tried what happens on that test VM  
when I do what ReaR tells to "manually remove the build area":

    # rm -Rfv --one-file-system && echo y || echo n
    y

    # rm -Rfvi --one-file-system && echo y || echo n
    rm: missing operand
    Try 'rm --help' for more information.
    n

Puh!  
Basically by pure luck 'rm' does not remove anything  
when there is nothing explicitly specified to be removed:

    # rm
    rm: missing operand
    Try 'rm --help' for more information.

As far as I see the problem is in sbin/rear  
only between successful

    source $SHARE_DIR/lib/_input-output-functions.sh

and unsuccessful

    BUILD_DIR="$( mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX || Error "Could not create build area '$BUILD_DIR'" )"

and the basically only thing that is in between is

    QuietAddExitTask cleanup_build_area_and_end_program

so the whole problematic code is

    if ! source $SHARE_DIR/lib/_input-output-functions.sh ; then
        echo -e "ERROR: BUG in $PRODUCT\nFailed to source $SHARE_DIR/lib/_input-output-functions.sh\nPlease report it at $BUG_REPORT_SITE" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    ...
    if test "$WORKFLOW" != "help" ; then
        # Prepend temporary working area (BUILD_DIR) removal exit task
        # so it gets executed directly before the above listed exit tasks.
        # This must be done before the first possible call of the 'Error' function
        # otherwise we may error out but leave the build area behind:
        QuietAddExitTask cleanup_build_area_and_end_program
        # Create temporary working area:
        BUILD_DIR="$( mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX || Error "Could not create build area '$BUILD_DIR'" )"

which I did via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3f4bc829ec106ecf3456e305d48a4f2423458303](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3f4bc829ec106ecf3456e305d48a4f2423458303)

@pcahyna  
because you did much improve the  
cleanup\_build\_area\_and\_end\_program() related code  
I dared to also assing you here because  
I would much appreciate it  
if you could also have a look here.

I think I will at least for now move the

    QuietAddExitTask cleanup_build_area_and_end_program

directly after the

    BUILD_DIR="$( mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ...

because if 'mktemp' fails then there is no  
$TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
so no build area is left behind  
(and if at all only an empty $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
would be left behind).

I wonder if it is needed to be on the safe side  
to manually call

    rm -Rf --one-file-system $BUILD_DIR || true

when 'mktemp' fails or if this is superfluous because  
when 'mktemp' fails, there cannot be a $BUILD\_DIR?
