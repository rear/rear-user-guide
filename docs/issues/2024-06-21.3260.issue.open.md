ReaR uses various different methods  
to read variable values from files  
in particular from shell-style config files  
that are insecure because they execute foreign code  
in particular

    source FILE

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259)  
or  
methods that work more or less reliable  
for example like

    eval "$(grep "^VARIABLE=" FILE)"

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3171)  
which is also insecure because it may evaluate foreign code  
i.e. code that comes after `VARIABLE=` like

    VARIABLE=$( foreign code )

Attempts to generically mitigate and deal with it  
were not accepted, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3203)  
and

Thank you @jsmeix for aggregating this topic here!

What is our reasoning for putting this issue into the 3.0 milestone?

Can you or @pcahyna maybe help us to get support for threat modelling
from SUSE or Red Hat? I'd really love to work on our security
improvements based on threat modelling and I'd assume that you have
experts for that.

Finally, I was wondering what prevents ReaR from running as regular user
instead of root, because that could alleviate a lot of the security
concerns for the `rear mkrescue` part.

I also believe that we should treat the rescue/recovery mode separately
from a security perspective. There might be different requirements.

@jsmeix Personally, I think this task is so complicated that release 3.0
would be delayed by many, many months. Perhaps, release 3.1 would make
it more feasible?

I am afraid I could not reply earlier because  
last week I was away on a team event and  
this week I have to catch up with fixing other  
security issues for my other software packages  
that I maintain at SUSE.

@schlomo  
yes, this is my plan to ask SUSE colleagues  
if there is perhaps already a commonly established  
generic method how to safely and reliably read  
variable values from shell-style config files.

If there is none ("it depends on your case" won't help)  
I would like to get the SUSE security people involved  
how to further proceed with that generic issue  
(it is not ReaR alone that has this issue).

Hopefully I find time to do that properly next week  
I don't want to do that "just somehow by the way".

@gdha  
because this is a security issue  
I think we cannot easily delay it,  
in particular not because ReaR runs as root  
so when a non-trusted user could somehow modify a  
shell-style config file which is executed by ReaR  
(completely via 'source' or partially via 'eval')  
that user could execute any command as root.

So at least for now until things are better understood  
I would like to keep ReaR 3.0 as the intended target  
where this issue should be at least somehow mitigated.

Some thoughts regarding running ReaR an non-root user:

First and foremost it matters here when ReaR runs  
on the original system:

"rear mkrescue" might be possible as non-root user.  
We should try out how far this works.

"rear mkbackuponly" is likely not possible as non-root user  
because only root can read all files to make a complete  
'tar' backup.

When ReaR runs within the ReaR recovery system  
(e.g. "rear recover") is a different case  
that may or may not matter here:

Think about a shell-style config file  
or any other file (e.g. a ReaR script) which was  
modified by a non-trusted user which gets copied  
into the ReaR recovery system because it needs to be  
executed by ReaR (via 'source' or 'eval')  
during "rear recover".  
This way that non-trusted user could get the system  
recreated in a modified way as he likes.

With probability one  
no chance to do something for ReaR next week.  
Right now got several new security issues  
assigned that I need to fix at SUSE.

No problem Johannes - security first ;-)

It hurts because this issue is also security related  
so "security first" would mean this issue first.  
But "customers first" implies "upstream later"  
so issues get fixed in backwards ordering:  
First in released software then at upstream  
so users and customers first get issues  
because of not enough manpower upstream to fix them.  
But I fear this is how business works:  
Customers or users usually won't pay upstream directly.  
Customers pay others for support (e.g. Linux distributors).  
So customers get what they pay for:  
Released upstream software with issues which require  
support by others (e.g. Linux distributors).  
Let's wait and see how long it still takes until  
most business decision makers may finally understand  
that Free Software does not mean "free as in free beer".

I think we need a new generic function

    is_trustworthy_file

that checks if a file is trustworthy.

Each file which will be executed by ReaR  
(completely via 'source' or partially via 'eval')  
must pass this function check.

Each file which is included  
in the ReaR recovery system  
must pass this function check.

What exactly trustworthy means can be further  
adapted and enhanced step by step as needed  
in the implementation of this function.

As an initial first step I suggest (guess what! ;-)  
to implement this function for now to only ensure  
the file owner is one of the TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS  
with the for now reasoning as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3258/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3258/files)  
i.e.:

A file is considered trustworthy  
when its file owner is one of the TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS.  
Because only the file owner can 'chmod'  
(cf. "man 2 chmod": caller's EUID must match owner)  
we may sufficiently safely assume that a file  
which is onwed by one of the TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS  
is sufficiently trustworthy without the need  
for further additional checks  
(e.g. if other users have permissions  
to modify the file or special ACLs).  
Furthermore it should not be ReaR's task to prevent  
TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS from doing what they want  
(a.k.a. "final power to the user")  
or simply put:  
TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS means we do trust them.

For example (offhanded, untested) like

    function is_trustworthy_file () {
        local file_name="$1"
        test "$TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS" || return 0
        owner_name="$( stat -c %U "$file_name" )" || return 1
        IsInArray "$owner_name" "${TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS[@]}" || return 1
    }

No surprise indeed. TBH, I'm not sure however if checking for the file
ownership in the rescue system is so helpful. What should happen if the
file ownership doesn't match? Abort the recovery?

BTW, we also have the MD5 checksum test - is this also a security
feature?

Obviously the check that each file which is included  
in the ReaR recovery system must pass this function  
happens during "rear mkrescue" for the original file  
on the original system with its original file owner  
because inside the ReaR recovery system such a test  
does not make sense where 'root' is basically the only owner.

By the way, a quick test shows "interesting" files in  
the ReaR recovery system that are not owned by 'root'

    crw--w---- 1 johannes tty 136, 2 Jul 4 12:53 ./dev/pts/2
    crw--w---- 1 johannes tty 136, 3 Jul 4 15:22 ./dev/pts/3
    crw--w---- 1 johannes tty 136, 0 Jul 4 15:15 ./dev/pts/0
    crw--w---- 1 johannes tty 136, 4 Jul 4 12:57 ./dev/pts/4
    crw--w---- 1 johannes tty 136, 1 Jul 4 13:45 ./dev/pts/1
    crw--w---- 1 johannes tty 4, 2 Jul 4 07:29 ./dev/tty2
    crw-rw---- 1 tss root 10, 224 Jul 4 07:28 ./dev/tpm0

and many other device nodes with owner group

    root audio
    root dialout
    root disk
    root input
    root kmem
    root kvm
    root lp
    root render
    root tty
    root video

but - as far as my quick test shows - all  
directories and files in the ReaR recovery system  
have owner group 'root root'

Now back to SUSE work - I have no time for discussions here.

@jsmeix @schlomo @pcahyna Why checking for ownership? I would compare
md5sums of the config files with the original md5sums. I guess now you
will say that can may tampered as well, but ownership can also be
modified once an intruder has the root shell. What I already did for a
customer is checking a certificate serial number (and that is full-proof
and extreme difficult to go around it). Just some random ideas. The be
clear the certificate check only is needed on the md5sum check script to
ensure that script is not modified.
