Hi,  
Maybe code I've added in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b81693f27a41482ed89da36a9af664fe808f8186](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b81693f27a41482ed89da36a9af664fe808f8186)
will fix this.  
Can you try to upgrade to ReaR 1.19?

V.

@urobasa  
because you closed it I assume with ReaR 1.19 is works for you.
