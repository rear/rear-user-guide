Since upgrade to TSM version 6.4 the restore code in the rear image
fails to properly restore the / filesystem.

In /usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/ 40\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh
restore is started as:

        dsmc restore "${filespace}*" "/mnt/local/$filespace" \
                -verbose -subdir=yes -replace=all \
                -tapeprompt=no "${TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS[@]}" 

This command now throws an ANS1102E error, which basically means an
unquoted wildcard is being used. The files are not being restored.

Changing the restore command to

dsmc restore ""${filespace}"" ""/mnt/local/${filespace}/""   
-verbose -subdir=yes -replace=all   
-tapeprompt=no "${TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS\[@\]}"

seems to fix the problem.
