-   Brief description of the issue: After rear recovery from ISO , one
    mount point has root ownershop. looks like it has overwritten .  
    The below FS ownership should be like below. But after restore it
    was changed to root.

`/opt/xxxxx 1775 gemapp gtousers`  
But on checking "directories\_permissions\_owner\_group" the permission
was "/opt/xxxxx 1775 gemapp gtousers"..

-   Work-around, if any:

@gdha @hpannenb  
For this issue , i hope this entry will solve this issue
"DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER="  
But i am confused with the syntax , kindly correct me if i am wrong .  
DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER=( '/opt/xxxxx 1775 gemapp gtousers' )  
But this mount points has no links

Attaching the $VAR\_DIR/recovery/directories\_permissions\_owner\_group
, In which the permission and ownership is saved correct. But during the
recovery its saving as "root"

@nirmal21s Try to add `CLONE_ALL_USERS_GROUPS=yes` to your local.conf
file as I think your users and groups were not known within the rescue
environment.

@nirmal21s  
you changed your

Does it mean it did not work?

Now only we are doing the testing with now with
CLONE\_ALL\_USERS\_GROUPS=yes.  
Soon i will update.

@jsmeix  
This option also not worked. But the files under that directory has been
restored with correct permission and ownership.  
Still the directory recreated as root only .  
thinking to try DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER =( '/opt/xxx 1775
myowner mygroup' )  
kindly provide your feedback.

@nirmal21s  
to be able to find out when exactly permissions and ownership changes  
you would need to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because after the ReaR 2.3 release I added a migration mode
confirmation  
directly after restore of the backup (i.e. at beginning of finalize
stage), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758)

In general I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in
released  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with
reasonable effort)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your ReaR version.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

<pre>
Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

To enforce migration mode during `rear recover`  
call in the running ReaR recovery system

<pre>
# export MIGRATION_MODE='true'
</pre>

directly before you call "rear recover".

In MIGRATION\_MODE manual disk layout configuration happens  
via several user dialogs.

In this case in particular the user confirmation dialog after backup
restore  
is of interest that shows up as follows:

<pre>
Confirm restored config files or edit them
1) Confirm it is OK to recreate initrd and reinstall bootloader and continue 'rear recover'
2) Edit restored etc/fstab (/mnt/local/etc/fstab)
3) View restored etc/fstab (/mnt/local/etc/fstab)
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
5) Abort 'rear recover'
</pre>

There select `Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here`  
which gets you into a (sub)-shell where you can inspect the up to that
point  
recreated system below /mnt/local/ and check what permissions and
ownerships  
there are directly after the backup was restored.

FYI  
for another example how to use that you may have a look at  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html)  
cf.

@nirmal21s  
I forgot that in MIGRATION\_MODE there is another user confirmation
dialog  
that should help to find out when exactly those unexpected permissions
and  
ownerships are set.

That other user confirmation dialog happens directly after the disk
layout  
was recreated (i.e. it happens directly before the backup gets
restored).  
That other user confirmation dialog shows up as

<pre>
Confirm the recreated disk layout or go back one step
1) Confirm recreated disk layout and continue 'rear recover'
2) Go back one step to redo disk layout recreation
3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
4) Abort 'rear recover'
</pre>

where you also should select
`Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here`  
and inspect the up to that point recreated system.

@nirmal21s  
things in DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER  
are not created if they already exist, see the  
usr/share/rear/restore/default/900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh  
script (cf. the DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER description in
`default.conf`)  
that is run at the end of the backup restore (i.e. intentionally after
the backup restore)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/default/900\_create\_missing\_directories.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh)  
that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
  # Create only symlinks if the symbolic link name does not yet exist (regardless in what form)
  # so that things that have been already restored from the backup do not get changed here:
...
  # Create only directories if nothing with that name already exists (regardless in what form)
  # so that things that have been already restored from the backup do not get changed here:
</pre>

I.e. DIRECTORY\_ENTRIES\_TO\_RECOVER is only intended to create missing
stuff  
that was not already restored from the backup - it is intentionally not
intended to  
overwrite anything that was restored from the backup.
