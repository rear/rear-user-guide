Implemeted two new general useful functions percent\_encode() and
percent\_decode()  
but currently percent\_encode() fails for me on SLES11-SP4 with GNU bash
version 3.2.57  
in case of UTF-8 encoded strings (hopefully nobody uses a UTF-8 encoded
GPT partition name)  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-359797990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-359797990)

Those functions are used to again support GPT partition names with
blanks and  
re-implemented some quoting hell to provide what parted command line
calls need  
according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-359784102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-359784102)

By the way I additionally  
replaced is\_numeric() with hopefully new more generally usable
functions  
is\_integer() and is\_positive\_integer() that also return a useful
return code  
and I better documented what read\_and\_strip\_file() actually does  
(it also skips lines with leading spaces) and let it return a useful
return code  
to be more generally usable.

Currently it is not tested.  
I did the pull request nevertheless so that you can have an early look.

@gdha  
many thanks for testing it!

Also for me it works well.

After "rear recover" I got on the recreated system

<pre>
 # parted -l

</pre>

Same GPT partition names on sdb but the partitions on sdb moved.  
I assume that happened because during "rear recover" it printed

<pre>
Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)
Switching to manual disk layout configuration
</pre>

i.e. I got MIGRATION\_MODE=true and I accepted the subsequent dialogs
"as is".  
I was wondering why it detected "Ambiguous possible target disks"  
because on both systems there is a 20GiB sda and a 2 GiB sdb  
so that there should not be "Ambiguous possible target disks".  
Looking at the code in layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh
shows

<pre>
    # MIGRATION_MODE is needed when more than one possible target disk exists for a disk on the original system:
    if test "$found_orig_size_on_replacement_hardware" -gt 1 ; then
        LogPrint "Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)"
        MIGRATION_MODE='true'
    fi
</pre>

so that there is a (minor) issue in 250\_compare\_disks.sh  
(that is not related to this issue here) that somehow
250\_compare\_disks.sh  
detects more than one possible target disks with same size  
even if actually there is only one target disk with same size.  
I guess this happens because the same disks can be detected  
several times under different "names" or something like that.  
But the good news is that 250\_compare\_disks.sh bahaves  
on the safe side:  
Better too often detect "Ambiguous possible target disks"  
than to blindly proceed and be sorry when it is too late.

The percent-encoded GPT partition name `UTF-8%20name%20bin%C3%A4r`

I.e. I replaced in diskrestore.sh the UTF-8 encoded 'binär' by the ASCII

You probably get this message

    +++ parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart ''\''UTF-8 name bin<C3><A4>r'\''' 12587008B 23072767B
    Error during translation: Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character

as a result of not setting the locale during recovery. Parted tries to
convert your partition name into a wide-character string. If the locale
(more specifically, the `LC_CTYPE` category) is set to `C`, your
argument is an invalid string which cannot be converted.

Could you try again by setting `LC_CTYPE` on your recovery system to the
same value that was used during `rear mkrescue` and make sure the
respective locale files are present during recovery?

@OliverO2  
I also assume the reason is the inappropriate locale when running parted
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-361557086](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-361557086)

Note that current ReaR uses the POSIX/C locale in any case  
(because that locale is set in any case in usr/sbin/rear)  
i.e. both during "rear mkrescue" and during "rear recover".

This even might mean that - strictly speaking - there might be  
a bug in parted if parted in POSIX/C locale would not output  
non-ASCII characters in a GPT partition name in an "appropriate way"  
so that parted's own GPT partition name output in POSIX/C locale  
could be later used "as is" as input for parted in POSIX/C locale  
to (re)-create a partition what that same GPT partition name.

This pull request is done because its intent was only  
to again support partition names with blanks but  
not to support partition names with non-ASCII characters.

I filed a new issue "Implement support for UTF-8 encoded values in
ReaR"

Don't know if conforming to the [POSIX Portable Character Set
standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) should be
called a bug, but at least one could wish for such a plain ASCII-encoded
output.

Actually, there seems to be a real bug in parted with respect to
character set translations: It uses the C language's wide character type
to convert arguments into GPT partition names (which should be UTF-16
encoded). Quoting Wikipedia: ["The width of wchar\_t is
compiler-specific and can be as small as 8 bits. Consequently, programs
that need to be portable across any C or C++ compiler should not use
wchar\_t for storing Unicode text. The wchar\_t type is intended for
storing compiler-defined wide characters, which may be Unicode
characters in some
compilers."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_character)

@OliverO2  
I do not understand what you like to say regarding  
the POSIX Portable Character Set because  
I think that is even a sub-set of ASCII according to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable\_character\_set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_character_set)  
and the "Reference" listed therein?

@jsmeix  
It's just that POSIX allows, but does not require support for characters
outside the portable character set in the "C" locale. Parted uses the
POSIX-conformant standard library function *mbsrtowcs(3)* so its actual
behavior depends of the respective standard library implementation. You
could still call this limitation a but do you have to?

@OliverO2  
many thanks for the link  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649165/behavior-of-extended-bytes-characters-in-c-posix-locale](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649165/behavior-of-extended-bytes-characters-in-c-posix-locale)  
that reads (excerpt)

<pre>
C and POSIX both require only a very limited set
of characters be present in the C/POSIX locale,
but allow additional characters to exist.
This leaves a great deal of freedom to the
implementation; for instance, supporting
all of Unicode (as UTF-8) in the C locale
is conforming behavior.
</pre>

Now I understand that it is POSIX conforming behavior  
when a tool (e.g. parted) that is run in POSIX locale  
outputs non-ASCII characters e.g. in UTF-8 encoding  
(or in anything else - whatever each particular tool likes).

Welcome to the "warm feeling" in encoding hell ;-)
