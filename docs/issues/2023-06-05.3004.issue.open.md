[\#3004 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3004) `open`: Merge / Rebase master before merging PRs?
==========================================================================================================

**Labels**: `discuss / RFC`, `ReaR Project`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) opened issue at [2023-06-05 12:43](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3004):

@pcahyna raised the question why I like to merge / rebase master into a
PR branch before merging that branch into master.

Here is my reasoning:

-   GH let's us merge a branch if there are not git merge conflicts, but
    that doesn't tell us if the code will continue to work with current
    master
-   Merging / rebasing onto master **before** merging the PR branch
    allows GH to run all the checks and actions on the codebase that
    would be the result of merging the PR into master. That means that
    we get a higher confidence that ReaR will continue to work after
    merging the PR.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003)
is a nice example for this, the change in the `Makefile` has an impact
on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/62b9afac5c2aba542075c3692cf93a0fe280c8a2/.github/workflows/build-packages.yml\#L26-L30](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/62b9afac5c2aba542075c3692cf93a0fe280c8a2/.github/workflows/build-packages.yml#L26-L30)
which can be observed only after I merged current master because at the
same time I fixed a but in this workflow that prevented it from working.

Therefore I'd like to propose to *always* merge/rebase master before
merging a PR branch.

Let's talk about this here, what would be reasons against doing this?

I am not too concerned by this problem, in my experience it does not
happen often in practice.

If you want to be on the safe side, I prefer to rebase the PR branch on
top of the current master rather than merging master to the PR branch.
The additional merge clutters the history a bit.  
Rebasing the PR branch before merging is often advisable anyway, because
one may need to improve commit messages and/or squash commits that
correct mistakes in previous changes into the commits that they fix (to
avoid cluttering the final history with commits like "do A" and then
"correct the mistakes made while doing A").

I wonder if it could be rather confusing when  
(at a possibly longer time after a PR was merged)  
others who like to understand what a PR was about  
(e.g. to analyze if a PR is the reason for a regression)  
see additional commits in a PR that do not belong  
to the actually intended code changes of a PR:

When I look at the recent

is not confusing.

When I look at the merge commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd)  
it only shows the actually intended code changes of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003)  
i.e.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd)  
shows the same as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3003/files)

In particular the additional changes in the PR  
because of the "Merge branch 'master' ..." commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7122a911be8eea685a421be0461bf9d398c4b2cc](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7122a911be8eea685a421be0461bf9d398c4b2cc)  
do not appear in the merge commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29f51855f36d6a0152a691fcab1d6224642a6ffd)

So I think additional changes in a PR  
because of a "Merge branch 'master' ..." commit  
are not confusing when others like to understand  
what a PR was about (i.e. after a PR was merged).

Now I am wondering if it could be rather confusing  
while a PR is "work in progress" (i.e. before it is merged)

Well, maybe it is not confusing when thinking about what the PR was
about, but it still needs additional brain power if you need to decipher
the history in detail because of more parallel lines in your "git log
--graph" output that one will need to keep track of when reading it. It
becomes much more difficult to determine which line of development (with
all its commits) belonged to the PR and which belonged to the master
branch or another branches. I.e. I now have to think whether the commit
`jsmeix@suse.com 62b9afac5c2aba542075c3692cf93a0fe280c8a2 Mon Jun 5 13:44:07 2023 +0200`
belongs to the PR or not. In this case, it is fairly easy, because there
are not many commits and I recognize my own name in the PR branch. But
think about the possibility where there are long-running branches with
many other commits happening in the meantime, and you don't recognize
the names of their authors.

100% agree that rebasing is much better than merging, need to see if the
"Update" button on GitHub can be configured to rebase instead of merge.

I was not really "confused", but having an unrelated (merge) commit
appearing in my branch is certainly a bit of complication.

For me asking the PR author to rebase would be the best option. Doing it
for them (using WebUI or otherwise) would be confusing for the PR author
who might be working on the branch in the meantime and now is forced to
update and rebase their unpushed changes etc.

On my current
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006)  
I see near the bottom

    This branch has no conflicts with the base branch     [ Update branch | v ]
    Merging can be performed automatically. 

Clicking the 'v' of the "\[ Update branch | v \]" button shows

    [V] Update with merge commit
        ...
    [ ] Update with rebase
        ...

where "Update with merge commit" is preselected.

I do not want to play around with that on my current active  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006)  
because I do not want to get things somehow  
changed in my PR in possibly unexpected ways.
