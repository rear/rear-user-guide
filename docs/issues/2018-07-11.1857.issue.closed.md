I use the current ReaR master code.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593)  
"rear recover" goes by default into MIGRATION\_MODE  
if an ambiguous disk layout is detected i.e. when there is  
more than one disk with same size in disklayout.conf

In this case "rear recover" looks like:

<pre>
Comparing disks
Ambiguous disk layout needs manual configuration (more than one disk with same size used in '/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf')
Switching to manual disk layout configuration
Using /dev/sda (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/sda
Using /dev/sdb (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/sdb
Current disk mapping table (source -> target):
    /dev/sda /dev/sda
    /dev/sdb /dev/sdb
UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 211
Confirm or edit the disk mapping
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
4) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
</pre>

When now the user confirms that proposed identical mapping  
he gets still all the other subsequent dialogs in MIGRATION\_MODE  
regardless that a completely identical layout mapping usually means  
that actually no MIGRATION\_MODE is wanted.

Therefore that "Confirm or edit the disk mapping" dialog  
in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
should be enhanced when a completely identical layout mapping is shown  
by one more choice where the user can confirm that proposed identical
mapping  
plus disabling MIGRATION\_MODE (i.e. setting MIGRATION\_MODE='false').

A quick fast initial hack in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
worked o.k. fo me.

But I noticed that there is likely an inconsistency in the ReaR code  
how currently is tested whether or not migration mode is active:  
Some scripts test

<pre>
is_true "$MIGRATION_MODE" || return 0
</pre>

while other scripts - in particular some finalize scripts - test

<pre>
test -s "$MAPPING_FILE" || return 0
</pre>

to skip the rest of the script when not in migration mode.  
I will also clean up how for migration mode is tested.

FYI:  
My primary use case is "rear recover" on a RAID1 system that uses  
two disks with same size and same sized partitions where RAID1 arrays  
are built from each of the partition pairs on my original system:

<pre>
# lsblk -i -p -o NAME,KNAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
NAME         KNAME     TYPE  FSTYPE             SIZE MOUNTPOINT
/dev/sda     /dev/sda  disk                      20G 
|-/dev/sda1  /dev/sda1 part  linux_raid_member    2G 
| `-/dev/md0 /dev/md0  raid1 swap                 2G [SWAP]
|-/dev/sda2  /dev/sda2 part  linux_raid_member   10G 
| `-/dev/md1 /dev/md1  raid1 ext4                10G /
`-/dev/sda3  /dev/sda3 part  linux_raid_member    5G 
  `-/dev/md2 /dev/md2  raid1 xfs                  5G /home
/dev/sdb     /dev/sdb  disk                      20G 
|-/dev/sdb1  /dev/sdb1 part  linux_raid_member    2G 
| `-/dev/md0 /dev/md0  raid1 swap                 2G [SWAP]
|-/dev/sdb2  /dev/sdb2 part  linux_raid_member   10G 
| `-/dev/md1 /dev/md1  raid1 ext4                10G /
`-/dev/sdb3  /dev/sdb3 part  linux_raid_member    5G 
  `-/dev/md2 /dev/md2  raid1 xfs                  5G /home
/dev/sr0     /dev/sr0  rom   iso9660            3.6G
</pre>

There I get during "rear recover" the above shown proposed identical
mapping table  
that I like to confirm only once plus disabling any further
MIGRATION\_MODE stuff.

What I get with some enhancements in
layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh is:

<pre>
Current disk mapping table (source => target):
  /dev/sda => /dev/sda
  /dev/sdb => /dev/sdb
UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 246
Confirm or edit the disk mapping
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration
3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
5) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
2
UserInput: Valid choice number result 'Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration'
User confirmed identical disk mapping and proceeding without manual configuration
</pre>

and from that point it "just works" without any further migration mode
dialog.

When there is a non-identical disk mapping the choices are:

<pre>
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) n/a
3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
5) Abort 'rear recover'
</pre>
