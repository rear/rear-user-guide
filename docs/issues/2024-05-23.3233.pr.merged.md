-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    High impact when needed to avoid endless searching  
    for the root cause when booting fails in inexplicable ways  
    on POWER when the initrd is too big.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3189)

-   How was this pull request tested?

To test on my x86\_64 system I used additionally

    if test "$ARCH" = "Linux-i386" || ...

plus `BACKUP=TSM` and got:

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue

    Saving result files with TSM

The error is because I do not have TSM installed.

@jsmeix do you know what is the panic message (or in general relevant
kernel messages) when this happens? In the whole \#3189 I can't find it.

    Verify that your ReaR recovery system boots on your replacement hardware.
    If it fails to boot consider the following:
    REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION='lzma' for better (but slower) initrd compression
    MODULES=('loaded_modules') to include less kernel modules in the initrd

I could only test on x86\_64 architecture  
i.e. on a VM on my homeoffice workstation.  
There I added

    if test "$ARCH" = "Linux-i386" || ...

see my above test reports.  
I cannot test on POWER machine - at least not  
with efforts that are reasonable in practice for me.  
But perhaps @pcahyna could test on a POWER machine?  
Perhaps he has direct access to a POWER machine?

@jsmeix regardless of the testing I'd appreciate it if we could move the
arch-dependent code into separate scripts, if anyhow possible.

OTOH, maybe there is a general limit on the initramfs size, as [this
blog
article](https://www.lightofdawn.org/blog/?viewDetailed=00128#:~:text=Which%20means%2C%20if%20you%20use,or%2025%25%20of%20your%20RAM)
suggests. In that case I'd be happy to see a generic implementation of
initramfs size checking with a default setting to 50% of RAM, that would
be overridden for PPC or ARM to something suitable smaller.

@schlomo @pcahyna  
I'm afraid, currently I don't have time for it  
because of maintenance updates for SLES,  
a.k.a. "customers first" ;-)

I have no good idea how to properly separate  
arch-dependent code away into separate scripts  
and still keep the code easy to understand, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

My reasoning:

As far as I understand how separeated  
arch-dependent script directories work  
the execution logic is basically like

    if ARCH = specific_arch
       then source specific_arch-dependent.script
    endif

so the code in `specific_arch-dependent.script`  
is run **only** for **one specific** architecture.

But what is needed in particular in this case here is

Nested Conditions:

    if OTHER_CONDITION
       then if ARCH = specific_arch
               then specific_arch-dependent code
               else generic code
            endif
            other condition code
    endif

as in (shortened code excerpts)

    case "$REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION" in
        (lz4)
            if [[ "$ARCH" == "Linux-s390" ]] ; then
                REAR_INITRD_FILENAME=$VM_UID".initrd"
            else
                REAR_INITRD_FILENAME="initrd.lz4"
            fi
            lz4 related code
            ;;
        (lzma)
            if [[ "$ARCH" == "Linux-s390" ]] ; then
                REAR_INITRD_FILENAME=$VM_UID".initrd"
            else
                REAR_INITRD_FILENAME="initrd.xz"
            fi
            xz related code
            ;;

AND

Multiple Archs:

    if ARCH = this_arch OR ARCH = that_arch
       then this_or_that_arch-dependent code
    endif

as in

    if test "$ARCH" = "Linux-ppc64" || test "$ARCH" = "Linux-ppc64le" ; then

To implement "Nested Conditions"  
via arch-dependent separated scripts  
I would have to duplicate the OTHER\_CONDITION test  
in each arch-dependent separated script.

To implement "Multiple Archs"  
via arch-dependent separated scripts  
I would have to implement as many separated scripts  
as there are archs or at least use multiple symlinks.

Separating arch-dependent code is against  
to "keep together what belongs together" and  
it is against "implement one thing only once"  
and both would make the code as a whole  
harder to read and even harder to understand  
because the meaning of the code as a whole  
was artificially split up into parts  
which makes it needlessly hard to reassemble  
its overall meaning from its separated parts.

Additionally there is a generic issue with  
"Multiple Conditions"  
for example like

    if ( CONDITION1 AND NOT CONDITION2 ) OR CONDITION3

when some of those conditions should be separated  
out into condition-dependant scripts.

In general I am wondering about:  
Why separating certain kind of conditioned code away  
into certain-condition-dependant scripts at all?  
What is the real advantage of it (for us and our users)?  
We have the same with Linux-distribution-dependent code.  
Why separating Linux-distribution-dependent code away?  
What is the crucial difference that makes an arch condition  
or a Linux-distribution condition different compared  
to any other condition?  
How to properly deal with "Nested Conditions"  
and "Multiple Conditions"  
via certain-condition-dependent scripts?

@jsmeix @pcahyna Can we change the milestone to "3.1"? Or, is this a
blocker for "3.0"?

The curent implementation works  
as far as it is implemented  
so it could be merged as is.

What is questioned is if the curent implementation  
is the best way how to implement it and  
if a more generic test could be implemented  
but that is not something I could do  
(no time for more advanced things).

We could make an additional issue for improvements if required.

@jsmeix typically we would have to further modularize the code so that
we break it up into smaller pieces, and then some of these smaller
pieces go into the arch-dependent subfolders
