We decided ages ago to have indentation use 4 spaces. Currently the
indentation is a mix of various personal styles.

During the reorganization we could do a re-indentation as well. By doing
this together we avoid introducing errors or merge-conflicts with other
changes. We probably also want to change other Bash constructs as we
discussed (using \[\[ \]\] and (( )), use of LogIfError/BugIfError,
etc.)
