It fixes issues when we want to restore again after an incomplete layout
restoration.

This does not look correct to me. If the restore fails after LVM has
been recreated, in fs for example, ReaR should continue where it failed
after fixing disklayout/diskrestore. With this PR, it would deactivate
some VGs which were correctly created while the rest of the restore
script expects them to be available.

I don't know an easy solution to this...

Yes, you're right, after some investigation, there isn't a proper way to
handle that and it has to be done manually.
