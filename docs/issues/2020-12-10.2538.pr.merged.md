-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR enables `rear mkrescue` when used with the **RAWDISK** output
method to install the rescue/recovery system directly to one or more
local disk partitions.

This is particularly useful on systems with redundant disks where a
malfunction of one disk can be recovered via a rescue system available
on another disk. It is also useful for testing as a separate
rescue/recovery medium is no longer necessary.

##### Usage

1.  Enable `RAWDISK` output.
2.  Prepare one or more rescue partitions on local disk(s)
    -   with an appropriate size (e.g. 1 GiB),
    -   either empty or with a VFAT file system (which will be
        overwritten),
    -   ideally identified as EFI system partition,
            sgdisk --typecode=$partnum:ef00 ...

    -   with a specific partition name like `Rescue System`, e.g. via
            sgdisk --change-name="$partnum:Rescue System" ...
3.  Set the configuration variable accordingly, e.g. in `local.conf`:
        RAWDISK_INSTALL_GPT_PARTITION_NAME='Rescue System'

4.  When configured like this, each `rear mkrescue` invocation will
    install the rescue/recovery system to the respective disk
    partitions. This occurs in addition to creating and distributing the
    disk image as directed by the `OUTPUT_URL` variable.

##### Example Configuration

    OUTPUT=RAWDISK
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    RAWDISK_INSTALL_GPT_PARTITION_NAME='Rescue System'

At some point during testing, code blocks apparently switched their
position. The section

    ### Unmount the boot partition, release the loop device

appeared before

    ### Copy the EFI boot partition to local disk partitions named "$RAWDISK_INSTALL_GPT_PARTITION_NAME" if configured

5aceaa5 fixes this, adds error checking for `dd`, and provides more
output in the log file. This is a simulation of the previous situation
(loop device missing) but with the fixed code output:

    Installing the EFI rescue system to partitions labeled 'Rescue System'

    ERROR: Could not copy the EFI rescue system to partition '/dev/sda2'

Previously, I had relied on ReaR's former behavior of stderr output
appearing in the log file at all times. So I checked the log file to
convince myself that all was working well. However, since \#2498 stderr
no longer appears in the log unless debugscript mode is turned on, and I
missed to spot the problem.
