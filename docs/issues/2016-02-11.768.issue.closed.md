Noticed there is a rear 1.17.x for SLES 10 but there was a mention that
SLES 10 was not longer supported. Which version should we be using for
SLES 10 recoveries?

Does the REAR ISO rescue image support the ability to recover image when
recovering on different hardware? ( Example : Created REAR ISO image on
SUN hardware but then try to restore on HP Blade? - network drivers
different - will REAR ISO have drivers for HP even if image was created
with SUN hardware )

From SUSE there is no official support for rear on SLE10.  
SUSE supports rear on SLE11-HAE and SLE12-HAE  
(i.e. not on plain SLE but only via the HA extension).

Regarding support from Relax-and-Recover upstream see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/support/](http://relax-and-recover.org/support/)

In general regarding rear and in particular regarding  
"different hardware" see

In general the rear recovery system on the ISO is specific  
for each particular system where it was created.

In general there is currently no such thing as a  
generic "full featured" rear recovery system  
(that should boot and run on basically any hardware).

Regarding the future about this you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732)
and at the section "Using rear as generic installer in any installation
system" in
