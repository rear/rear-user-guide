-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Use

    { SECRET COMMAND ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

instead of

    { SECRET COMMAND ; } 2>/dev/null

Reasoning:  
See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1562732484](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1562732484)  
that reads (excerpt):

    the

    { ... ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

    syntax makes it clear which redirections are
    explicitly meant to hide secrets to distinguish them
    from usual unwanted output discard via '2>/dev/null'

This is not a critical issue  
because before there was already 2&gt;/dev/null  
so nothing leaked into the log.
