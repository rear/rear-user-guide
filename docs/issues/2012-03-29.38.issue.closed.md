As mentioned often on the mailinglist we need to have automated testing
infrastructure and a defined set of supported targets in order to
guarantee a certain level of stability and find distribution-specific
regressions.

There are a few upcoming stuff we would like to improve which is going
to be a major pain without such infrastructure, notably:

-   reorganizing the source structure (\#5) **partly solved**
-   standardize bash syntax for the better (\#6)
-   getting rid of the /usr/lib and /usr/bin symlink (\#36) **already
    solved**
-   redesign OUTPUT\_URL and BACKUP\_URL logic (\#37)
-   fix identation and cosmetic changes (\#57)

So let's start discussing the list of supported targets, and what is
required for the ideal automated testing infrastructure.

Let the games begin !

Automated testing infrastructure
--------------------------------

### Requirements

-   Orchestrate: build VM, run `rear mkbackup`, reboot VM using rescue
    image and recover VM (using Ansible)
-   Provide answers non-interactively when needed
-   Centralize all log-files (for future reference/analysis)
-   Verify the original system against the restored system (compare VMs)
-   Send out email when system fails (anywhere) -&gt; requires
    modifications so that Rear can mail log on error

### Variations

-   Do the same with smaller/larger target VMs
-   Use different system configurations
    -   e.g. LVM, filesystems, SWRAID
-   Use different boot media
    -   e.g. ISO, PXE, tape, USB
-   Use different backup strategies
    -   e.g. TAPE, NFS, CIFS, rsync, USB, ...

Support targets
---------------

### Supported distributions

Supported distributions are distributions that have a low probability to
break (Enterprise distributions) and have a large userbase and number of
contributors. Due to limited access to hardware, only x86 and x86\_64
architectures are supported at this time.

-   Debian 6
-   RHEL4 - Still supported until 2015 - @dagwieers
-   RHEL5 - Large userbase, still supported until 2017 - @dagwieers
-   RHEL6 - Growing userbase, still supported until 2020 - @dagwieers
-   SLES 11 SP2
-   Ubuntu LTS 10.04
-   Ubuntu LTS 12.04

### Tested distributions

Tested distributions are distributions that have some interest from
contributors so we can guarantee that regressions are being fixed.

-   Arch - @jhoekx
-   Fedora - @gdha
-   Gentoo
-   Ubuntu
-   OpenSUSE

Please add your distribution(s) here, when applicable add version and
contributor names.

The BAREOS team has implemented automated testing for rear with bareos.
It is at least better then nothing so far.
