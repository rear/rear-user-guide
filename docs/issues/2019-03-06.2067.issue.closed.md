### Versions

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4
-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

### Scenario

-   Configuration:

    -   `/etc/fstab`:
            UUID=... / btrfs defaults,noatime,subvol=@ 0 1
            UUID=... /volumes/01 btrfs defaults,noatime,subvolid=0 0 0

    -   Btrfs volume structure:
            /volumes/01        -  Btrfs top-level subvolume (subvolid 5, mountable via subvolid=0)
            /volumes/01/@      -  Btrfs subvolume mounted at /

-   Sequence of events:

    1.  Prepared an OS release upgrade:
        1.  `cd /volumes/01`
        2.  `mkdir release-upgrade`
        3.  `btrfs subvolume snapshot @ "release-upgrade/@-$(date -Isecond)-pre-release-upgrade"`
    2.  Started the OS release upgrade (on Ubuntu `do-release-upgrade`)
    3.  Release upgrade failed
    4.  Recovered the previous state:
        1.  Booted into recovery mode
        2.  Rolled back the root file system (/):
            1.  `cd /volumes/01`
            2.  `mv @ "release-upgrade/@-$(date -Isecond)-broken-release-upgrade"`
            3.  `btrfs subvolume snapshot release-upgrade/@-*-pre-release-upgrade @`
        3.  Rebooted

-   Consequence: The system now has its root file system on a subvolume
    named `@` which has not been created by `btrfs subvolume create` but
    by `btrfs subvolume snapshot`.

-   Trying to recover that system with ReaR produced the following
    results:

    -   ReaR recreated only the original Btrfs subvolume:
            # btrfs subvol list /mnt/local/volumes/01
            ID 257 gen 13 top level 5 path release-upgrade/@-2019-02-09T12:28:54+01:00-broken-18.04

    -   ReaR refused to recover the current snapshot subvolume named
        `@`, which acted as `/`.

-   In \#556, ReaR gained code to handle a similar situation, but this
    is limited to SLES12.

### Background

-   From [Manpage/btrfs-subvolume - btrfs
    Wiki](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume):

    > A snapshot is a subvolume like any other, with given initial
    > content.

-   From [SysadminGuide - btrfs
    Wiki](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SysadminGuide):

    > A Btrfs filesystem has a default subvolume, which is initially set
    > to be the top-level subvolume and which is mounted if no subvol or
    > subvolid option is specified.

### Suggestions

-   Since the above sequence of events is a perfectly legal way to roll
    back a system, ReaR should be able to handle such a system later on
    without extra intervention.

-   ReaR should not make assumptions about subvolumes the way it
    currently does:

    -   ReaR should not attribute any meaning to the way a subvolume was
        created (empty or as a snapshot).
    -   ReaR should not attribute any meaning to the *default subvolume*
        (it is really just a way to shorten the list of mount options
        required).

-   ReaR should recreate Btrfs subvolumes which are mounted via
    `/etc/fstab`. Regardles of whether these were originally empty or
    started as a snapshot, they can be recreated with
    `btrfs subvolume create` and their contents expected to be restored
    from a backup.

-   Hopefully, if we concentrate on recreating mounted Btrfs subvolumes
    only and ignore everything else, the entire Btrfs recreation code
    could be greatly simplified. Would this break anything currently
    useful?

@OliverO2  
only a short initial notice:

The current btrfs support in ReaR is basically an add-on hack  
as needed for SLES and RHEL.  
In particular for SLES: ReaR works with the btrfs snapshotting  
as it is done there (via snapper).

I think 90% of what can be done individually with btrfs  
is currently not supported in ReaR.

Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028)
in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028\#issuecomment-463193378](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028#issuecomment-463193378)  
and follow the links therein and see the "FYI" part in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791\#issuecomment-406513969](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791#issuecomment-406513969)

Because of newest storage features in SLES like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2057](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2057)  
we may need to completely overhaul the layout code  
rather sonner than later...

@OliverO2  
I assume since your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079)
is merged  
this issue was fixed for your use case and I hope it still works for
you  
since my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080)
is merged  
so that I can close this issue hereby for now  
regardless that btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic()  
needs some enhancements to make it work everywhere, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080\#issuecomment-472448686](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080#issuecomment-472448686)  
and subsequent comments - but that is something for the future.

@OliverO2  
thank you for continuously testing ReaR on current Ubuntu versions and  
for your enhancements that make things work on new Ubuntu versions!
