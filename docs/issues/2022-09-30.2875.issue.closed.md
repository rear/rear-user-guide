[\#2875 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2875) `closed`: Optimizing for speed when rsync is in use
============================================================================================================

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `no-issue-activity`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43404795?v=4" width="50">[fadamo](https://github.com/fadamo) opened issue at [2022-09-30 11:05](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2875):

By backing up the system via rsync, the process involves:

    if test -d "${opath}" ; then
        rm -rf $v "${opath}.old" || Error "Could not remove '${opath}.old'"
        mv -f $v "${opath}" "${opath}.old" || Error "Could not move '${opath}'"
    fi

So, basically, we have to wait for minutes (we save on NAS) due to "rm
-rf" and many minutes due to rsync starting from scratch.  
We found that modifying the code with something like:

    if [ ! -d "${opath}" ]; then
        mkdir -p $v -m 0750 "${opath}"
        rm -Rf "${opath}.old"                # if exists
    elif [ -d "${opath}.old" ]; then
        mv "${opath}.old" "${opath}.veryold"
        mv "${opath}" "${opath}.old"
        # better to update an old copy rather then starting from scratch (rsync --delete --delete-excluded is in use)
        mv "${opath}.veryold" "${opath}"
    else
        mv "${opath}" "${opath}.old"
        mkdir -p $v -m 0750 "${opath}"
    fi

we are able to backup a server in a couple of minutes.  
What do you think about? Can the modification be considered?

@fadamo could you please be more specific? What backup method and
BACKUP\_URL are you using? And which file does "the code" refer to?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43404795?v=4" width="50">[fadamo](https://github.com/fadamo) commented at [2022-09-30 12:18](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2875#issuecomment-1263500088):

We use this config:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=rsync://USER@NAS::/rear-nfs
    BACKUP=RSYNC
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://USER@NAS::/rear-nfs
    RSYNC_PROTO=rsync
    BACKUP_PROG=rsync

and actually we do this:

    mount $BASEPATH
    if [ ! -d $BASEPATH/$SRV ]; then
        mkdir -m 750 $BASEPATH/$SRV
        rm -Rf "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV".old
    elif [ -d $BASEPATH/"$SRV".old ]; then
        mv "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV".old "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV".veryold
        mv "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV" "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV".old
        # meglio aggiornare una vecchia copia che copiare tutto
        mv "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV".veryold "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV"
    else
        mv "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV" "$BASEPATH"/"$SRV".old
        mkdir -m 750 $BASEPATH/$SRV
    fi
    umount $BASEPATH

for every server before calling rear.

We have a lot of limitation by our security deparment, there is a
firewall between servers and NAS..... a long story. We had to implement
a complex configuration.  
BTW, in the past I did some test on lab servers, modifying
/usr/share/rear/output/default/150\_save\_copy\_of\_prefix\_dir.sh and
probably
/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/150\_save\_copy\_of\_prefix\_dir.sh,
too.  
The concept is not to start from scratch when rsync is in use.  
FYI, this is the log of the backup of an Oracle server:

We have also another kind of configuration for which I'm extracting some
info:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://NAS/VOL06/LNX/REAR
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="rsize=65536,wsize=65536,tcp,hard"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://NAS/VOL06/LNX/REAR
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="rsize=65536,wsize=65536,tcp,hard"
    BACKUP_PROG=rsync

OK, try this configuration:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://NAS/VOL06/LNX/REAR
    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="rsize=65536,wsize=65536,tcp,hard"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://NAS/VOL06/LNX/REAR
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="rsize=65536,wsize=65536,tcp,hard"
    BACKUP_PROG=rsync
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=y

Modify these files:

    [root@server2backup:~]# cat /usr/share/rear/output/default/150_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh  
    # if KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY is not empty then move old OUTPUT_PREFIX directory to OUTPUT_PREFIX.old

    [ -z "${KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY}" ] && return

    # do not do this for tapes and special attention for file:///path
    local scheme=$( url_scheme $OUTPUT_URL )
    local path=$( url_path $OUTPUT_URL )

    # if filesystem access to url is unsupported return silently (e.g. scheme tape)
    scheme_supports_filesystem $scheme || return 0

    local opath=$( output_path $scheme $path )

    # an old lockfile from a previous run not cleaned up by output is possible
    [[ -f ${opath}/.lockfile ]] && rm -f ${opath}/.lockfile >&2

    #if test -d "${opath}" ; then
    #    rm -rf $v "${opath}.old" || Error "Could not remove '${opath}.old'"
    #    # below statement was 'cp -af' instead of 'mv -f' (see issue #192)
    #    mv -f $v "${opath}" "${opath}.old" || Error "Could not move '${opath}'"
    #fi

    set -ex
    if [ ! -d "${opath}" ]; then
        mkdir -p $v -m 0750 "${opath}"
        rm -Rf "${opath}.old"                # if exists
    elif [ -d "${opath}.old" ]; then
        mv "${opath}.old" "${opath}.veryold"
        mv "${opath}" "${opath}.old"
        # better to update an old copy rather then starting from scratch
        mv "${opath}.veryold" "${opath}"
    else
        mv "${opath}" "${opath}.old"
        mkdir -p $v -m 0750 "${opath}"
    fi
    set +ex

    # the ${BUILD_DIR}/outputfs/${OUTPUT_PREFIX} will be created by output/default/200_make_prefix_dir.sh

    [root@server2backup:/var/log/rear]# cat  /usr/share/rear/output/default/200_make_prefix_dir.sh

    # Create $OUTPUT_PREFIX directory.
    # The $OUTPUT_PREFIX directory defaults to $HOSTNAME.
    #
    # This happens usually under a mounted network filesystem share
    # e.g. in case of OUTPUT_URL=nfs://NFS.server.IP.address/remote/nfs/share
    # but it is also happens for local stuff like OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    #
    # Do not do this for tapes and special attention for file:///path
    local scheme=$( url_scheme $OUTPUT_URL )
    local path=$( url_path $OUTPUT_URL )

    # If filesystem access to url is unsupported return silently (e.g. scheme tape)
    scheme_supports_filesystem $scheme || return 0

    local opath=$( output_path $scheme $path )

    # Create $OUTPUT_PREFIX sub-directory:
    if [ ! -d "${opath}" ]; then
        mkdir -p $v -m0750 "${opath}" && return
    else
        return 0
    fi

    # A failure to create the $OUTPUT_PREFIX sub-directory is fatal:
    Error "Failed to create '$opath' directory for OUTPUT_URL=$OUTPUT_URL"

then run 3 times

    time rear -Ddv mkbackup

In my case:

    1st:    # No backup present
    real    12m8.235s
    user    1m34.092s
    sys     1m17.382s

    2nd:    # Only 1 backup present
    real    15m10.871s
    user    1m33.559s
    sys     1m17.733s

    3rd:    # 2 backup presents
    real    1m52.441s
    user    1m0.933s
    sys     0m30.103s

I don't know if it's correct to modify files in
/usr/share/rear/output/default, probably it should be better to use
something like /usr/share/rear/output/NETFS (or RSYNC). BTW updating an
old backup is much more convenient when using rsync.

Thank you for the information, and what version of ReaR is this? A log
above shows 2.4, is that the case also for the version you are
experimenting with?

Yes, we are using 2.4 (RHEL 7) and 2.6 (RHEL 8). I checked the latest
files (on github) and are still the same I have.
