    RESCUE xrearm3d:~ # rear -V
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git

    [root@xrearm3d rear]# cat /etc/redhat-release
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.2 (Maipo)

    [root@xrearm3d rear]# cat local.conf
    # Default is to create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
    # set OUTPUT to change that
    # set BACKUP to activate an automated (backup and) restore of your data
    # Possible configuration values can be found in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    #
    # This file (local.conf) is intended for manual configuration. For configuration
    # through packages and other automated means we recommend creating a new
    # file named site.conf next to this file and to leave the local.conf as it is.
    # Our packages will never ship with a site.conf.
    # John L added the lines below.
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT_URL=sshfs://root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xx/dbar/
    BACKUP_URL=sshfs://root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xx/dbar/
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/media' '/var/tmp' '/var/crash')

When doing a OS recovery the process will stop because the "fuse" kernel
module doesn't load. The workaround is to issue "modprobe fuse" then
start the recovery. This is not an issue with RHEL6.  
Do I need to configure anything different for RHEL7?

Below is a cut and paste from the log.

Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 is rather old  
(from August 2015).

I think this issue should be fixed in current ReaR with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c1e962855a3e477093caa63cdd7602a76a801f72](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c1e962855a3e477093caa63cdd7602a76a801f72)

This was committed on 7 Jul 2016 so that it  
should be fixed since ReaR version 1.19.0 (October 2016).

@John-Leone If you have a RHEL support contract create a ticket with
RedHat and request a newer rear version (and refer to RHBZ\#1355667 -
Rebase rear to newer version ). The more people ask for it, then the RH
engineers will make some time to test out rear-2.00 and validate it for
RHEL 7.2

Thank you; I will do what you recommend.  
Also, we are waiting for (MANUAL\_INCLUDE= fix) rear-2.1 coming in May.

@John-Leone  
I don't know about a "fix" for MANUAL\_INCLUDE  
that is planned for the next ReaR version?

I only know about  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019\#issuecomment-271077493](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019#issuecomment-271077493)  
which is about to get rid of MANUAL\_INCLUDE provided  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE plus BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE plus BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
can be used as a replacement for what MANUAL\_INCLUDE  
is intended to be used.

So I should be able to use BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( ) to backup only the
file systems that are specified in the statement, correct? It
essentially works like MANUAL\_INCLUDE.  
Let me know if Iâ€™m mistaken.

@John-Leone  
let's not misuse this issue which is about sshfs and fuse  
for issues about MANUAL\_INCLUDE.  
I think I already answered your above question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019\#issuecomment-264132715](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1019#issuecomment-264132715)  
therein see in particular the "How it works" part at the end  
or even better see directly the documentation in default.conf  
in the curent GitHub master code:  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

I just heard back from RedHat and the target to rebase ReaR to either
1.19 or 2.0 is RHEL 7.4.
