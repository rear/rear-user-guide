Hi,

Performed a rear backup with option BACKUP\_URL=file:///software/rear

Need to know a way how to restore the data with such a option  
when only ISO can boot the system but the backup location  
i.e. /software/rear is not available during the recovery phase.

At one stage I tried to download the backup.tar.gz file from the source
server to the destination server on which rear recovery was going on
using sftp but the download happened partially. Post that sftp session
killed.

@sunilckhatri Perhaps we should remove the local spare disk:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/888633/116999935-a1ac2f80-ace0-11eb-9090-6c0df1c05acb.png)

It makes no sense to keep the rear image and archive on a local disk.
What if this system breaks - how will you retrieve the ISO image from
and tar archive? The local spare disk has to be read as a disk that can
be removed and stored safely. In case of disaster you can add the disk
into another spare disk to retrieve the ISO image.

@jsmeix What is your opinion on this matter? Should be remove the local
spare disk as backup target or is this too short sighted?

I think your comment in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2607\#issuecomment-831888189](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2607#issuecomment-831888189)

    The local spare disk has to be read as a disk that can be removed and stored safely.

explains it so I think the wording

    local spare disk

should be replaced by

    removable local disk

or

    removable local spare disk

FYI:  
In general I do not think a local spare disk must be removable.  
It is good when it is removable but that is not mandatory for ReaR to be
useful.  
I am thinking about a single home user PC or Laptop with  
two usual built-in disks where one disk is used for the system and  
the other one for backups plus the bootable ReaR recovery system.  
Of course when the whole PC burns down or the Laptop falls off the
window  
all is lost so the user will copy his backups also on external media  
to be prepared for manual bare metal disaster recovery on new
(different) hardware.  
But most often neither the whole PC burns down nor the Laptop falls off
the window.  
ReaR on a built-in second disk is still useful (to some extent) for less
final disasters  
like soft errors (e.g. deleted essential files, broken filesystems, or
system bootloader issues)  
where booting the ReaR recovery system from the other disk (via plain
BIOS/UEFI) still works  
or when only the system disk breaks down where replacing it by a new
disk helps.  
Compared to ReaR on external USB disk ReaR on a built-in second disk  
is more convenient for such less final disasters because  
all what is needed for such kind of disaster recovery is built-in and
ready-to-use.  
In particular with a Laptop that means one external piece less that one
has to care about  
(e.g. when travelling one cannot forget the built-in disk).  
On the other hand with ReaR on a small USB stick one is prepared even
for final disasters  
except the Laptop bag that contains the Laptop and the ReaR USB stick
burns down ;-)
