it was on a VM  
Perhaps the network was so fast the "speed" was wrapping the bitsize of
the variable.  
after about 30 minutes it went positive.

We never saw this behaviour. Have no clue what it could be (for the
moment) and as it is not impacting rear archiving I would prefer to
leave it as it is.  
In the future we could re-open this issue if needed.
