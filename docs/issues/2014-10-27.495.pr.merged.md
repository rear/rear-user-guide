hi:  
this patch tried to fix two problems.

1.  force create drbd metadata. the command have been tested in 8.3.16
    and 8.4.5.
2.  restore multiple volumes. when resource was activate (up or attach)
    first time, next time the script use "drbdadm role" to check if the
    resource is already activate and skip the rest. so when restore
    multiple volumes, the resource will be create/activate once. the
    restore has been test under 8.3.16 and 8.4.5 correctly. under 8.4.5
    "drbd attach" failed but it seems like a drbdadm bug. will report
    drbd upstream.
