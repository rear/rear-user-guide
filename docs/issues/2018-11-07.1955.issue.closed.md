Please let me know,  
Does rear support Oracle Enterprise Linux(OEL) with unbreakable Linux
kernel?

@samurdhi in short yes it works the same as with RHEL (or CentOS)

Thanks @gdha @schlomo

I did not test it with OEL yet but I'm going to test it very soon
Because we are hoping to update OS of all Oracle Linux servers soon.
