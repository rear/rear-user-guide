-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now there are two functions that implement btrfs subvolumes setup:

The old btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup is now btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_SLES

The new one from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2079)  
is now btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic

There are two new user config array variables  
BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP  
and  
BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP  
where the suer can - if needed - specify how his btrfs subvolumes  
should be set up.

When neither BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP  
nor BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP  
is set the old behaviour is kept (now via
btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_SLES).

When both BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP  
and BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP are set to a false value  
no btrfs subvolumes setup is done.

When BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP is set to a true value  
or when BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP is set to a false value  
btrfs subvolumes setup is done via btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic

When BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP is set to a false value  
or when BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP is set to a true value  
btrfs subvolumes setup is done via btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_SLES

When the BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_GENERIC\_SETUP array contains  
devices those are set up via btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic

When the BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP array contains  
devices those are set up via btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_SLES

@rear/contributors @OliverO2  
I did the pull request early so that you can have an early look at the
code  
and provide comments what you think about it.

Currently this is work in progress...

Tested it a bit on SLES12:

"rear recover" still works with the defaults (which is using the old
code).

"rear recover" fails on SLES12 with its btrfs structure when the new
code is used,  
then the diskrestore.sh script fails, I have the "rear recover" log
file  
but will have a closer look tomorrow...

My latest commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080/commits/c0b0ddd5657b0e981ee33274db0f4d40fd1a1674](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2080/commits/c0b0ddd5657b0e981ee33274db0f4d40fd1a1674)  
intends to implement some automatism that ensures  
during "rear recover" btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_SLES()  
gets called when needed so that for SLES things should even work  
when the user has specified `BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_GENERIC_SETUP="true"`.

Sound reasonable to include such an automatism for now. I'm curious
about discovering why the `diskrestore.sh` script created by the generic
implementation failed on SLES12, though.

@OliverO2  
I need to test my latest geratest automatisms first...  
...and if it works it could (hopefully) be some kind of template  
for you how you could later add an automatism to call  
btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup\_generic() as needed for your case.

Take your time. The reason why I am curious is that the generic code
should create a layout for any setup (which would include SLES12). It
might not be the "right" or "ideal" layout for now, but at least
`diskrestore.sh` should not abort.

Testing helps ( unsurprisingly ;-)  
My automatism does not yet work - I know why - will fix it...

Now things work for me so far so that I like to merge it right now  
to have it in ReaR master code where all can test it more easily.

@OliverO2  
the "rear -D recover" log and disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh  
from my failed attempt

[rear-recover-fail.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2961891/rear-recover-fail.log)

[diskrestore-sh.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2961895/diskrestore-sh.txt)

[disklayout-conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2961902/disklayout-conf.txt)

In "rear -D recover" log there is

    ++ source /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
    ...
    Create subvolume '/mnt/local/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot'
    +++ btrfs subvolume set-default /mnt/local/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot
    btrfs subvolume set-default: too few arguments
    usage: btrfs subvolume set-default <subvolid> <path>

        Set the default subvolume of a filesystem

Ah, I see: Your version of the Btrfs tool suite requires the `subvolid`
parameter for the `subvolume set-default` command. Newer versions seem
to be clever enough to figure out that
`/mnt/local/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot` already uniquely specifies a
subvolume. I could easily fix that (by using another invocation to
retrieve the subvolid first) but probably no earlier than somewhere in
April...

On my SLES15-like openSUSE Leap 15.0 system  
"man btrfs subvolume" shows

    set-default [<subvolume>|<id> <path>]

    Set the default subvolume for the (mounted) filesystem.
    ...
    There are two ways how to specify the subvolume,
    by <id> or by the <subvolume> path.
    The id can be obtained from
    btrfs subvolume list
    btrfs subvolume show
    or
    btrfs inspect-internal rootid

which belongs to btrfsprogs version 4.15.

On my SLES12 system I have btrfsprogs-4.5.3  
where "man btrfs subvolume" shows

    set-default <id> <path>

    Set the subvolume of the filesystem <path>
    which is mounted as default.
    The subvolume is identified by <id>,
    which is returned by the
    subvolume list
    command.

so for SLES12 the subvolume's "name" is not possible.  
On SLES12 one must use the (numerical) ID,  
cf. the `btrfs subvolume set-default` code in the (now renamed)  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/136\_include\_btrfs\_subvolumes\_SLES\_code.sh
