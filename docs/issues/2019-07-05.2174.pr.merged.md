@jpmens  
thank you for your careful reading of our documentation.  
We appreciate corrections of even small spelling errors  
because spelling errors could make the whole thing look a bit sloppy
like:  
"When they can't even spell right how could they ever make right code?"
;-)

@jsmeix Now I understand why we have some bugs in our code - it was just
miss-spelled ;-)

@gdha  
:-)  
now I am thinking about an appropriate place in our documentation for
some humor like

    We do not have actual bugs in our code.
    If some code does not work, it is just accidentally misspelled.
    We do our best but unfortunately none of us is bash native speaker.

;-)
