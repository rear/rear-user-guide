Hi,

I have "/opt" as a mounted filesystem. I would like to exclude ONLY
directory "/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.33" underneath it from rear backup &
recovery. Could you please suggest me what would be the correct EXCLUDE
option to use.

Regards,

You could add the following line to `/etc/rear/local.conf`:

    EXCLUDE_BACKUP=( ${EXCLUDE_BACKUP[@]} /opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.33 )

No it did not work. Although it is printing in logs that it is excluding
the logs. But still on backup system all files and directories are
present.

2018-11-08 13:33:29.311853451 /tmp/\*

But on destination host all files are present

@attiqmscs004  
to include or exclude only specific stuff and disable ReaR's
automatisms  
what gets included and excluded it should help to use the config
variables  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
that exist in recent ReaR versions (I think since version 2.00)  
check your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf whether or not  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
are described therein.

Note that BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
only work for ReaR's internal backup method (usually 'tar')  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
but not for external backup solutions, cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" at

@msoupramanien Thanks for the feedback. Ok, Try the following that works
for me (albeit for other directories):  
`BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.33/*' )`
