Environment: IBM PowerVM Lpar on Power8 hardware  
OS: SLES11SP3  
Rear 1.17.1

local.conf:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    NETFS_URL=nfs://nfs_host/backup/rear/
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/' )
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' '/var/lib/rear/output/*' '/media/*'  )

"rear -v mkbackup" runs successfully and creates the bootable iso and
the backup.tar.gz file

however the lpar to be recovered is unable to boot from the
'rear-hostname.iso' image, message "no operating system found " is
displayed on the console, no errors or any other references.

here is the output of rear validate on the system.

    Version:     Relax-and-Recover 1.17.1 / Git
    Validation:  SUSE_LINUX/11/ppc64
    Submitted:   Hari Mahadevan hari@mahadevan.net USA
    Date:        2015-07-03
    Features:    ISO
    Comment:     rescue disk fails to load ( SMS message "no operating system found message ", this occurs  when attempting to recover a SLES 11Sp3 lpar, The boot iso 'rear-hostname'.iso get created as part of 'rear -v mkbackup'

The same process works fine on a x86 vmware virtual machine.

Anything unique with the Power8 Lpars with SLES11Sp3?

appreciate your response.

What is your storage? If you are booting from a SAN, you'll need to
start with defining BOOT\_FROM\_SAN=y as well as
AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=n in your config file.

I could be wrong, but I bet your VMWare env is not the same. Many VMWare
environments use a clustered file system and not an NPIV, multipath'd
boot from SAN environment. Booting directly from the SAN from virtual
fibre channel is a bit more complicated.

Any more details to share? Can you post the mkbackup log?

Also, take a look at issue \#572 . It might help you get your

I will test with BOOT\_FROM\_SAN=y and AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=n options
and update with the logs.

AFAIKT an LPAR is some kind of virtualized environment. Are you sure
that the ISO that is built by ReaR is actually made for that? Can you
try booting the hardware system from that ISO?

Also, are there other ways how to boot Linux on LPAR? For example by
providing a kernel and initrd directly (like with XEN)? If yes, then I
would advice to use that and not to rely on the "ISO" wrapping.

Yes LPAR is a virtualised environment on IBM's Power
hypervisor/hardware.

the ISO image was created by rear (rear -v mkbackup) and the same iso
was mapped to a vSCSI device on the lpar, and the iso os the backing
device that presents as a cdrom for the lpar.

the same process using an SLES 11 ISO was used to build the SLES 11 OS
on the lpar. so the booting from the SLES ISO works fine.

I see. IMHO the fact that the vendor-shipped SLES11 ISO works
unfortunately does not tell us anything about the ReaR ISO.

ReaR uses yaboot to make the ISO bootable, the code is in
`output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/30_create_yaboot.sh`. PPC64 is not so wide
spread and AFAIKT none of the ReaR developers has access to that.

Bottom line is that it might be that we cannot help you directly. I
would, however, strongly advice to ask on the ReaR mailing list as there
might be still some PPC64 users around. You might also search the GitHub
issues for PPC and contact their authors directly.

And, I still think it would be interesting to know if the ReaR ISO works
on the raw hardware. That test would help you to narrow down where to
look further.

I think we'll need the logs to see what is happening. I have access to
ppc64 hardware, but I don't have a SAN to test on. The create\_yaboot.sh
script should work. It works for me using RHEL on ppc64 on local
storage, anyway.

Also, schlomo, on ppc64 gear running PowerVM, you actually don't ever
have access to the raw hardware. The hypervisor is in the firmware and
OS's are always virtualized (LPAR'd). It's changed a bit with the new
OpenPower servers though, which do have a raw hardware mode.

Can you post the rear/var/log/rear/rear-hostname-log file? That will
tell us if it created the PReP partition at least.

Ah, good point. My PPC knowledge is indeed *very* outdated. Mostly from
installing SUSE 7 on an old PowerPC Mac :-) But, yaboot was already
state of the art back then.

Always good to keep learning right? :) Yaboot was good for it's day, but
grub2 has surpassed it in design and function. This is reflected in the
latest distros for PPC (RHEL7, SLES12, Ubuntu) all moving to grub2 for
the bootloader. The PReP partition still exists, however.

I've not tested REAR in a grub2 PPC distro yet. I'll have to do that and
open any issues I find..

I think I found the issue here - I haven't worked up a patch just yet
though.  
In SLES, the yaboot binary is at: /lib/lilo/pmac/yaboot, not in
/etc/yaboot/yaboot like in Red Hat based distros.  
The code in output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/30\_create\_yaboot.sh will need to
account for the different location based on distro. The created ISO
looks good otherwise, it's just missing the bootloader.

As a quick workaround, you can change line 23 to point to
/lib/lilo/pmac/yaboot instead of /etc/yaboot/yaboot. That should get a
working bootable ISO.

@jayfurmanek perhaps make a special function like `find_syslinux_file`
(`usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh`) for it like we did for
finding syslinux executable.

That's a good idea. That /lib/bootloader-functions seems like a good
place for that, but looking in that file I see mostly syslinux related
stuff. Any preference on where that function should live?

You can put it into the same file, just make sure that the function
carries a self-explanatory name.

Can you try to check out the latest code and try again. The boot media
should work now. On my system with local storage I can recover a SLES 11
system just fine now.

acsacpact,

Do you need to create the RPM? Why not just do a quick git clone and use
that? Also, from your output, it looks like you need to install git.

harikum,

Did you do a full checkout? The 30\_create\_yaboot.sh file is not the
only file that changed. You'll have to generate a new ISO as well.

I never saw that error, though...but seeing as you are on Power8, maybe
try explicitly putting the LPAR in Power7 compat mode. SLES 11 doesn't
support Power8 until the next SP release.

install git from the OS's repositories, then do:

Then you can run it from that directory.

Not to be mean, but this log is for issue \#610 and is probably not
place for these basic questions.

You don't need to make the the RPM, nothing needs compiled, just use
REAR from that very directory. (./usr/sbin/rear)

I understand its very basic questions and I already installed stable
version (rear-1.17.1-1) and did the rear -v mkbackup and it completed
successfully. But when I try to reboot and test the recover, yaboot not
even showing the rear recovery in boot image list.. then I found this
issue link and suggested to get latest code(rear-1.18) but I could able
to get the rpm

please help to get it resolve the issue. Shall I remove the
rear-1.17.1-1 package from the linux system and how I can install the
rear-1.18 and do the backup again and test the recovery.

I am new to this Linux platform, If there some basic please excuse me.

-   Download this:
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/master.zip)
-   unzip it somewhere
-   run it: /<where you unzipped REAR to>/usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup
-   (probably edit your local.conf first at:
    /<where you unzipped REAR to>/etc/rear/local.conf)

Thanks.. its portable package can be run without installing.. Now I
understand...;)

And I have below configuration on the local.conf file. Do I need update
anything else to update the /etc/yaboot.conf to get the my rear boot
image on it? because I don’t see rescue boot image, how we see it on
x86\_64 hardware( /boot/grub/menu.lst)..

On the latest master.zip files, still i could see the following

you check and suggest on the same.

I dont want to test this ISO, I need to boot the same LAPR into rear
recover mode to test the backup.tar.gz can be restored on the same
server.

How in the x86 hardware, when we add the GRUBRESCUE=y in the local.conf
file, the rear -v mkbackup modify the /boot/grub/menu.lst with rear
recover kernel option in that file and we can recover the system and
restore the backup.tar.gz file to the same SuSE Linux system.

similarly I am looking option in the IBM Power LAPR that yaboot.conf
file to get the another boot for the rear recover to restore the backup
to the same LPAR.

Will this supported or not ?

or I need to boot from the rear ISO, then Only I can recover it even the
Same server ?

@jayfurmanek, Yes i did run a fresh 'mkback' to generate a new ISO after
updating 30\_create\_yaboot.sh file.

my kernel version is '3.0.101-0.42.1.7881.0.PTF-default, this is updated
on top of a SLES11SP3 build. I didn't have to modify the lpar definition
switch to comparability mode to perform the original builds. Not sure
why this will be required to recover?

harikum,  
The kernel will negotiate to Power7 mode, but the yaboot bootloader may
be getting confused. Trying it with the entire LPAR set to Power7 mode
might help with your problem.

@acsacpact  
There is no GRUBRESCUE=y option for yaboot in Rear. You've told Rear to
create an ISO and it did.  
You can recover using that ISO to the same LPAR or to a different one
(assuming you are not mounting using UUIDs in the /etc/fstab, which SLES
likes to do by default)

@Jay,

After I reboot the system with my recovered image, getting below error.
Can you suggest how to fix it

Something we need to do to fix the PRep boot image or the boot list.

ok, so the ISO worked and you got to the rescue shell..and the recover
functioned.That's good.

Is this on a different system/LPAR than the original? SLES sets up fstab
and bootloader config based on LUN UUID. If the LUNs are different, the
UUIDs will be different. The WARNING in there is referring to that:

hello, please I'm facing the same issue, and I'm trying to find the
solution between all these comments...  
My Power8 LPAR couldn't boot with ISo rear mkrescue (Detected bad memory
access to address: ffffffffffffffff Package path = /packages/boot-mgr)

With vmware VMs have no problem.

Thank you
