#### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=2096900](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096900)

-   How was this pull request tested?

RHEL 9 VM without this patch that failed to regenerate the `initrd` and
same VM with this patch that regenerated the `initrd` successfully.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

For a long time, `mkinitrd` was a wrapper script around `dracut` in
Fedora and RHEL that maintained backwards compatibility with the real
(but rather obsolete) `mkinitrd`.

Dracut 054 removed the `mkinitrd` wrapper script \[1\] so now we have to
execute `dracut` directly. Fortunately, ReaR did not use almost anything
from `mkinitrd`'s interface (with the exception of `--with`) so the
transition is quite straightforward.

Without this patch the initrd regeneration in the finalize stage of
recovery fails on RHEL 9 and Fedora 33 or newer.

@pcahyna, it is expected that the `production-build` Packit jobs will
start only for high privileged contributors?

I have no idea. Why would it be limited to `production-build` and not
`rpm-build`, anyway?

@jsmeix I checked that `dracut` exists in RHEL 6 (the oldest release
that ReaR cares about) and that even there `mkinitrd` was a shell script
that invokes `dracut` internally. Of course this does not guarantee that
it will work properly, but at least the chances are quite high.

@pcahyna  
when the changes work sufficiently backward compatible  
for what Red Hat needs we should include it in ReaR 2.7  
so feel free to merge it as you like.

@jsmeix, Sorry, I should have already mentioned that in the commit
message. As @pcahyna already mentioned, RHEL 6 was the first release
that used `dracut` to generate initrds. That said I've also tested this
change on RHEL 7 and RHEL 8 without any dracut related regressions
spotted.

@pcahyna  
is there a reason why you do not merge it?

Could or should perhaps I "just merge" it?

@jsmeix sorry, I forgot about this. Yes, I will merge it.
