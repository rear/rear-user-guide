Is it a LVM mounted on a loop ? It has to be LVM otherwise you won't
have any issues ...

@david-hill Still need to see some output to understand it better...

@gdha do you know how do the loop devices get skipped? I don't see any
code to skip them under `layout/save`. There is code in
200\_partition\_layout.sh that skips generating `disk` lines for devices
that are not in the known list (currently the list is: hd sd cciss vd
xvd dasd nvme mmcblk ) but there seems to be nothing to prevent `fs`
lines being generated for them in 230\_filesystem\_layout.sh ). Surely I
am missing something, as usually it has not been a problem.

@gdha I don't see that:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/tmp/loopfs bs=1024 count=102400
    mkfs.xfs /var/tmp/loopfs
    mkdir /home/loopfs
    mount -o loop /var/tmp/loopfs /home/loopfs
    rear savelayout

results in this in layout:

    fs /dev/loop0 /home/loopfs xfs uuid=fbb2b182-5f12-49b0-9ff4-9bbf99e3cc35 label=  options=rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota

so, loop device is not skipped (unless it changed in ReaR 2.7; this was
with ReaR 2.6). Not sure why loop devices on Ubuntu are skipped, aren't
they mounted under something in `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH` ?

@david-hill your issue is only tangentially related to loop devices.
Using a PV/VG on a disk:

    parted --script -a optimal /dev/vdc -- mklabel gpt mkpart extra ext2 1M -1M set 1 lvm on
    pvcreate --yes /dev/vdc1
    vgcreate sigvg  /dev/vdc1
    rear savelayout

results in the same error:

    Verifying that the entries in /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf are correct ...
    LVM no 'lvmvol /dev/sigvg' for 'lvmdev /dev/sigvg'
    ERROR: 
    ====================

    'Entries in /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf are broken ('rear recover' would fail)'

without any loop device involved. The underlying issue is that ReaR does
not like volume groups without logical volumes. Unused volume groups may
be unusual, but I think there is nothing really wrong with them, and PR
\#2603 fixed a bug ( \#2596 ) where an unused PV (without VG) aborted
mkrescue. So, by analogy, I think we should also allow a VG without any
LV (either exclude it, or add it to the layout as empty).

What to do with loop devices is a separate question, but I think should
be addressed consistently for all storage objects on them (you see above
that filesystems on loop devices are not being excluded either).

I would suggest we just skip /dev/loop ... is there any possibility we
have any useful data on there ?

@pcahyna On my ubuntu ws the loop devices are of type squashfs, so this
is the reason of exclusion. The one I created manually is included as

So, yes it would be better to exclude loop devices if they are not
really required.

Why shouldn't be any useful data on /dev/loop ? Is it because the
backing files of loop devices can be already saved when the filesystem
where they reside is backed up? This makes sense, but beware: if the
loop devices are mounted or in any other way used (like being PVs for
active VGs, esp. when using thin pools) when the backing files are being
backed up, the backup will very likely be inconsistent. This is a
similar reasoning like why we usually don't back up data by using just
`dd` on the underlying block device.  
Properly saving loop devices and all storage objects on top of them
(instead of skipping) would be a way around the problem, but would
require some special code (to call losetup during layout recreation to
set up the loop devices properly).  
Another option would be to exclude them and to warn (or error out) when
backing files of loop devices are being backed up and active read-write
storage objects (filesystems, LVM) reside on top of them. This would
guide the user to think how to temporarily deactivate this stuff during
backup to prevent inconsistent backups (similarly to how one can shut
down database server before backup and start them after to prevent
inconsistent database files, cf the description of `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT`
in default.conf).

@pcahyna  
regarding your above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2853\#issuecomment-1250063689](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2853#issuecomment-1250063689)

In general we do not know in ReaR what files are in the backup.  
In particular not for alomst all non-internal backup methods  
because ReaR does not implement making a backup with  
almost all non-internal (external) backup methods,  
see "BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

So in general we cannot compare what files are in the backup  
with what storage devices or filesystems are in disklayout.conf.

Furthermore even with internal backup methods we do not know  
during "rear mkrescue" what files are actually in the backup  
because no backup is actually made during "rear mkrescue".
