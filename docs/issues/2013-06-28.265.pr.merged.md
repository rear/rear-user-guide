==========================================================================================================================================

This function now traps when the partition number is not a number or
spans more than two characters. Since Relax-and-Recover does not support
more than 9 partitions we are not creating another artificial limit.
However if we find a better way to get the partition number from
inconsistent devices (those that add a partition number directly to a
trailing number), I am all for that.

This pull-request relates to \#183 and \#263
