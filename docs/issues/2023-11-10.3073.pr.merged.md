##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    fixes \#3064

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `yum erase rsync` and `yum install chkconfig` followed by
    `rear mkrescue` on RHEL 9

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Do not skip symbolic links when adding libraries required by executables
in COPY\_AS\_IS. The symlink targets will be copied later by
build/default/490\_fix\_broken\_links.sh. We thus need library
dependencies for symlinked executables just like for normal executables
and build/default/490\_fix\_broken\_links.sh does not perform library
dependency scan, so we need to do it at the same place as for normal
executables (in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh). Otherwise it can
happen that we add a (broken) symlink via COPY\_AS\_IS, the actual
executable is then added by build/default/490\_fix\_broken\_links.sh,
but without its libraries, and "rear mkrescue" then fails because
required libraries are missing. Happens for example with
/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install, which is a symlink to
/bin/chkconfig and gets added to COPY\_AS\_IS in
prep/GNU/Linux/280\_include\_systemd.sh.

Gets rid of one exception for symlinks, which looks good in any case
(shorter and simpler code).

Do you mean to the source code comments?

one rpm-build in Copr seems to be in progress, but actually it has
finished successfully. The outdated status is due to the Packit issue
