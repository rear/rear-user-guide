    release 6.7 (Final)

Hello,

I would like to include REAR to my Puppet-Deployment. To do so I would
like to use FTP as output\_url, which works fine.

But: The name of the generated iso is `rear-1.iso` in one case, which
could be the name of another system aswell.

In Puppet I managed to create a configuration that adds a FTP-folder to
the output\_url - but if that folder does not exist the upload fails.

So my questions are:

-   Is it possible to create an iso by using the fqdn?
-   Is it possible to auto-create a folder to FTP if it does not exist?

I tested current GitHub master code  
on my SLES12-SP2-RC1 test system with

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
OUTPUT_URL=ftp://10.160.4.244/rear
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
</pre>

and on the test host d245 "rear -d -D mkbackup"  
results on my NFS and FTP server 10.160.4.244

<pre>
# ls -lh /srv/ftp/rear/
total 159M
-rw------- 1 ftp ftp   62 Aug 25 12:37 README
-rw------- 1 ftp ftp 150M Aug 25 12:37 rear-d245.iso
-rw------- 1 ftp ftp 8.5M Aug 25 12:37 rear.log
-rw------- 1 ftp ftp  262 Aug 25 12:37 VERSION
# ls -lh /nfs/d245
total 700M
-rw------- 1 nobody nogroup 700M Aug 25 12:38 backup.tar.gz
-rw------- 1 nobody nogroup    0 Aug 25 12:37 .lockfile
</pre>

I.e. I get the hostname of the system where "rear mkbackup"  
was run in the ISO file "rear-d245.iso" and the backup  
in a "d245" directory.

With

<pre>
OUTPUT_URL=ftp://10.160.4.244/rear/$HOSTNAME
</pre>

"rear mkbackup" does not automatically create the  
hostname directory on the FTP server but fails with

<pre>
Copying result files '/root/rear/var/lib/rear/output/rear-d245.iso /myreartmp/rear.DfguWh3MnUvQSxk/tmp/VERSION /myreartmp/rear.DfguWh3MnUvQSxk/tmp/README /myreartmp/rear.DfguWh3MnUvQSxk/tmp/rear.log' to ftp location
ERROR: Problem transferring result files to ftp://10.160.4.244/rear/d245
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-d245.log for details
</pre>

But when I manually create that directory on the FTP server  
it "just works".

I.e. when you know in advance the hostnames, create  
matching directories in advance on your FTP server.

Ah!  
I did not notice that you wrote "using the fqdn".  
See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
ISO_PREFIX="rear-$HOSTNAME"
</pre>

But I wonder abut your case where the hostname  
seems to be "1" - is this really the intended hostname?  
If yes, you should not use same hostnames on  
different systems.  
If no, I think you need to fix that system so that  
it has the actually intended hostname.

FYI:

<pre>
ISO_PREFIX="rear-$( hostname ).$( domainname )"
</pre>

"just works" for me.
