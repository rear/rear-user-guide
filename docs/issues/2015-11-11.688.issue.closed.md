Currently when in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode only "set -x" is done.

Personally I prefer "set -vx" when debugging bash scripts because  
'-v' prints the script source code lines (in chunks as read by bash) and
afterwards '-x' prints the commands and their arguments as they are
executed.

For me this makes debugging issuse very much faster because I see first
the original source code lines and then what commands and arguments the
bash eveluation results which helps me very much to understand what is
actually happening.

Hereby I request that in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode "set -vx" is done.

I propose the following in usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh  
(plus some explanatory comments):

<pre>
function Source() {
...
    # in DEBUGSCRIPTS mode print shell input lines as they are read
    # and print commands and their arguments as they are executed:
    test "$DEBUGSCRIPTS" && set -vx
    # the actual work (source the source file):
    Debug "Begin sourcing '$source_file'"
    . "$source_file"
    Debug "End sourcing '$source_file'"
    # undo DEBUGSCRIPTS mode settings:
    test "$DEBUGSCRIPTS" && set +vx
</pre>

If you like it, I make a pull request.

:-) I know the `-v` feature and it always confused me to see almost the
same content twice... In my Bash debugging needs so far `-v` played a
seldom and minor role. I sometimes add `: $VAR` in the code to see the
content of a variable in `-x` mode.

Question: Is it a matter of taste? Should we allow configuration for
this?

@schlomo  
just propose what rear command line parameter you like  
for "set -v" and I will implement it.

Perhaps a command line parameter '-C' for "Code"  
or something like that?

Or perhaps even better add support for a value for the '-D'  
parameter where the value is by default 'x' like:

rear -D

results "set -x" and

rear -D vx

results "set -vx"

and

rear -D v

results "set -v".

This way - for debugging by experts - even

rear -D xvue

could be set.

I think I prefer -D and -DD, interpreting -v as an additional
verbosity  
layer on top of -x.

What do you think?

We already have verbose (-v). Why don't use this as a trigger for set
-x$v ? Keep it simple no?

@gdha brilliant idea - thanks a lot for seeing the simple things!

Only a note FYI:

For now I cannot work on it because a customer printing issue  
appeared.

Using '-v' plus '-D' to get "set -vx" is o.k. for me  
but it is not really KISS as I understand what KISS means.

Using '-v' plus '-D' to get "set -vx" is RFC 1925 (5)  
from my point of view.

And the result is a backward incompatible change  
because before '-v' and '-D' were separated things.

Personally I prefer a variant of KISS:  
KSIS: Keep Separated Issues Separated.

But I do not want to make a longer discussion  
because of this relatively small issue.

I will implement using '-v' plus '-D' to get "set -vx".

Probably I will also implement that '-D' can have an  
optional value because I like to be able to "set -xue"  
via '-D xue' for my own personal needs...

Indeed, it's not the best thing if the cmdline options behavior change:
e.g. we could expect much bigger logfile on systems where 'rear -v -D'
is scheduled (potentially affecting a filesystem utilization).

I made a first tentative and currentyl untested implementation  
by using a separeated long option --debugscripts that  
requires an argument where the argument contains  
the flags to be 'set' so thet e.g. '--debugscripts=xv'  
results 'set -xv'.

I need to play around with it how it works.

This issue is fixed by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/699)
via a new debugscripts option which is fully backward compatible because
the behaviour of the other options does not change.

Now one can use e.g.

<pre>
rear --debugscripts xv mkbackup
</pre>

or even things like

<pre>
rear --debugscripts 'xvue +h -o pipefail' help
</pre>
