On IBM ppc64 systems, the console is on /dev/hvsi0 when using the serial
port. When using a virtual TTY (through a Hardware Management Console or
something), the console is on /dev/hvc0. We would need an addition in
the ppc64 skel tree to make sure init starts a getty is the correct
places for these systems.  
SSH with a key does work as a workaround.

No problem, please submit a pull request. Since PPC64 hardware is rather
seldom we need contributions from users because only you can know what
actually works.

I've got something working, but it might not be the best solution. I'm
working with RHEL6. There is no /etc/init directory in the ppc64 skel
tree. I created it, then put a hvc0.conf and hvsi.conf in there with
respawn agetty commands. This solution doesnt use USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE,
but seems to work.

@jayfurmanek What is the content of `/etc/init` on your production
system? I know that debian also have an `/etc/init` directory.  
Is there no need to redefine the `cmdline` (see
`./rescue/GNU/Linux/40_use_serial_console.sh`)?

My system is running RHEL6, and the /etc/init directory looks pretty
much the same as it does on an x86-64 system:

    # ls /etc/init
    control-alt-delete.conf  rcS-sulogin.conf
    init-system-dbus.conf    readahead-collector.conf
    kexec-disable.conf       readahead.conf
    plymouth-shutdown.conf   readahead-disable-services.conf
    prefdm.conf              serial.conf
    quit-plymouth.conf       splash-manager.conf
    rc.conf                  start-ttys.conf
    rcS.conf                 tty.conf
    rcS-emergency.conf

The cmdline does include the console entry (this one is using a serial
cable console)

    # cat  /proc/cmdline 
    root=/dev/mapper/vg0-lv_root ro rd_NO_LUKS rd_LVM_LV=vg0/lv_root LANG=en_US.UTF-8 crashkernel=1024M@0M console=hvsi0 rd_NO_MD  KEYTABLE=us rd_LVM_LV=vg0/lv_swap SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 console=hvsi0 rd_NO_DM rhgb quiet

I probably do want to make sure the console= parameter is correct and to
leverage the USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE param..just have to figure it out.

@jayfurmanek I guess you have `/dev/hvsi0` available? Could you check if
`/dev/ttyS*` exist?  
Otherwise, we could just update script
`rescue/GNU/Linux/40_use_serial_console.sh` with;

    for devnode in $(ls /dev/ttyS[0-9]* /dev/hvsi[0-9]*| sort); do

Would you able to test this out for me?

Sure. Thanks. I'll give it a shot.

BTW - there /dev/ttyS\* files do exist. The system doesn't use them for
the console, though.

So your addition does indeed produce the console parameter on the kernel
comand line, which is good:

    # cat /proc/cmdline 
     root=/dev/ram0 LANG=en_US.UTF-8 SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 KEYTABLE=us selinux=0 console=hvc0,38400 console=tty0 

(The above test is on a virtual "LPAR", so the console is hvc0 there)
The agetty still needs to be started, to get the login prompt, however.

If I SSH in to the rescue OS and run:

    RESCUE chefserver:~ # /sbin/agetty /dev/hvc0 38400 vt100-nav

The login prompt pops up on the console.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, I think I got it figured
out now.  
I added the following to
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/init/start-ttys.conf:

        # support HVC console on Power
        if [ -c /dev/hvc0 ] ; then
                echo initctl start tty TTY=/dev/hvc0
                initctl start tty TTY=/dev/hvc0
        fi
        # support serial console on Power
        if [ -c /dev/hvsi0 ] ; then
                echo initctl start tty TTY=/dev/hvsi0
                initctl start tty TTY=/dev/hvsi0
        fi

That kicks up the gettys on the hvc0 console. I still need to test the
serial console (hvsi0), but I'm confident that it will work there too.  
I also need to test to see if your proposed change above is necessary or
not..

The change you proposed to rescue/GNU/Linux/40\_use\_serial\_console.sh
ended up not making much of a difference. Below in that same file,
console=tty0 is tacked on to the cmdline and the kernel takes the last
console= parameter first. So when USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE is set to yes,
you loose some of the boot time messages (as they are directed to
/dev/tty0)  
Once the getty starts, though, the login does pop up properly with my
change, above.

It's probably best just to have USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE set to NO for this
platform.

@jayfurmanek could you tell me how the `/etc/init/start-ttys.conf` gets
kick off in recovery mode? It is not clear to me as don't find any
reference to it within rear.
