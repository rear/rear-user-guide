-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.6
-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"): ubuntu 20.04
-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): uefi/grub
-   Partition table type on system: gpt
-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    After a recover a new UEFI boot entry gets created for the recovered
    efi since the GPT partition GUID changed.  
    Of course this is more a minor issue only affecting people making
    use of multiple boot options tried to boot in order.  
    This however has two side effects:
    1.  it changes the boot order putting the recovered efi partition as
        first
    2.  it fills the boot records list with another entry keeping the
        old one (getting messy and maybe running out of entries over
        time)
-   Workaround/solution:  
    There are at least two possible workarounds/fixes possible for this:
    -   one can cleanup the old efi boot entries and set the boot order
        again (manually or with e.g. evibootmgr)
    -   one can replace the GUID (e.g. using gdisk or sgdisk) and use
        the old efi boot entry

The complete fix for rear would be also writing GPT GUIDs to the layout
file and then setting them e.g. with sgdisk.

@DEvil0000 No interest in writing a PR for your proposal?

@DEvil0000 PR has been merged, if you could recheck if all goes well?

The vfat ID now gets set for the UEFI partition but the GPT partition
GUID (not type id) is still newly generated and was not addressed by
\#2546

@DEvil0000 Sorry for the delay in answer - please show us what is really
missing here - it seems we misunderstood

A efi boot entry contains `disk`, `partition` and `efi payload path`.
There may also be a filesystem ID/UUID but thats not what this ticket is
about.  
Example UEFI boot entries (might use less details or different ids and
methods - UEFI records are quite a beast):

    Boot0019* Ubuntu 1  HD(1,800,32000,a44dc908-e0d1-4df5-903f-a8db5f6f66b3)File(\EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi)
    Boot001A* Ubuntu 2  HD(4,df6609e,2fbe1,773a0059-be41-4828-944a-32217f941c95)File(\EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi)

The `disk` may be referenced by its bios id (a integer based on boot
order bios settings normally) or by a disk UUID. See [wiki (Partition
table header, offset
0x38)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) for GPT but I
think msdos has the same thing at the same offset in this case.

When using a msdos `partition` table the partitions are numberd from 1-4
or such. For an UEFI boot (payload) record you reference the partition
id then.  
When using GPT partition tables the partitions have a UUID for the
partition type and a UUID for the actual partition. See [wiki (Partition
entries, offset
0x10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table). This
`Unique partition GUID` must get recovered so existing old UEFI boot
entries still match otherwise the system BIOS/Firmware will create a new
entry or you would need to create one manually.

So when using a GPT partition table and UEFI you should definitely save
the GPT UUIDs (disk and partition) and also insert those when creating
the partition on recover. This way you restore the system "as it was".  
Then you will not face any issues with UEFI and existing boot entries.

Edit:  
My proposal is to also store those GPT UUIDs in the layout file and
write them correctly to GPT when created.  
There is also a GPT partition name which you might need to recover -
don't remember if that was recovered.  
BTW I am using USB method if that makes a difference.

@DEvil0000 Not all system are equal it seems - my UEFI knowledge became
a bit rusty...

Not sure where to start? @gozora Do you have some more insights on these
matters?

Let us not forget that there are also users that are migrating to
different HW. For this group of people recreating all the UEFI boot
configuration entries make little sense.  
I think that current minimalist approach, that adds just entry for newly
restored system, is good because it is simple. If one is concerned about
mess in boot entries, he can easily clean it up (using `efibootmgr`).

Of course if anybody is willing to cover this complex topic with a pull
request, I have no objections.

Hope it helps.
