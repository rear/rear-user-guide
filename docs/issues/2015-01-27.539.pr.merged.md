Reasoning: At least on RHEL6 when parted created a raid partition on
disk,  
udev (via /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules) wakes up mdadm
which locks the disk,  
so further parted commands with the disk will fail since the disk is
busy now.  
The /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules detects anaconda (the Red
Hat installer),  
and if it find itself running under anaconda, it will not run.  
Accordingly also for other installers (in particular the rear
installer)  
this rule should not be there (and other Linux distros probably do not
have it)  
which means removing it is the right solution to make rear work also for
RHEL6.
