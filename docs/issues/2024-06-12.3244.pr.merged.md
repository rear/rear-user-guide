@lzaoral  
out of curiosity:  
Did you do the replacements manually at each place  
or did you use some tool (like 'sed') to automate it?

I ask because at some places the replacement is like  
`egrep -xyz` -&gt; `grep -Exyz`  
while at other places the replacement is like  
`egrep -xyz` -&gt; `grep -E -xyz`  
so it looks a bit inconsistent which indicates  
you did it manually.

Wouldn't an automated replacement like  
`'egrep '` -&gt; `'grep -E '` (note the trailing space)  
have been always right - or are there exceptions?

@lzaoral  
thank you for this code cleanup work!

By the way:  
I know that 'egrep' is deprecated "since the beginning of time"  
so I guess 'egrep' will stay there in this or that form  
"until end of time".  
But that warning is an annoyance, cf.  
[https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)  
so it is good to get rid of it.
