ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):2.3

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): RHEL 7.5
-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<pre>
NRSERVER=XXXXX-bar1
NSR_CLIENT_MODE=
OUTPUT=ISO
ISO_PREFIX="rear-nsr-$HOSTNAME"
BACKUP=NSR
OUTPUT_URL=file:///tmp
# Static IP (no DHCP!)
USE_DHCLIENT=
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="y"
# NTP
TIMESYNC=NTP
</pre>

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine):
-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot? : Legacy boot
-   Brief description of the issue: we are not able to boot the server
    with the REAR ISO image.  
    But the ISO image has been created sucessfully.  
    Is there any configuration changes we need to do with respect to
    REAR for Legacy/UEFI boot.  
    Now this server is using Legacy boot.
