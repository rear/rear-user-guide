Granted, in this specific case it's only unneeded text files ... but
still. ;-)

-   Workaround, if any:  
    The fix is trivial: add `-print0` to the `find` options, and add
    `-0` to the `xargs` options.

Ugh!  
I was waiting for the first example where $IFS characters appear  
in basic system file names - so here we are :-(

firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43430a0-sdio.ONDA-V80 PLUS.txt and  
firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.MINIX-NEO Z83-4.txt  
belong to the Linux kernel firmware files so recent kernel files  
have $IFS characters in their names.

@z1atk0  
thank you for your issue report!

FYI:  
The root cause behind such issues is described in

The actual fix is not so trivial

    -    find . -xdev -type f | egrep -v '/md5sums\.txt|/\.gitignore|~$|/dev/' | xargs md5sum >>$md5sums_file || cat /dev/null >$md5sums_file
    +    find . -xdev -type f -print0 | egrep -z -v '/md5sums\.txt|/\.gitignore|~$|/dev/' | xargs -0 md5sum -b >>$md5sums_file || cat /dev/null >$md5sums_file

because each command in the pipe must be explicitly changed  
to also work with files that have $IFS characters in their names.

This shows that the default behaviour of usual commands  
is to not expect files with $IFS characters in their names  
which proves that nowadays $IFS characters in file names  
are still not a generally expected or a "just supported" case.

This fix makes things work at least for me on SLES12-SP5.

Currently I don't know if on SLES11 and older RHEL versions  
`grep` supports `-z` and `md5sum` supports `-b`  
so the new code might fail there but intentionally that code  
behaves fail-safe via `|| cat /dev/null >$md5sums_file`  
so if the new code fails on older systems it means the whole  
md5sum verification is skipped on systems where it cannot work  
just as it happens now (i.e. without the above fix) when there are  
files in the recovery system that have $IFS characters in their names.

@z1atk0  
could you please verify that with my fix in the above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2407\#issuecomment-633885689](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2407#issuecomment-633885689)  
the whole md5sum verification also works for you on RHEL 7  
in particular that the actual md5sum verification during startup  
of your particular ReaR recovery system really works for you,  
cf. the code about "Verifying md5sums" in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L79](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L79)

My bad, sorry, I totally missed the `egrep` in the middle.
:man\_shrugging: 😇

If you're worried about `-z` support on certain systems, then what about
eliminating the `egrep` altogether and let `find` do the work instead,
like:

    find . -xdev -type f -regextype posix-egrep ! -regex '/md5sums\.txt|/\.gitignore|~$|/dev/' -print0 | xargs -0 [...]

Or, if you're worried that `find` might not be new enough to support
`-regextype`, then either modify the regex to be of type "emacs"
(whatever that may look like, I have no idea TBH), or use a slightly
different shell construct like:

    find . -xdev -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 | egrep -v '/md5sums\.txt|/\.gitignore|~$|/dev/' | while read single_file_name; do md5sum "$single_file_name" >>$md5sums_file; done || cat /dev/null >$md5sums_file

Here, the `xargs` invocation emits one filename per line, so for both
`egrep` and `md5sum` it's just business as usual, as you can
conveniently read and quote the whole filename that way. The downside is
that you now have one `md5sum` invocation per file in a bigger loop.

In any case, I don't think it's necessary to use `md5sum -b` *just
because of the filename*, as this option only seems to concern the
handling of a file's *contents*, but not its *name*. This only seems to
be relevant on systems that actually distinguish between text & binary
files *on disk*. I found a few interesting links on that specific
matter:

-   [gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/md5sum-invocation.html#md5sum-invocation)
-   [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17988090/what-are-the-differences-between-md5-binary-mode-and-text-mode)
-   [stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/127959/md5sum-command-binary-and-text-mode)

As for actually testing your fix, that might be a bit of a problem,
especially the actual recovery part of it. I mentioned in my initial
report that we're using REAR as bundled by SEP SESAM, and not as a
standalone solution. So I can add your fix to the script in question, do
an extra BSR backup run, and then check the log file, but ATM I'd be a
bit hard-pressed (both time and (virtual) hardware wise) to find
resources to do a real from-scratch recovery.

@z1atk0  
thank you for your suggestions - I will have a look...

I thought I need `md5sum -b` because without the `-b`  
I got an error message from md5sum that went away with `-b`  
but right now I can no longer reproduce how it had failed  
(I don't remember exactly what I did that caused this failure).

In general regarding testing things in the ReaR recovery system:

Set in your etc/rear/local.conf `KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"`  
and see the description about KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR  
in your particular usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

In our current GitHub master code that is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L142](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L142)

For example on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system:

    # chroot /tmp/rear.3QcTcmdxtyN1vjV/rootfs/

    bash-4.4# md5sum -c --quiet md5sums.txt

    bash-4.4# echo $?
    0

    bash-4.4# exit
    exit

Well, so if you have other reasons than the stream of `NUL`-terminated
filenames, then that's a different story of course. 😉 Coming to think of
it, I guess you can probably just leave it in without any ill effects,
because on systems *without* text/binary discrimination it won't make
any difference at all (except for having `"<SPACE>*"` as a separator
between MD5 sum and filename instead of `"<SPACE><SPACE>"`), and on
systems where it *does* matter it will automagically do the right thing.
👍

Okay, so this sounds easy & quick enough - I thought I'd have to go
through a full-blown restore to test it, which would have been quite
cumbersome. I'll give it a shot and let you know if/how it worked!

Okay, building looks good (note the relaxing & reassuring absence of
error messages 😁) ...
