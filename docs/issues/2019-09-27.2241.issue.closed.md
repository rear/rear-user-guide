    it):  
    When using option BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=("--zstd")  
    recovery is not possible due to missing zstd binaries in recovery
    image.  
    (The same might be true for options --lzip --lzma and --lzop but I
    haven't tested it)

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Possible: copy missing binary from other location when in recovery
    mode (not tested)

@aasami  
there is currently no automatism in ReaR that would automatically add  
what is needed by `tar` for special BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
settings into the ReaR recovery system.

When you know what binaries and libraries and other files  
are needed by `tar` when using zstd compression  
you can add them into the ReaR recovery system  
via generic ReaR functionality using config variables like  
COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, and LIBS  
see the default.conf description  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

After "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" you can check things inside the  
ReaR recovery system by using KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes",  
see the KEEP\_BILD\_DIR description in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L128](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L128)  
via chroot $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/  
and then try to run `tar` with the options you like  
to test things inside the ReaR recovery system  
so that you can check more easily and directly  
if all what is needed to run `tar` as you want it  
is included in the ReaR recovery system.

Regarding how BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
is actually used for the `tar` command see the scripts  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh)  
and  
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh)

@aasami Will you make PR when you got it working?

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9e07846b460976084e2bb2bdec01b901c42ec413](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9e07846b460976084e2bb2bdec01b901c42ec413)  
I added explanatory comments to default.conf  
about backup restore that may fail for things like  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=("--zstd")  
due to missing zstd binaries in recovery system  
(probably also for --lzip --lzma --lzop).

Accordingly this issue is now at least documented  
and because I do not plan to implement an automatism in ReaR  
that would automatically include additional things  
that are needed by tar into the ReaR recovery system  
I close this issue hereby and set the 'needs sponsorship' label.
