@ritzmann Strange - you are first having this issue (at least some-one
who has reported it).  
Ok - `-F` flag could be added from my point of view - @jsmeix any
objections against it?

However, it struck my that you want to boot off from an USB disk, but
skip any backup (BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE) - are you just testing it
perhaps?

I actually want to (manually) restore a BackupPC backup.

My first choice was OUTPUT=ISO instead of USB and then write the ISO
image to a USB stick when I actually need it. But I have so far not
managed to create a bootable USB stick based on the ISO. I would have
one or two more questions still, what would be the best channel to
discuss them?

The problem is to keep backward compatibility in the current code  
in format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh

<pre>
LogPrint "Creating $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM filesystem with label '$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL' on '$rear_data_partition_device'"
if ! mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM -L "$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL" $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PARAMS $rear_data_partition_device >&2 ; then
    Error "Failed to create $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM filesystem on '$rear_data_partition_device'"
fi
</pre>

because any options must work for all `mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM`
commands  
i.e. for all allowed values of USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM which are
according to default.conf

<pre>
# Only ext3 and ext4 are supported by the format workflow.
...
USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM=ext3
</pre>

but in contrast the comments in the code also tell about `ext2` and
`btrfs`,  
e.g. see format/USB/default/350\_label\_usb\_disk.sh  
and format/USB/default/200\_check\_usb\_layout.sh

An additional `-F` option would only work for `mkfs.ext2` `mkfs.ext3`  
and `mkfs.ext4` (according to the man pages down to SLES10)  
but `-F` is not supported for `mkfs.btrfs` because there the force
option is `-f`.

@ritzmann  
regarding separated issues like  
"How to create a bootable USB stick with ReaR?"  
you may create separated issues here.

I did that some time ago via "rear format" plus "rear mkrescue"  
and for me on my laptop things "just worked" so that  
if "rear format" plus "rear mkrescue" does not create a  
bootable USB stick plus the ReaR recovery system on it  
in your case it probably depends on your particular hardware  
so that you would have to provide us information on what hardware  
a USB stick made with "rear format" plus "rear mkrescue"  
does not boot the ReaR recovery system.

Because ReaR is all plain bash scripts you can adapt them  
as you need it, for example you can add the `-F` option to your  
usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh  
script to the `mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM` command like

<pre>
LogPrint "Creating $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM filesystem with label '$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL' on '$rear_data_partition_device'"
if ! mkfs.$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM -F -L "$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL" $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PARAMS $rear_data_partition_device >&2 ; then
    Error "Failed to create $USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM filesystem on '$rear_data_partition_device'"
fi
</pre>

to make things work for your particular case (regardless whether or
not  
your particular way is also backward compatible in all other cases).

OK. I was thinking that I could use USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_PARAMS to
pass "-F" to mkfs.ext4.

FWIW, I am not clear how I managed to evoke this issue. I tried to
reproduce it multiple times without success.

Now that you mention it I also think you could use  
USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_PARAMS to pass "-F" to mkfs.ext4

I promise next time I may even read our documentation in default.conf
;-)

@ritzmann @jsmeix Is the issue resolved with this variable
`USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PARAMS ` from your side?

@ritzmann I noticed you use BackupPC software - why don't you try to
integrate it with ReaR?

@gdha  
I think because "rear format" explicitly asks the user for
confirmation  
we should in ReaR use hardcoded enforced formatting calls  
i.e. `-F` for mkfs.ext2/3/4 (and if needed `-f` for mkfs.btrfs).

Yes.

I actually tried a "poor man's" integration by building a rescue image
that would contain the required pieces of software to run BackupPC
(Perl, rsync and sudo). I am backing up the backup server with ReaR, so
it needs a few more pieces to run BackupPC than if it were just a
client. I reached the limits of my skill set however when sudo and su,
while running from the rescue image, complained about PAM not being
present.

I figured that I would get faster results by backing up the relevant
parts of the system with NETFS and then, after restoring the system,
restore the rest of the files from the restored system with BackupPC. I
hope that description wasn't too confusing. :-)

@ritzmann Thank you for your input around BackupPC. I just wonder if you
need `sudo` anyhow in the ReaR rescue image as you run directly as root?
Or, do you run if with a different account?

I think in general it is better to keep separated things separated.  
In this case I mean to keep the recovery of the basic system  
separated from the recovery of "higher level" parts of the system.

I think in general it is better to use ReaR only to recover the basic
system  
(with a relatively small backup that contains only the files of the
basic system)  
to get the basic system up and running as fast as possible,  
and then in the recreated running basic system do the recovery of the
various  
"higher level" parts of the system in separated additional steps where
that  
additional separated steps could be even run in parallel (provided the
various  
"higher level" parts of the system are sufficiently independent of each
other).

Regarding doing the recovery of the various "higher level" parts of the
system  
in separated additional steps that run in parallel cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
which describes how to do that with ReaR but the idea behind also
applies  
when the recovery of the various "higher level" parts of the system is
done  
by various other tools as needed for each particular "higher level"
part.

In general regarding huge "all-in-one" backups see also

Thanks all for your valuable advise. Sounds like I am on the right path.

Just to answer @gdha's last question:  
In general, BackupPC expects to run with a dedicated backup user. When
rsyncing files it will switch to root on the backed up system. I guess
it would be possible to run it all as root but that setup is a bit
delicate.

@gdha  
see my question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1736\#issuecomment-380402840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1736#issuecomment-380402840)

If you agree that we should in the `rear format` workflow  
use hardcoded enforced formatting calls  
I would implement it.
