#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 7.3

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=nfs://XXX/GPFS/var/rear  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=('rootvg')

-   Brief description of the issue

RHEL 7 uses "Consistent Network Device Naming" in which interface names
are no longer ethX by default. (udev is generating a predictable
interface name, fe. eno1654872).  
Even though this feature is disabled when running mkbackup, the rear
recovery ISO is still using the predictable name for the interface. As a
result, the interface doesn't get an IP address and recovery cannot
continue automatically.

-   Work-around, if any

Add IP address manually to the interface.

As a workaround use  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
so that you can define in /etc/rear/local.conf whatever  
commands you need for networking setup in the  
ReaR recovery system.  
See  
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
how NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
is meant to work and for some examples how it works see

Hi Johannes

Thanks for the feedback.  
Not sure if this will help since the name of the interface on the target
system is unknown at the time of the backup. We don't know what udev
will make of it...

One solution that I currently see is to generate a udev rule and put
this in the recovery media. That way the target system can use the same
interface name.

f.e.  
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*",
ATTR{address}=="&lt;mac\_address\_of\_interface\_on\_source&gt;",
ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*",
NAME="&lt;interface\_name\_on\_source&gt;"

What's your idea?

I assume it works now because "no news is good news".
