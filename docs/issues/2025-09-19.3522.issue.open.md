### Requesting support or just a question

How do I set up a rear backup that saves the bootable rescue image to a
usb flash drive and the backup itself to a remote machine via rsync

### Platform

Ubuntu 22 with rear 29 from a recent git clone

### Additional information

If I set

    OUTPUT=USB
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

    BACKUP=RSYNC
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://my_server/path/to/images

`rear mkrescue -v` attempts to rsync something to `my_server`, despite
the fact that I intended to make the image creation/saving process (the
`OUTPUT_*` variables) be entirely local. If I allow the rsync
connections, it eventually complains about xattr, which doesn't make
sense if it's trying to create and store the bootable image locally.

If I set `BACKUP=NETFS`, which the man page strongly implies should work
with `BACKUP_URL=rsync://...`, I get

    ERROR: Invalid scheme 'rsync' in BACKUP_URL 'rsync://my_server/path/to/backups' valid schemes: nfs cifs usb tape file iso sshfs ftpfs

FWIW, I also tried `OUTPUT=ISO` and `OUTPUT_URL=file://...` with
`BACKUP=RSYNC`, assuming I could burn to a flash drive later, but it
again attempted to rsync during `mkrescue`.

Is there a way to get this combination (bootable image to flash drive,
backup content to remote machine over rsync or scp, i.e. not NFS or
CIFS) to work?

@noambernstein

onyl FYI  
a totally offhanded and untested idea  
what might help out here in a generic way:

My assumption is that somehow the config variables  
OUTPUT and OUTPUT\_URL versus BACKUP and BACKUP\_URL  
have some more or less hardcoded interdependencies  
so one cannot freely use arbitrary combinations.

So my basic idea is to get separated things separated  
i.e. what config variables settings are used for  
"rear mkrescue" versus for "rear mkbackuponly".

You cannot use "rear mkbackup" when you want the  
ReaR recovery system be made different than what  
is used for the backup.  
I guess this could be the reason behind why you see  
interdependencies between OUTPUT and OUTPUT\_URL  
versus BACKUP and BACKUP\_URL.  
When you want the ReaR recovery system to be made  
different than what is used for the backup you must use  
"rear mkrescue" with its specific config variables settings  
to make only the ReaR recovery system (without backup)  
versus  
"rear mkbackuponly" with its specific config variables settings  
to make only the backup (without ReaR recovery system).

To do this have a look at

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/release/2.9/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc>

In particular in its section  
"Relax-and-Recover Setup for Different Backup Methods"  
note this part:

    Using different backup methods requires to get all the
    binaries and all other needed files of all used backup methods
    into the ReaR recovery/rescue system during "rear ... mkrescue".

    Those binaries and other needed files must be manually specified
    via REQUIRED_PROGS and COPY_AS_IS in /etc/rear/local.conf
    (regarding REQUIRED_PROGS and COPY_AS_IS see conf/default.conf).

I have no idea whether or not this may or may not work  
for what you need here - but you may at least try out  
how far this might help for your specific use case.
