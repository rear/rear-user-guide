##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=2097437](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097437)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    without the change:

<!-- -->

    # echo 'PROGS+=( timeout )' >> /etc/rear/local.conf
    # rear -d mkrescue
    ...
    Testing that the recovery system in /var/tmp/rear.sewWahfi7dNgMlf/rootfs contains a usable system
    ...
    # chroot /var/tmp/rear.sewWahfi7dNgMlf/rootfs timeout 10 vi +q
    # echo $?
    124

with the change, the return code is 0 and manually executing vi in the
chroot works properly.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In recent Fedora and RHEL 9, `vi` is a shell script that executes `vim`
if found, so linking `vim` to `vi` leads to an infinite loop. Fix by
removing the symlink (I find it more confusing than helpful anyway, and
it is good to reduce the amount of special handling) and adding
`/usr/libexec/vi` (the real executable, executed by `vi` if `vim` is not
found) to `COPY_AS_IS`.

One could add vim as well, but I am afraid that it would bloat the
rescue ramdisk in case vim is compiled with a rich set of features.

Impact is High, because `vi` in the rescue system is currently broken
without the change.

@gdha I was thinking about it, but the problem is, this "just in case"
may get quite expensive in terms of ramdisk size, if `vim` is linked
against e.g. Perl, Python, TCL and GTK (I believe on Ubuntu / Debian
this can be the case).

I found 'vim' at those code places

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'vim' | grep -v '# vim: set et ts=4 sw=4'

    usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/005_create_symlinks.sh:
    ln -sf $v vi $ROOTFS_DIR/bin/vim >&2

    usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/106_remove_files_copied_unconditionally.sh:
        bin/vim

Perhaps with the changes in this pull request in  
build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/106\_remove\_files\_copied\_unconditionally.sh

    # Remove symlinks whose targets have been excluded on the PBA system
    local symlinks_to_remove=(
        bin/vim
        var/lib/rear
    )

could be simplified or cleaned up to

    # Remove symlinks whose targets have been excluded on the PBA system
    local symlinks_to_remove=(
        var/lib/rear
    )

?

build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/106\_remove\_files\_copied\_unconditionally.sh  
originates from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e9f61ccc74f5b5be8106b43f67b219983e955956](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e9f61ccc74f5b5be8106b43f67b219983e955956)  
which points to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2448](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2448)  
but I found no explanation why the 'bin/vim' symlink is removed  
especially in case of OUTPUT=RAWDISK

@jsmeix good catch, I have no idea why that symlink gets removed, but
since we now avoid creating it. I guess it makes sense to avoid removing
it as well.

I addressed both comments, so I will rebase and merge the PR.
