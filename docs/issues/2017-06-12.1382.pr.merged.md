Do not create multipath.conf file if multipath devices were present  
on source. Even if multipath.conf does not exist. This mean the system
can work without multipath.conf and use default options (no firendly
names etc..) like Suse.

If the source system can work without multipath.conf we want to keep it
unchanged during rescue and only create multipath.conf during "migration
from non-multipath to mulitpath"
