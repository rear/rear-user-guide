Hi there,

we have an issue with rear 1.14-3, trying to prepare DR for a HP
Proliant Server.

The "rear -v mkbackup" went fine, and I can boot it up, but when doing
recovery, hpraid.sh reports an error after successful restauration of
the configuration:

...  
Recreating HP SmartArray controller 0|B  
Warning: stripesize is deprecated. Use stripsize instead.  
Configuration restored successfully, reloading CCISS driver...  
Could not configure an HP SmartArray controllers.

1.  View Relax-and Recover log...

The logfile has the following details:

... Engage SCSI on host /proc/driver/cciss/cciss0  
/var/lib/rear/layout/hpraid.sh: line 63: echo: write error: No such
device or address  
...

Lines 60-64 in hpraid.sh read:

make the CCISS tape device visible
==================================

for host in /proc/driver/cciss/cciss?; do  
Log "Engage SCSI on host $host"  
echo echange scsi &gt;$host  
done

I commented out the echo command, and could go ahead with recovery.

Is this a bug in hpraid.sh?

Regards, Tom

In my opinion the *engage* should not be fatal, even when I think it
ought to work in all cases.
