(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.1 through latest github

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Fedora 26

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup  
    OUTPUT\_URL=file:///home/exedor/images/  
    ISO\_MAX\_SIZE=4400  
    BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}"  
    '/backup'  
    '/home/exedor/images' )  
    COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE=( ${copy\_as\_is\_exclude\[@\]}  
    '/backup'  
    '/home/exedor/images' )

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    Legacy BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    The ISO image is created. When I burn it to disk and then try and
    use it, the restore process gets to "Running mkinitrd..." and then
    gets stuck and does not proceed. There is no activity of any kind
    from system LEDs. It just gets stuck. I left it that way for a half
    hour, just to be sure.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    USB backup and restore works flawlessly so right now, that's the
    work around.

@exedor Could you see in a second window what it was doing at that time?
And, could you paste the last lines from the rear.log?

We could not reproduce this problem the user had. No further feedback
received - closing it - if needed it can be re-opened.

OK, I'm finally getting back to this. I'm still having the same problem
on several of the systems I'm trying to restore to. I have other systems
with older Biostar motherboards and everything works fine. However I
still get this behavior on a bunch of systems. The USB works great, but
the ISO fails every time and hangs on this mkinitrd step. I have tried
grabbing an alternate console and am unable to do so. What is the trick
to making that work?

I can hit Ctrl-C and it tries to run mkinitrd again. Then I hit Ctrl-C
again and then it finally stops. I've looked at the log before exiting
and I'm not finding much that is useful. Can we re-open this?

I'm hitting this while trying to "rear recover" RHEL 7.6 images (on 10
machines).  
Is there a work-around I can run after "rear recover" hangs on the
"Running mkinitrd..." screen?

The previously mentioned work-arounds seem to be for those who which to
build a new image. I'm just hoping to recover the images I already have
for now.

I'm happy someone else is finally running into this. We have gone to
strictly USB image backup and restore and abandoned the much more cost
effective option of using DVD disks. That at least kept us running while
we work to address other far more pressing issues. Ever time I think I
can get back to this to find root cause and provide more/better
troubleshooting info to the devs, I get blind sided by some other urgent
crisis :(

@exedor  
FYI two side notes regarding "USB image backup and restore":

1.  

See what the description about `MIGRATION_MODE` in default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
reads about "an ultimate disaster" that could happen when your USB
disk  
with your backup has same size as your target system harddisk, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)  
This issue is mitigated since ReaR 2.3 because since ReaR 2.3 there is  
improved MIGRATION\_MODE autodetection when the disk layout looks
ambiguous  
so that ReaR 2.3 is more fail-safe against recreating on a possibly
wrong disk, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)

1.  

There is a general problem when the ReaR recovery system  
was booted from a normal disk device like a USB disk, see
