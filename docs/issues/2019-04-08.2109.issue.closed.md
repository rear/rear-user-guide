#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
    OS\_VERSION=7

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=TSM  
    COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_TSM=(
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/libTsmViSdk.so
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/libTsmViSdk.so
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/libtypes.so
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/libvim-types.so
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/plugins64/libdiskLibPlugin.so )

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    vmware guest

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    BIOS/GRUB

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    local disk

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    We have Dynatrace Oneagent for APM installed.  
    The installer generates /etc/ld.so.preload with
    "/$LIB/liboneagentproc.so". I bet in order to  
    load the correspondig 32- or 64-bit.  
    We also run "rear mkrescue" each night to have a rescue ISO
    generated.  
    On stderr we get an error "Failed to copy
    '/$LIB/liboneagentproc.so'".

-   Workaround, if any:  
    I traced it back to the function RequiredSharedOjects in
    lib/linux-functions.sh.  
    The awk statement at the end parses ldd output for 3 different
    patterns.  
    So with the given ld.so.preload from Dynatrace the ldd output
    includes a line like this:  
    /$LIB/liboneagentproc.so =&gt; /lib64/liboneagentproc.so
    (0x00007ff999916000)  
    This line matches two times in the awk statement:  
    -first time here: /^\\t.+ =&gt; // { print $3; }  
    -second time in next line: /^\\t// { print $1; } '  
    I fixed it to add a "next" after each awk-print statement.  
    So a line of ldd-output only matches ones and everything is fine.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):  
    I will try to generate a pull request for this

Thanks in advance,  
Johannes

@jgrumboe  
thank you for finding and fixing such special cases where  
the RequiredSharedObjects() function did not yet work properly.

It seems it is in particular third party tools that do very special
things  
with their libraries where the RequiredSharedObjects() function  
is not yet prepared for. The last one of such issues was  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980)

@jgrumboe  
I have a question:

I do not understand how it happens that /lib64/liboneagentproc.so  
(which seems to be a library from Dynatrace Oneagent for APM)  
is added to the ReaR recovery system.

I mean what is the reason behind why such a special library  
for special software is needed in the ReaR recovery system?

@jsmeix  
I agree that there's no usecase for liboneagent in the recovery system.
It slips right into it because it is defined in /etc/ld.so.preload and
rear tries to find out automatically every required shared lib.  
Probably it would be nice to have an exclude option for this, but as you
said it's a very special case.

@jsmeix and @rmetrich  
Thanks for pointing me to \#1980.  
I tried this fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980/commits/eba2b88ec11235799ae6f56811c58a854b1304d9?file-filters%5B%5D=.sh\#diff-4e4a62951eec0f3018ad0193024ea158](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1980/commits/eba2b88ec11235799ae6f56811c58a854b1304d9?file-filters%5B%5D=.sh#diff-4e4a62951eec0f3018ad0193024ea158)
and this also fixes my problem.

Additionally i saw that \#1980 is already available under RHEL with
rear-2.4-4.el7\_6.  
On my system i had rear-2.4-2.el7 - so i just need to upgrade.

@jgrumboe  
could you attach a `rear -D mkrescue` debug log file  
so that I could understand how exactly it happens that  
/lib64/liboneagentproc.so is added to the ReaR recovery system.

Not urgent or "must have" for ReaR 2.5 so postponed to ReaR 2.6
