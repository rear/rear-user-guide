In 1.13, there was a block of logic in
/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh
that defined the variable "displayarchive" which contains the location
of the backup files.

This is missing in 1.14 and newer versions. Any chance of adding this
back in? Or is there a new variable that references the same thing?

Have a look at `prep/NETFS/default/07_set_backup_archive.sh` - it is now
called `backuparchive`

Ah. I had scripts implemented from previous versions of ReaR that
referenced `displayarchive` and were failing after the upgrade. I'm sure
I'm not the only one that was confused by this change.

@gigawatts can this issue be closed? Or, do you have other concerns?

I ended up just defining it myself in one of the rear conf files with
the same code that was stripped out of the new rear versions

`displayarchive="$NETFS_URL/${NETFS_PREFIX}/${BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE}${BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX}${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX}"`

This suits my needs for now. If there are no plans to add this back into
the current versions, then yes, this issue can be closed.

Ok thank you for the feedback. Indeed no plans to re-introduce this
variable, so do not forget about it for the next update of rear
