New RECOVERY\_COMMANDS array that specifies the "rear recover"
commands  
which are automatically called after the ReaR recovery system has
started up  
to recreate the system in **'auto\_recover'/'automatic'** or
'**unattended**' mode.

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?

Seems to work OK for me so far  
with the defaults (in default.conf)  
and also with (excerpt)

    ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended
    ISO_DEFAULT=automatic
    RECOVERY_COMMANDS=( "echo 'rear -Dn recover' in $USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT seconds" "sleep $USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT" "rear -Dn recover" )
    RECOVERY_COMMANDS_LABEL="rear -Dn recover"
    REBOOT_COMMANDS=( "echo poweroff in $USER_INPUT_UNATTENDED_TIMEOUT seconds" "sleep $USER_INPUT_UNATTENDED_TIMEOUT" "poweroff" )
    REBOOT_COMMANDS_LABEL="poweroff"

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
added RECOVERY\_COMMANDS (plus RECOVERY\_COMMANDS\_LABEL)  
and in default.conf set and describe defaults  
so that manual "rear recover" behaves as before.

At least for me my current code in  
\[skel/default\]/etc/scripts/system-setup  
seems to work rather well (likely not yet perfect).

Because currently there is nothing in default.conf  
for RECOVERY\_COMMANDS I test with things like (excerpt)

    #ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended
    #ISO_DEFAULT=automatic
    RECOVERY_COMMANDS=( 'echo rear $rear_options recover in $USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT seconds'
                        'sleep $USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT'
                        'rear $rear_options recover' )
    RECOVERY_COMMANDS_LABEL='rear $rear_options recover'
    REBOOT_COMMANDS=( 'echo poweroff in $USER_INPUT_UNATTENDED_TIMEOUT seconds'
                      'sleep $USER_INPUT_UNATTENDED_TIMEOUT'
                      'poweroff' )
    REBOOT_COMMANDS_LABEL='poweroff'
    #USER_INPUT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT=11
    #USER_INPUT_UNATTENDED_TIMEOUT=7

@jsmeix your PR should add a default value for `RECOVERY_COMMANDS` to
default.conf, I suspect that that's why the CI tests are failing.

I believe this will be very useful especially for automated testing. One
will be able to inject flags like -D or -d, and even test another
recovery system commands, like `rear mountonly`, or perform examination
of the recovery system (saving logs etc).

@pcahyna  
currently there is nothing in default.conf for RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
because currently this pull request is a work in progress draft.  
Soon I will add defaults for RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
and RECOVERY\_COMMANDS\_LABEL together with  
a description what that thingy is good for...

maybe you can actually squash all the commits together because the
latter commits merely fix problems with the earlier commits and we don't
need all the commits in the history?

That's what the CI test actually does, so you maybe don't need to spend
time on this kind of test (unless you want to test specifically on SUSE
distributions, the CI runs on Fedora and CentOS).

A further side note regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089\#discussion\_r1413862335](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089#discussion_r1413862335)  
(i.e. using 'eval echo')  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089\#discussion\_r1414329071](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089#discussion_r1414329071)  
(i.e. using 'envsubst')  
to evaluate nested variable values:

Neither 'eval' nor 'envsubst' properly evaluate  
even deeper nested variable values:

    # export toplevel='toplevel with $indirection1'

    # export indirection1='indirection1 with $indirection2'

    # export indirection2='no further indirection'

    # echo $toplevel
    toplevel with $indirection1

    # eval echo $toplevel
    toplevel with indirection1 with $indirection2

    # eval eval echo $toplevel
    toplevel with indirection1 with no further indirection

    # echo $toplevel | envsubst
    toplevel with indirection1 with $indirection2

    # echo $toplevel | envsubst | envsubst
    toplevel with indirection1 with no further indirection

When one knows the varaiable names one could do

    # indirection1_evaluated="${toplevel//'$indirection1'/$indirection1}"

    # indirection2_evaluated="${indirection1_evaluated//'$indirection2'/$indirection2}"

    # echo $indirection2_evaluated
    toplevel with indirection1 with no further indirection

Perhaps I should do the latter for 'rear\_options' like

    # command='rear $rear_options workflow'

    # rear_options='-v'

    # echo "Running '${command//\$rear_options/$rear_options}' automatically"
    Running 'rear -v workflow' automatically

I don't know what is better:

    # echo "... '${var//'$nested'/$nested}' ..."

or

    # echo "... '${var//\$nested/$nested}' ..."

To me the latter code looks more clear.

'${parameter//pattern/string}' is old bash functionality  
(I tested it also on SLES 10 SP4 with GNU bash 3.1.17).

The 'rear\_options' value is safe because we set it in  
\[usr/share/rear/skel/default\]/etc/scripts/system-setup

But this is proper behavior! Shell itself does not evaluate this. As
shown in your first example, below. So `eval`, which evaluates the
string as interpreted by the shell, should not do it either. It would be
very unsafe if the shell interpreted variable references recursively.

What is the problem you are trying to solve? We don't have any nested
variable references like this currently. The `rear_options` value does
not contain any variable reference. So, what would you need evaluation
of deeply nested variable references for?

I thought you wanted to keep the code simple, i.e. no attempts at
variable replacement in the displayed string? Anyway, if you want to
perform replacement anyway, I think the latter code is clearer. Too many
single quotes in the former.

A remark regarding squashing commits:

While squashing commits makes the history  
of the master branch look cleaner  
it seems it causes that the squashed commits  
(i.e. commits "inside" a pull request)  
become somewhat "dangling" or "orphaned" to some extent  
because e.g. for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b131e473807f28c051f1c019d17d63c245a406da](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b131e473807f28c051f1c019d17d63c245a406da)  
the GitHub web frontend shows

    This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository,
    and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Walking back the chain of parents finally leads to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/09c81c9f93fe6a76e9e35122e2ff45f1427c1e8f](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/09c81c9f93fe6a76e9e35122e2ff45f1427c1e8f)  
which points to the wrong pull request,  
i.e. not the one where  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b131e473807f28c051f1c019d17d63c245a406da](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b131e473807f28c051f1c019d17d63c245a406da)  
belongs to (which is this pull request here).

In contrast without squashing commits  
for a commit "inside" a pull request like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4960ca8b4bbc5d8346470f54be289d7482e3eaf4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4960ca8b4bbc5d8346470f54be289d7482e3eaf4)  
the GitHub web frontend shows `master (#3070)` with links

    [master](https://github.com/rear/rear) ([#3070](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3070))

so without squashing for commits "inside" a pull request  
it is still visible to what pull request they belong.

I see. The problem seems to be that the WebUI
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089/commits](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089/commits)
still shows b131e473807f28c051f1c019d17d63c245a406da, but it is
dangling, which is not intuitive.

IMO, the right solution is to squash the commits yourself locally and
force push. Then merge in the WebUI without using the squash option.
This will update
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089/commits](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089/commits)
with the new commits that also the merged history will contain.
b131e473807f28c051f1c019d17d63c245a406da would not be visible at all,
instead of it you would see the squashed commit(s) under
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089/commits](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089/commits).
Would that work?

Regarding properly evaluating nested variables:

I only liked to show that there is no proper way to  
evaluate (possibly even deeper) nested variables  
so in general it is useless to try to do that.

Only under known restricted/controlled conditions  
nested variables can be properly evaluated.

Currently I don't know if I will ever implement

    ${command//\$rear_options/$rear_options}

but at least I know that this specific case is feasible.
