Hello,

Those changes add the capacity in rear to stop/start some services or
run some required tasks previous to run backup (just like those exist
for recovery), this can be useful in some scenarios if, for example, a
small database that can be stopped and it's data will be consistent
after OS recovery without human intervention.

I've tested and forced error between pre and post to check correct
behaviour of Exit Tasks in case of any error during backup if, for
example, some service stopped in PRE can be started by Exit Tasks array.

Following changed:

new file: usr/share/rear/backup/default/01\_pre\_backup\_script.sh

    if test "$PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT" ; then
        Log "Running PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT '${PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}'"
        AddExitTask "${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"
        eval "${PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"
    fi

new file: usr/share/rear/backup/default/99\_post\_backup\_script.sh

    if test "$POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT" ; then
        Log "Running POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT '${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}'"
        RemoveExitTask "${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"
        eval "${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"
    fi

modified: usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

    # Call this after Relax-and-Recover finished to do anything in the mkbackup/mkbackuponly workflow.
    POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT=

    # Call this before Relax-and-Recover starts to do anything in the mkbackup/mkbackuponly workflow.
    PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT=

required configuration on /etc/rear/local.conf:

    PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT="/path_to_scripts/pre_scr.sh"
    POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT="/path_to_scripts/post_scr.sh"

Kind regards,

Didac

@didacog  
I do not understand why you have the AddExitTask()  
and RemoveExitTask() calls, cf.  
"Code should be easy to understand"  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Such calls are not used in the implementation for  
PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
in setup/default/01\_pre\_recovery\_script.sh  
and wrapup/default/50\_post\_recovery\_script.sh

In particular

<pre>
if test "$PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT" ; then
    ...
    AddExitTask "${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"
</pre>

looks like a typo.

But I guess it is intentionally that POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
is added as exit task when PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is non-empty  
but I do not understand why - i.e. I do not understand how it is  
meant to work - i.e. why is not PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT only called as in the  
implementation for PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
and POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT?

@didacog  
I assume when you add your usecase description here in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/977\#issue-172932345](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/977#issue-172932345)  
in a bit more explanatory way to default.conf then I  
(and all other rear users) would understand how  
PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
are meant to be used.

@jsmeix

Is not a typo, for example:  
In case you are stopping a small mySQL database in order to maintain its
data consistency with rear backup, you want to re-start it again after
backup.  
It will be done in 99\_post\_backup\_script.sh if all tasks between 01
and 99 of backup stage are ok, but if some error occur in the meantime,
ExitTasks will do it.

In case of no POST tasks, nothing will happen anyway.

I don't know if I explained well.

Regards,

@jsmeix

I've updated default.conf with explanation about PRE POST backup.

Hope this will be ok. ;)

Hooray!  
Now even I understand it  
and - with pleasure - I can "just merge" it :-)

@didacog  
many thanks for your vaulable contribution!

@didacog  
I like all those various little helper functionality in
Relax-and-Recover  
very much. Usually it is not needed but when it is needed it is  
a priceless advantage to have them available, cf.  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL  
BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY  
they all do not make anything "just work out of the box"  
but in case of special issues they can (hopefully) help.

@gdha  
This one got merged into rear:dev.  
Now I wonder about the procedure  
how to decide if it also gets merged into rear:master and  
if yes, how to actually get it merged into rear:master?

@didacog @jsmeix @schlomo Pull requests who made it in the **dev**
branch should first go through a QA test before we allow it in the
**master** branch. That is the idea behind it. I do not want to cripple
a release with untested commits.Otherwise, we will never come to a
stable release IMHO. If it doesn't make it for this release it will be
for another. However, do not yet panic.  
I'm trying to setup an automatic testing bed for rear (but it will take
time)

@gdha sounds good for me. We are working in that way in DRLM also.

We use git-flow to manage: release tagging, hotfixes and features on
branches from dev until merged to master.

If we can help in some way we'll be pleased to do It.
