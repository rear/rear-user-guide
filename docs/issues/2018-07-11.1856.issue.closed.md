-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): fedora

-   Brief description of the issue: the `rear.spec` requires a minor
    cleanup according Fedora packager tibbs

Action: check the Fedora Packaging Guide what they have to say about it:

From the File Permissions section  
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines\#File\_Permissions](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#File_Permissions)

<pre>
The default file mode is 0644 or 0755. Directories should be mode 0755.
Most well behaved build scripts and rpm will use these defaults.
If the directory needs to be group writable, it SHOULD also have
the setgid bit set so that files written there are owned by that group.
These directories SHOULD have mode 2775.

The %defattr directive in the %files list SHOULD ONLY be used
when setting a non-default value, or to reset to the default value
after having set a non-default value. 
</pre>

@jsmeix The above statement is probably for RHEL based systems. The
question is now does this also applies to SLES based systems?

See my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855\#issuecomment-404100990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855#issuecomment-404100990)

I think our ReaR upstream `rear.spec` is o.k. as long as our ReaR
upstream RPMs  
get built o.k. by the openSUSE build service for the various Linux
distributions.

FYI:  
My own `rear.spec` at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1)  
has

<pre>
%defattr(-,root,root,-)

As far as I see the "openSUSE:Specfile guidelines"  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile\_guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines)  
require that

<pre>
Every %files section must include a %defattr(...) line.
</pre>

see  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile\_guidelines\#Permissions](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines#Permissions)

<pre>
Permissions on files must be set properly.
Executables should be set with executable permissions, for example.
Every %files section must include a %defattr(...) line.
Here is a good default:

%files
%defattr(-,root,root)

Unless you have a very good reason to deviate from that,
you should use %defattr(-,root,root) for all %files sections
in your package.
You can use %defattr(-,root,root,0755) to fix permission issues
with directories. E.g. when an umask was too tight while unpacking.

I think this issue is not a ReaR upstream issue, cf.

@gdha  
provided you agree that this issue is not a ReaR upstream issue,  
can we close it or do you need it to be open for some time?

@jsmeix As OBS requires it I agree that we must keep it. We can close
this task.
