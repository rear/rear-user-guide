### Platform

Linux x64

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Lack of docs for EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS

### Describe the solution you'd like

It doesn't seem that EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS is documented and this is
pretty much the only (one of the few) option I need to use for rear.

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc>

Would seem like the logical place to document it but it could instead be
covered on:

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc>

@jsmeix outlined it like this for me (I have genericised it a bit)

    You can exclude your disk (eg /dev/sda)  via EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS like

    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS+=( /dev/sda )

    (Maybe give a /dev/disk/by-id example too?)

    To exclude a disk with mounted filesystems one must also specify
    the filesystem mountpoints for example via

    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS+=( /dev/sdX fs:/mountpoint1 fs:/mountpoint2 )

    Where fs:/mountpoint1 and fs:/mountpoint2 are mount dirs on sdX.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

This depends on that my  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3455>  
is merged  
and when it is merged it is already described  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf (excerpts)

    # How to exclude something ----- EXCLUDES -------
    #
    # Normally a whole device (e.g. a disk device /dev/sdX) is not excluded directly
    # (for exceptional cases see EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS below).
    # Instead specific things on a device are excluded.
    # When everything on a device is excluded then via the dependency tracker
    # the whole device gets automatically excluded from the recovery
    # because there is no recovery information left for that device.
    ...
    # EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS: Exclude any component from the recovery.
    # Some component types need a prefix:
    # - filesystems: "fs:/var/cache"
    # - physical volumes: "pv:/dev/sda2"
    # - swap: "swap:/dev/mapper/system-swap"
    # Volume groups look like: "/dev/system".
    # For the correct syntax of a specific component see /var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf
    # Because EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS excludes any component from the recovery
    # it can be used in exceptional cases to exclude unwanted whole disks from the very beginning,
    # for example to circumvent issues with unneeded problematic disks which cause issues in ReaR
    # as in https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2995 where parted could not recognize a partition table.
    # To exclude a disk with mounted filesystems their mountpoints must be also specified
    # for example via EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS+=( /dev/sdX fs:/mountpoint1 fs:/mountpoint2 )
    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=()

Currently things do not look so good that the intent of  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3455>  
could be implemented with reasonable effort, see  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3455#issuecomment-2812436548>

To be clear, I need EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS to stop rear trying to backup my
ZFS disks which rear can't backup and restore properly. I use other
tools to backup ZFS.

I think this function is too important to have it only documented in
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf but thats just my opinion as a big fan
and user of ZFS.

@danboid Are you an ZFS expert as it would be nice to have this covered
by ReaR as well?

I wouldn't call myself an expert, I'm not a ZFS developer. I've been
using it for about a decade so I know it quite well.
