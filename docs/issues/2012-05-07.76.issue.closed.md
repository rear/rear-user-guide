Hi ,  
i'm testing REAR 1.13 on RHEL 6.2 x86\_64 .

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.2 (Santiago)  
2.6.32-220.13.1.el6.x86\_64 \#1 SMP Thu Mar 29 11:46:40 EDT 2012 x86\_64
x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

It runs on HP Proliant 585 G7 hardwae with 2 136GB disks in raid 1 and
128GB ram.  
I configured rear to save iso and backup on a cifs share for testing
purposes , maybe in prod the target environment should change to nfs.  
Anyway here i append a local.conf example that works well on a RHEL5.6
vm:

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=/rear/  
NETFS\_URL=cifs://10.0.18.178/rear  
NETFS\_OPTIONS=user=r0bby,pass=G10rg1a  
MODULES\_LOAD=( vmxnet )  
DHCLIENT\_BIN=dhclient  
DHCLIENT6\_BIN=

The output message is :

\[root@drac64cblab01 rear\]\# rear -vd mkbackup

You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.msFhqZc1EGOv7yA

I can't find a valid reason for this behaviour.

In your configuration file I see two definitions for the same:

    BACKUP_URL=/rear/
    NETFS_URL=cifs://10.0.18.178/rear

the `NETFS_URL` is deprecated and means the same as `BACKUP_URL`.
Therefore, use the following (see also the configuration-examples.txt
file for more examples).

To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use
`BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path`.  
To provide credentials for CIFS mounting use a `/etc/rear/.cifs`
credentials file and define  
`BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"` and pass along the variables
defined in `/etc/rear/.cifs` file:

    username=_username_
    password=_secret password_
    domain=_domain_

@r0bby I am closing this issue as resolved. If for some reasons this
does not work, or you have other feedback we should look at, feel free
to reopen this issue.

Sorry Sirs , i didn't see nor reply to your comments. Many thanks for
the solution , anyway i can't make it work using the .cifs cred file.
I'm investigating about the cause. As you can see from the past time ,
it's not an urgent matter .Thank you.
