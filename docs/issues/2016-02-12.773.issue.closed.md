With fedora23 I noticed that the rescue image could not start the
*rsyslogd* daemon because the `/etc/scripts/run-syslog` script contains
a parameter option `-c3` which is not valid anymore.  
I cannot even recall what the `-c3` option supposed to do? Removing the
`-c3` fixes this, but what was the purpose again? Anybody who knows
please tell me.
