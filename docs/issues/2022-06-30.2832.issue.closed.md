A user reported that he couldn't subscribe, who from @rear/contributors
can fix this? I can provide more details privately

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819\#issuecomment-1166895246](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819#issuecomment-1166895246)  
it seems the ReaR mailing lists that are shown at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
are provided by the mail system at host service.3ti.be

@gdha  
can you help with mail issues on service.3ti.be  
or do you know who could help?

I mailed the request to @dagwieers who knows the people of 3ti.be. We
have to wait on the response.
