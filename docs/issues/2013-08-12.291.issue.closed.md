I've got a server with the OS on internal disks. There are a lot of san
disks that don't need to be included in the backup. These have been
excluded with AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=y.

Unfortunately I do need one file system that is defined on the
san/multipath volume. Is there a way that I can include this file
system.

Or do I have to manually fill the exclude list with all filesystems on
the san except the file system I need ?

You could use in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file the following settings
(example only):

    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" "vg01" )
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( /san1 /san2 )

You must mention all mountpoints you want to exclude. You could use
`EXCLUDE_VG` instead of `ONLY_INCLUDE_VG`, but that is up to you what
you prefer.

It guess it's also useful to mention that the local.conf file is sourced
as a shell script. That means you can generate the list in
EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS if you want to...

It took what time and some clever implementation of the options but it  
worked.

@MalfuncEddie Could you explain what you mean with clever implementation
of the options?
