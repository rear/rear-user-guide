on `master` we now have

    Testing that the recovery system in /var/tmp/rear.AHBCO3wxs3FdARC/rootfs contains a usable system
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.so requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found'
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.so requires libsystemd-shared-255.so which was not found by 'ldd' but exists as /var/tmp/rear.AHBCO3wxs3FdARC/rootfs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-shared-255.so

thanks to \#3250 and I'd like to suggest a small improvement on it:

1.  strip the ReaR build including `.../rootfs` from the found library
2.  show these lines only in the log and not on the console, because
    this info is not actionable and we decided to assume that all is
    well if the missing lib is found somewhere.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308)  
intends to improve the first part

    strip the ReaR build including .../rootfs from the found library

Regarding the second part:

    show these lines only in the log and not on the console ...

I agree but - at least as I currently see - it is  
not straightforward to implement it because the message

    ... requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found'

is already output when there is any binary  
where 'ldd' shows 'not found'.

Only later we may find out that the file  
where 'ldd' had shown 'not found'  
actually exists within the recovery system.

Therefore the subsequent message

    ... exists as ...

is shown to the user to tell him that  
the file where 'ldd' had shown 'not found'  
actually exists within the recovery system  
so things should be OK with this file  
BUT  
one cannot rely on that things are actually OK  
with this file so the user should better  
double check things  
SO  
this message is (somewhat) actionable  
at least to a certain degree.

More regarding the second part:

We cannot silently rely on the assumption  
that all is well if the missing thing is found somewhere.

Totally agree, which is why I want to be able to white-list specific
things to be nevertheless OK, for example this systemd core library. Or
also the many special libs that some backup software references where we
know that they don't exist or exist somewhere as part of the backup
software tree.

That way we can slowly reduce the amount of false positives.

I think with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308)
merged  
this issue is solved because the first part

    strip the ReaR build including .../rootfs from the found library

is implemented by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308)  
and the second part

    show these lines only in the log and not on the console

cannot be done because we cannot silently rely on the assumption  
that all is well if the missing thing is found somewhere  
so we need to show these lines on the user's terminal  
to have him informed (in verbose mode).
