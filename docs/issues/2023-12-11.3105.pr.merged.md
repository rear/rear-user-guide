##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

with original code, `OUTPUT=ISO` and  
`POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS=( 'cp $STDOUT_STDERR_FILE /mnt/local/root' )`,  
`/root/rear.recover.stdout_stderr` contains:

    Including restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh
    mkdir: cannot create directory '/var/tmp/rear.pUTNJoLWHyPL5wP/outputfs/kvm-03-guest18': Read-only file system

In ReaR 2.6, when stdout and stderr of commands used to appear in the
recover log, this was printed to the recover log.

With the changed code, this does not appear.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Remove a forgotten  
`mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$NETFS_PREFIX`  
command in restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh.  
Should have been deleted in 7dda23d708854db2d09db1308c159aea667763c0  
with other code that touched the backup location.  
For the YUM method, the same change was already done  
in 6b9d8d8508183144f56eec92b828ae037c03a6f7

@pcahyna  
could you tell what the bug is when that `mkdir -p` is there?  
Perhaps the bug is obvious but I just don't see it.  
I mean:  
I seems to have worked well regardless of that `mkdir -p`  
so currently I consider it as only some "cleanup"?

@jsmeix see the error messages under "How was this pull request tested?"

As the error message was harmless, it could be considered just a
cleanup.
