Thinking forward, after we remove a feature that was deprecated in a
given version, we need to add the deprecated config variables to a
(forever growing) list of obsolete configuration variables that trigger
a hard error with an explanation, that this feature was removed in a
previous version of ReaR

Siilly idea for implementation:


    # check all used config variables against blacklist of removed configs
    for var in ${!*} ; do
      if InArray $var $blacklist ; then
         Error "$var is a deprecated feature that has been removed from ReaR, you'll have to downgrade ReaR to use it"
      fi
    done

Maybe the blacklist is a text file with the variable name in the first
column followed by an explanation and hint about the last usable version

The generic issue is what to do when config variables changed,  
i.e. when config variables name or syntax or semantics changed.

Examples:

-   Meaningless or misleading name changed to a meaningful name.
-   Syntax changed from "string of words" to an array.
-   Semantics change of one or more config variables together.

Should I create one or more separated issues for such cases  
or could we handle all config variables changes  
at a single place via this one same issue here?

(But then likely with several pull requests to solve it.)

@pcahyna  
regarding the ReaR 2.8 release  
where in current GitHub master code  
ReaR errors out for deprecated things  
(in a current `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git`):

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f \
     | xargs grep 'ErrorIfDeprecated' | grep -v ': *#'

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh:
    ErrorIfDeprecated gpt_sync_mbr "The 'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning is no longer supported by SUSE since 2016

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650_check_iso_recoverable.sh:
    ErrorIfDeprecated nsr_check_iso_recoverable "Check for Networker Backups conflicts with 'rear checklayout', see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3069"

    usr/share/rear/prep/GALAXY10/default/001_galaxy10_deprecation.sh:
    ErrorIfDeprecated galaxy10 "CommVault Simpana 10 is EOL since 2018 according to https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductEOLMessages"

    usr/share/rear/prep/GALAXY/default/001_galaxy_deprecation.sh:
    ErrorIfDeprecated galaxy "CommVault Galaxy 5 is EOL since 2006 according to https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductEOLMessages"

    usr/share/rear/prep/GALAXY7/default/001_galaxy7_deprecation.sh:
    ErrorIfDeprecated galaxy7 "CommVault Simpana 7 is EOL since 2014 according to https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductEOLMessages"

@pcahyna  
if you think it is needed in the above listed cases,  
I could change the ErrorIfDeprecated function for ReaR 2.8  
to show only a LogPrintError message that also tells  
that in ReaR 3.0 it will error out for deprecated features.
