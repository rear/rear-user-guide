-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

We have media server all live video files are getting save,  
we have 3 physical disk in the server  
/dev/sda 256GB for CentOS 8,  
/dev/sdb 8TB for every day video files  
/dev/sdc 8TB for copy end of day all video files from /dev/sdb to
/dev/sdc.

We are using cronjob for copying data which run ever day midnight
rsync.  
Now we are adding new server same make and model with bigger disk
layout  
like /dev/sdb=16TB and /dev/sdc=16TB.

For this we are using rear to create ISO on our NFS share.  
But we are not able to get in our back /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc.

Above all configuration we are test using vm's.  
we are able to backup only /dev/sda.

It is possible to add /dev/sdc & /dev/sdb in the same backup  
so while restoring we get as it is.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Did not found

I would recommed the opposite:

Use ReaR to only backup the basic operating system  
i.e. only for sda with CentOS 8.

Do the backup of huge data stuff separetedly.

I would even backup the "every day video files" on sdb  
separatedly from the backup of the "every day video files" on sdc.

Reason:

When you recreate the system with "rear recover"  
the whole backup gets restored.

During "rear recover" restoring the backup needs  
most of the whole time.

When you recreate the system with "rear recover"  
and only several GiB CentOS 8 files need to get restored  
"rear recover" will finish rather soon and you have  
your basic operating system back wherefrom you then  
can restore your huge data stuff as needed,  
in particular you would first only restore  
the "every day video files" on sdb  
and later - as time permits - also restore the  
backup of the "every day video files" on sdc.

Assume restoring several GiB CentOS 8 files needs 5 minutes  
then restoring several TiB data needs about 5000 minutes  
which is more than 80 hours which is more than 3 days.

So if you had all in one backup "rear recover" would  
need more than 6 days to finish - and if there is one  
single fatal backup restore error all will be lost.

Thank you so much for you quick reply on my question, we understood it
take backup only for OS Disk. In case if we need to add 2nd disk to this
backup if it is possible how
