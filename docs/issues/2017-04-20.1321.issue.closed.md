Currently "rear recover" recreates initrd/initramfs  
only if some drivers changed, see the code in the  
rebuild\_initramfs scripts.

I think recreating initrd only if some drivers changed it
insufficient.  
It basically calls for errors later when booting the recreated system.

I think by default initrd should always be recreated to be on the safe
side.  
ReaR can never verify all possible reasons why initrd must be
recreated.  
Only in special known cases recreating initrd could be skipped  
automatically by ReaR.

On the other hand when recreating initrd fails during "rear recover"  
this should not be a hard error abort because often the recreated  
system boots with the initrd that was restored form the backup, cf.  
the LogPrint "WARNING ..." messages in the rebuild\_initramfs scripts.

Probably best is to add a new boolean config variable

<pre>
REBUILD_INITRAMFS=""
</pre>

which defaults to "yes" if not specified by the user  
so that by default it works fail safe but still the user has the  
final power to decide whether or not ReaR recreates the initrd.

I can't remember now why we didn't recreate the initrd by default back
when I wrote this part. Maybe this is related to some historic SLES8/9
stuff which I forgot already.

Therefore I am all in favor. However, I would approach it from the other
side: Always recreate the initrd and have a variable (e.g.
`NO_REBUILD_INITRAMFS`) which can be set to force ReaR to trust the
existing initrd.

That would underline the fact that we believe that it should always be
generated.

I do not like logically inverse working boolean variables  
that lead to code like

<pre>
NO_REBUILD_INITRAMFS="no"
if ! is_false "$NO_REBUILD_INITRAMFS" ; then
</pre>

Huh?!  
What exactly is that code meant to do?

I already got crazy when working on code that deals with  
that NOBOOTLOADER thingy. At least for me I get too  
easily the logic of inverse working boolean variables inverse.

In other words:  
Usually I fail to implement code for inverse working boolean variables  
correctly and then I fail to fix my bugs correctly ad infinitum...

I meant more like

    is_true $NO_REBUILD_INITRAMFS && return

which to me is positive logic even though the variable denotes disabling
something.

Otherwise, if it helps you, maybe just call it `KEEP_INITRAMFS` instead.
Although I would not prefer that as it sounds too positive for something
that we consider a bad idea.

Of course for our initial intended use case

<pre>
is_true $NO_REBUILD_INITRAMFS && return
</pre>

the logic is clear and simple.

I meant when more sophisticated cases may appear later  
(because of whatever reasons that I cannot foersee now)  
then inverse working boolean variables easily cause bugs.

I think in practice it should not really matter if we use  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS or NO\_REBUILD\_INITRAMFS  
because for normal use cases the user should not  
bother with that setting and for experts who like to  
not rebuild their initrd/initramfs both names are o.k.

merged  
this issue should be fixed.
