Regarding Version 2.5-1

From issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2228\#issue-489707602](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2228#issue-489707602)
I learnt that setting values for variable PROGS must be carried out as
an *addtion* of the new values to the predefined variable.

But why?  
In default.conf variable PROGS is set to an *empty* array so it seemed
not to make any harm to *set* some values. But it did not work.  
Does anybody else do things to that variable before it is sourced with
my values?  
And if so, how could I know to be careful and only *add* things, since
there is no hint in default.conf .

As for AUTOXCLUDE\_PATH it works to *set* the respective pathes.

It is not empty. See at least
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/b8b7e466ed85891eff67e6653fb2239f41655f82/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf\#L12](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/b8b7e466ed85891eff67e6653fb2239f41655f82/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L12)

@guru4712  
two side notes FYI:

Run `rear -s mkrescue` (`-s` is simulation mode)  
to see what scripts would get sourced in your case.  
Cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Run something like

    find usr/share/rear/ -name '*.sh' | xargs grep 'PROGS='

to find all places in ReaR scripts where `PROGS` is assigned.

@jsmeix well it will not find += if/when there are any :)

@pcahyna  
so we know now at least one reason for using

    ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" additional elements )

instead of the simpler and more fail safe

    ARRAY+=( additional elements )

:-)

@guru4712
