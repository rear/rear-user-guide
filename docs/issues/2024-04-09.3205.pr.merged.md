This is stuff that I fixed while working on the \#3190:

-   Obsolete old and ancient validations
-   Support RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 for OS detection
-   abort earlier if `rear recover` runs on non-rescue system

Please have a look, I'll merge them soon otherwise.

FYI, the [koji build
job](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=116151447)
failed with

    BuildError: Unknown origin for rust-srpm-macros-epel-26.2-1.el9.noarch: file:///var/tmp/koji/tasks/7264/116147264/repo_5998851_premerge/

which seems to be unrelated to ReaR because our own package build was
successful.

I'll be merging this now.
