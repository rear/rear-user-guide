hi,

this should be more a discussion as a issue.

Rear 2.3  
Ubuntu 10.X (very old, i know)

While moving a system to another host using REAR i came along this
interesting disk layout.  
The original disk is formatted like this:

    Number  Start         End            Size          Type      File system  Flags
     1      32256B        53686402559B   53686370304B  extended
     5      64512B        53686402559B   53686338048B  logical
     2      53686402560B  107372805119B  53686402560B  primary

disklayout.conf for this device looks like this:

    disk /dev/sdc 107374182400 msdos
    # Partitions on /dev/sdc
    part /dev/sdc 1024 32256 extended none /dev/sdc1
    part /dev/sdc 53686402560 53686402560 primary none /dev/sdc2
    part /dev/sdc 53686338048 64512 logical none /dev/sdc5

However, the disk layout recration script fails with:

    +++ parted -s /dev/sdc mkpart primary 2101248B 64426648780B
    Error: Can't have overlapping partitions.

the commands beeing used are:

    rear> grep "parted -s /dev/sdc mkpart" /var/log/rear/rear-sepcrm2.log
    +++ parted -s /dev/sdc mkpart extended 2097152B 128849018879B
    +++ parted -s /dev/sdc mkpart primary 2101248B 64426648780B

i was able to recreate the disks partitions by editing the recovery
script and giving it  
clear assigments, thus the partitions not overlapping.

The main question here for me is: clearly the disk is partitioned in a
very strange way:

1.  should REAR work around this?
2.  should it even work?
3.  would there be a possibility to detect such caveats during creation
    of the recovery iso and  
    either warn the user about a strange disk layout, or even fail? I
    think that would better than leaving the user with a frustrating
    situation during restore.

Be aware SLES 10 is not official supported anymore by ReaR.

I think what is missing in general in ReaR are various verification
tests  
that run during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" to verify that things  
on the original system look o.k. (as far as possible with reasonable
effort)  
so that one can more often expect that also later during "rear
recover"  
things work o.k. (as far as possible with reasonable effort), e.g. see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1711\#issuecomment-361544271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1711#issuecomment-361544271)

In particular there are tests missing that verify  
whether or not the entries in disklayout.conf look o.k.  
(as far as possible with reasonable effort), e.g. see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1704](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1704)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-361561739](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-361561739)

Only FYI:  
Regardles that SLE10 is not officially supported  
(which means there is no support for SLE10 specific issues)  
ReaR 2.3 even worked for me on SLE10 to some reasonable extent, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.3](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.3)

Also Ubuntu 10.X is not officially supported  
see "Supported Operating Systems" at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-3](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-3)  
which means there is no support for Ubuntu &lt; 12 specific issues  
but as far as I see this issue here is a generic issue because I think  
overlapping partitions could happen on any Linux distribution.

For me the main question here is if it is worth the effort  
to check the entries in disklayout.conf for overlapping partitions  
because it seems parted refuses to set up overlapping partitions  
so that overlapping partitions are probably an extreme corner case  
and testing for extreme corner cases is beyond "reasonable effort".

I close it as "won't fix" because while I was working  
on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)  
I found that detecting overlapping partitions is too complicated  
to be implemented with reasonable effort because in case of  
an extended partition its logical partitions are inside the extended
partition  
so that an extended partition must completely overlap its logical
partitions  
which makes the whole overlapping partitions detecting code too
complicated  
to be implemented with reasonable effort.

This does of course not mean that I would reject a GitHub pull request
that  
implements checking the entries in disklayout.conf for overlapping
partitions  
and/or other validation tests for the entries in disklayout.conf.

It only means that from my current point of view it looks too
complicated  
to be implemented with reasonable effort by me.

I think I see now and I can understand what actually went wrong in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718\#issue-293071380](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718#issue-293071380)

On the original system the partitions do not overlap  
but the parted commands that are generated during "rear recover"  
have partitioning data that would create overlapping partitions.

The reason is a (from my point of view severe) bug in how  
"rear recover" recreated partitions before I merged  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)

One bug was that the extended partition size was not correctly
detected  
(in disklayout.conf it is only 1024 bytes) which I fixed  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733/commits/6efb681d8b4c6a4d9f20b2900bbea79548c624a8](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733/commits/6efb681d8b4c6a4d9f20b2900bbea79548c624a8)

Because of the former bug the next bug was that during "rear recover"  
it recreated extended partitions always up to the end of the disk  
which I fixed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733/commits/f4273dc500be87263297f88827508b64d521ccf1](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733/commits/f4273dc500be87263297f88827508b64d521ccf1)

Accordingly I think this issue here is a real (severe) bug  
which is meanwhile fixed via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)

@abbbi  
please try out the latest ReaR GitHub master code and  
provide feedback whether or not it is actually fixed now for you.

In default.conf read the sections about MIGRATION\_MODE  
and the new AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE  
config variables because since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)  
the default behaviour changed.

I tested the latest ReaR GitHub master code  
whether or not it works when after the extended partition  
there is one more primary partition and for me it "just works".

On my original system I have this sdb

<pre>

On the replacement system I have a sdb with same size (also 2 GiB)  
and "rear recover" recreated byte-by-byte identical partitioning:

On the original system only /dev/sdb4 and /dev/sdb6 are mounted

<pre>
# mount | grep sdb
/dev/sdb4 on /data.primary4 type ext2 (rw)
/dev/sdb6 on /data.logical2 type ext2 (rw)
</pre>

which is the reason why no other filesystems were re-created  
on sdb during "rear recover", cf. at the bottom of
