We do not support backing up logical volumes or partitions that are not
mounted.

In case of e.g. KVM hosts, we fail to back up those disk images that are
logical volumes. We also fail to backup unmounted windows partitiions.

We should give the option to `dd` the contents of such devices.

Personally, I believe this type of backups fall under the category
"backup" and not DR. OTH, nothing stops you to write a small script and
plug it into the backup directory to make this happen ;-)

I agree. Maybe a good alternative is to warn the user if there are
logical volumes (or partitions) that are recreated but do not have a
filesystem/backup. (of course only when they have not been excluded)

I don't think we are expected to take care of this. Personally I would
expect VMs to run Rear as well. At least then a filesystem-level backup
is done rather than a disk dump.

hum, during presentation I always Windows partitions are not covered by
rear, by saying that, I believe it answers your request. No will do ;-)

@jhoekx may we close this issue?

Sure, I think I just moved it to the issue list from the original file.
