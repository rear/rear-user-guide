If using the FTP protocol (et al) for ISO output, REAR will not work if
YUM'd in since it will not require that the lftp RPM be installed with
it. But it is required for it to work as far as I can tell.

The `OUTPUT_URL=ftp://` requires `lftp` that is correct, but it is not a
core dependency for `rear` and therefore it is not mentioned in the
`rear.spec` file. If it is missing, you will noticed it when it tries to
ftp the ISO image (which fails).  
If that is not acceptable, please write a small script in the
`usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/` directory to check if `lftp` is
available? We are happy to accept a pull merge!

Be aware that on SLES `lftp` is not available as RPM. Sources can be
found at [http://lftp.yar.ru/get.html](http://lftp.yar.ru/get.html)
