udev 176
========

The 'devtmpfs' filesystem is required now, udev will not create or
delete  
device nodes anymore, it only adjusts permissions and ownership of
device  
nodes and maintains additional symlinks.

A writable /run directory (ususally tmpfs) is required now for a fully  
functional udev, there is no longer a fallback to /dev/.udev.

Is related to issue \#206

I believe this was a false alert...just close it without further notice.
