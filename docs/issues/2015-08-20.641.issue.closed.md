Hi.  
during some of my recovery tests on a RHEL6 server I investigated the
current

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/43\_prepare\_timesync.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/43_prepare_timesync.sh)

does not prepare the correct `90-timesync.sh` script in
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/` of the rescue image when using
`TIMESYNC=NTP` in the ReaR config file. This leads to a failure during
startup but does not seem to have any further influence.

Not beeing a shell expert this is due to the `cat` command beeing used
which already replaces the used (shell) variables in the resulting
script.

I "patched" the script as follows (`diff -u`); the "+++" is my patched
version; I still have to test if this works as supposed to:

I checked the situation. In principle the script `90-timesync.sh` is
working. Its output is as follows:

    ./90-timesync.sh 
    Setting system time via NTP ...
    getconfig: Couldn't open </etc/ntp/crypto/pw>
    ntpd: time slew -0.011359s

The error is initiated with the command `ntpd -q -g`. Maybe it is worth
extending the COPY\_AS\_IS section in the `43_prepare_timesync.sh` to
also copy `/etc/ntp/` ?

The extended looks as follows:

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp/ )

@hpannenb Thank you for reporting it - it has been fixed in the master

Works as supposed to. Thanks. :-)
