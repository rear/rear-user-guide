-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    rear-1.17.2
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL-7.2 Server
-   Brief description of the issue  
    Rear contains two basic possibilities during create backup:
    -   Create data backup: user should specify configuration directives
        BACKUP and BACKUP\_URL
    -   Create rescue image: user should specify OUTPUT and OUTPUT\_URL

We had rear testday and most of participants told that names of
configuration directives OUTPUT and OUTPUT\_URL are really confusing.
They are not able to navigate skillfully if it covers data backup or
rescue image. Yes, there is manual page and documentation, they use it,
but this problem was still appearing. They proposed renaming this
variables to for example RESCUE and RESCUE\_URL. Also it is possible to
preserve old directives as visible or hide options.
