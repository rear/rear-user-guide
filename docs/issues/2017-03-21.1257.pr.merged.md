Today I've accidentally found a small regression that can basically
avoid ReaR to correctly setting **USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1**.

With old code:

    if [[ -n $(find /boot -maxdepth 1 -iname efi -type d) ]]; then
        return    # not found
    fi

If *efi* directory is found inside */boot* 320\_include\_uefi\_env.sh
would prematurely return.

@gozora To my knowledge this was already fixed - did you forgot a
`git pull`?  
See

Hello @gdha,  
My fix is in file *320\_include\_uefi\_env.sh* the one you are
mentioning is about *310\_include\_uefi\_tools.sh*

@gozora  
many thanks for finding the other faulty test!

Could you - by the way - have a look at my comment  
in 310\_include\_uefi\_tools.sh about whether or not it might  
be better to abort with a clear Error message instead of  
proceeding 'bona fide'?  
My blind guess is that when the user has UEFI  
those stuff in those scripts must be successfully done  
and if that is not possible it should abort with an Error.  
In particular because the 'prep' stage is run during  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" where an Error abort can  
tell the user early that something is wrong (in contrast  
to an Error abort during "rear recover" where it is usually  
too late for the user to get things properly fixed).  
But I am not a sufficient UEFI expert to make an educated  
decision if an Error abort is better here.

Honestly? I really don't know which approach would be better :-(. I'll
try to focus on this part of code during my testing and maybe to find
out what would be better behavior ...

@gozora  
I fully agree with you.

First things first.

I will merge it soon because I think since your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1257/commits/42d1c4c5a1fc4019d104b3a87850816d666c1018](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1257/commits/42d1c4c5a1fc4019d104b3a87850816d666c1018)  
what @gdha requested is fulfilled.

How unfortunate - now I can no longer merge it ;-)

@gdha  
many thanks for your merge!  
:-)
