##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): NA

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `rear mkrescue`

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    I've moved *400\_guess\_kernel.sh* from **pack** to **prep** stage,
    to get access to KERNEL\_FILE variable earlier.  
    This will be helpful for future EFISTUB support, where KERNEL\_FILE
    could be checked for EFISTUB functionality in earlier stage and
    throw error a bit sooner ...

As far as I see the 400\_guess\_kernel.sh script  
does nothing else than to set the KERNEL\_FILE variable  
so that on first glance it seems to be o.k. when 400\_guess\_kernel.sh  
is moved to the 'prep' stage because what it does matches  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/README](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/README)

BUT:

It seems the code in the 400\_guess\_kernel.sh script also appears  
in our various 300\_copy\_kernel.sh scripts which makes this issue  
related to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851)  
so that we have one single piece of code  
where the KERNEL\_FILE variable is set.

Interestingly 400\_guess\_kernel.sh is run after 300\_copy\_kernel.sh  
which - offhandedly - looks just plain wrong to me...

@gozora  
in which subsequent stage do you actually need the KERNEL\_FILE value?

FYI:

The stages during `rear mkbackup`:

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -s mkbackup | grep '^Source ' | cut -d '/' -f1 | uniq
Source conf
Source init
Source prep
Source layout
Source rescue
Source build
Source pack
Source output
Source backup
</pre>

Unfortunately the 'prep' stage is the only one with a README file  
that explains its intent a bit.

The scripts that contain `KERNEL_FILE`:

<pre>
# find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep -l "KERNEL_FILE"
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh

Hello @jsmeix,

TLDR;  
Anywhere before */usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh*

Recently I was writing restore code for boot entry using `efibootmgr` in
`rear recover` stage.  
Since `efibootmgr` requires information about file to boot (which is
Linux kernel in our case), I've decided to store information about
kernel (available during backup) in /var/lib/rear/<somewhere>.  
Problem here is, that /var/lib/rear is copied into $ROOTFS\_DIR in
**build** stage and $KERNEL\_FILE becomes available in later **pack**
stage ...

V.

@gozora  
I will try to do a pull request that cleans up how KERNEL\_FILE is set,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851\#issuecomment-442419363](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851#issuecomment-442419363)

Because we are in development phase of ReaR 2.5  
I think I should do such a cleanup soon so that we could  
get feedback from users who use current ReaR upstream  
if my cleanup causes regressions on this or that architecture  
and/or on this or that Linux distribution where I don't test it myself.

@jsmeix, thanks I appreciate your action a lot!

Do you think that I can close this PR in favor of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851\#issuecomment-442419363](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851#issuecomment-442419363)
