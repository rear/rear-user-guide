See

and subsequent comments, in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512\#issuecomment-347927227](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512#issuecomment-347927227)  
but I decided to keep the

<pre>
if grep -q '^ssh:' /etc/inittab ; then
</pre>

in skel/default/etc/scripts/run-sshd  
because as far as I understand it a  
"ssh:23:respawn:..." entry in /etc/inittab is written by  
rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh only if sshd should be started.

Because it works well for me both on SLES11 and SLES12  
I would like to merge it soon unless there are objections.
