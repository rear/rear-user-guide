I have servers on which I don't want to install the LSB package because
of all of the dependencies it brings in. I would like to be able to
install a rear package and just create an os.conf file. Instead of
making lsb a mandatory dependency, perhaps the post-install script can
create the os.conf file automatically (or os.conf.nolsb) if lsb is not
installed, or at least tell the user to do one or the other. The spec
file should be able to work out the correct distro and release without
any trouble.

This is in fact already the case through OBS. The packages do not depend
on the LSB packages, and an os.conf is created by the SPEC file bas on
the distribution.

If this is not exactly as you want it, please reopen and provide more
details.

This sounds exactly how I want it.

But IMHO I should be able to get this result building my own package
using the spec file provided in the source code. The one I'm using, for
SUSE, has "Requires: iproute2 lsb". I see that it is conditional on
%{?suse\_version} being non-zero. So I don't know how the OBS gets
around this, unless they're using a different spec file. I'm using SLES
v10p3.

Similarly, is there a reason that portmap/rpcbind is "Requires"d? I
don't use NFS. Or is this also not required in the OBS package?

Apparently I don't have permission to reopen this issue.

Hi,

I am against writing long if-clauses to guess the OS and OS version.
That  
was the main reason for the dependency on the lsb package (as it gives
us a  
standard API-style way to know the OS and version). Besides that lsb  
requires a certain set of standard tools which we then don't need to  
require individually.

If you can suggest a replacement for discovering the OS (one that we
don't  
have to maintain for new OSes and versions), then please go ahead and  
submit a patch.

BTW, I would see one serious risk if one would set the OS version in a  
%post script: Imagine someone updates the OS without updating the ReaR  
package. Then ReaR would work with the old OS version and not know
about  
the update. Thus any special fix which ReaR has for either the old or
the  
new OS version would not work properly.

Regards,  
Schlomo

@jezzaaa You should be able to reopen. Not sure why you couldn't though
? So I reopened for you ;-)

@schlomo Your concern is correct, but applies only to certain
distributions and/or cases. My preferences is to depend on lsb in those
cases where requiring lsb is practically possible (e.g. not pulling
Xorg, cups and other non-sense dependencies by default). So maybe we
should reconsider our practice to also accommodate newer distributions
(e.g. RHEL6) where the lsb dependency chain is more practical. However
this requires a better understanding of each distribution/version...

I have seen funny behavior of rear with a wrong`os.conf` file (due to
installing wrong distro-rpm), so in MHO the lsb package is still the
safest to determine the current OS.  
BTW are there alternatives for lsb? If some has an idea please come
forward and tell us about it...

Hi,

originally I added the dependency to the lsb\_release tool to spare us
the  
hassle of OS detection. lsb\_release has a clear and stable interface
and is  
AFAIK supported on all Linux distros.

Unfortunately many Linux distros pull in a lot of extra packages to
install  
lsb\_release because they don't separate the different lsb features
into  
subpackages. Even those who do tend to do it wrong:

\[sschapiro@devgss02 ~\]$ lsb\_release -a  
LSB Version:  
:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-noarch:printing-4.0-amd64:printing-4.0-noarch  
Distributor ID: Scientific  
Description: Scientific Linux release 6.3 (Carbon)  
Release: 6.3  
Codename: Carbon  
\[sschapiro@devgss02 ~\]$ rpm -qf
/etc/lsb-release.d/printing-4.0-noarch  
redhat-lsb-printing-4.0-3.el6.x86\_64  
redhat-lsb-4.0-3.el6.x86\_64  
\[sschapiro@devgss02 ~\]$ rpm -q --whatrequires redhat-lsb-printing  
redhat-lsb-4.0-3.el6.x86\_64

So installing redhat-lsb (which provides lsb\_release) pulls in the
printing  
stuff which pulls in cups, ppds, gs and so on. Debian is a little
better  
because it spread the lsb functions over more packages:

sschapiro@isdeblnnl002:~$ apt-cache search lsb-  
lsb - Linux Standard Base 4.0 support package  
lsb-base - Linux Standard Base 4.0 init script functionality  
lsb-core - Linux Standard Base 4.0 core support package  
lsb-cxx - Linux Standard Base 4.0 C++ support package  
lsb-desktop - Linux Standard Base 4.0 Desktop support package  
lsb-graphics - Linux Standard Base 4.0 graphics support package  
lsb-printing - Linux Standard Base 4.0 Printing package  
lsb-release - Linux Standard Base version reporting utility  
liblinux-distribution-perl - detect on which Linux distribution we are  
running  
lsb-appchk3 - LSB v3.x Application checking tool  
lsb-build-base3 - LSB v3.x Development tools base package  
lsb-build-cc3 - LSB v3.x Development environment lsbcc package  
lsb-build-desktop3 - LSB v3.x Development tools desktop package  
lsb-invalid-mta - Linux Standard Base sendmail dummy  
lsb-languages - Linux Standard Base 4.0 Runtime Languages package  
lsb-multimedia - Linux Standard Base 4.0 Multimedia package  
lsb-pkgchk3 - LSB v3.x package checking tool  
lsb-qt4 - Linux Standard Base 4.0 Qt4 support package  
lsb-security - Linux Standard Base 4.0 Security package

Long way to go till we get the distros to get better, supporters are
most  
welcome.

Schlomo

PS: The above RHEL6 strangeness about 2 packages owning the same file is
a  
"feature" of RPM that allows that if-and-only-if the file is identical
in  
both packages. IMHO it is a RHEL6 bug that redhat-lsb-printing is
installed  
by default and that redhat-lsb requires it.

I'm not sure where that leaves me. Perhaps I just install the lsb
package with "--nodeps". :-(

You can sure do that, but the next yum upgrade will fix it for you :-)
Are  
you a paying RH customer? Then you should open that as a bug. I will do
the  
same at work.

From the RHEL 6.4 release notes:

> New redhat-lsb-core Package
>
> When installing the redhat-lsb package, a large number of dependencies
> is pulled into the system to meet the LSB standard. Red Hat Enterprise
> Linux 6.4 provides a new redhat-lsb-core subpackage which allows you
> to easily fetch only the minimal set of required packages by
> installing the redhat-lsb-core package.

I hope that will help.

@jezzaaa @jhoekx @schlomo @dagwieers May we close this issue? Nothing

well, as long as nobody adjusts the SPEC file to require only the  
redhat-lsb-core package if RHEL &gt;= 6.4 is found, then nothing will
change.

I'm not entirely happy. I can't see the lsb dependency being removed
from the SPEC, nor can I see a fall-back to a cascade of if/then/else
being accepted either. I don't know what else to suggest, and nobody
else has come forward in 10 months with any new ideas. So while I still
think this is a bug in ReAR, there's no point in keeping the ticket
open, only to get closed in 12 months. So if there's no more discussion
right now, you might as well close the ticket.

Sorry for your disappointment. ReaR unfortunately cannot fix all OS
vendor  
bugs...
