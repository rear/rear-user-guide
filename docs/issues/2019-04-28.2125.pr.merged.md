##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2120

-   How was this pull request tested? Ran `rear mkrescue` on Ubuntu
    18.04.2 LTS server before and after patching. Verifying log output
    changes as intended. Also tested a full restore successfully.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR intends to fix \#2120, avoiding unwanted "Welcome to" messages
in the log file from `rear mkrescue`.

These invocations of `bash --login` in
`usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh` were affected as
follows:

1.  Motd message does not appear in log file, as output is filtered by
    *grep*. But if someone would change the welcome message text to
    something containing the phrase "not found", the grep expression
    would always match and subsequent code would behave erroneously. The
    fix prevents this.
2.  Motd does appear in log file. Fix has been verified to suppress it.
3.  Motd does appear in log file. Fix has been verified to suppress it.

Other invocations of `bash --login` across rear scripts are not affected
in the same way: They do not chroot into the rescue system
(`chroot $ROOTFS_DIR`), but into the recovered target system instead
(`chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT`). The target system has its own set of bash
profile files, so it does not emit the ReaR welcome message. Examples
tested:

-   `usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh`
-   `usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh`
-   `usr/share/rear/restore/default/900_create_missing_directories.sh`

Good catch, redirecting STDIN makes sure that the shell is
non-interactive.

At least the redirection covers what
`usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/bash.bashrc` thinks about
interactivity. Bash seems to have its own notion of it and the presence
of the `-c` option already makes it consider itself non-interactive (`i`
missing from `$-`).

@jsmeix looks worth taking with the release 2.5, no?  
@OliverO2 thanks for the cleanup of the code

@OliverO2  
as always many thanks for your thorough analysis of the issue  
and for your fix!

Because you wrote (excerpts)

    Motd message does not appear in log file,
    as output is filtered by 'grep'
    ...
    (chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT). The target system
    has its own set of bash profile files

I got a bit scared because this means there could be also any kind  
of unexpected bash output in the target system chroot environment  
(e.g. because of any etc/motd in the target system environment)  
so that I checked right now our `chroot ... /bin/bash --login` calls as
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2120\#issuecomment-484159562](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2120#issuecomment-484159562)  
if there are some where stdout is used like

    chroot ... /bin/bash --login ... | ...

Fortunately it seems there are none (except the single one that is  
fixed by this pull request - the first one in the output below)

    # find usr/share/rear/ -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -h -o 'chroot .* /bin/bash --login .*' | sort -u

    chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "type $required_program" || missing_required_programs="$missing_required_programs $required_program"

    chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "echo -e '$root_password\n$root_password' | passwd root"

@schlomo @gdha  
what do you think about redirecting the input to /dev/null for chroot
calls  
(provided input is not needed in each particular case)  
to avoid such unwanted messages in any case for ReaR 2.6?  
Cf.

I know I haven't been asked but let me drop some points to consider:

-   `usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/bash.bashrc` checks via `tty -s`.
-   The 'canonical' way to check for an interactive shell is [something
    like `[[ $- == *i* ]]` (Bash Reference
    Manual)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Is-this-Shell-Interactive_003f.html).
-   `$-` contains an `i` whenever there are commands to execute (either
    via `-c` or via at least one non-option argument), or if a `-i`
    option is present. `-c` is present in all `bash --login` invocations
    within ReaR, `-i` is not.
-   There are no guarantees regarding the actions being performed by the
    target system's profile files in general.
-   There are no guarantees regarding the actions being performed by the
    target system's profile files in case of an incomplete setup (e.g
    `PATH` not set up as expected).
-   Unless you are in control of each and every profile file involved,
    there might be unwanted side effects when invoking `bash --login` in
    the (partially set up) target environment. Maybe it is worth to look
    for a safer way to achieve things.

@OliverO2  
of course you are always welcome to contribute your thoughts!

I asked @schlomo and @gdha because I hope they may better  
know about the history why certain things are as they are in ReaR  
like why there is in usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/bash.bashrc

    # print motd for interactive shells
    tty -s && test -s /etc/motd && cat /etc/motd

Regarding using `$-` to determine if we run interactively:  
This should work at least down to SLES10-SP4  
with GNU bash 3.1.17 where "man bash" reads

    An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments
    and without the -c option whose standard input and error are both
    connected to terminals (as determined by isatty(3)), or one started
    with the -i option. PS1 is set and $- includes i if bash is interactive,
    allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state.

In general regarding `chroot ... /bin/bash --login -c "command ..."`  
versus `chroot ... /path/to/command ...` see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862)  
and therein in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862\#issuecomment-274068914](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862#issuecomment-274068914)

I suppose you'd even find `$-` and the `i` option in the ancient bourne
shell. If I remember correctly it's been there ever since. The only
difference in detection is the pattern matching available in bash.
