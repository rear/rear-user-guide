@gdha  
feel free to move as many of the PROGS to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
up to any point that you think is reasonable.

In general I would prefer when our users get by default  
a rather big and full featured ReaR recovery system  
that works on most (possibly different replacement) hardware.

Those cases where the ReaR recovery system should be minimal  
must be explicitly specified by the user when he finds out that  
the default recovery system is too big in his case.

My reasoning behind is that a by default big recovery system  
that works on most hardware causes less severe issues  
compared to a by default minimal recovery system.  
A too big recovery system wastes some space but when  
something essential is missing in the recovery system  
it is basically a dead end for the user.
