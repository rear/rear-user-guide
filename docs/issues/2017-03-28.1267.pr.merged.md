This PR will add support for curl (HTTPS)  
brief description of changes:

Added required LIBS and files to **/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf**
and remove them from
**/usr/share/rear/init/default/010\_set\_drlm\_env.sh**

This code has been tested on RHEL/CentOS, SLES/OpenSUSE and
Debian/Ubuntu.

Hi @jsmeix,

Any suggestion will be appreciated, I just added the libs and files
because now curl is added by default and just in order to work over HTTP
and HTTPs without issues.

Regards,

I think it would be rather unexpected nowadays  
when curl works via HTTP but not via HTTPS  
so that I think this pull request should be merged "as is".

Later - preferably only when a user can show some evidence  
that nowadays the recovery system is too big - we could add  
support for things like LIBS\_EXCLUDE / PROGS\_EXCLUDE

FYI:  
Since I impemented FIRMWARE\_FILES support  
the user can make his recovery system really noticeable  
smaller compared to what it was before,  
cf.

Yes, I've seen that issue ;-)

Thx!

@didacog  
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1278\#issuecomment-291835588](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1278#issuecomment-291835588)  
I am thinking about whether or not the  
current default setting in conf/GNU/Linux.conf

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( ... /etc/ssl/certs/* /etc/pki/* )
</pre>

could lead to security issues.

Reason:  
As far as I understand it - in /etc/ssl/certs or /etc/pki  
also self-generated private stuff could be stored  
which would then by default get copied into the  
ReaR recovery system.

But by default the ReaR recovery system should not contain  
confidential or private stuff (as far as I remember what  
@schlomo wrote a longer time ago) unless the user  
had explicitly configured something.

@jsmeix

This is required by curl with https, there are stored de distribution
provided certificates installed from packages, nothing confidential.
Usually the public verified certs, and not private keys as far as I
know.  
For example the private keys are stored in **/etc/ssl/private** (not
copied)  
In /etc/pki maybe **/etc/pki/tls/private** should be excluded.

@didacog Good catch - try to **exclude** all private keys.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5380209?u=163f1571e6b9c9c7df94e2c6ca152b0a7406b52d&v=4" width="50">[didacog](https://github.com/didacog) commented at [2017-04-05 12:04](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267#issuecomment-291840492):

@gdha @jsmeix I will try to adjust it and send a new pull request
excluding private keys location from /etc/pki.

I guess this should work:  
In **usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf**:

`COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]:-} dev/shm/\* /etc/pki/private/* )`

Let me test and check if more stuff should be excluded before PR.

@didacog  
when you work on it could you add some explanatory  
comments directly in the code that tell about why  
stuff is included and other stuff is excluded so that  
others can even a longer time later still understand  
the reasons behind, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

To get comments at the right place inside longer bash arrays  
I would suggest to do it somehow like this:

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]:-} /dev /etc/inputr[c] /etc/protocols /etc/services /etc/rpc /etc/termcap /etc/terminfo /lib*/terminfo /usr/share/terminfo /etc/netconfig /etc/mke2
fs.conf /etc/*-release /etc/localtime /etc/magic /usr/share/misc/magic /etc/dracut.conf /etc/dracut.conf.d /usr/lib/dracut /sbin/modprobe.ksplice-orig /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sys
ctl.d /etc/e2fsck.conf )
# Required by curl with https:
# There are stored the distribution provided certificates
# installed from packages, nothing confidential.
# Usually the public verified certs, and not private keys.
# The private keys are stored in /etc/ssl/private (not copied)
# In /etc/pki maybe /etc/pki/tls/private is excluded (see below).
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" '/etc/ssl/certs/*' '/etc/pki/*' )
# exclude /dev/shm/*, due to the way we use tar the leading / should be omitted
COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]:-} dev/shm/\* )
# Exclude /etc/pki/tls/private (cf. above):
COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( "${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/etc/pki/private/*' )
</pre>

Note that using ${VAR\[@\]} without double-quotes is problematic  
so that one should use "${VAR\[@\]}" see 'Arrays' in "man bash"  
and see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068)

Furthermore I wonder if bash globbing must be  
avoided for values like /path/to/something/\*  
by using single quotes '/path/to/something/\*'  
or if bash globbing is intended by not using single quotes?

@jsmeix @gdha

I've sent a PR \#1279 with the changes tested.

Finally, to exclude all priivate keys:

    /etc/pki/tls/private 
    /etc/pki/CA/private
    /etc/pki/nssdb/key*.db

I "just merged"
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1279](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1279)  
to get that possible security issue solved as fast as possible.
