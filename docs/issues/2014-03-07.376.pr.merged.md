Hello

This was my configuration:

sample local configuration Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as
===================================================================

ISO image  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL="cifs://192.168.56.5/Backup"  
OUTPUT\_OPTIONS="username=kreitz,password=<DELETED>"

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental  
FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon"

BACKUP\_URL="cifs://192.168.56.5/Backup"  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS="username=kreitz,password=<DELETED>"

I was the Person, wor originally submitted the incremental patches.  
It is not a config related issue, there are some parts missing in the  
code.

Greetings

Christopher
