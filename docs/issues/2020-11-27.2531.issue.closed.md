-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Attempting to recover backup from HTTP location due to lack of access to
physical media in a remote VPS environment.

I want to be able to revert a machine to a backup image over the
network, right now I'm thinking over HTTP. I am stuck with a hosting
service that does not offer backups or any webconsole access (only SSH
after boot), so I cannot rely on interactive bootable media. This looked
like a tool that 'may' be able to do this, but I'm a little confused by
the HTTP, or any other network support.

Is this use case supported? I have a test environment I can play with.

When using BACKUP=NETFS we support those BACKUP\_URL schemes  
that are described in "man rear" cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

The basic idea behind BACKUP=NETFS is to use a mountable thingy  
(usually a NFS share on a remote NFS server)  
so that the remote storage location  
(whereto the backup gets written during "rear mkbackup"  
and wherefrom the backup is read druring "rear recover")  
appears as part of the locally accessible file system of the system  
where "rear mkbackup" is run (the original system) and in the exact same
way also  
where "rear recover" is run (in the ReaR recovery system on replacement
hardware).

The crucial point is that the ReaR recovery system runs inside a
ramdisk  
on the replacement hardware (so things work independent of local
disks).  
Therefore it is not (easily) possible during "rear recover" to download
the  
whole backup.tar.gz (several GiB - possibly even up to some TiB)
because  
the download target would be in the ramdisk.

Depending on what backup program is used (by default 'tar') it would be
possible  
to restore the backup during "rear recover" when a download from a HTTP
location  
could be streamed into the backup restore program like

    curl http://rear.backup.server/path/to/backup.tar.gz | tar xz ...

Currently this is not supported in ReaR.

You could play around with that manually inside the ReaR recovery
system  
(by default 'curl' is included in the ReaR recovery system)  
and if you get things working as you need it in your particular
environment  
we would appreciate a GitHub pull request from you  
at least as some proof of concept so we could have a look  
or ideally even as some basically working solution.

@sissieadmin Love to see a PR once you succeeded your recovery attempt
as I'm sure others will find this an interesting feature to have. Thanks
in advance.

@jsmeix and @gdha

Sorry for the dead air. I'm unlikely to be able to provide a PR for this
myself.

I'm still exploring options for this situation and have ruled over a
dozen other programs. In short, I do not specifically need to use HTTP
as the location, but need a way to restore a server that does not have
any extra partitioning or any opportunity for PXE.

Would restoring a local backup on the current single partition be
possible?

The documentation seems unclear about this, in that it says "restore
from local disk" which can imply rescue partitions. Would Rear support
having an edit made to Grub which boots and installs, hands-free, from
an image on the one partition/filesystem I have?

This is a use-case that seems very rare nowadays, and Rear seems like
the only option that 'may' support it.
