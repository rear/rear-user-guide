I think rear is lacking some option between `raw`, `rsync` and all those
advanced things. I loved to use `fsarchiver` which does something like a
filesystem backup (including parmission and such) and compresses that
full backup into a single file. That comes in quite handy when you want
a full backup but not raw since you have a lot of unused space. Due to
the compression and less lookup effort it is at least in some cases
better then using `rsync`. For example on a Raspberry PI thats in my
eyes the optimal method.

Issue \#413 would also integrate perfectly with it as with most other
methods. Its a good choice to get a in time consistent snapshot of the
stored files without stopping services. Please consider implementing
this as well.

@DEvil0000 Supposingly you are referring to
[https://www.fsarchiver.org/](https://www.fsarchiver.org/) - The pages
are mentioning SystemRescue is a perfect match, sure enough, ReaR is
also a valid candidate to add `fsarchiver` binary to copy with the
rescue image and you could use the BACKUP=EXTERNAL setting in the
`/etc/rear/local.conf` file.

Furthermore, I understand your reasoning behind the scenes, but it would
add an extra layer of complexity I think (my opninion may vary of course
with yours or others).  
The case you are refering to RaspberryPI - perhaps useful yes, but ReaR
has not yet be ported to aarch64 (in its full extends) and not sure ReaR
has a clear understanding how to handle the boot mechanism on aarch64. I
do know there was some effort in the past, but I don't think it was
completed.
