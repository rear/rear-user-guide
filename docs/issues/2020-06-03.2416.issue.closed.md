Currently stdout and stderr are redirected to the log file in any case.

The reason behind is that all what could be useful for later debugging  
in case of issues must appear in ReaR's log file, cf.  
"What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

But this means that also error messages from commands  
that fail when a possible failure is expected and handled in ReaR  
appear in the log file.

I.e. for code of the general form like

    TRY_COMMAND || FALLBACK_COMMAND || Error "..."

a failing TRY\_COMMAND error message appears in the log file  
which may confuse the user regardless that all works well  
because it is only a "false alarm" message.

On the other hand the TRY\_COMMAND error message must appear  
in the log file because for later debugging in case of issues it is
needed  
to see how TRY\_COMMAND had failed i.e. what its exact error message
was  
because it makes a difference to understand the root cause of an issue  
if the TRY\_COMMAND error message shows that its failure is OK  
(and FALLBACK\_COMMAND does "the right thing")  
or if the TRY\_COMMAND error message points to the root cause of an
issue  
(e.g. because TRY\_COMMAND should have worked in a particular case  
and FALLBACK\_COMMAND should not have been run in that case).

So there is a dilemma between suppressing error messages  
to not confuse the user with "false alarm" error messages  
versus having all what could be useful for later debugging in the log
file.

Perhaps a possible way out of that dilemma could be  
to only redirect stdout and stderr to the log file  
when `rear` is run in verbose mode (`-v`) or in debug modes (`-d`
`-D`)  
to avoid that such messages appear in the log and confuse the user  
when the user has called `rear` in a "normal operation" mode and  
in "normal operation" mode stdout and stderr are redirected to
/dev/null.

Perhaps the best way might be:

In "normal operation" mode stdout and stderr are redirected to
/dev/null.  
In verbose mode stderr is still /dev/null but stdout is redirected to
the log.  
In debug modes stdout and stderr are redirected to the log.

It seems this would be in compliance with our `$v` `$verbose` usage

    # touch foo

    # cp -v foo foo.cp 2>/dev/null
    'foo' -> 'foo.cp'

    # mv -v foo.cp foo.mv 2>/dev/null
    renamed 'foo.cp' -> 'foo.mv'

because it seems command verbose output happens usually on stdout.

I do no longer think that my above described "best way" works OK in
practice, see

With the current changes in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498)  
i.e. with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498/commits/0f63d43236a0b28e020f5cb6cd2ff933438a481b](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2498/commits/0f63d43236a0b28e020f5cb6cd2ff933438a481b)  
I do no longer think that our our `$v` `$verbose` usage is helpful for
the user.

I think we should set the `$v` and `$verbose` variables in debug modes  
but not in verbose mode.

Perhaps we may even set the `$v` and `$verbose` variables only in
debugscript `-D` mode  
because additional command verbose messages are mostly useless without
context  
in particular without the info what exact command was called  
and that info is only provided in debugscript mode.

Reasoning:

Calling ReaR in verbose mode should make only ReaR itself verbose  
in particular to show ReaR messages on the user's termial  
but it should not also transitively make things that are called by ReaR
verbose  
because I think when the user likes to get such internal details of
information  
then the user is more in debugging state (i.e. looking for the cause of
an issue).

Explanation:

Currently we do in usr/sbin/rear

    # Set the variables v and verbose to be used in called programs
    # that support the '-v' or '--verbose' options like
    # "cp $v ..." or "rm $verbose ..." and so on:
    v=""
    verbose=""
    if test "$VERBOSE" ; then
        v="-v"
        verbose="--verbose"
    fi

so that in verbose mode many commands are run with verbose output  
as described in "man rear"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

    -v
        verbose mode (show more output and run many commands in verbose mode)

But from my point of view the commands verbose output in the log  
is mainly confusing and does not actually help the user at all.

For example what additional commands verbose output I get in my log  
during "rear -v recover" compared to "rear recover"  
(excerpts from a `diff` output with long lines cut after 150
characters):

All those `+` lines are completely useless from my point of view.  
At least I do not understand anything what those additional command
verbose messages mean  
without context (in particular without the info what exact command was
called).

All the time since I had written in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416\#issue-629800799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416#issue-629800799)

    In verbose mode stderr is still /dev/null but stdout is redirected to the log.

I had some bad feeling to handle stderr and stdout differently.

Now I know it is a bad idea to handle stderr and stdout differently.

Most of the useless `+` lines in the log file excerpts in the above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416\#issuecomment-702142588](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416#issuecomment-702142588)  
are not because of additionally requested command verbose messages  
but just normal command stdout messages that appear in the log  
when in verbose mode stdout is redirected to the log.

E.g. the above

and for debugging purposes the `service docker status` message

not  
there have been issues with the `service docker status` command  
at the time when ReaR was running (e.g. late at night), cf.

merged this issue should be done.

As described in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2538\#issuecomment-743365322](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2538#issuecomment-743365322),
I had an issue with `dd` failing due to a missing input file.

Before considering the effects of \#2498, my code would look like this:

    dd if="$boot_partition" bs=1024 of="$install_partition" || Error "Could not copy the EFI rescue system to partition '$install_partition'"

producing output like this:

    ERROR: Could not copy the EFI rescue system to partition '/dev/sda2'
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 280_create_bootable_disk_image.sh:
      [...]
      2020-12-11 18:37:31.509370807 Installing the EFI rescue system to partition '/dev/sda2'

There is no detailed information about the cause of the problem.

Now I have changed it to:

    dd if="$boot_partition" bs=1024 of="$install_partition" 2>>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" || Error "Could not copy the EFI rescue system to partition '$install_partition'"

which produces this output:

    ERROR: Could not copy the EFI rescue system to partition '/dev/sda2'
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 280_create_bootable_disk_image.sh:
      [...]
      2020-12-11 18:37:31.509370807 Installing the EFI rescue system to partition '/dev/sda2'
      dd: failed to open '/dev/loop6p1': No such file or directory

Now there is detailed information about the cause of the problem without
requiring the user to enable debugscript mode.

So what is the better solution?

1.  Leave everything as is, suppressing `stderr` messages giving details
    about the cause of an underlying error, requiring another invocation
    with `-D` (if the problem reproduces).
2.  Change code like above to use `2>>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE"` redirections
    before error checks (`|| Error "..."`).
3.  Redirect `stderr` to the log file again at all times and use
    `2>>/dev/$DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV` in places expected to produce
    (lots of) stderr output under normal circumstances (false
    positives).

My considerations:

-   I appreciate the effort to reduce unnecessary messages in the ReaR
    log, in particular lots of 'false positives'.
-   In case of real errors, I would like to have as much detail as
    possible instantly (not in a second invocation).
-   I am always a bit wary of posting large logs like those produced in
    debugscript mode, as I find it hard to screen them for sensitive
    information, which I would not like to leak.

@OliverO2  
Wow!  
What a great analysis - as usual from you - much appreciated!

I prefer very much using

    COMMAND ... 2>>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" || Error "..."

at specific places where we (i.e. the ReaR developers) know  
(to some extent as far as possible with reasonable effort for us)  
that this particular COMMAND call only outputs on stderr  
when there is a real error so that ReaR exits with `Error`.

@OliverO2  
I think `-D` debugscript mode can easily leak sensitive information into
the log file  
in this or that special circumstaces so I would not use `-D` in
environments  
where ReaR's log file is not sufficiently safe.  
But I think normal debug mode `-d` should be very much safer  
against leaking sensitive information into the log file  
but normal debug mode cannot be 100% safe because  
we cannot know what arbitrary programs may output  
on stdout or stderr under this or that special circumstances cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416\#issuecomment-702159687](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416#issuecomment-702159687)  
in particular when programs are called in verbose mode, cf.

Hmmm - after reading again my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416\#issuecomment-855956701](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416#issuecomment-855956701)  
I even think now that  
"Redirect stdout and stderr to the log only in debug modes - normally
discard them to /dev/null"  
(in particular with calling programs in verbose mode also only in debug
modes)  
is also a security feature because it avoids that whatever unexpected
program output  
may leak sensitive information into the log file - probably no secrets
like passwords  
but "internal" information that could be misused by someone who should
not know that.

Is the log file world-readable? Apparently it is, but probably it should
not be. (Files under `/etc/rear` are not.)
