In packaging/rpm/rear.spec replaced "BuildArch: noarch"  
with "ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86\_64 ppc ppc64" that should  
tell the user that rear is known to work only  
on %ix86 x86\_64 ppc ppc64  
and removed "Requires: yaboot" for ppc ppc64 because  
that is the default installed bootloader on ppc ppc64  
see the GitHub issue

Additionally replaced the incomplete and outdated  
changelog entries with one generic entry that is always valid.
