@fadamo  
I know nothing about Veritas and I guess most others also don't  
so we need some explanatory background information  
what errors happen when "Veritas sw" is installed and  
why they are avoided by excluding `dev/vx` and `dev/dmpconfig`  
(I have no idea what dev/vx and dev/dmpconfig do).

See the comments in default.conf at COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
that at least briefly tell why something is excluded  
by default so other users can see and understand  
what each of the exclusions is about and why it is there,  
cf. "Code must be easy to understand (answer the WHY)" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I searched the ReaR code and documentation for Veritas  
and found only

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:
    # BACKUP=NBU (Symantec/Veritas NetBackup)

    doc/user-guide/10-integrating-external-backup.adoc:
        default.conf:# BACKUP=NBU stuff (Symantec/Veritas NetBackup)

Is the "Veritas sw" you mention in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2878\#issue-1399331342](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2878#issue-1399331342)  
that "Symantec/Veritas NetBackup"  
or is "Veritas sw" some different software?

When "Veritas sw" is "Symantec/Veritas NetBackup"  
then I think those exclusions should be better implemented  
not as general exclusion but as specific exclusion  
only when BACKUP=NBU is used - i.e. in COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_NBU  
which gets added to the generic COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE in  
usr/share/rear/prep/NBU/default/400\_prep\_nbu.sh via

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( "${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NBU[@]}" )

so the end result is the same but this way it is more clear  
that those exclusions are not generic but belong to BACKUP=NBU.

Ah!  
As it seems RHEL specific software is involved,

@fadamo  
thank you even more for also posting the Red Hat solution!

I had assumed those RPMs are from Veritas and not from Red Hat  
which is why I *also* assigned it to @pcahyna (in addition to me).

On first glance the Red Hat solution looks unexpected

    /dev/vx/* /dev/dmpconfig/* /dev/dmpconfig /dev/vx/dmpconfig

because it seems it does not match your exclusion list

    dev/vx dev/dmpconfig

The problem is that the entries in COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE  
are written into a `copy_as_is_exclude_file` that is used by

    ... tar ... -X $copy_as_is_exclude_file ...

in usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
so the patterns in COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE are 'tar' patterns  
which could behave a bit special (at least sometimes).

Perhaps `dev/vx` might accidentally exclude more than intended,  
e.g. also things like `home/lebedev/vxyz` or similar  
(I cannot keep 'tar' pattern matching behaviour in my mind)  
cf.

yes, my exclusions are a bit different from RH ones because I found the
RH solution only today.  
Actually I'm using

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=(
    "${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]}"
    /dev/vx
    /dev/dmpconfig
    )

In my 1st comment I omitted the initial / because I have seen all the
others exlcusions without it:

    # grep COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE= /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( dev/shm dev/shm/\* dev/oracleasm dev/mapper dev/.udev $VAR_DIR/output/\* )

but now I think we could and should keep it.  
IMO you can use the exclusions suggested by RH, they should work
properly.

@jsmeix about your concern of the pattern matching too much, I was also
wondering why the exclude patterns don't start with `/` to be rooted at
`/`. Especially relevant as stuff like `$VAR_DIR` is of course
`/var/...` and starts from `/`.

If nobody has an idea why we should omit the leading `/` on those
patterns I'd strongly suggest to require all default patterns to start
from `/`

Otherwise of course we are happy to add useful defaults that won't harm
anybody
