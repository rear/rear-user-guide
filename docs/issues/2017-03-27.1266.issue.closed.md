This is not caused by my latest changes in 500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
because on an older ReaR GitHub checkout I can reproduce it  
when I remove the ReaR stuff in the var/ directory.

The reason is that the savelayout workflow  
only runs 450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh  
which fails without a var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader file.

I will do GitHub pull request to fix the savelayout workflow.

@gdha  
your symbolic link workaround is not a proper solution because  
it results that during "rear mkrescue" guess\_bootloader is run twice:

<pre>
# ls -l usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 45 Mar 28 10:46 usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh -> ../../../prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh

# usr/sbin/rear -s savelayout | grep bootloader
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh

# usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue | grep bootloader
Source prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
</pre>

Meanwhile I think that bootloader stuff may not belong  
to the disk layout.  
Currently I wonder whether the check\_bootloader\_files script  
is at the right place in a 'layout' directory.

Or perhaps the BugError "Unknown bootloader..." in the  
check\_bootloader\_files script does not actually belong there  
because the meaning of a check\_bootloader\_files script  
is only to do CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES for supported  
bootloaders but not to check if an unsupported  
bootloader is used.

Perhaps it is better to further enhace 500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
to also error out if an unsupported BOOTLOADER was  
specified and remove that BugError "Unknown bootloader..."  
from the check\_bootloader\_files script.

@jsmeix I tend to agree with you üëç the error is not on its place here.
OTOH - we have to make sure we catch it somewhere else.

I think the root cause of the current mess is that  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES  
is used in ambiguous ways:

In default.conf CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES is described  
to be generally used to check for anything that  
needs the ReaR recovery system to be recreated  
but it is implemented in the checklayout-workflow which  
means according to checklayout-workflow.sh only to  
"check if the disk layout has changed"  
which does not match the description in default.conf.

From my current point of view it seems the  
whole savelayout and checklayout workflows  
need to be revised.

Ok - that makes sense, but we better tackle this piece first and make a
separate issue for the latter, no?

I think as a first step I will move the "Unknown bootloader..." error  
out of 450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh  
and into 500\_guess\_bootloader.sh.  
This would not fix this issue here.  
It is only meant as a first step to get things sorted out.

Yes, first things first and separated issues for the rest.

I think when we move the guess\_bootloader script  
from prep/default/500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
to layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
everything could be o.k.

Reason:

Currently the 500\_guess\_bootloader script  
is run in those workflows:  
mkbackuponly mkbackup mkrescue udev

<pre>
# for w in $( ls usr/share/rear/lib/*-workflow.sh | cut -d '/' -f 5 | cut -d '-' -f 1 ) ; do usr/sbin/rear -s $w | grep 500_guess_bootloader && echo $w ; done
Source prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh
mkbackuponly
Source prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh
mkbackup
Source prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh
mkrescue
Source prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh
udev
</pre>

When there is layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
it is run in those workflows:  
checklayout mkbackuponly mkbackup mkrescue savelayout udev

<pre>
# for w in $( ls usr/share/rear/lib/*-workflow.sh | cut -d '/' -f 5 | cut -d '-' -f 1 ) ; do usr/sbin/rear -s $w | grep 445_guess_bootloader && echo $w ; done
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
checklayout
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
mkbackuponly
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
mkbackup
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
mkrescue
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
savelayout
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
udev
</pre>

I.e. when we move the guess\_bootloader script  
from prep/default/500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
to layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
the guess\_bootloader script is still run in all workflows  
where it was run before (i.e. that move is backward compatible)  
plus it is run in checklayout and savelayout  
where the latter should fix this issue here  
and the former should fix the bootloader behaviour  
also for checklayout.

What bootloader scripts are run after the move:

<pre>
# for w in $( ls usr/share/rear/lib/*-workflow.sh | cut -d '/' -f 5 | cut -d '-' -f 1 ) ; do usr/sbin/rear -s $w | grep bootloader && echo $w ; done
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
checklayout
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
mkbackuponly
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
mkbackup
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
mkrescue
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
savelayout
Source layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh
Source layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh
udev
</pre>

Looks correct.

I will do a GitHub pull request.

By the way only FYI:

I was wondering about the reason why the layout/save stage  
is run for the mkbackuponly workflow.  
The layout/save stage is explicitly called in
lib/mkbackuponly-workflow.sh  
but (as usual) without any comment therein that tells *why*  
so that I needed (as usual) the big 'git log -p --follow' hammer  
and fortunately (as unusual ;-) it even tells about the reason:

<pre>
# git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/lib/mkbackuponly-workflow.sh
...
commit c3685bc5ff0d3ee6c595521a43b0b4f2542151a0
Author: Jeroen Hoekx <jeroen.hoekx@hamok.be>
Date:   Wed Oct 26 12:43:30 2011 +0000

    Fix mkbackuponly to use the same excludes as the layout code.
...
+       DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf
+       SourceStage "layout/save"
</pre>

@gdha  
could you have a look if

looks o.k. for you.
