Hi All,  
I tried to recover a system to a new hardware. While booting the ISO, in
the Section 55-migrate-network-device.sh I had the following problem:

My network-device mapping should be (see also screenshots):  
OLD eth0 -&gt; NEW eth3 (selection 1)  
OLD eth1 -&gt; NEW eth5 (selection 3)  
OLD eth2 -&gt; NEW eth4 (selection 2)

After the selection of the interface eth5, the last selection of the
interface eth4 failed. As long as I could use the selection 1 -&gt; 2
-&gt; 3 it works.

In the script 55-migrate-network-device.sh I found the following bug in
the loop over all the original macs:

On line 94:  
unset "NEW\_DEVICES\[$n\]"  
there goes something wrong with the assignment of the array element and
the selection numbers from the select command.

I replaced line 94 with this command:  
NEW\_DEVICES=( "${NEW\_DEVICES\[@\]/$choice/}" )

An other possible solution:  
NEW\_DEVICES\[$n\]="used"

After this change it works for me.

System info:  
REAR Version rear-1.16.1-1  
SLES 11.3  
local.conf:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NBU

I never did something like this before, but I'll try to do.

@gsbit rear-1.16.1-git201408201003 contains your pull request - If you
find some time could you test it out?

Sorry for the late response. I made some tests with the build
