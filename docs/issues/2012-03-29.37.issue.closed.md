Original report
---------------

Duplicate ISO-Transfer happens when using rsync. Because this script
*./output/ISO/Linux-i386/90\_transfer\_image.sh* doesnt support all the
nice rsync options it lists the rsync modules on my rsyncd instead of
copying something.

the script that really copy the iso is:
*./output/RSYNC/default/90\_copy\_result\_files.sh*

I deactivated rsync in that script as it was done before for all NETFS
workflows. Heres the output of diff -p against your git repository:

I believe when BACKUP\_URL = OUTPUT\_URL then you have a point.  
Therefore, we may not blindly remove it, but do the above check first.

@gdha @kpieth What needs to be done for this issue ?

i think you can disable rsync transfer in  
./output/ISO/Linux-i386/90\_transfer\_image.sh  
because this script does the work better:  
./output/RSYNC/default/90\_copy\_result\_files.sh

Aha, now I see. You seem to have hit a similar problem as I have
(\#108). Because if you rely on output/RSYNC for the transfer of the ISO
image, you are actually expecting BACKUP= to be defined, which should
not be mandatory (if you do not expect Rear to take care of backups).

So we definitely need to rethink how this is supposed to work. In my
opinion the OUTPUT and BACKUP configuration are complete separate things
and if OUTPUT\_URL=rsync:// it should transfer the output files and
BACKUP\_URL=rsync:// should take care of the backup.

For example, you should be able to transfer your ISO image using rsync,
nfs or cifs (e.g. **OUTPUT\_URL=(rsync://|nfs://|cifs://)**) and use TSM
for backup (**BACKUP=TSM**). Which is currently not possible...

Also see \#108.

What do you think of:  
If OUTPUT\_URL is set, then
"./output/ISO/Linux-i386/90\_transfer\_image.sh" should do the work. If
not, then the chosen BACKUP workflow cares about transferring the image.

Personally, I think OUTPUT\_URL should take care of the output-related
stuff, and BACKUP\_URL should take care of the backup-related stuff. But
the meat of this matter is that what you are doing is strictly speaking
not allowed. OUTPUT\_URL was never supposed to have an rsync:// URL. The
reason it works (twice) is mostly by accident and carelessness.

Which doesn't mean that we do not want the functionality ! We should
have this properly defined and properly designed.
