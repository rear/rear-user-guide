Hi, thanks for the change, I believe it would be better to do this after
PR \#2735 is merged, otherwise the changes would conflict. Also, is it
intentional that it is done only for PRE/POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and not
for PRE/POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT ?  
I suppose you are using the scripts yourself, could you please have a
look at PR \#2735 and check if it is useful for you, including the
suggestion I made at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735\#issuecomment-1090422991](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issuecomment-1090422991)
? If you don't find any issue with that PR, I would like to merge it
soon and then update and merge this one.

I'm ok with merging that PR after \#2735. The mine one is introducing
only information to the output in run time... so it's OK. What I can do
is to add the same Information for PRE/POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.

What do you think?

Yes, I would do the same change for PRE/POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.

What do you think about the changes in PR \#2735 and the suggestion in
the last comment there? (I think we should gradually deprecate
`PRE/POST_*_SCRIPT` and replace by the proposed `PRE/POST_*_COMMANDS`.)

I don't agree to add that new variables, but may maintain the original
ones:

-   PRE/POST\_\*\_SCRIPT: I understand it to a unique (and external to
    ReaR) script to be executed as is (the original intention I think)
-   PRE/POST\_\*\_COMMANDS: It is supposed to be able to run one or more
    commands, not necessarily a script. These commands are external to
    ReaR, too, but adds more complexity to ReaR when is not needed, as a
    single script can contain all the commands to be executed.

So, in my honest opinion, ReaR is not intended to re-implement a shell
to parse all the shell grammar, letting to run an external script should
be enough.

@ivarmu  
thank you for your enhancement pull request!

PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
are still there and did not change how they work  
so you could use any combination of  
PRE\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS and POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
and PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
according to what works best for your needs.

I think in particular for longer complicated things  
it is better to have them all in separated scripts  
and call them via PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and  
POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT.

But to "just run a few simple commands"  
PRE\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS and POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
are likely easier to use for the user because  
he can specify all in his etc/rear/local.conf  
and does not need to care about external scripts.
