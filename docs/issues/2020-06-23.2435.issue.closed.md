Current packaging/rpm/rear.spec contains  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec\#L33](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec#L33)

    ExclusiveArch: %ix86 x86_64 ppc ppc64 ppc64le ia64

which does not match well what  
current doc/rear-release-notes.txt describes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L2578](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L2578)

    ReaR-2.6 is supported on:

      o Intel x86 type of processors
      o AMD x86 type of processors
      o PPC64 processors
      o PPC64LE processors

    ReaR-2.6 may or may not work on:

      o Intel Itanium processors
      o ARM type of processors
      o IBM Z "s390x" type of processors

I think when we build ReaR packages for Intel Itanium "ix64"  
then we should also build ReaR &gt;= 2.4 packages for ARM  
and additionally ReaR &gt;= 2.6 packages also for IBM Z.
