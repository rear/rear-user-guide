-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    1.18
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL 6.5
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    ISO/NFS
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Will hang after "creating root fs layout" if openssh-server is not
    installed. Only openssh-clients is listed as mandatory. Hanging
    process: "grep sftp".

Problem:  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/50\_ssh.sh: read subsys sftp file junk
&lt; &lt;( grep sftp /etc/sshd\_co\[n\]fig /etc/ssh/sshd\_co\[n\]fig
/etc/openssh/sshd\_co\[n\]fig 2&gt;&8 )

Those files may not exist, in case a different SSH solution is used
(e.g. CentrifySSH). You might want to add a check or make openssh-server
the only supported SSH solution.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Install openssh-server

@EQXTFL Seems weird you should see some messages like:

    grep: /etc/sshd_co[n]fig: No such file or directory
    grep: /etc/openssh/sshd_co[n]fig: No such file or directory

but it shouldn't hang. In case of Centrify - what are the file names?

Confirmed again - it just hangs. The file is here:
/etc/centrifydc/ssh/sshd\_config  
Adding this to the related line in 50\_ssh.sh fixes it.

@EQXTFL FYI, we are currently working on SSH (see \#1500 and \#1513 and
the current master). Please kindly have a look if all those changes
still work with your centrify setup.

Confirmed working, backup and restore. Thanks!

@EQXTFL  
I would expect that with current ReaR master code  
CentrifySSH still works "out of the box" because in  
current ReaR master code there is in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh

<pre>
copy_as_is_ssh_files=( /etc/ssh* /etc/openssh* /etc/centrifydc/ssh* /root/.s[s]h /root/.shos[t]s )
</pre>

but see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530\#issuecomment-337609631](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530#issuecomment-337609631)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538)  
where the latter changes that to

<pre>
copy_as_is_ssh_files=( /etc/s[s]h /root/.s[s]h /root/.shos[t]s )
</pre>

The funny \[\] around a letter makes 'shopt -s nullglob' (which is  
set in usr/sbin/rear) remove this file from the list if it does not
exist.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538)
merged there is now  
only support for OpenSSH 3.1 and later with its default directory  
/etc/ssh/ for keys and config files and its default sshd config file  
/etc/ssh/sshd\_config for the SSH setup of the recovery system.  
I removed support for non-standard directories  
like /etc/openssh or non-standard sshd config files  
like /etc/sshd\_config or /etc/openssh/sshd\_config.  
I documented in the SSH\_\* section in default.conf  
how to manually set up ReaR with a secure shell  
software other than OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1.  
I removed the incomplete support for CentrifySSH  
but did not make OpenSSH mandatory for ReaR  
so that the initial problem in this issue here  
does not re-appear (in particular not with SSH\_FILES='no').

@EQXTFL  
I would very much appreciate it if you could re-test  
whether or not the newest GitHub master code  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1538)
merged  
still works for your use case.  
Many thanks in advance for your testing!

@jsmeix  
Confirmed working - thanks!

@EQXTFL  
many thanks for your confirmation!  
It helps (at least me) a lot to have an explicit feedback  
when there is no (possibly obscure) regression in ReaR.
