-   Description of the issue:

Create full backup with `rear -v mkbackup`.  
Provision identical VM and boot from newly-created ReaR ISO.

ReaR says

    Ambiguous disk layout needs manual configuration (more than one disk with the same size...)
    Select "2" - Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration

Restoration dies with

    ERROR: No filesystem mounted on 'mnt/local'. Stopping.

Excerpt from log says

    Cannot change working directory to DFFILES: No such file or directory

Presumably ReaR is struggling with the combination of MD RAID and LVM?

-   Workaround, if any:

None.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

N/A

-   Comments:

I'm more than willing to try dev branches, and provide further, detailed
feedback if that helps.

@robpomeroy  
MD RAID1 with LVM has worked for me during several tests  
in the past so MD RAID1 with LVM should work in ReaR.

But I test on QEMU/KVM virtual machines.  
I do not have VMware.

To find out why it does not work in your particular case  
we need "rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files.

See the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular its sub-section  
"To analyze and debug a 'rear recover' failure ..."

You provided most info in your initial comment.

What is missing is:

-   Debug log file of "rear -d -D mkbackup" or "rear -d -D mkrescue" (in
    /var/log/rear/) that matches the "rear recover" failure (i.e. debug
    log from the original system of the "rear -d -D mkbackup" or "rear
    -d -D mkrescue" command that created the ReaR recovery system where
    "rear recover" failed)
-   Debug log file of "rear -d -D recover" (in /var/log/rear/) from the
    ReaR recovery system where "rear recover" failed
-   Contents of the /var/lib/rear/ directory and in its sub-directories
    from the ReaR recovery system where "rear recover" failed

When "rear -d -D recover" fails, you need to  
save the log file out of the ReaR recovery system  
(where "rear -d -D recover" was run and where it had failed)  
before you shut down the ReaR recovery system - otherwise  
the log file would be lost (because the ReaR recovery system  
runs in a ramdisk).

Additionally the files in the /var/lib/rear/ directory  
and in its sub-directories in the ReaR recovery system  
(in particular /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
and /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh) are needed  
to analyze a "rear -d -D recover" failure.

See the "First steps with Relax-and-Recover" section in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how to access the ReaR recovery system  
from remote via ssh so that you can use 'scp'  
to get files out of the ReaR recovery system.

Hallo @jsmeix.

The various files are
[here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgaNtzEbEvR9nmdaVA9co9XpN4Ol?e=3rtLcm) (link
expires in 7 days).

I can see one problem immediately - I don't know if it's fatal. In
`/var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt` you'll see an error message:
"Dialafile has been scheduled with an illegal command -PL ". This is
because unfortunately for historical reasons, these systems have a
binary file "df" in the search path, which is *not* the "disk free
space" command - it's a proprietary program called Dialafile. I wasn't
around when that decision was made! ðŸ˜‚

Other than that, I can't see any obvious issues. But I don't know ReaR
well enough, so my eyes are uneducated!

I am afraid this will be very likely fatal. ReaR uses the `df` command
in many places and if your `df` program deviates in its behavior from
the usual `df` program, strange errors may happen.

Thanks @pcahyna. I will see if I can remove it from the path for the
duration of backup & restoration.

@jsmeix & @pcahyna - thanks so much for your guidance. Setting `$PATH`
correctly before running `rear mkbackup` fixes this.

I have the wrong default option in the grub boot menu on my restored
system, but for that I shall consult the documentation.

Again, thank you!

@robpomeroy  
thank you for your clear description in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2807\#issuecomment-1126177354](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2807#issuecomment-1126177354)  
what the root cause was why ReaR (and all what uses 'df') failed.

FYI:  
This was not the first case we had here at ReaR  
where a disaster recovery test with ReaR reveals  
a broken setup of the original system.  
In particular we already had various "fun" with  
various different kind of third-party software  
that had messed up things in the original system.  
So disaster recovery setup plus recovery test with ReaR  
help to check if the basic setup of the original system  
seems to be reasonably "normal".

@jsmeix - I probably should have realised anyway. I have to use absolute
paths so often, for exactly this reason. I've had a few scripts fail
because `$PATH` isn't as expected.

I suppose because ReaR runs on so many systems, you can't really plan
for every possible scenario. ðŸ™‚ Thanks!

I think ReaR should not call basic programs by full path  
because ReaR should work generically on all systems  
so ReaR should respect a system admin's configuration.

For example when an admin has modified '$PATH'  
then all programs should respect his will  
and behave as the admin specified.

I think via hardcoded full paths the programmer  
who hardcoded them imposes his will on the user  
who may have specified things differently.

Of course when the user specifies "wrong" things  
his system behaves "wrong" (from other's point of view)  
but in general I regard the user's will as sacrosanct.  
Accordingly my general principle is:

    Final power to the user!

Only kids are sometimes an exception where  
"parental overwrite" is good - e.g. when a kid  
is up to cross the main street all of a sudden.

@jsmeix - I completely agree Johannes!
