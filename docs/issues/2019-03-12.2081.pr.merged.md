-   How was this pull request tested?

Tested with 4 disks:

-   Disk 1: GPT with consecutive partitions
-   Disk 2: MSDOS with consecutive partitions
-   Disk 3: GPT with non-consecutive partitions (1, 3, 4, 6)
-   Disk 4: MSDOS with non-consecutive partitions (1, 3 (extended), 5
    (logical), 6 (logical))

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

`parted` is not capable of creating non-consecutive partitions. To still
be able to do so, the trick consists in creating dummy partitions to
fill the gaps between partition numbers.  
Allocation of these dummy partitions is done from the end of the target
partition, because `parted` is not capable of resizing a partition from
the beginning.

Example (see also in `/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh`,
`create_disk_partition()` function):

    The GPT disk contains only 1 partition numbered 3 named PART

    # parted -m -s /dev/sda unit B print
    /dev/sda:21474836480B:scsi:512:512:gpt:QEMU QEMU HARDDISK:;
    3:1048576B:2097151B:1048576B::PART:;

    We need to create these partitions to recreate the exact same partitions:

    # parted -m -s /dev/sda unit B print
    /dev/sda:21474836480B:scsi:512:512:gpt:QEMU QEMU HARDDISK:;
    3:1048576B:2096127B:1047552B::PART:;
    2:2096128B:2096639B:512B::dummy2:;
    1:2096640B:2097151B:512B::dummy1:;

    Then delete dummy partition 1 and 2 and resize 3 to its original end.

@rmetrich  
Wow!  
I will have a look tomorrow...

@rmetrich  
when I was thinking about how to implement that in the past  
because of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1681)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1771](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1771)  
I had the idea to create all dummy partitions all at the end of the
disk.

I assume the mimimum size of a partition is 4096 bytes = 4 \* 512
bytes  
(I hope this is safe for
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced\_Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format)
)  
then if we use 1 MiB at the end of the disk for dummy partitions  
we should be able to create up to 256 = 1024 \* 1024 / 4096  
dummy partitions in that last 1 MiB at the end of the disk.

This way we could create all "real" partitions normally  
without the need to resize them - except the last "real" partition  
that must be created at most up to the end of the disk minus 1 MiB.

After all "real" partitions were created normally we can remove  
the dummy partitions at the end of the disk.

I think we could even leave the last "real" partition as is  
which would make it at most 1 MiB smaller than it was before.  
I think that 1 MiB less cannot be of real importance.

Or could that somehow mess up things when LVM or things like that  
is used on the last "real" partition that got recreated 1 MiB smaller?

I think things will mess up when the last "real" partition  
is recreated 1 MiB smaller and that partition is an extended partition  
and the last logical partition goes up to the end of the extended
partition  
which means if the extended partition is recreated 1 MiB smaller then  
the last logical partition must be also recreated 1 MiB smaller.

@jsmeix I did some testing and it messed up LVM indeed. I believe
resizing the partition is safer. Also it's hard to tell which is the
last partition to resize because partitions must be in right order but
allocated blocks are not (partition 1 can point to end of disk for
example).

@rmetrich  
thank you for your testing - that makes things clear.

FYI:  
With "last partition" I meant what is located "last" on the disk  
(not what has the highest partition number), i.e. same as in  
layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh\#L161](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh#L161)

    # The last partition is the /dev/<partition> with biggest <partition start(bytes)> value.

@rmetrich  
do you think you can make this working for ReaR 2.5  
or should it better be postponed?

I think changes in the layout code that recreates partitions  
are now somewhat late for ReaR 2.5 and because currently  
we do not have real user issues with sparse partition schemes  
I think it should be postponed after ReaR 2.5 to avoid regressions.

Better postpone it to later ... even if it seems to work.

A side note FYI:

When you need "associative" arrays that are indexed by a number  
(in your case the partition number for `partitions_to_resize()`)  
you can use the normal bash 3.x non-associative arrays  
because one can set arbirary index numbers like:

    # arr[2]="two"
    # arr[4]="four"
    # arr[7]="seven"

    # declare -p arr
    declare -a arr='([2]="two" [4]="four" [7]="seven")'

    # for index in $( seq 256 ) ; do test "${arr[$index]}" && echo "element with index $index is '${arr[$index]}'"  ; done
    element with index 2 is 'two'
    element with index 4 is 'four'
    element with index 7 is 'seven'

Alternatively when you need pairs of numbers in an array  
you may concatenate the numbers of one pair  
with a non-digit separator character like  
`partition_number:end_btye`  
as in

    arr=( 2:12345 7:23456 123:3456789 )

and split them later with something like

    for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do
        partition_number=${e%%:*}
        end_btye=${e##*:}
        echo partition_number $partition_number end_btye $end_btye
    done

which results this output

    partition_number 2 end_btye 12345
    partition_number 7 end_btye 23456
    partition_number 123 end_btye 3456789

Alternatively when you need tuples of words in an array  
you can store them as strings with usual $IFS separators  
like in this code example

    # Array elemets are "partition_number start_byte end_btye"
    arr=( "2 1234 2345" "7 3456 4567" "123 5678 6789" )

    declare -p arr

    for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do
        read partition_number start_byte end_btye junk <<<"$e"
        echo partition_number:$partition_number start_byte:$start_byte end_btye:$end_btye
    done

which results this output

    declare -a arr='([0]="2 1234 2345" [1]="7 3456 4567" [2]="123 5678 6789")'
    partition_number:2 start_byte:1234 end_btye:2345
    partition_number:7 start_byte:3456 end_btye:4567
    partition_number:123 start_byte:5678 end_btye:6789

@jsmeix Could you test on a SLES12-SP4, which has "parted resize" but
not "parted resizepart", but still "parted resize" with only NUM and END
arguments.

You just need to add some disk, partition it with msdos or GPT with gaps
in partitions, and try restoring :-)

For documentation here a summary with excerpts from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2081\#discussion\_r270031759](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2081#discussion_r270031759)  
that show where non consecutive partitions should now work on SLES:

On my SLES10-SP4 system

    # parted --version
    GNU Parted 1.6.25.1

    # parted --help
    ...
      resize NUMBER START END
        resize partition NUMBER and its file system

means `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZEPART=n`  
and `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZE=n` so that  
non consecutive partitions do not work on SLES10.

On my SLES11-SP4 system

    # parted --version
    parted (GNU parted) 2.3 ...

    # parted --help
    ...
      resize NUMBER START END
        resize partition NUMBER and its file system

means `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZEPART=n`  
and `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZE=n` so that  
non consecutive partitions do not work on SLES11.

On my SLES12-SP4 system:

    # parted --version
    parted (GNU parted) 3.1 ...

    # parted --help
    ...
      resize NUMBER END
        change end sector of partition NUMBER

means `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZEPART=n`  
and `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZE=y` so that  
non consecutive partitions should now work on SLES12.

On my SLES15-like openSUSE Leap 15.0 system:

    # parted --version
    parted (GNU parted) 3.2 ...

    # parted --help
    ...
      resizepart NUMBER END
        resize partition NUMBER

means `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZEPART=y`  
and `FEATURE_PARTED_RESIZE=n` so that  
non consecutive partitions should now work on SLES15.

Personally I would appreciate it if you merge it sooner than later  
because I need to do enhancements for partition creation  
on IBM Z architecture, cf.

on top of your enhancements in this pull request here.

Never mind!  
That's just how computers behave nowadays:  
Internally deterministic but unpredictable from the outside.

I guess the 'click' event handler callback function manager got a

There is a possibly severe issue/regression since this is merged:

Before there have been the explicit `parted` calls  
in the diskrestore.sh script so that in MIGATION\_MODE  
one could edit them directly, for example

    parted -s /dev/dasda mklabel dasd >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart "'dasda1'" 98304B 314621951B >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart "'dasda2'" 314621952B 838926335B >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart "'dasda3'" 838926336B 7385198591B >&2

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495554406](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495554406)

Since this is merged the explicit `parted` calls in diskrestore.sh  
are replaced by indirect function calls like in my case now

    create_disk_label /dev/dasda dasd
    create_disk_partition "/dev/dasda" "ext2" 1 98304 314621951
    create_disk_partition "/dev/dasda" "ext2" 2 314621952 838926335
    create_disk_partition "/dev/dasda" "ext2" 3 838926336 7385333759

which could no longer be "just edited" by an admin  
unless he knows how those functions evaluate.

I think it is the main purpose of the generated diskrestore.sh script  
that when things do not "just work" an admin can relatively easily  
understand what actually goes on and change that as he needs  
to fix disk layout recreation issues during "rear recover",  
see in the section about "Restore to different hardware"  
"The Ad-Hoc Way" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
therein in particular the line

    It’s simple bash code. Change it to use better values.

is now no longer true, it is no longer `simple bash code`.

The old `parted` directives can still be used by the user to recreate
his partitions, so there is no real regression here. Also the
`create_disk_partition` function has been documented to let the user
understand how it works.

@rmetrich  
on my test system I did some enhancements that output comments  
with the actual `parted` calls in the diskrestore.sh script so the
user  
can see the real commands but I did not yet do a pull request for it...
