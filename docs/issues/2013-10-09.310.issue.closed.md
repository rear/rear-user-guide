Hello,

please create release packages (.zip and .tar.gz) for rear 1.15.

So i can update my rear-1.15.ebuild to install exactly this version and
nothing else.

Kind regards,

morlix

It is available at
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/1.15/rear-1.15.tar.gz/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/1.15/rear-1.15.tar.gz/download)  
You're right sir, out main download pages, still refer to Github which
stopped support for downloads (as tar.gz) files a few months ago. I'll
rephrase the page so it becomes clearer for other as well.

By the way, I have no clue how the ebuild stuff works. Could you provide
some more information on this, so I can add it in the user guide for
example? It would please me a lot.  
thx, Gratien

Which information about ebuilds do you need? Howto install a package via
a ebuild which is not in the official portage tree?

Hmm that would be a lot to write... I hope you also like the URLs which
describe the required things.

Hi,

maybe even nicer for Gentoo users:

Make it so that Gentoo users can just "ebuild rear" to get the latest  
version. Let us know what we need to maintain for that and maintain
the  
Gentoo part.

What do you think?

My aim is that rear can be installed "the native way" on as many as  
possible distros.

Regards,  
Schlomo

I'm no official gentoo developer, so i can't add rear to the official
portage tree. But after i'm finished and successfully tested everything
i will open a bug report on the gentoo bugzilla and ask if someone would
take care of it, so that rear comes into the official portage tree.

@morlix OK thanks. Keep in touch how it evolves.  
One more thing: did you modify the file `packaging/gentoo/rear.ebuild`
to build the new rear-1.15? If yes, could you share the new content so
we can update the `rear.ebuild` file?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/283996?u=02b6cffb15028c756d145d3fd1f5839ce4bdb76a&v=4" width="50">[teissler](https://github.com/teissler) commented at [2013-10-15 06:47](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/310#issuecomment-26312545):

There already were a bug report for Gentoo, but i added my customized
ebuild for 1.15.  
[https://bugs.gentoo.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=404439](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=404439)

So we have to wait until there is something new regarding this bug.

Now every gentoo user can just "emerge rear" because as of 17th october
i'm the official proxy maintainer for rear and rear is now in the
official portage tree.

[https://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-backup/rear](https://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-backup/rear)

So this issue can be closed.
