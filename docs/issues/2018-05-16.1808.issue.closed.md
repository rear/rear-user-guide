The **mount\_cmd** is working fine, it appears on 'df -k' while the
`rear mkbackup` run but it's dismounted as the function **StopIfError**
seem to see it failed. What's very strange is that the return code is 0
as we can see in the test `[ 0 !=0 ]`

I am not a sshfs user but I think

<pre>
OUTPUT_URL="sshfs://rear-uxdc01@51.15.151.255/home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs /home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs port=12222"
</pre>

cannot work because `man rear` reads

<pre>
BACKUP_URL=sshfs://
    To backup to a remote server via sshfs (SSH protocol), use
    BACKUP_URL=sshfs://user@remote-system.name.org/home/user/backup-dir/
</pre>

and OUTPUT\_URL has same syntax as BACKUP\_URL  
because `man rear` also reads

<pre>
If you do not specify OUTPUT_URL variable then by default
it will be aligned to what was defined by variable BACKUP_URL
</pre>

I'm not trying to backup true *sshfs*, I'm doing this true BORG. I'm
just trying to save the **iso** on a sshfs directory instead of getting
it locally. So it's the good variable, **OUTPUT\_URL**  
I don't use BACKUP\_URL as BACKUP=BORG with BORGBACKUP\_HOST and
BORGBACKUP\_PORT

If I use the MOUNT\_CMD generated and launch it manually, no problem.
The remote directory is mounted locally on `/home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs`  
After that if, I put in the *local.conf*  
`OUTPUT_URL="file:////home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs"`  
which is the mount point of the sshfs  
The `rear mkbackup` save the iso file as expected in the mount point
`/home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs`  
So you we can expect to let it as this, but the problem is that my
backup server will have many others connected to it, and you can easily
imagine the impact to let all theses sshfs opened.

By using the **OUTPUT\_URL**, sshfs is mounted before the backup and
dismounted at the end.

What exactly is the error you are getting ?

Hello @jsmeix,

INDEED! Thanks!

@patlegu You can't use such format for *OUTPUT\_URL*.  
You need ReaR to choose the mount point.  
And if you need to specify non-default port for SSH operations, I'd
recommend to use *~/.ssh/config* something like:

    Host 88.182.85.28
         Port 22222

Hello.  
@jsmeix,@gozora: You're right, this syntax is needed by Rear, not sshfs.
These three parameters are analyzed in the 'global-functions.sh'
functions and used by *mount\_url* for sshfs (line 399):  
'\#\#\# Mount URL $1 at mountpoint $2\[, with options $3\]'  
For sshfs, resulting in this command :
`mount_cmd="sshfs $authority:$path $mountpoint -o $options"`  
and that's what I get (line 434):  
`mount_cmd="sshfs rear-uxdc01@88.182.85.28:/home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs /home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs -o port=22222"`  
I think I've finded where is the problem and I'm testing this today and
let you know.

Pat.

@patlegu  
see also default.conf e.g. the current one at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
that reads in particular

<pre>
# In case of doubt inspect the scripts how exactly a particular variable works.

[...]

# Output/backup locations
##

# The URL defines the remote share as <scheme>://<host>/<share> like these examples:
# nfs://host.domain/path/path/path
# cifs://server.domain/share
# usb:///dev/sdb1
...
# Additional options to the mount command are given using *_OPTIONS
# Alternatively, you can provide your own mount/unmount commands, in that case
# Relax-and-Recover will append its mountpoint to the command.
...
# Specify the location of the output:
# When OUTPUT_URL is not specified it inherits the BACKUP_URL value.
OUTPUT_URL=
OUTPUT_OPTIONS=
OUTPUT_MOUNTCMD=
OUTPUT_UMOUNTCMD=
OUTPUT_PREFIX="$HOSTNAME"
</pre>

and the main script how exactly that works is  
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh  
therein the mount\_url() function  
together with the other URL related functions therein.

I never used things like OUTPUT\_MOUNTCMD but as far as I see in  
usr/share/rear/output/default/100\_mount\_output\_path.sh  
OUTPUT\_MOUNTCMD cannnot be a string of words but must be a single
command  
and all the options to the mount command must be in OUTPUT\_OPTIONS.

@jsmeix : You're right, but I don't say I use this *OUTPUT\_MOUNTCMD* in
configuration file. I just say that *mount\_cmd* appear in the log file,
and I try to copy and paste it in a shell and it work. That's just this,
I've not been as clear as I should have been, sorry.  
And as you mentioned, the only option I've used in local.conf is:  
`OUTPUT_URL="sshfs://rear-uxdc01@88.182.85.28/home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs /home/rear-uxdc01/ISOs port=22222"`

I've found where is the problem. The remote directory is mounted under a
path and the iso file is copied to another one in the temporary working
path. To work, the output\_path function just need to be modified.

    (file|sshfs)
        # type file needs a local path (must be mounted by user)
        # type sshfs need a local path too but is mounted and unmounted automatically before and after the files copy.
        # To work properly, the OUPUT_URL must be set in the /etc/rear/local.conf file like this :
        # OUTPUT_URL="sshfs://<remote user>@<remote host><remote path> <local mount point> <sshfs option>"
        # Be carefull to not include the ":" between <remote host><remote path> as it's done automatically.
        # This exemple OUTPUT_URL="sshfs://rear-user@11.222.333.444/home/rear-user/ISOs /home/rear-user/ISOs
        # NOTE that sshfs options can be cumulated like this : port=2222,idmap=user

Hope this help.
