@gdha  
your recent commit "Add SUPPORT section in README"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2f3b62a3b418027bbf177fd57d33c557266cca19](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2f3b62a3b418027bbf177fd57d33c557266cca19)  
is broken.

It seems by accident many (or even all) symlinks in ReaR got deleted  
and the content became re-added as regular separated duplicated files.

Right now I did a new `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git`  
into a separated directory and compared that why my existing clone from
before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2f3b62a3b418027bbf177fd57d33c557266cca19](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2f3b62a3b418027bbf177fd57d33c557266cca19)  
and both are same so this issue is solved.

I.e. we are now back at the state where  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/be8b6edc8c09d2fedeceae9573ba9b824f587a7d](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/be8b6edc8c09d2fedeceae9573ba9b824f587a7d)  
is effectively the last commit.

@gdha  
thank you for your fix!
