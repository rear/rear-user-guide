...D is set

ReaR first sets up array of files to be copied. So any attempt to edit a
file before copy, will be unsuccessful.  
The first patch tried to edit a file that wasn't there .

I don't know why it worked the first time (probably a PEBKAC), but this
change has been tested several times now, and works everytime.
