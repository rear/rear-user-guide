(this work is for a client who uses GALAXY11 and Python, hence multiple
topics in one PR - sorry)

New
===

-   Include Python interpreter (minimal or full) via new variables
    `PYTHON_INTERPRETER` and `PYTHON_MINIMAL` (both `false` by default)
-   `mkboot` workflow for bare boot image without rescue info (for
    testing stuff not related to backup/restore)
-   `checklayout` workflow now runs full `prep` stage, first step
    towards resolving \#2951 and required for GALAXY11

Improved for `GALAXY11`
=======================

-   reworked point-in-time recovery
-   inject credentials and configuration via environment variables for
    remote-controlled recovery automation
-   reduce false positives in library dependency check for Galaxy11
    binaries
-   `checklayout` will also notice a change in `GALAXY11` installation
    to allow updating the rescue image after a GALAXY11 update

Tested
======

Manually on OL8u7

@schlomo  
I had only a very quick look.  
Currently I am busy with other things  
so I cannot do a review.

That is OK @jsmeix, thanks for taking a quick look. For newer systems
(Python 3.4ff) this PR could simplify adding Python for `YUM` and
`DUPLICITY`, but somebody who is actually using those will need to test
and adapt the old code.

Dear @rear/contributors I'd like to merge this really soon, latest on
Monday.

This PR adds generic Python support and also enables the full `prep`
stage for the `checklayout` workflow to enable using dynamic infos in
`checklayout`.

I believe that the biggest risk is that during `checklayout` ReaR will
create some files in `TMP_DIR` or in `ROOTFS_DIR` which are not required
for `checklayout`, and which can be safely ignored.

We can then still slowly work on moving those scripts out of the `prep`
stage into the `rescue` stage.

Hi @schlomo , it seems that the PR does at least 4 different things:

-   Python support
-   GALAXY11 changes (is GALAXY written in Python, or what is the
    relation?)
-   Adding a new "mkboot" workflow (how is that related?)
-   Using the "prep" stage in checklayout (why? and how is this
    related?)

the last two are not even described in the PR title, nor in the
description.

I believe unrelated changes (if they are unrelated) should be preferably
split into separate PRs (if too difficult, then at least into separate
commits), and in any case properly described to avoid surprises like:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967)

@pcahyna this PR contains all what i need for this customer who uses
Galaxy 11 and Python.

I hear your feedback on PR discipline and agree with you. I'll be happy
to be better next time and would appreciate is to go forward with this.

The variable dump script is something I'll be happy to remove if it
helps.

Everything else i needed to make it work or to test the code.

mkboot allows me to create a generic boot media without caring about a
backup method or rescue stuff, super useful for working on a feature
like Python that doesn't depend on anything.

Prep stage in Checklayout is for \#2951 and using variables defined in

@schlomo could you please do an interactive rebase to correct the issues
in commits? While we at it, the
[typo](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2965/commits/355d1559955fed02d9a67c9768de7319daf020a6),
[fix stage
ordering](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2965/commits/a5c000ed5d1d370fc7fe7240cf2a09241e3094b9),
[fix stage
ordering](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2965/commits/db9a2c16cfaeedb23976fee1149a1548abf561fa)
commits can be squashed into the commits that they fix. And [Include
Pyhon and
dependencies](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2965/commits/efa27e1a0f85c080de4770d990273d67dad75342)
should be easily split to a Python part commit and the mkboot workflow
part commit, with proper descriptions.

Concerning PR discipline, if you don't want to file separate PRs, please
edit this PR description to mention all the significant changes, and not
just some of them.

Ok, can you please describe the reason in the commit message of
9e7e52163afaa7acca56ed2cc7a4b49aa369186d ? (I now see what you meant by
"Add Galaxy Home Dir to checklayout verification, this is an example i…

…mplementation for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2951](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2951)",
but the description itself was too terse.)

This was just an example to show how confusing it is to submit changes
without describing them, the dump script itself should be discussed
separately.
