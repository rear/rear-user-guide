-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In prep/Linux-i386/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh  
set GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT=i386-efi  
in case of i686|i586|i386  
and  
set GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT=x86\_64-efi  
in case of x86\_64

Additionally describe current GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT usage  
only in case of EFI so that currently it does not matter  
when GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT is set to a value for EFI systems  
also on BIOS systems, cf.
