Moved from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239)
.

I am less concerned with builds (they only rarely fail) and more
concerned with tests (they fail fairly often, so it is a more pressing
issue). We need to pay attention to failing tests, because they may mean
either that:

1.  the PR introduces a regression and should not be merged
2.  something changed in the distro that we test against, so the PR can
    be merged, but we still need to know about it and fix the issue ASAP

In the first case, "if it is broken then eventually somebody will fix
it" is not the right approach. The PR author needs to fix it, and not
"eventually", but before the PR is merged.

For this we need the test to be not flaky. "continuously failing
building and testing against unknown Linux distro versions" is not even
the worst case (if it continuously fails, it is probably a case of point
2.) . The worst case is that tests fail randomly. If tests fail for
random reason too often, we will learn that we should disregard them and
cases of point 1. will creep in.

The question is: should we test on development versions of distros (in
our case, Fedora Rawhide for now)? We will catch incompatibilities with
updates to the distro, but won't the occasional false positives due to
unrelated breakage in the distro hide true test failures and lead us to
ignoring them?

I'm totally fine with not doing anything on development versions of
Linux distros and rather solve problems when we see them on the released
versions. In any case I don't expect a distro to fix something because
ReaR stopped working.

BTW, \#2972 was a nice example of an upstream problem that I found where
maybe (at least I like to believe that) we were helpful in getting it
fixed faster - because our CI found it and I followed up on it and it
turned out to be an upstream bug.

@schlomo well,
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972)
contradicts your "I don't expect a distro to fix something because ReaR
stopped working". If you mean "only because ReaR stopped working and
nothing else", even if the distro does not fix the incompatible change
that breaks our use, we still need to develop a fix on our side, so we
need to know about it.

As a compromise, I think I'll enable testing on `fedora-branched` (
[https://packit.dev/docs/configuration\#aliases](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration#aliases)
). This includes all supported stable versions, as well as the version
that was branched from the development branch (rawhide) and is
undergoing stabilization in order to become the next stable version.
Testing on it will hopefully allow us enough time to catch issues due to
distribution changes before the stable distribution version release,
while avoiding most of the breakage associated with Rawhide.

(This is for longer term; in the short term I will disable even the F40
stable version though due to a known but incompletely understood test
failure as discussed elsewhere.)

yes @pcahyna that is indeed an anti-example. I was thinking if I should
change ReaR to not use the broken `cp` option, but then I decided that I
first want to try reporting it upstream and simply waiting for upstream
to fix it. Which happened in the end. If this would have been for a
release that had to go out then I would indeed have changed ReaR as a
workaround (and reverted that for the next release).

Clarification of my unclear wording:  
With  
"continuously failing building and testing  
against unknown Linux distro versions"  
I actually meant the worst case  
that continuously this or that tests fail randomly  
so we are continuously hit by various false alarms.  
I did not mean that specific tests fail continuously.

Regarding

    2. something changed in the distro that we test against,
       so the PR can be merged, but we still need to know about it

"Tertium datur!" ;-)

When a test for a specific distribution fails  
for a longer time (i.e. considered "continuously"),  
it my not mean we have to fix something in ReaR.

When that specific distribution is not a stable release  
but something that changes, then a test that fails  
for a longer time could be a bug in that distribution  
which will be eventually fixed by that distribution,  
e.g. as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972)

Only when this bug in that distribution is not fixed  
when that distribution is released, then we may think  
about implementing a workaround in ReaR - but this  
requires that there is someone who uses that distribution  
and who contributes the workaround - i.e. as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251\#issuecomment-2173907303](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173907303)

Because of my above reasoning I still think  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239\#issuecomment-2173626556](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2173626556)

    I would prefer - if possible - is that our CI tests
    run in stable environments that are under our control

i.e. theat we run the CI tests only on (stable) released  
Linux distribution versions, same as @schlomo wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251\#issuecomment-2173857729](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173857729)

    I'm totally fine with not doing anything
    on development versions of Linux distros and
    rather solve problems when we see them
    on the released versions.

On the other hand I fully understand when @pcahyna  
would like to test on development versions of  
the distro he personally cares about (Fedora Rawhide)  
because he may like to know early when there are issues  
in Fedora Rawhide that affect ReaR, e.g. to avoid early  
that such issues later hit Red Hat customers who use RHEL.

The crucial difference here is that  
when @pcahyna enables tests on Fedora Rawhide  
and when he cares about "his" test results  
then all is well and I really appreciate it  
because test failures on Fedora Rawhide may  
indicate early a generic issue in ReaR,  
e.g. because of a newer version of some software  
as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3021](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3021)

In contrast when we enable tests on various  
development versions of Linux distros  
but there is no dedicated person (maintainer)  
who cares about those test results,  
then at least I feel somewhat annoyed by  
"randomly failing tests" and all I could do  
in this case with reasonable effort is to  
simply ignore particular failing tests  
(i.e. tests where the root cause of the failure  
is not obvious to me with reasonable effort).

Don't rely on "bug will be eventually fixed" without our action. In many
cases, we will need to actively report the bug on order to get it fixed,
otherwise nobody will care. This is especially the case for obscure
features of otherwise standard software that do not affect anyone else
if they get broken. So, even if we don't implement a workaround in ReaR,
we still need to know about the problem in order to get the maintainers
fix it.

The main question is, if a test on rawhide fails on a PR, what will you
(or other maintainers) do? Debug the cause of the test failure? Ask me
to debug it and wait with merging until the cause is known? Or just
merge the PR despite the test failing? In the third case, won't that
lead you to gradually ignore all test failures, even when they occur on
stable versions where the likelihood of the failure being a real bug is
much higher?

If there is a risk that the third case would apply, I prefer not testing
on rawhide (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251\#issuecomment-2173885768](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3251#issuecomment-2173885768)
for a compromise solution that would IMO bring lots of the benefits
without most of the drawbacks).

@pcahyna  
regarding the first part:  
Simply put in practice I can only care about (open)SUSE  
because I have basically no time for other distributions.

Regarding the second part:  
I only meant that you could enable tests on whatever  
distribution you like provided you care about its  
test results. I did not mean you should enable  
tests on Fedora Rawhide - but you could if you  
care about its test results.

In general:  
I am against CI tests on a Linux distribution  
(regardless how many users it has "out there")  
when we have noone here at ReaR upstream  
who actively cares about that Linux distribution,  
cf. what I wrote about Ubuntu and Canonical in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239\#issuecomment-2175051154](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2175051154)

Bottom line from my point of view:  
It is not about what would be good to do or good to have.  
It is about what we can get done with reasonable effort.

E.g. since about one year I wished a new ReaR release  
could get done - but see how long we need in practice  
for such a very basic task to get it actually done.  
So all what might delay us getting our basic tasks  
done should be avoided as far as possible.

I will care about the CI results - I already do.

Even then it entails waiting with PR merges on me debugging CI failures
sometimes - is that acceptable for you?

Are you willing to have a quick look at CI test failures on your PRs
yourself first, please? From time to time there will be actual bugs
introduced and initial investigation by the PR author would save me some
work. Just as you did in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128\#issuecomment-1892136367](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128#issuecomment-1892136367)
where you correctly identified that the failures are something to
investigate in more detail.

I understand that you may not have the time for this, but then I will
not be able to enable rawhide tests, as the load would be too high.

@pcahyna  
how I behaved at the time of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128\#issuecomment-1892136367](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128#issuecomment-1892136367)  
versus how I behave now regarding CI test failures  
explains perfectly well what I mean with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239\#issuecomment-2154754393](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3239#issuecomment-2154754393)

    When automated tests result too many false positives
    those automated tests do more harm than good.

    I think more than one or two percent false positives
    is already when it does more harm than good.

    When for each pull request 10 automated tests are run
    and each on has 98% reliability, then the overall
    reliability is only 82% (0.98 ^ 10 = 0.817)
    so every 5th CI failure is a false positive.

    To have 98% overall reliability (for 10 CI tests)
    each one must have 99.8% reliability
    (0.998 ^ 10 = 0.980).

    With "reliability" I mean that a failing CI test
    correctly indentifies an issue in our own code.

At the time of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128\#issuecomment-1892136367](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3128#issuecomment-1892136367)  
the automated tests were rather new for me  
so I cared and paid attention to failing tests  
because a failed CI thing was interesting.

Meanwhile for any pull requests there are basically  
always some CI things that fail (regardless what kind  
of CI thing fails - basically always something fails).

So I became rather accustomed to failed CI things  
and because most failed CI things were not caused  
by the actual code changes, failed CI things became  
no longer interesting but "just some normal noise"  
that one better "simply ignores".

Actually when something is mostly only noise  
one must ignore the noise to be able to still focus  
on what one actually wants to get done - otherwise  
if one would listen to noise (pay attention to noise)  
one could not get done what one actually wants to get done.

So my current ignorance of failed CI things is  
a necessity or a way out for me so that I still  
can get done what I actually want to get done.

@jsmeix exactly, and that's why I think disabling Rawhide tests is a
good thing to do despite missing the opportunities to catch important
changes or bugs in the distribution early. Hopefully the CI will be all
green most of the time then and developers will start paying attention
to it again.
