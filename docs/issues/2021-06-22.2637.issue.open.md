Usage of OUTPUT=OBDR should be deprecated in next ReaR version (2.7)  
so that the OBDR code could be removed in the version after the next
version (2.8)

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2625)

    UEFI seems to have broken OBDR support:
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/41efc97eb7141c30455df45a871b98cd08e09fa7

    OBDR probably got broken on ppc64le:

I wonder what the best way is how to deprecate something in ReaR.

My personal offhanded idea is to add a new script like  
usr/share/rear/init/default/850\_check\_deperecations.sh  
that errors out when something deprecated is used  
e.g. something like

    test "$OUTPUT" = "OBDR" && Error "OBDR support is deprecated"

perhaps a bit more user friendly - I only liked to suggest the basic
idea.

An offhanded proposal how to make it easier for the user  
to still use deprecated functionality:

Add to default.conf

    # For now you may set it to 'false' to still use deprecated OUTPUT="OBDR"
    # but OBDR support will be removed in a subsequent ReaR version
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637
    OBDR_DEPRECATED="OBDR support is deprecated"

and in a new script
usr/share/rear/init/default/850\_check\_deperecations.sh

    if ! is_false "$OBDR_DEPRECATED" ; then
        test "$OUTPUT" = "OBDR" && Error "OUTPUT=$OUTPUT - $OBDR_DEPRECATED"
    fi

@maslo64 can you please test OBDR support?

@pcahyna tests were performed with 2.7.1 RPM and in order to restore,
here are changes which were done to rear.

Here we need to update config file with `""` and `()` because of tar
behavior ,mentioned also in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7ce864210fc7a7c95a131ea8c933f543b6e3b9cb/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7ce864210fc7a7c95a131ea8c933f543b6e3b9cb/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540_set_backup_compression.sh)

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

Here we are missing 'mt' program in order to perform restore , f.x. seek
with fsf command

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7ce864210fc7a7c95a131ea8c933f543b6e3b9cb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1283](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7ce864210fc7a7c95a131ea8c933f543b6e3b9cb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1283)

what was also needed for restore was to execute script

    bash /usr/share/rear/skel/OBDR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/43-init-cciss.sh

and afterwards update `TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nstX` in config file.

Thanks

@maslo64  
thank you for your comment.

As long as current ReaR works with OBDR and  
as long as there are users who use current ReaR with OBDR,  
we will not deprecate OBDR.

In general:  
Contributions for special use case support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually cannot test those special use cases  
so we totally depend on contributions from people  
who use and know about those special use cases.

Currently I do not understand the third part in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637\#issuecomment-1475690995](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637#issuecomment-1475690995)

    what was also needed for restore was to execute script

    bash /usr/share/rear/skel/OBDR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/43-init-cciss.sh

    and afterwards update TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nstX in config file.

but I never used a tape device with Linux  
so I may not see things that are obvious  
for users who actually use a tape device.

What confuses me:

I would assume etc/scripts/system-setup.d/43-init-cciss.sh  
gets automatically run during ReaR recovery system startup?

I see TAPE\_DEVICE is used a lot in various scripts  
but there is no TAPE\_DEVICE in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
so TAPE\_DEVICE is no user config variable?

`I would assume etc/scripts/system-setup.d/43-init-cciss.sh gets automatically run during ReaR recovery system startup?`  
I did expect that would be the case, but I *think* in my case
/var/lib/rear/output/rear-${HOSTNAME}.iso, was created using
'OUTPUT=ISO', then it changed to 'OUTPUT=OBDR' in config file, so script
never made it to /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/ so it couldn't be executed
during startup.  
And reason why it was this was setup this way is that with 'OUTPUT=OBDR'
the ISO file was never successfully created.  
So we have had 'static' booting ISO always written to tape and data with
tar was updated regularly.

I did test it now and it looks better during boot

    Running 43-init-cciss.sh...
    Disable OBDR mode for device /dev/sr0
    Rescan single device using 1 0 1 0
    Wait for devices to settle
    Running 45-serial-console.sh...

` so TAPE_DEVICE is no user config variable?` after some more testing ,
this seems to be required for successful restore.  
If only OUTPUT\_URL=/dev/stX is specified, restore failed in my case.

As `TAPE_DEVICE` in recovery environment in OBDR case might not be same
device file, as new device /dev/stX will be generated when changing
device from OBDR mode. (considering there could be any number of tape
drives/changers in recovery environment ) so TAPE\_DEVICE has to be set
either manually or using `43-init-cciss.sh` somehow.
