We point to SourceForge in multiple places:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/72e92b8d442a62e463b18755ef0fbca2b0ca0ecc/packaging/rpm/rear.spec\#L22](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/72e92b8d442a62e463b18755ef0fbca2b0ca0ecc/packaging/rpm/rear.spec#L22)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/72e92b8d442a62e463b18755ef0fbca2b0ca0ecc/packaging/gentoo/rear.ebuild\#L9](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/72e92b8d442a62e463b18755ef0fbca2b0ca0ecc/packaging/gentoo/rear.ebuild#L9)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/72e92b8d442a62e463b18755ef0fbca2b0ca0ecc/Makefile\#L174](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/72e92b8d442a62e463b18755ef0fbca2b0ca0ecc/Makefile#L174)

But we stopped uploading ReaR release files there:
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rear/files/rear/)

How about we start using GitHub Releases for actual production releases?
We already have tags for every release, which are the basis for a GitHub
release.

Or, as an alternative, we can simply point to the GitHub repo as the
Source, that would IMHO still be better than pointing at the outdated
SourceForge.

Actually, our website already points to GitHub releases even though we
don't publish GitHub releases yet:

@schlomo  
from my personal point of view  
(i.e. unless other @rear/contributors object)  
feel free to cleanup and update those things  
as you think what works best for us and our users.

@schlomo I saw the same thing in the RPM spec recently and I have a fix
- I can send a PR unless you are working on it already.

Please send a fix, thank you very much.

Hi @schlomo, sorry for the delay. PR \#2949. I touched only the RPM spec
as I am not familiar with Gentoo (if nobody else can test it, I can
update it blindly).  
The spec works already even without having releases on GitHub - it
refers to the archive that corresponds to the tag (arguably the release
tarball will be a bit different, but looking at the Makefile, the
difference should be only in omitted dot files and the files listed in
.gitignore, right?).
