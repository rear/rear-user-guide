At least sometimes "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
does not sufficiently error out if mandatory stuff is missing.

I think when mandatory stuff is missing (e.g. parted not installed)  
ReaR should error out early with a meaningful error message  
than to blindly proceed until it errors out at an arbitrary later
place  
with an unexpected error message, cf.

FYI:  
REQUIRED\_PROGS works as expected.  
I have in local.conf

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" qqq )
</pre>

and "rear mkrescue" errors out:

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue && echo OK || echo FAIL
