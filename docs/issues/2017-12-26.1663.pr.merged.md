Doc seems to incorrectly state that the code would check for running
from tmpfs or ramdisk. The actual check in code that I can find is much
simpler: "test -e /etc/rear-release" at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear)  
Better reflect the actual behavior in documentation.

@schlomo @gdha  
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc)  
I don't know what the "demo" recovery workflow should be and/or  
how a "demo" recovery workflow could be started manually.

According to the code in  
init/default/050\_check\_rear\_recover\_mode.sh  
any "rear recover" command would be aborted  
unless /etc/rear-release exists.

The part about the "demo" recovery workflow in  
doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc  
exists since that file had been created as  
doc/relax-recover-concept.txt  
on Jun 14 2011 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f4fae8a56625e05d41a548e03a6d3a3dda9d7e0f](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f4fae8a56625e05d41a548e03a6d3a3dda9d7e0f)

I think the whole paragraph

<pre>
The recovery workflow is triggered by the fact that
the root filesystem is mounted in a ram disk or tmpfs.
Alternatively a "demo" recovery workflow can be
started manually. This will simply recover all data into
a subdirectory and not touch the hard disks (Phase 2).
</pre>

might be deleted because /etc/rear-release is an implementation detail  
that does not need to be documented here and I guess that "Phase 2"  
means that the "demo" recovery workflow was meant to be  
implemented in the future but it never happened.

I am not aware of a demo recovery workflow and `git grep` doesn't find
anything. So probably a good idea to remove this part of the
documentation till somebody implements such a workflow.
