@rear/contributors  
because this change affects only `OUTPUT=RAWDISK`  
and because it was tested by @OliverO2  
I would like to merge it tomorrow morning  
if there are no objections.

@OliverO2  
In general this PR looks OK to me.

Only for the future, it might be good idea to unite Grub2 UEFI code also
for `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` . With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c67e24d32c09a86ca98733c2f2399f428e6ce071](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c67e24d32c09a86ca98733c2f2399f428e6ce071)
@pcahyna introduced code for this purpose. Maybe it would be worth a
wile to check if it would be usable also for `OUTPUT=RAWDISK`. Some
example code can be found in
[250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/03b36df5efc990c2dbccf3b37f9e3ba97c247c35/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh#L75).

V.

@gozora I would like to unify the code with my previous GRUB changes,
but I don't have time for it now - @yontalcar do you want to have a
look?

@gozora Actually, I've tried to use `build_bootx86_efi` in my attempt to
fix this. Unfortunately, I was unable to make it work right away.

@pcahyna @yontalcar Some ideas from my side if `build_bootx86_efi` were
to be used universally.

`RAWDISK` output is not just used to create a recovery image. It is also
used to create a pre-boot-authentication system to unlock
self-encrypting disks. Such a system must be pretty small (less than 128
MB) and boot quickly, silently and nicely (with a plymouth graphical
splash if available). So in this case a minimal set of grub modules is
required, the only file system support needed is GPT/FAT, but relevant
video modes must be usable.

Using `build_bootx86_efi` would replace just one line in
`usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/270_create_grub2_efi_bootloader.sh`:

        $grub2_name-mkimage -O x86_64-efi -o "$boot_loader" -p "/EFI/BOOT" "${grub_modules[@]}"

Would that be worth it? If you think so, could you consider including
some documentation in `build_bootx86_efi` making some guarantees about
its invocation (parameters, global variables, behavior) so that it is
easier to use and things don't change unexpectedly later on?
