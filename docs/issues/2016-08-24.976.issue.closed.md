-   Brief description of the issue  
    While using rear, when installed via rpm everything works fine.
    mkbackup, recover everything is fine.  
    But while trying to just unpack the files to be able to distribute
    them to other machines I kinda stumbled across the issue that my
    rear recover of those machines is not working. Unfortunatly the only
    issue I found is that I get the same error message as \#870 with the
    rpc.statd can't start.

I just can't find the reason why it happens though. Is there something
rpm is doing differently then just unpacking the script/config files to
the right positions?

I have used ' rpm2cpio rear-1.18-3.x86\_64.rpm | cpio -idmv' to unpack
the files and then sync them to the other machines. Backuping works fine
without issues, so does the PXEboot but when starting the recover I get
the rpc.statd error. Seems to me that something is not being copied into
the live image, but what could be the reason to it?

Well my work around would be that I install the rpm on every machine and
copy the configurations after that - but I would still like to know how
rpm2cpio differs in that small regard to rpm -i

This is no issue in rear.

I cannot really help here but I guess that the rpc.statd issue  
is not caused by how you put all the rear files on the  
other machine - you did put all the rear files on the other  
machine not only the \*.sh scripts didn't you?

I guess the rpc.statd issue on the other machine is caused  
by whatever reason that is specific for the other machine  
or its networking environment.

Yes, I did unpack all files that you get from rpm2cpio - even the empty
directory paths into the other machines - just hoped maybe you guys know
some more since you build the rpms. Guess I would need to look into rpm
itself and what exactly it is doing differently.

Like I said - it's partly even working. I can use manuels for rear, can
use mkbackup. The only issue occurs when booting up the PXE rescue image
and trying to recover from there.

Funny enough - when the rpm was not installed via the rpm command but
only copied, you can still install it and call 'rear mkrescue' and the
backup will work. It's probably some internal rpm2cpio difference to rpm
-i. Well I'll see if I can find some more information on that regard.

Thank you for your reply.

You mean when you installed the plain files via cpio  
there is the rpc.statd issue but when you then install  
the rear RPM package with 'rpm' on the same machine,  
then there is no longer the rpc.statd issue?

First idea what is different are the RPM scriptlets  
but in my rear RPM package I don't see a scriptlet  
that could make a real difference

<pre>
# rpm -q --scripts rear       
preinstall scriptlet (using /bin/sh):
if [ $1 -gt 1 ] ; then
# during upgrade remove obsolete directories
/usr/bin/rm -rf /usr/share/rear/output/NETFS
fi
</pre>

because when you do not yet have rear files on a machine  
theer would be no obsolete /usr/share/rear/output/NETFS  
directory so that the preinstall scriptlet does nothing.

Yes exactly this! That's why I'm so confused myself. I've looked at the
preinstall scriplets already and that's why I was asking here since I
couldn't find anything that was being done pre or past installation that
would make a difference in plain files over installing the rpm
package.  
But it obviously does something different since with the installed rpm
it's working and the plain files the recover failes with the rpc.statd
error.

Like I said it's the same issue \#870 had. The sm-notify is not in the
liveimage. I tried specifying all progs required, but I probably miss
some since when I specify them in the local.conf it ONLY installs those
specified and not those specified + the defaults needed.

Edit: Maybe there are some variables that get set when you install it
via rpm? I don't know how the package itself is configured so that makes
it hard to reconstruct what is actually going wrong with the plain files
vs 'rpm -i' method.

Logfile for rpm install:

1135 rows of unpacking folders/files on both. So I should have
everything needed on cpio aswell.  
Can't see any specific difference besides the indexing?

I have neither an idea what caused a difference  
nor do I have an idea what the difference is  
but I am curious to learn what it is in the end.
