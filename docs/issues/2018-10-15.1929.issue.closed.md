ReaR version 2.00 is a bit old, from January 2017, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)

Some time ago there was an issue with ReaR 2.0 where guessing  
the bootloader did not work on RHEL 7.3 with UEFI, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242)  
that lead to "Improved BOOTLOADER support" in ReaR 2.1, see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)  
and for details see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262)

With UEFI you may additionally need to specify config variables  
like ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER, see what the currrent
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
reads that is related to `UEFI`.

Try out if a more current version works better for you, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

See  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)  
what has changed from ReaR 2.0 to the current ReaR 2.4.  
There are some possibly backward incompatible changes.

I would also recommend to try out our current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code as follows:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).

I don't know if your issue is a bug in ReaR, a missing feature in
ReaR,  
or if it is caused by inappropriate configuration settings by you.

If your issue is a bug or a missing feature in ReaR:

Bugs in older ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR
upstream).  
Missing features in older ReaR versions are not backported by us.

Bugs in older ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (provided the fix can be backported  
with reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got
your  
older ReaR version.

Missing features in older ReaR versions are usually not backported  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.

If the issue also happens with current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
please provide us a complete ReaR debug log file of "rear -D mkrescue"  
so that we can have a look how it behaves in your particular
environment  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If it works with current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
we would really appreciate an explicit positive feedback.

Because "no news is good news", cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AUnix\_philosophy\#No\_news\_is\_good\_news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AUnix_philosophy#No_news_is_good_news)  
I assume things work sufficiently with latest ReaR release 2.4  
or with our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code.
