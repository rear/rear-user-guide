-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

NVMe devices are represented by the kernel as a root device
(`/dev/nvme0` in this example) and a sub-device for each namespace of
the drive (`/dev/nvme0n1` in this example). On most client SSDs, there
is only one namespace, and it contains the entirety of the user-visible
LBAs on the drive. `sedutil-cli` expects to be passed the device
representing the entire drive, but `partprobe` needs to be passed the
device representing the namespace.

All of the functions in `opal-functions.sh` attempt to pass the same
device to both `sedutil-cli` and `partprobe`, and `partprobe` returns an
error status when handed the root device for an NVMe drive instead of
the namespace device. As such, the unlocking function fails.

-   Workaround, if any:

None.

I'll look into this one too. I'd have to familiarize myself with NVME
stuff first but the issue seems to contain sufficient details to figure
out a solution.

@bmastenbrook  
I do not have a NVME device so I cannot reproduce things myself.

I am puzzled by your `lsblk` output versus your description

    NVMe devices are represented by the kernel as a root device
    (/dev/nvme0 in this example) and a sub-device for each namespace
    of the drive (/dev/nvme0n1 in this example)

because your `lsblk` output does not contain a `nvme0` kernel device  
so it seems there is no such device on your system.  
But when there is no `nvme0` kernel device I wonder how `sedutil-cli`
can  
expect to be passed the device representing the entire drive as `nvme0`?

I assume for `sedutil-cli ... <device>` the device needs to be a `disk`
type device  
which is usually e.g. something like `/dev/sda`.

In your `lsblk` output `nvme0n1` is show as a `disk` type device  
so I would expect that `sedutil-cli ... /dev/nvme0n1` works.

But it seems in case of NVMe devices there are two layers of `disk` like
devices:  
A hidden / non-visible low-level `nvme0` kind of `whole-disk` type
device plus  
one or more normal visible `nvme0n1` kind of `normal-disk` type devices?

Only FYI regarding "fun with device naming" for mmcblk/eMMC devices  
cf.

Actually it could be a toaster as long as its driver provides the
necessary ioctls. `sedutil-cli` uses different ioctl commands for NVME
and SATA devices.

With `disk` type device I meant what the `TYPE` column of `lsblk`
shows  
so of course also whole toasters when shown as `disk` by `lsblk`  
in contrast to toaster slots that could be shown as `part` by `lsblk`
;-)

@jsmeix  
Actually, it seems like `sedutil-cli` uses the nvme *character* device
`nvme0` in the above example, which is just a control device. This
control device is used to create the actual disk-type devices called
namespaces (= "amount of NVM storage formatted for block access") like
`nvme0n1`. Each namespace device can then be partitioned.

`sedutil-cli --scan` is used to determine available Opal devices and
this seems to spit out the control devices in case of NVME. These
character devices are not considered by `lsblk`.

Maybe we should campaign for toasters being supported as NVME devices,
too, with the slots being the namespaces. ;-)

@bmastenbrook  
Could you change `usr/share/rear/lib/opal-functions.sh` like this and
try again?

1.  Insert this function just above the definion of
    `function opal_device_regenerate_dek_ERASING_ALL_DATA()`:

        function opal_device_partprobe() {
            local device="${1:?}"
            # uses partprobe to update partition tables for all block devices belonging to the given Opal device.

            case "$device" in
                (*/nvme*)
                    partprobe "$device"n[0-9]  # consider all namespace block devices (NOTE: relies on nullglob)
                    ;;
                (*)
                    partprobe "$device"
                    ;;
            esac
        }

2.  Change all `partprobe` invocations to `opal_device_partprobe`

@OliverO2  
I noticed `device="${1:?}"` and found the `${VAR:?}` form many times in
Opal related code  
but I this leads to an unfriendly exit without any error message when
VAR is null or unset.

This is described in "man bash" (GNU bash, version 4.4.23 in my case):

    ${parameter:?word}
    Display Error if Null or Unset.
    If parameter is null or unset, the expansion of word
    (or a message to that effect if word is not present)
    is written to the standard error and
    the shell, if it is not interactive, exits.
    Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.

For example when I put

    LogPrint TEST begin
    foo=""
    bar="${foo:?}" || BugError "foo null or unset"
    LogPrint TEST end

in a script ReaR exits as follows

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git
    Running rear mkrescue (PID 8066 date 2020-08-10 16:04:49)

@jsmeix  
These checks are just a compact attempt to catch internal bugs early
without putting too much error-checking distractions in the code. The
log file in your example helps to spot the cause:

    2020-08-10 17:20:16.233077604 TEST begin
    /home/oliver/Repositories/open-source/rear/usr/share/rear/prep/default/009_test.sh: line 3: foo: parameter null or not set
    2020-08-10 17:20:16.234854487 Exiting rear mkrescue (PID 20879) and its descendant processes ...

Is there a better alternative?

-   Not checking at all (like most code in ReaR) would let ReaR either
    continue with undesirable results or trigger a follow-up error later
    on which is probably harder to diagnose.
-   Putting in explicit error-checking code everywhere (like
    `[[ -z "$foo" ]] || BugError "foo: parameter null or not set" ]]`)
    distracts from the primary functionality and makes the code harder
    to read.

@OliverO2  
I think explicit testing is the best way for bash scripts.  
I try to explain my reasoning why below.

Regarding `bar="${foo:?}"`:

The problem for the user is that he does not get the error message on
his terminal.  
Let him search the actual error message from the log is not user
friendly.  
He needs at least some message about what went wrong on his terminal.  
Then he can search the log for more details related to that message.  
To show the bash error `foo: parameter null or not set` on his
terminal  
and have that message also in the log so the user can find the matching
part in the log

    { bar="${foo:?}" ; } 2>> >( tee -a "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" 1>&8 )

is the only way that works for me.  
Why a compound group command `{ ... ; } 2>` must be used see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L840](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L840)  
and for the complicated redirection via `tee` process substitution see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh\#L71](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500_make_backup.sh#L71)  
and see the explanatory comment for that code.  
and for background information see the discussion in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382)  
in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r417852393](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r417852393)  
and subsequent comments there like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r418018571](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r418018571)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r419378558](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r419378558)

But what would code like

    function opal_device_partprobe() {
        { local device="${1:?}" ; } 2>> >( tee -a "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" 1>&8 )

actually help?  
E.g. it would not catch if `opal_device_partprobe /etc/fstab` was
called.  
Others who read that code would get a longer exercise in reverse
engineering  
what that complicated code intends to do or a longer comment is needed  
that explains them what the idea behind is.

In contrast explicit testing like

    function opal_device_partprobe() {
        local device="$1"
        test -b "$device" -o -c "$device" || BugError "opal_device_partprobe called for '$device' that is neither a block nor a character device"

makes it obvious for a code reader what that code is about and  
the user gets a helpful error message via ReaR standard functionality.

@OliverO2  
would you like to open that separated issue about ReaR coding
conventions?

I ask you because I think when you do the initial description  
the issue would show things from your point of view which is the point
of view  
we need primarily as initial input to get something new and interesting.

In contrast if I did the initial description the issue would  
show things from my point of view which is what I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475\#issuecomment-671871423](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475#issuecomment-671871423)  
which is no new and interesting input but "just old known stuff" as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

And there is no time pressure, in particular no need to change things  
in your code right now, so take your time as long as you need.

@jsmeix Sure, I can open the issue. The only downside is that I don't
know how to move comments from this issue to the new one. If this were

let's do it this way, I'll start the new issue sometime this week, so
stay tuned. :-)

@OliverO2  
thank you in advance!

I don't know if it is possible to move comments to another issue.  
I see a "Reference in new issue" functionality but that seems to be
something different.  
I can hide comments in issues.  
So to "move" a comment I would manually copy&paste it into the new
issue  
and then I could hide the old comment in the old issue.

i got the git version, flashed Secure Boot PBA and a nice plymouth
dialog is displayed after 11 seconds (not very fast, exactly like LUKS
delay, but better than DTA PBA of 5 seconds + forced reboot 15 sec).
After setting password, the message says "drive couldn't be unlocked"
and next attempts fail to progress booting. In fact, the NVME is indeed
unlocked with first attempt, as I can see when i fallback to OPAL
PBA&gt; command line (and by a negative check of falling back before
password entry). I can unlock with sed-opal-unlocker also as only PBA
changed. I have two NVME so the fastest approach is sed-opal-unlocker
service with 1 sec delay but not suitable for single drive nor boot
files being on the SED drive which i'd like.

unlockers summary:  
BIOS: password prompt can be triggered with MBREnable=false but it
doesn't work  
DTA PBA: works with 5 + 15sec delay, except Ryzen systems, unreadable
GUI with no pwd repeat, no Secure Boot?  
DTA forks: some bring different hashing, some bring support for Ryzen,
added password save for suspend, none are compatible with DTA.
unreadable GUI with no pwd repeat, no Secure Boot?  
sed-opal-unlocker: almost no delay, password can be in hashed file,
added password save for suspend, runs as a service too late to move any
boot files to SED drive, compatible with DTA, Secure boot ok  
rear: 11sec delay, nice GUI with pwd repeat, added password save for
suspend?, compatible with DTA, Secure boot ok

@gitthangbaby Thanks for your report.

If the PBA fails to unlock your device, could you please use the rescue
system to provide a detailed log?

This is what you could do to help find the cause:

1.  Prepare a rescue system on a USB stick according to **Step 3** in
    [Quick Start: Setting up Self-Encrypting
    Disks](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/13-tcg-opal-support.adoc#quick-start-setting-up-self-encrypting-disks).
2.  Shut down your system so that SEDs become locked.
3.  Boot the rescue system.
4.  Log in as `root` (locally, or from another system via `ssh`)
5.  Run these commands:
    -   `lsblk -o +MODEL`
    -   `rear opaladmin info`
6.  Provide the output of the above commands.
7.  Run this command to attempt to unlock SEDs.
    -   `rear -D opaladmin unlock`
8.  Provide the complete contents of the log file
    `/var/log/rear/rear-*.log`
    -   NOTE: Capture the log contents right away as it will be
        overwritten by the next rear invocation.
9.  Run once more:
    -   `rear opaladmin info`
10. Provide the output of the above command.

Hi. Sorry for no reply, I had a misfortune of flashing the Rear USB
image (thinking it's PBA) to unlocked NVME drive (thinking it's locked),
so i lost all distros. The Rear USB started with grub&gt; only.  
Since i have advantage of two drives, i decided to put effort to
initram-ize the boot process and it was extremely difficult but
successful.

@gitthangbaby No problem. It would still be valuable if you could try
[the above
steps](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2475#issuecomment-728220696)
and provide output and log file. I'm pretty sure whatever is is, it can
be fixed easily once we have the necessary information.
