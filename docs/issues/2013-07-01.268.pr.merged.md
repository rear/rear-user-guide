This merge request intend to fix several issues when a legacy grub is
used in EFI mod. (eg: RHEL6)

-   Grub shouldn't be installed on the MBR
-   In efibootmgr, only one backslash is needed in the bootloader path
    to separate dirs
-   When we add a rear entry to the GRUB config, adapt the path on EFI
-   Fix bootloader name inside efiboot.img. It needs to be BOOTX64.efi,
    not a distro specific name.
-   Don't use a GRUB2 config on a GRUB legacy bootloader in the bootable
    ISO
