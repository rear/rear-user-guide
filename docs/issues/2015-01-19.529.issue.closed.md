We are testing a rear restore on systems utilizing a multipath/ boot
from SAN configuration. Currently we are getting the error "No code has
been generated to restore device pv:/dev/mapper/mpatha2 (lvmdev).

I have read through issue \#228 but trying the troubleshooting items
listed did not help. Looking at disklayout.conf I see that
/dev/mapper/mpatha2 listed. I have uploaded debug logs to gist.

I could not find the `diskrestore.sh` script. Would have been useful to
see that one as well.

Here is the diskrestore.sh (screenshot).

@captaw3some what you could do to get you further is to manual edit the
`disklayout.conf` file and un-comment the following lines (for mpatha):

    disk /dev/sda 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdb 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdc 5898240 unknown
    disk /dev/sdd 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sde 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdf 5898240 unknown
    disk /dev/sdg 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdh 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdi 5898240 unknown
    disk /dev/sdj 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdk 21626880000 msdos
    #disk /dev/sdl 5898240 unknown
    #disk /dev/sdm 0
    multipath /dev/mapper/mpatha /dev/sda,/dev/sdd,/dev/sdg,/dev/sdj

Not sure that will be sufficient - you might consider to add the
variable `BOOT_OVER_SAN=y` to the `local.conf` file (see script
`./prep/GNU/Linux/24_include_multipath_tools.sh`).  
Furthermore, making a bootable SAN disk is not yet automated within rear
(so hoping you could help here).

gdha, read my document that I have just posted in this issues section,
it covers how to do this with multipath/boot from san, while taking
advantage of LVM2 (i.e. vg/lvols etc...). I just did another test where
I scrapped /boot, /etc, /var and /tmp and I was able to recover using
REAR via my document.

See issue \#572 - we can close this one
