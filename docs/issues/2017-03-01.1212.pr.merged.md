Trying to make how UEFI\_BOOTLOADER works

@gozora  
hereby I did major changes in  
rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
that (hopefully) make UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
more generally usable.

I tried to keep all backward compatible  
but I really need your careful review.

In particular I searched all ReaR scripts  
for what variables are actually globally used  
and I did not find that those variables that I  
declared now as 'local' to be used elsewhere.

Furthermore I implemented a somewhat sophisticated  
way how one same variable UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
can be either specified as file to be used as UEFI bootloader  
or as single string or array of filename globbing patterns  
for 'find' to search for a file to be used as UEFI bootloader.  
My implementation is based on the bash behaviour that  
normal single string variables and arrays work compatible  
in a very well reasonable way:

<pre>
# var="string"

# echo "$var"
string

# echo "${var[@]}"
string

# var=( 'this' 'that' )

# echo "$var"
this

# echo "${var[@]}"
this that

# var="something"

# echo "$var"
something

# echo "${var[@]}"
something that
</pre>

Hello @jsmeix,

I'm definitely going to try this out, hope you don't mind a small delay
in this review because lately I have lot of (primary) work tasks even
during weekend so it might take longer then usual ...

@jsmeix serious change in code - testing will be easier then just
looking at the code...I guess

@gdha  
I cannot test with reasonable effort all those various possible  
scenarios (i.e. all those various Linux distributions) where  
the right file for UEFI\_BOOTLODER could be stored.

@gozora  
while sleeping over it I noticed that the current logic  
is partially backwards - and I think we can get rid  
of the BugError - I will do another commit...

@jsmeix thanks for notification!  
I was planing to take a look on it today afternoon/evening ...

@gozora  
I think now you could have a look.

Unfortunately it became somewhat nested conditions but  
currently I have no good idea how to make it less nested  
(without using things like artificial helper variables).

Whoops!  
I had the wrong assumption that any UEFI related code  
belongs to @gozora until now when I used

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh
</pre>

that shows me that @gdha had initially made it  
so that hereby I humbly also request a review  
from @gdha

Caution:  
In general

<pre>
is_true $VAR
</pre>

is not the logical opposite (i.e. the logical negation) of

<pre>
is_false $VAR
</pre>

see my explanation in usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh

<pre>
# two explicit functions to be able to test explicitly for true and false (see issue #625)
# because "tertium non datur" (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)
# does not hold for variables because variables could be unset or have empty value
...
    # only if there is explicitly a 'true' value then is_true returns true
    # so that an unset variable or an empty value is not true
...
    # only if there is explicitly a 'false' value then is_false returns true
    # so that an unset variable or an empty value is not false
    # caution: for unset or empty variables is_false is false
</pre>

Accordingly

<pre>
is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return
</pre>

returns  
if USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is explicitly a 'false' value  
and also when USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is empty or unset  
while in contrast

<pre>
is_false $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER && return
</pre>

returns  
only if USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is explicitly a 'false' value  
but not when USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is empty or unset.

See also default.conf:

<pre>
# A few variables have ternary semantics:
# - explicit true value like True T true t Yes Y yes y 1
# - explicit false value like False F false f No N no n 0
# - unset or empty or a value that is neither a true value nor a false value
# (see the is_true and is_false functions in lib/global-functions.sh).
</pre>

I.e. for USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER="foo"  
both  
is\_true $USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
and  
is\_false $USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
result 'false'.

Basically directly after leaving the office yesterday  
I remembered what I already did to avoid  
code with deeply nested 'if...else' conditions:  
I use an artificial 'for' clause that is run only once  
so that I can at any point 'continue' with the code  
after that 'for' clause, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/default/990\_move\_away\_restored\_files.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/default/990_move_away_restored_files.sh)

Since my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212/commits/9a31a5fa9a75a72bfb01eedabadc104400982667](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212/commits/9a31a5fa9a75a72bfb01eedabadc104400982667)  
I even like to look at my code ;-)

@gozora  
many thanks for your tests!

I think I will merge it soon - unless there are objections.

@gdha  
of course when there are bugs, I will fix them.
