I am not a cifs user so I cannot test it.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/global-functions.sh in mount\_url()  
therein in the cifs case added explicit '-t cifs'  
to mount\_cmd because that seems to be needed  
with a Windows 11 cifs share at least in some cases  
(with Windows 10 it had worked without '-t cifs').

@rear/contributors

I assume it cannot cause regressions  
when for the 'cifs' case its mount command  
has explicitly the mount option '-t cifs' set  
so I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections.

According to "man 8 mount" '-t cifs' is supported  
at least since util-linux-2.19.1 and cifs-utils-5.1  
which I have in SLES11 SP4 (my oldest test VM):

    # type -a mount
    mount is /bin/mount

    # rpm -qf /bin/mount
    util-linux-2.19.1-6.72.1

    # man 8 mount
    ...
      -t, --types vfstype
        The argument following the -t is used to indicate
        the filesystem type. The filesystem types which are
        currently supported include: ... cifs ...
        ...
        For most types all the mount program has to do
        is issue a simple mount(2) system call, and no
        detailed knowledge of the filesystem type is required.
        For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs)
        ad hoc code is necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs,
        and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount program.
        In order to make it possible to treat all types
        in a uniform way, mount will execute the program
        /sbin/mount.TYPE (if that exists)
        when called with type TYPE.
    ...

    # type -a mount.cifs
    mount.cifs is /sbin/mount.cifs

    # rpm -qf /sbin/mount.cifs
    cifs-utils-5.1-0.14.46
