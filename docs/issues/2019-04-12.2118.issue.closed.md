-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I can successfully run the rear backup of this server. Then the problem
happens when I'm going to test this backup in another physical test box
(Which I'm successfully testing lots of rear images of other servers).

When I'm booting this test box with rear image of the server, it failed
to recover.  
After running "rear recover" command it get failed because it says in
target system does not have /dev/sda but this problem does not come when
I'm mounting other servers rear images.

When I type lsblk command to see local disk in test system, it does not
show anything.

@samurdhi  
I have no real good idea what the reason could be  
when on a `Intel Physical Server: HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9`  
its `Local Disk` is not available for the kernel.

I guess there is something special on HP ProLiant  
but I do not use or have any HP ProLiant system.

I think when there is no device node (like /dev/sda) for the local
disk  
that local disk needs a special kernel module to be loaded.

Usually kernel modules for local disks get loaded automatically  
provided the needed kernel modules are there.  
But by default the ReaR recovery system does not include all kernel
modules  
so that special kernel modules could be missing in the recovery system,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)

In particular when you use the ReaR recovery system  
on not 100% compatible replacement hardware,  
cf. "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
you usually need to specify in etc/rear/local.conf

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )

see its documentation in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

By the way: `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`  
will be the default in the upcoming ReaR 2.5  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041)  
and

@jsmeix

Thanks, Jsmeix for your reply.  
I have updated local.conf file and included line (MODULES=(
'all\_modules' )) and then took a new rear image. Then I boot my
recovery testing server with this image and no luck.  
Still I'm unable to see any internal disks,

@samurdhi  
I am afraid, I have neither a further good idea what might help here  
nor can I imagine what the reason could be why there is  
no device node for the local disk in the ReaR recovery system.

In your initial description  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2118\#issue-432707046](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2118#issue-432707046)  
you wrote that you have a `HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9`.  
I guess that is where your original system runs.  
But you did not write what exactly your `another physical test box`
is.  
Is that also a `HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9` or something different?  
If it is different, what exactly is that `another physical test box`?

Some blind shots into the dark:

When you boot another installation system on that
`another physical test box`  
e.g. an Oracle Linux Server release 6.4 installation system  
or a Linux distribution installation system - preferably the matching
RHEL 6.4  
according to "Release history" in
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle\_Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Linux)  
is then a device node for the local disk in those installation systems?

Because you are  
`successfully testing lots of rear images of other servers`  
on that `another physical test box`:  
What Linux systems do you use on that `other servers`?

Perhaps it helps to enforce loading of all kernel modules that are
loaded  
on the original system where "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" was run  
also in the ReaR recovery system via

    MODULES_LOAD=( first_module second_module ... )

You may use a command like

    # tac /proc/modules | cut -d ' ' -f1

to get the currently loaded modules in the right ordering  
for `MODULES_LOAD` i.e. the first loaded module first.  
But loading all kernel modules of the original system  
in the ReaR recovery system may totally fail when the  
ReaR recovery system hardware is too different compared  
to the original system hardware.

To better see what happens during ReaR recovery system startup  
add the kernel command line option `debug`.  
When you are in boot menu of the ReaR recovery system  
select the topmost entry

    Recover host_name_of_your_original_system

and then press the `Tab` key to edit the kernel command line  
where you can append ` debug` (separated with a space).  
This lets the ReaR recovery system startup scripts  
run one by one (you need to press `Enter` to start each one)  
where each one is run with 'set -x' so that it prints the commands  
and their arguments as they are executed.  
Perhaps you can detect something suspicious?

My reasoning behind is:  
In the ReaR recovery system the exact same kernel is run as  
on the original system where "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" was run.  
With `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` you get the exact same kernel  
and all its kernel modules in the ReaR recovery system as on the  
original system where "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" was run.  
When there is no device node for the local disk in the ReaR recovery
system  
on `another physical test box` it means - as far as I can imagine -
that  
the kernel with all its kernel modules from the original system  
does not work on that `another physical test box`.  
Accordingly I think the original system and that
`another physical test box`  
must somehow differ so that the kernel with all its kernel modules from
the  
original system does not work on that `another physical test box`.
