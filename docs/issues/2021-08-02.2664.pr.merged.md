##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2654\#issuecomment-881609874](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2654#issuecomment-881609874)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Running `rear mkrescue` on a system with /tmp on tmpfs. Before, it
    has failed with the message
    `cp: error copying '/tmp/rear.ZLTj0NcVqlr4fiH/tmp/initrd.cgz' to '/tmp/rear.ZLTj0NcVqlr4fiH/tmp/isofs/isolinux/initrd.cgz': No space left on device`.
    After the change it succeeds.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The default temporary directory ( /tmp ) is not suited for ReaR, because
ReaR needs lots of space. file-hierarchy(7) recommends to use /var/tmp
as default for such programs.

If the user sets TMPDIR explicitly, it still takes precedence.

See the discussion in issue \#2654 .

@pcahyna Would it make sense to prevent overwriting the TMPDIR if set

@hpannenb that's what my line is doing. If TMPDIR is set, it overwrites
it with the same value, which should be a no-op (and .there are many
other instances of this idiom in the code).  
Note that I respect TMPDIR even if it is set to an empty value (maybe I
should set it to `/var/tmp` in this case, too).

@pcahyna  
thank you for this pull request!

Did you test that "rear recover" works with  
the new TMPDIR=/var/tmp in default.conf  
and also with some predefined `TMPDIR=/very/special/path/tmp`  
for the user 'root' on the original system where "rear mkrescue" runs?

I wonder if removing
rescue/GNU/Linux/600\_unset\_TMPDIR\_in\_rescue\_conf.sh  
is always fully safe because the comment in that file indicates that
something like  
TMPDIR=/var/tmp may not work during "rear recover":

    # e.g. by defining TMPDIR=/var we would get our BUILD_DIR=/var/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXX
    # However, in rescue we want our BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rear.XXXXXXX ...

But as far as I see from plain looking at the code  
we should have /var/tmp in the recovery system in any case  
because the skel/default/var/tmp directory (with its contents)  
gets included by rescue/default/010\_merge\_skeletons.sh  
so "rear recover" should work with the TMPDIR=/var/tmp default  
and  
I think the user 'root' in the recovery system cannot inherit  
some `TMPDIR=/very/special/path/tmp` setting  
from the user 'root' on the original system  
so "rear recover" should work with our TMPDIR=/var/tmp default even  
if there is `TMPDIR=/very/special/path/tmp` for 'root' on the original
system  
but I am not 100% sure.

No, I will test this.

    e.g. by defining TMPDIR=/var we would get our BUILD_DIR=/var/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXX

This code comment looks wrong. If you define `TMPDIR=/var`, then
`BUILD_DIR` should be `/var/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXX`.

You mean if it is set in the root's dotfiles? Not sure whether ReaR can
inherit them in some way, but if it does, the former code is broken
anyway (the `unset` is too late).

I also think that code comment is a typo. It originated from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/179fd6493883ddbba740fd64e4851ab322bc39ca](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/179fd6493883ddbba740fd64e4851ab322bc39ca)

For me the user 'root' in the recovery system has only

    /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh
    /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/known_hosts
    /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.gitignore
    /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.bash_history

with those contents

    # diff -s ~/.ssh/known_hosts /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/known_hosts
    Files /root/.ssh/known_hosts and /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/known_hosts are identical

    # diff -s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
    Files /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys are identical

    # cat /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/root/.bash_history
    : # no more predefined ReaR entries in the bash history
    systemctl start sshd.service              # start SSH daemon
    ip -4 addr                                # get IPv4 address
    dhcpcd eth0                               # start DHCP client
    nano /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  # disk restore
    nano /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf # disk layout
    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh    # disk restore
    vi /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf   # disk layout
    less /var/log/rear/*                      # log file(s)
    loadkeys -d                               # default keyboard
    rear recover                              # recover system
    : # there are some predefined entries in the bash history

so for me nothing from 'root' on the original system  
gets copied into the recovery system except  
/root/.ssh/known\_hosts and /root/.ssh/authorized\_keys  
(I have `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"` in my etc/rear/local.conf)  
cf. rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh

Of course the user could copy anything via COPY\_AS\_IS  
but then he is responsible what he gets in his recovery system.

I will need to check here on a CentOS7 VM. But I guess it will fit.

Update for @jsmeix : I could successfully clone my Centos7 VM with means
of the current ReaR git version plus the changes made by @pcahyna. My
test setup is NETFS backup included into bootable ISO as follows:

    # ReaR - site.conf

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@] '/var/tmp/*' '/var/backup/*' '/backup/*' )
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null

    ISO_MAX_SIZE=2100

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes
    USE_RESOLV_CONF=no

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='root'

P.S.: The /tmp directory is mounted `noexec,nodev,nosuid`.

FYI by the way regarding  
"inherited stuff from 'root' on the original system could let things in
'rear recover' fail":

Now I remember where that happened:  
It happened during "rear recover" 'finalize' stage (i.e. after the
backup was restored)  
where certain things are run inside the restored system via
`chroot /mnt/local`  
(in particular recreating the initrd and reinstalling the bootloader),  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1345](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1345)

The unfortunate consequence in current ReaR code is that  
we run a COMMAND within `chroot /mnt/local` differently:

With a login shell  
e.g. in finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh

    chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "COMMAND"

With a shell that is no login shell  
e.g. in finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

    chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash -c "COMMAND"

Without a shell  
e.g. in finalize/Fedora/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

    chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT COMMAND

Seems to be something more to clean up in the future...

@jsmeix As mentioned in my

a recovery works for one of my use cases. No objections in that area.

@hpannenb have you also tested setting a custom `TMPDIR` in the program
environment, or just the default setting?

"rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" work well for me both  
with the default with no TMPDIR set by root  
where /var/tmp/rear.XXX is used both for "rear mkbackup" and "rear
recover"  
and also  
with TMPDIR set by root on the original system as

    # mkdir -p /opt/QQQ/rear/tmp
    # export TMPDIR="/opt/QQQ/rear/tmp"

where /opt/QQQ/rear/tmp/rear.XXX is used for "rear mkbackup"  
and the default /var/tmp/rear.XXX is used for "rear recover"  
(i.e. no TMPDIR is set by root in the recovery system).

@hpannenb  
thank you for also testing it.  
It helps a lot to avoid unexpected regressions  
when more than one independent tests are done.

@pcahyna  
thank you for finally solving this long lasting case  
what the right way is to set ReaR's temporary directory  
that goes back at least to the year 2013  
(as far as I found out by looking for TMPDIR in `git log`).

@pcahyna  
I have a question about the exact intention of the command

    export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}"

where you wrote above in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2664\#issuecomment-891624592](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2664#issuecomment-891624592)  
"... should be a no-op ..."

According to how I understand "man bash" that command  
exports TMPDIR in any case (so it is not a no-op because it exports
it)  
and the value of TMPDIR is set to /var/tmp only if TMPDIR is unset  
but not if TMPDIR is null/empty so if TMPDIR is empty it results

    export TMPDIR=""

Is my understanding right?

If yes, I wonder what the intent is to export an empty TMPDIR
variable?  
Is the export in any case perhaps meant to ensure that any TMPDIR
value  
(also when it is the empty value which means "use the system default")  
will be in the environment for all `exec`-ed (and possibly `fork`-ed)
programs?  
I.e. if somehow TMPDIR was set but not yet exported it is then exported?

If this is the intent behind I think it is good to do it this way  
to ensure a set TMPDIR is used by all subsequent programs.

@jsmeix As recognised from
[here](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html) and
man bash there are many ways to substitute. That is what @pcahyna also
mentions in his comment " Note that I respect TMPDIR even if it is set
to an empty value (**maybe I should set it to /var/tmp in this case,
too**)."

It might be useful to always overwrite with a default `/var/tmp` in any
case but the user explicitly decides to use a different path:

I did a small check on this (though I am not a bash expert):

    [root@centos7 ~]# unset TMPDIR
    [root@centos7 ~]# echo "${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}","${TMPDIR:-/var/tmp}","${TMPDIR:=/var/tmp}"
    /var/tmp,/var/tmp,/var/tmp
    [root@centos7 ~]# TMPDIR=
    [root@centos7 ~]# echo "${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}","${TMPDIR:-/var/tmp}","${TMPDIR:=/var/tmp}"
    ,/var/tmp,/var/tmp
    [root@centos7 ~]# TMPDIR=aaaaa
    [root@centos7 ~]# echo "${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}","${TMPDIR:-/var/tmp}","${TMPDIR:=/var/tmp}"
    aaaaa,aaaaa,aaaaa

A general decision to be made what will be the better approach to use.

The "respect TMPDIR even if it is set to an empty value" is my point.

My general "mantra" in particular for ReaR is

    Final power to the user!

In this case "final power to the user" means:  
When TMPDIR is set we assume it is set by the user so ReaR has to obey  
and ReaR must error out if it cannot work with what is set (by its
user)  
but ReaR must not make a final decision against what is set (by its
user).  
In contrast when TMPDIR is not set then ReaR is free to decide.

Acceptable "red line"/mantra for the use of ReaR. So the solution is
kept "as is". 👍

@jsmeix sorry for not having noticed your question earlier. Indeed,
TMPDIR being empty is a corner case and the code does not touch the
value of the variable in this case but merely exports it. But I think
that in practice it does not matter, because the variable can't be set
without being exported - if it is not exported, how would ReaR have
inherited it? The only possibility is that someone has set it in a
configuration file, without exporting it, but I don't think we should
consider this really supported.  
Concerning

> the value of TMPDIR is set to /var/tmp only if TMPDIR is unset but not
> if TMPDIR is null/empty

maybe I should change it to `:-` to set the variable to a default value
both if it is unset or empty. I am not at all sure what is the intended
semantics of TMPDIR set to an empty string, if any.

@pcahyna  
see my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2664\#issuecomment-894117682](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2664#issuecomment-894117682)

I.e. I think when TMPDIR is set (i.e. also when it is set to an empty
value)  
we assume it is set intentionally by the user (also if it is set to an
empty value  
we assume the user wants the semantics of that setting) and ReaR has to
obey  
so I think it is exactly right to let ReaR set TMPDIR only if TMPDIR is
unset.
