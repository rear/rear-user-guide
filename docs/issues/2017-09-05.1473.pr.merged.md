===================================================================================================================

Now each UserInput function call requires  
a specified '-I user\_input\_ID' option and  
the autogenerated user\_input\_ID is gone.

Now the user\_input\_ID option value can and must be  
a valid bash variable name e.g. 'choose\_replacement\_disk'  
so that the user can (if he wants) specify a variable named  
UserInput\_choose\_replacement\_disk  
(i.e. the user\_input\_ID option value with prefix 'UserInput\_')  
where its value is used as automated input.

This way meaningful variable names for automated UserInput  
are implemented in a generic way using plain bash syntax  
without any restriction how the user needs to specify  
his particular automated input settings.

The user can do this statically in his local.conf like  
UserInput\_choose\_replacement\_disk="/dev/sda"  
or via whatever sophisticated scripting magic as he likes  
(e.g. also local.conf is sourced and executed as a script).

@gozora  
I used in your restore/BORG/default/300\_load\_archives.sh

<pre>
UserInput -I BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover ...
</pre>

but I think the user input there is run in a loop where the user  
can add several BorgBackup archives to restore.  
With a fixed UserInput\_BORGBACKUP\_archive\_to\_recover  
variable value only one automated user input is currently possible  
(which is already better than no automated user input before ;-)  
but I think you need to enhance that script so that for each  
UserInput call a different '-I user\_input\_ID' option is used  
e.g. with a trailing number

<pre>
UserInput -I BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover_1 ...
UserInput -I BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover_2 ...
UserInput -I BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover_3 ...
...
</pre>

so that the user can specify as many BorgBackup archives  
as he needs e.g. via

<pre>
UserInput_BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover_1="archive1"
UserInput_BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover_1="archive2"
UserInput_BORGBACKUP_archive_to_recover_1="archive3"
...
</pre>

Intentionally I named the UserInput and my other new functions  
for user input and output as the existing functions for user output  
were named in ReaR so that all functions for user I/O  
are named consistently.  
I cannot clean up all the syntactical mess in ReaR.  
I like to implement actual functionality but it feels as if  
I do most of my time clean up mess that is not from me.  
I wished I could clean up e.g. function names via script  
but function names like 'Print' make that impossible for me  
because I cannot do a semantics testing script because  
one cannot simply replace all 'Print' with 'print' - and 'print'  
(the lowercase word) is a too simple/generic word so that  
it should not be used as a ReaR-specific (function) name.

I think it is misleading to lowercase things that are used  
like "proper names" for example things like  
EFI, USB, SELinux, DRBD, NBKDC.

Perhaps BORGBACKUP should be even correctly  
spelled BorgBackup but somewhere we decided  
to use all-caps for config variables and that is  
wherefrom to took BORGBACKUP.

None of the non-lowercase spellings is my own spelling.  
I carefully tried to use "correct" spelling - whatever "correct"  
might actually mean in each particular case.

Wrong ;-), and thank you for teaching me how comments can be useful ;-)

Reading comment:

    # Display BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_CACHE file content
    # and prompt user for archive to restore.
    # Always ask which archive to restore (even if there is only one).
    # This gives possibility to abort restore if repository doesn't contain
    # desired archive, hence saves some time.

So that loop is there only for user to choose archive to restore or exit
if desired archive is missing, no other fancy functionalities.  
You certainly can break to loop if *BORGBACKUP\_archive\_to\_recover* is
set and continue with recovery, or if you are busy, I can patch it after
your PR is merged ;-).

@gozora  
now even I see the 'break' statement in the while loop  
when one valid BorgBackup archive was specified  
so that the current UserInput call is sufficient.

Sorry @jsmeix I disagree. IMHO mixed spelling is the worst. So within a
single name or ID the spelling should be consistent. Either uppercase
like in global variables or lowercase as in function names.

Good:

-   get\_size\_for\_efi\_boot\_in\_mib
-   SET\_SIZE\_FOR\_EFI\_BOOT\_IN\_MIB

Bad:

-   Set\_size\_for\_EFI\_boot\_in\_MiB
-   ... other mixtures ...

I am also fine with uppercasing all the user input ID names. This is
consistent with our coding style to upper case global variables.

Yes, there is a lot of old mess in ReaR. That is why I believe it to be
better to introduce new stuff following our new guidelines instead of
matching new stuff to the wrong ways of the past.

`Print` is indeed a problem, maybe `user_print` is a good alternative
name. Same for `Error` which might be better named `raise_error` or
`abort_with_error` or such.

@schlomo just to ease my curiosity (really have no preference in naming
and I'm still looking for "perfect" formatting style), why do you think
*Set\_size\_for\_EFI\_boot\_in\_MiB* is bad ?

@gozora the main reason that is bad is that you have an additional
dimension of potential errors. As a user you not only have to get the
words right you on top of that also have to get the spelling right. IMHO
this is a totally needles source of errors that doesn't help anybody.

If we want to force users to always copy-paste those IDs then we should
be using random IDs or UUIDs instead. If we want users to be able to
just type them in then we should use a very consistent and as easy as
possible way of writing those variables.

In shameless self-praise mode I am impressed:  
That thingy seems to "just work great" - at least for me  
(and in any case it is now better than it was ever before ;-)

Because I coded it in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh

<pre>
# When USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS has any 'true' value be liberal in what you accept and
# assume choices[0] 'Confirm mapping' was actually meant which is shown with choice number 1 (not 0) and
# a predefined user input must match the choice number that is shown to the user (not the choice index):
is_true "$USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS" && USER_INPUT_LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS="1"
</pre>

and similar things in  
format/USB/default/200\_check\_usb\_layout.sh  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/150\_include\_drbd\_code.sh  
restore/FDRUPSTREAM/default/270\_selinux\_considerations.sh  
and some kind of opposite logic in  
restore/NBKDC/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
to avoid that a predefined user input variable could cause harm  
because in this case no automated proceed is ever wanted.

I made  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1484](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1484)  
for the further general cleanup changes.

For now I think this pull request is good enough to be merged.

The main issue was that variables for predefined user input  
had not been only with uppercase letters but such variables are  
user config variables and we cannot rename user config variables  
without causing regressions for our users or implememting  
awkward backward-compatibility stuff. Therefore variables  
for predefined user input are now only with uppercase letters.

The names of user input/output functions can be changed  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1484](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1484)
because  
function names are implementation details but no  
user interface (in contrast to config variables).

I prefer consistent function names  
(all user input/output functions in CamelCase)  
over strict compliance with our intended coding style  
only for the new user input/output function names.  
In other words:  
I will either change all user input/output function names  
to get all in compliance with our intended coding style  
or none.

I see, nice trick. I think that this is a pattern that you might want to
add to our coding docs as it is not obvious and it requires the
developer to perceive the user input variable as a multi-value variable
that can be either true or a number from the list. It also forces the
developer to have the first list item as the "true" value.

I think that you should slowly get to merge this so that we can collect
some feedback from users.

About backwards compatible: In general I agree, in particular I like to
understand where the backwards compatibility creates a lot of complexity
in ReaR. In those cases I would like us to discuss a breaking change,
especially if it something where we learned over time that previous
assumptions were less than optimum.

@schlomo  
regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1473\#pullrequestreview-60622391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1473#pullrequestreview-60622391)

I am strongly :-) against positional parameters/arguments  
because I think positional parameters/arguments  
are one of the worst things ever.

I strongly ;-) suggest to prefer named parameters/arguments  
regardless if one is required or optional - except one single  
kind of arguments that are the trailing mass-arguments.  
This way also the unnamed arguments have same meaning  
because all mass-arguments are of one same kind.

If the ID parameter was a positional parameter I could not  
test if a ID parameter was specified at all or if it was valid  
because I could not reliably distinguish a right call like

<pre>
UserInput FOO BAR BAZ
</pre>

where FOO is meant as ID and BAR BAZ are choices  
from a same looking but wrong working call

<pre>
UserInput FOO BAR BAZ
</pre>

where no ID is specified because FOO BAR BAZ are  
all meant as choices.  
In the latter case I would take FOO as ID but because it was  
not meant this way that UserInput call would work but it  
would behave wrong (hopefully someone detects that)  
in contrast to now where I can test the syntax and  
immediately BugError out for syntactically wrong calls.
