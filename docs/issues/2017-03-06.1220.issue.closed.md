#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.00-git201701271258 / 2017-01-27

Hi  
On the rear recover work, on all steps there is an 30 seconds counter.
After this time rear goes to the next step. Can i set this counter
higher or even turn it off to wait for user action? In my case i don't
need to go automatically to the next step.  
Regards  
Rolf

Not for me.  
For me "rear recover" runs fast as lightning.

First and foremost see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

I am not a RHEL user but I don't see something  
obviously wrong in your /etc/rear/site.conf  
except the typo "ISO\_DEFAULT=manuel"  
which should probably be "ISO\_DEFAULT=manual"  
but that only affects the recovery system bootloader  
and not what happens during "rear recover".

I think you need to do  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
to find out what causes the delays during "rear recover".  
The ReaR log file has timestamps so that one should  
see where there is a 30 seconds delay.

FYI:  
At first glance it seems the functions in  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
that work with ISO\_DEFAULT are not well  
prepared for unsupported ISO\_DEFAULT values  
because I only find this setting

<pre>
        # If ISO_DEFAULT is not set, set it to default 'boothd'
        if [ -z "$ISO_DEFAULT" ]; then
                ISO_DEFAULT="boothd"
        fi
</pre>

but no fallback setting in case of  
unsupported ISO\_DEFAULT values.

Hi

Hello @RolfWeilen,

Maybe try to set `WAIT_SECS=0` in your */etc/rear/local.conf*

Hi  
thanks for the info, but it does not work. If i wait more the 30 sec,
rear goes to next step and finaly will start the restore.

add line in /etc/rear/site.conf  
WAIT\_SECS=0

Enter date/time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) or press ENTER \[30 secs\]:
Skipping Point-In-Time Restore, will restore most recent data.

The TSM Server reports the following for this node:  
\# Last Incr Date Type File Space Name  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1 07-03-2017 13:54:40 XFS /  
2 07-03-2017 13:54:05 XFS /app/lib  
3 07-03-2017 13:54:40 XFS /boot  
4 07-03-2017 13:54:41 UNKNOWN /dev  
5 07-03-2017 13:54:40 XFS /home  
6 07-03-2017 13:54:41 XFS /usr/local  
7 07-03-2017 13:54:44 XFS /var/log  
8 07-03-2017 13:54:44 XFS /var/log/suva  
Please enter the numbers of the filespaces we should restore.  
Pay attention to enter the filesystems in the correct order  
(like restore / before /var/log) !  
(default: 1 2 3 5 6 7 8): \[30 secs\] We will now restore the following
filesystems:  
/  
/app/lib  
/boot  
/home  
/usr/local  
/var/log  
/var/log/suva  
Is this selection correct ? (Y|n) \[30 secs\]

I think I cannot help further here  
because I know nothing at all about TSM  
(or any other third-party backup solution).

Hi  
This has nothing to with tsm. I found the code in the scripts.  
Set to 0 means 30. I try to increase the value to higher as 30. A value
to wait for user interaction does not exist. So i will set the
WAIT\_SECS=999999.

This value is then used in the needed tsm restore scripts.  
./verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
./verify/TSM/default/400\_verify\_tsm.sh

./verify/default/040\_validate\_variables.sh  
if \[\[ ! -z "$WAIT\_SECS" \]\]; then  
WAIT\_SECS=$( is\_numeric $WAIT\_SECS ) \# if 0 then bsize was not
numeric  
\[\[ $WAIT\_SECS -eq 0 \]\] && WAIT\_SECS=30  
WAIT\_SECS=30

Hi  
Thanks the parameter WAIT\_SECS works! No i can wait for 1 year for an
user interaction.  
TSM restores by default the latest backup data. Alternatively you can
specify  
a different date and time to enable Point-In-Time Restore. Press ENTER
to  
use the most recent available backup  
Enter date/time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) or press ENTER \[31104000 secs\]:

Thank you for your help  
regards  
Rolf
