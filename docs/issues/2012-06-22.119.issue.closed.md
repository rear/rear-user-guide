Hello,  
I'm trying to backup linux os using USB memory stick.  
But I am having the following problem. Please help me out for this
matter.

    Please check the archive and see '/tmp/rear-chuck.log' for more information.

    Since errors are oftenly related to files that cannot be saved by
    tar, we will continue the mkbackup process. However, you MUST
    verify the backup yourself before trusting it !

There are known problems with backup to USB in rear 1.13.0 which have
been fixed (on LinuxTag).

Could you please test with the latest git version? You can run it from
checkout these days.

Where can I have it? Please let me know.

You can fetch it with `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git`. This
will copy it into a directory `rear`

Now you can edit `etc/rear/local.conf` in that directory. Now run
`sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup` from inside the checkout.

@jhoekx We should add that information on the Development page on the
website. And in a Troubleshoot section in the future. (Maybe part of the
FAQ ?)

Hello,  
Actually, I am using RHEL version 4 and I have no idea about "git".  
Please let me grab the concept of the "git".

You can learn more about git by using the help here at github.

We are working on getting real snapshot packages for RHEL 4 working
again.

@cwnam14 I wanted to reproduce your problem using the version from the
master branch, however you did not share the configuration you were
using. Can you post this here (or on Gist) ? Thanks !

@cwnam14 We also improved that default tar output when errors occur, to
assist in troubleshooting the problem. I would be interested to learn if
that is useful for you as well.

This means that the archiving process ended prematurely, or did  
not even start. As a result it is unlikely you can recover this  
system properly. Relax-and-Recover is therefore aborting execution.  
Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-chuck.log for details

Thank you for your help.

@dagwieers That option was only introduced in tar 1.23. We should add a
version check for it.

@jhoekx Where would you add the tar features checking ? I think we need
to have a separate location in our tree where all feature testing is
concentrated. In this case, tar is used for copying files as well. I
prefer to not add it to the 50\_make\_backup.sh... (see mail from @gdha
wrt. b0278f2)

Hello Guys,  
Let me have the clue for this matter.  
Thx,

In this case, we only need the version check in 50\_make\_backup. It's
the only place where the warning is used. Just add it over there.

@cwnam14 The problem is the option `--warning=no-xdev`, that option only
exists in the latest version of tar and you are using an older version.
If you remove that option from
*/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh*, the problem
is solved.

If you partition the disk manually, does it allow you to store more than
100M of data on it? There are some USB disks that report incorrect sizes
or don't have the specified amount of flash.

Maybe trying with another USB device will solve the issue.

Ok, I found the problem.

We use `parted` to format the usb device. On RHEL 4 `parted` doesn't
support the 100% option we're using to format to the end of the disk.

Do you have a RHEL 5 or newer to format the disk?

Otherwise you will have to format the disk yourself and make sure the
partition spans the complete disk. Once you did that, run these
commands:

    parted -s /dev/sda set 1 boot on
    mkfs.ext3 -L REAR-000 /dev/sda1
    tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 -o acl,journal_data,journal_data_ordered /dev/sda1

You should be able to continue the restore by choosing option 4 and then
remove the line containing '/dev/hda4 on'

Can you post `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` and
`parted -s /dev/hda p` so we can debug why that code was generated?

    part /dev/hda 1024 10487232000 primary  /dev/hda4

to

And then try `rear recover` again.

I will need to set up a test VM with RHEL 4 and extended partitions.

Check `/var/log/rear/rear-chuck.log`.

If there's nothing suspicious, cancel this run and restart rear with

    # rear -D recover

Now the log will definitely print where it's wrong.

1.  I've removed USB drive and rebooted my system, but it doesn't come
    up at all

What should I do now?  
Please give me a direction.  
Thanks

That looks pretty good already.

Where does it stop when rebooting? Do you see grub?

My system doesn't start at all. On screen of my monitor, I can only see
the cursor blinking.  
I can't see grub.

So we will try to figure out why grub was not installed.

-   Reboot into the rescue system.
-   mount /, /usr and /var in /mnt/local
-   bind mount /dev, /sys and /proc in /mnt/local
-   chroot /bin/bash /mnt/local
-   grub
-   root (hd0, 0)

-   setup

Can you print out what that last command says?

Any advice for this matter?

It should be

I'v got the below;

Ok. That means the grub bootloader was installed correctly.

Can you print the output of /boot/grub/menu.lst?

That looks good. I don't understand why it wouldn't boot.

Do you have any other disks in the system?

I've got 2 disks in my system which have a windows OS and Linux OS, so
that I am sure I am booting from the correct disk.

On booting the system in BIOS, I choose the booting OS.  
If I want to change it. I need to restart my system.
