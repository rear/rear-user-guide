Would it be feasible to get ReaR v2.6 ready by the end of May 2020?

-   \[x\] Close, fix or shift current ReaR v2.6 labelled issues.
-   \[x\] Have the Release Notes ready
-   \[x\] Fill up the Test Matrix ReaR v2.6
-   \[x\] Any other topic (just add it here)

The currently only open issues with milestone ReaR 2.6 are  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1766](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1766)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1957](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1957)

I think it would be OK when the first one is postponed to ReaR 2.7  
but the second one can and should be cleaned up for ReaR 2.6.

@jsmeix You were updating the release notes so far. I will review these
tomorrow.  
If possible add something to the Test Matrix 2.6.

@rear/contributors Can we agree that on June 1st we will not add new
feature to the current ReaR v2.6 release candidate. Only serious bug
fixes will be applied, otherwise, we cannot test properly.

So far I added `SLES 11 SP 4` and  
`SLES 12 SP 5 with default btrfs structure` and  
`SLES 15 SP 1 with default btrfs structure` to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6)

As time permits I would like to also add SLE 12 and 15 with default LVM
cases  
i.e. with what comes out of YaST's "LVM-based Proposal" by default.

@jsmeix Thank you for the excellent release notes. Extremely detailed
and clear - the best ever - thanks Johannes for your hard work.

I will try to test fedora 32 this week so we can add it to the Matrix.

Shall we try to get ReaR 2.6 released by mid June?

You are welcome!

ReaR 2.6 release mid June is OK for me.

@OliverO2  
I have a question regarding what Ubuntu versions could be  
listed as supported by the upcoming ReaR 2.6 release.

In your recent pull requests  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2376](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2376)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2363](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2363)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2361](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2361)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2350](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2350)  
you wrote  
`How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS`  
and in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2166](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2166)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2131](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2131)
you wrote  
`Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS` and `Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS`  
so it seems Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is well tested.

The last of your pull requests that contains `Ubuntu 16.04` is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2119](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2119)  
which is just before the ReaR 2.5 release  
so it seems ReaR 2.6 was no longer tested with Ubuntu 16.04.

Currently we would still list `Ubuntu 16` as supported in the  
ReaR 2.6 release notes, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/bab64c0a9dc14fd24962fd7326422ade390aa021](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/bab64c0a9dc14fd24962fd7326422ade390aa021)

@jsmeix  
My records show that the last system was migrated from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
to 18.04 LTS in June 2019. Since then, all ReaR tests on my side were
done on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS only. I have no indication about ReaR becoming
incompatible with Ubuntu 16.04, so I would assume that it still works.

What I was thinking about was doing a small test on Ubuntu's current
20.04 LTS release. Would that be of interest for ReaR's 2.6 release?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2020-06-02 12:19](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368#issuecomment-637504619):

@OliverO2  
even a small "smoke test" on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS would be much
appreciated  
because - as far as I know - we do not yet have any tests there.

I could add your test overview to our "Test Matrix rear 2.6"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6)

Many thanks in advance!

@jsmeix  
OK, I'll do those Ubuntu tests, expecting to complete them this week,
which should be compatible with your envisioned mid June release. I'll
report results in this issue. Thanks for coordinating!

I noticed that the SELinux relabeling process is working too hard. There
is no need to relabel /sys directories IMHO? This what I saw while
rebooting a Fedora 32 test VM

I have now tested a complete mkrescue/recover cycle on Ubuntu 20.04.
Everything worked out of the box except that DHCP was not enabled on the
rescue system. So I added a separate Network Manager auto-detection. PR
upcoming.

I added test "SLES 15 SP 1 with default LVM and LUKS encryption and
btrfs structure" to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6)  
This is the last test I liked to do and all tests "just worked" for me  
so currently all looks fine to me with ReaR 2.6.

@gdha  
it seems doc/rear.8 is not updated  
to what there is in doc/rear.8.adoc  
because doc/rear.8.adoc mentiones  
e.g. "Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM)"  
which is not in doc/rear.8 (as far as I see).

@jsmeix I forgot the last **git push** yesterday evening. The man page
is in fact not the source itself, it is `rear.8.adoc` and is
automatically build during package creation. I never have been a fan of
`rear.8` being pushed into the master source tree (as it is not the
source). And, we already had a few times in the past that people edit
the man page itself instead of the source `rear.8.adoc` file.

After sleeping over it my current idea how to deal  
with the duplicated man page source files is:

On the one had there must not be duplicated source files  
which means `doc/rear.8` cannot stay as is.

On the other hand the ReaR sources should contain a man page  
(e.g. to also have a man page in a plain git source checkout)  
which means a `doc/rear.8` source file needs to be there.

I think the way out of this dilemma is to have a `doc/rear.8` source
file  
that contains only a small static man page text that points the user  
to the actual man page text in the `doc/rear.8.adoc` file.

This way the `doc/rear.8` source file could be still overwritten and  
replaced with full man page content generated from `doc/rear.8.adoc`  
by package making tools.

so that I close it hereby.
