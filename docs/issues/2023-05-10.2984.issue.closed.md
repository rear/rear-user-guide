Currently the disk creation loop tries forever to re-run:  
![image](https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/101384/70b4d094-9274-47a0-b9c2-64dcd38b60e9)

I'd like to suggest giving this a failure counter, so that it will abort
if it is not successful after 3 attempts. This would help a lot with
unattended recoveries and \#2979 - even without adding a new parameter
to `rear`.

As I don't know if there are indeed use cases where hammering the system
with the same re-creation script would be successful I want to discuss
this change here first.

Specifically the code in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/db9302e8b37890bfcf4debf443da38652f147116/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh\#L201-L202](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/db9302e8b37890bfcf4debf443da38652f147116/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh#L201-L202)
should be changed to have a counter instead of `while true; do` and the
default answer of "re-run disk creation".

Another approach would be changing the default choice here to Abort
instead of trying again.

Can somebody please provide more context on the decision to just retry
the disk creation?

I think the current endless retries are there  
to stay backward compatible with how it behaved before, see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e5d7f694212912d958168ec1238ed1bae25a50d2](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e5d7f694212912d958168ec1238ed1bae25a50d2)

What you need to do for an unattended use case is  
to prepare for it, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1534768715](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1534768715)

In this particular case set USER\_INPUT\_LAYOUT\_CODE\_RUN
appropriately,  
see the section about "UserInput function default behaviour"  
in default.conf

@schlomo  
regardless that now via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979)  
a generic way is implemented (which is good)  
I would still like to understand what the reason is  
why it is not possible (not at all or not in practice)  
to prepare for an unattended use case via appropriate  
settings of some USER\_INPUT\_... config variables  
at least for a specific unattended use case?

E.g. in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1535350129](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1535350129)  
I read  
"the user must know all possible inputs before".  
This is true but for a specific unattended use case  
it should be possible with reasonable effort to find out  
which UserInput calls are relevant (e.g. run it as a test  
and note what UserInput calls happened).

And in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1542204564](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1542204564)  
I read  
"--non-interactive flag ... without changing the configuration files".  
But one can already change configuration values via a  
command line option by using e.g. '-C unattended.conf'  
where etc/rear/unattended.conf contains configuration values  
as needed for a specific unattended use case.

In the end what I like to understand is the reason why  
it is not possible to get things working as needed  
with what ReaR provides currently?  
At least a test with current ReaR for a specific use case  
and when that fails a report what had failed.  
Was such a test done and if yes what was the result?

Bottom line:  
Regardless that I agree with the implementation method in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979\#issuecomment-1542195362](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979#issuecomment-1542195362)  
I still do not understand the reason behind why  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2979)  
is a "must have".
