Apparently after changes made to /lib into /usr/lib on Fedora 17 systemd
seems to be broken. I could fix most systemd stuff after moving the /lib
to /usr/lib in our skel structure. However, it still blocks at

    [FAILED] Failed to start Rear run-syslog script.
                    See 'systemctl status rsyslog.service' for details.

However, nothing happens after this point - no prompt. A bit more
debugging is required...

commited changes to the skel tree (mv /lib to /usr/lib). Need some more
testing as Jeroen changed
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/39\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

it works again - /usr/lib/systemd is the main track to use.

Gratien, wouldn't it be useful to link /lib/systemd to /usr/lib/systemd
to not break previous fedora versions?

/lib is linked to /usr/lib - so that is covered
