I would like to clarify here via comment  
WHY it is "the right thing" that  
systemd-detect-virt grub2-editenv grubby  
are added to the PROGS array  
and not to the REQUIRED\_PROGS array  
regardless that the comments in the code

    # In some cases to detect an USB device properly we need:
    systemd-detect-virt
    # In case we want to recreate initial ramdisks it is good to have:
    grub2-editenv
    grubby

indicate that REQUIRED\_PROGS might be even better?

I think the PROGS array is exactly right here because  
we can sufficiently safely assume that on systems where  
systemd-detect-virt is needed to detect an USB device properly  
systemd-detect-virt is installed  
and same argument for grub2-editenv and grubby:  
On systems where grub2-editenv and/or grubby are needed  
to recreate the initial ramdisk, we can sufficiently safely  
assume that there grub2-editenv and/or grubby are installed.

So using the PROGS array is exactly right because  
this way things behave backward compatible on systems  
where systemd-detect-virt grub2-editenv grubby do not exist,  
e.g. on my openSUSE Leap 15.5 system where grubby is not installed:

    # for p in systemd-detect-virt grub2-editenv grubby ; do type -a $p ; done
    systemd-detect-virt is /usr/bin/systemd-detect-virt
    grub2-editenv is /usr/bin/grub2-editenv
    -bash: type: grubby: not found

    # rpm -qf /usr/bin/systemd-detect-virt
    systemd-249.17-150400.8.43.1.x86_64

    # rpm -qf /usr/bin/grub2-editenv
    grub2-2.06-150500.29.34.2.x86_64

    # zypper search grubby

It is right to use `PROGS` and not `REQUIRED_PROGS` - GRUB2 is not the
only bootloader and we still support non-systemd distros to some extent.
`grubby` is not even a standard tool packaged with GRUB2, it is a
separate tool, not always available.

However, adding GRUB tools here does not seem right, all other GRUB
tools get added in
`usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/300_include_grub_tools.sh`. Would you
agree to moving the `grub2-editenv` line and perhaps the `grubby` line
there?

By the way, @gdha , can you please share details of your experiments and
how/where have you recreated initial ramdisks? I am curious why you have
needed to include anything more for this, because ramdisk recreation
should run in the recreated system (under `chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT`), and
I checked the sources that this is indeed happening, and all the tools
are available there, even if they are not in in the ReaR rescue ramdisk.
Even Grubby should be IMO used only in the chroot and not in the ReaR
rescue ramdisk.
