-   Brief description of the issue  
    After rear recover, I could not find the EFI boot entry for
    Tumbleweed.
-   Work-around, if any  
    Run Tumbleweed installation media using upgrade to have the
    bootloader installed correctly. Part of the rear recover log are:

@jsmeix I think you are in the best position to have this checked
internally at SuSe?  
@ryan-chow Can you confirm that everything was restored correctly, and
that only the efibootmgr command failed?

I believe the restore is good. After running the upgrade with the
installation media, it works.

I attempt a few backup and recover today. The same site.conf did not
restore everything correctly. /opt/\* and /usr/local/\* were backup but
not restored. Applications compiled from source were not restored as
well as google-chrome rpm installation.

@ryan-chow If you define the following
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" 'fs:/var/tmp' 'fs:/srv' 'fs:/var/lib/pgsql' 'fs:/var/spool' 'fs:/var/lib/libvirt/images' 'fs:/var/opt' 'fs:/tmp' 'fs:/.snapshots' 'fs:/var/lib/named' 'fs:/var/log' 'fs:/boot/grub2/i386-pc' 'fs:/var/lib/mariadb' 'fs:/var/crash' 'fs:/var/lib/mailman' 'fs:/opt' 'fs:/usr/local' 'fs:/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi' 'fs:/var/lib/mysql' 'fs:/var/cache' )`
then you explicitly asked for **not** restoring `/opt/` and `/usr/local`
directories (and everything below it).

Regarding "rear recover" log message

efibootmgr: EFI variables are not supported on this system.
2016-06-17 16:05:37 Problem occurred with creating an efibootmgr entry
</pre>

I can currently not really help because basically I have  
no knowledge in (U)EFI and tools like efibootmgr.

By dumb Googling for  
"efibootmgr: EFI variables are not supported on this system"  
I found  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/91620/arch-linux-grub-install-efi-variables-are-not-supported-on-this-system](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/91620/arch-linux-grub-install-efi-variables-are-not-supported-on-this-system)  
that reads (excerpt):

<pre>
The problem was simply that the efivars kernel module
was not loaded.
</pre>

which matches what "man efibootmgr" tells  
(except on my Leap 42.1 machine):

<pre>
Note: efibootmgr requires that the kernel support access to
EFI non-volatile variables (through /proc/efi/vars on 2.4 kernels,
/sys/firmware/efi/vars on 2.6 kernels).
modprobe efivars
should do the trick.
</pre>

@ryan-chow  
in the rear recovery system  
is the efivars kernel module loaded  
and if not does it help to do  
"modprobe efivars"  
before you run "rear recover"?

As far as I see in the rear code it should do "modprobe efivars"  
usually automatically but perhaps something is unusual on  
Tumbleweed?

@gdha  
as far as I see "modprobe efivars" is only called in  
prep/default/32\_include\_uefi\_env.sh  
which is run during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
but  
during "rear recover" it seems there is no script run  
where "modprobe efivars" is done.

Accordingly it seems "modprobe efivars" could be  
really missing during "rear recover"?

Hi,

Did you try setting USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1 in /etc/rear/local.conf?  
Usually, we set this option on all UEFI based systems.

@didacog The variable `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=` is automatically set by
rear on UEFI systems.  
@jsmeix I am not aware of the fact that `modprobe efivars` is required
during recovery?  
If @ryan-chow could test it out then we are sure of it...

@gdha true, I had problems without forcing it on previous versions of
rear :P (rear 1.15 I think).  
This is the reason I suggested to force it, but this issue is on rear
1.18.

@gdha @jsmeix removal of EXCLUDE\_RECREATE for btrfs subvolumes corrects
my restore problem.  
@didacog USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1 did not help in ebibootmgr entry
creation.  
@jsmeix 'modprobe efivars' did not do the trick too.

@gdha @jsmeix efibootmgr demonstrated the same problem on restoring
Fedora 24 (LVM default) but could boot with no repair work. The recoverd
system has two entries from EFI boot menu, i.e. Fedora and UEFI OS, and
they are identiical. Restoring Tumbleweed (LVM default without separate
/boot partition) was the same as on btrfs, which could be boot after
upgrade with the installation media. I believe 23\_run\_efibootmgr.sh
could be the problem.

@ryan-chow is there still an issue? Or are we good to close this case?

@gdha : Thank you for asking. I give up already since Jun 29. Please
close the case.
