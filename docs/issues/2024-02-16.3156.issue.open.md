We have in conf/GNU/Linux.conf

    COPY_AS_IS+=( ... /etc/dracut.conf /etc/dracut.conf.d /usr/lib/dracut ... )

It was added via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2d5445466d389b331c9ad1a984c66354415f21ea](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2d5445466d389b331c9ad1a984c66354415f21ea)  
which mentiones
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/233](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/233)  
but that does not explain anything about dracut  
(or I am blind and don't see the obvious)?

In current GitHub master code

    find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'dracut'

finds only rescue/GNU/Linux/220\_load\_modules\_from\_initrd.sh

    if test -s /etc/dracut.conf ; then
        MODULES_LOAD+=(
            $(
                add_drivers=
                source /etc/dracut.conf
                for s in /etc/dracut.conf.d/*.conf ; do
                    source $s
                done
                echo $add_drivers
            )
        )
    fi

where /etc/dracut.conf and /etc/dracut.conf.d  
are used on the original system.

But I fail to see where anything of  
/etc/dracut.conf /etc/dracut.conf.d /usr/lib/dracut  
is needed in the recovery system.

So I am wondering why we need dracut stuff in the recovery system?

why we need dracut stuff in the recovery system?
