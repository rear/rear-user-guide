-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Skip the assert\_ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT function  
when there is no usable ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT set  
so the user could specify `ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=0`  
or `ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT="no"` in his etc/rear/local.conf  
if he wants to skip the ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT test.

With my latest commits things work well for me.  
I will sleep over it and if no further things appear for me  
and if there are no objections from @rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.
