-   How was this pull request tested? Manually

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The current evaluation of the scripts is through `eval ${SCRIPT[@]}`
which has many drawbacks, in particular when using array variables, each
line must be semi-colon terminated or else the rest will be skipped,
e.g.

    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( 'multipathd' )
    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT+=( 'sleep 10' )

resulted in executing `multipathd sleep 10` instead of expected
`multipathd` then `sleep 10`.

This enhancement evaluates the scripts item by item, which is more
bulletproof and still supports having the script specified as a string
variable.

Hi @rmetrich, your change looks logical, but is contrary to the
documented intent. The comment in `default.conf` (and comments there
really serve as user documentation, because only very basic variables
are documented in the user docs and most of variables are documented
only in `default.conf`) says:
`NOTE: The scripts can be defined as an array to better handly spaces in parameters.`
So the intent of having them as arrays is not to support multiple
independent scripts to be evaluated separately, but to have only one
script that is better structured (command and arguments), like (perverse
example) `(echo 'rm -rf /')` that is intended to print `rm -rf /` but
after your change prints nothing and executes `rm -rf /`. That's
probably why the variables are called `PRE`/`POST_`XXX`_SCRIPT` and not
`_SCRIPTS` (note the singular). After your change, they would be better
called `PRE`/`POST_`XXX`_SCRIPTS`.  
Note that I do not endorse the original intent. To me it seems
misguided: if one wants to provide commands as shell arrays in order to
protect arguments from shell processing like whitespace splitting, fine,
but then one should not feed them to `eval`. The problem is, as the man
page of the Almquist shell succinctly states, "`eval string ...`
Concatenate all the arguments with spaces. Then re-parse and execute the
command.", specifically, the "re-parse" part. If one tries to provide a
list of arguments with embedded spaces to `eval` as a shell array, like
`CMD=(ls 'a filename with spaces'); eval "${CMD[@]}"`, then the
`"${CMD[@]}"` expansion will work properly, but `eval` will then
re-split the resulting arguments on whitespace, turning them into
`"ls" "a" "filename" "with" "spaces"` instead of the intended
`"ls" "a filename with spaces"`. Sure, one can quote the string inside,
like `CMD=(ls '"a filename with spaces"')`, but then one does not need
the bash array at all, because `CMD='ls "a filename with spaces"'` is
exactly equivalent and certainly simpler.

One has IMO basically two options how to use bash arrays to specify
commands:

1.  use them to provide multiple inline scripts, each of the scripts
    will be evaluated separately and can use various shell
    metacharacters, like quotes. If one wants to provide arguments with
    spaces to some commands in the scripts, one has to use quotes inside
    the scripts, like in any other shell command (and another level of
    quotes around the whole script).
2.  use them to provide a command with arguments. The arguments can
    contain whitespace and do not need to contain quotes (they will need
    quoting only when constructing the array). But then one can not use
    `eval`, thus one is prevented from using various special shell
    constructs.

This PR changes the interpretation of the variables to 1. while the
original intent seems to have been 2. (but due to the use of `eval` it
does not work as probably intended).

What about introducing new variables called `PRE`/`POST_`xxx`_SCRIPTS`
and letting the old variables as they are (and remove them in the next
major version)?

Of course, the scripts that one provide in the arrays are not really
independent because they run in the same shell, not in a subshell. So
they could be considered only multiple commands of one script (one can
pass variables from one to a subsequent one, for example). Still, I
think that calling the variables `_SCRIPTS` instead of `_SCRIPT`
expresses better the intent and the difference from the former behavior.
Or maybe `_COMMADS` would be even better?

Right, I completely missed this. Having new variables seems indeed
better.

Regarding ...\_COMMANDS:  
We have currently in default.conf  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
ZYPPER\_NETWORK\_SETUP\_COMMANDS  
YUM\_NETWORK\_SETUP\_COMMANDS

The variable name ...\_SCRIPT could be misleading because it looks  
as if it means the filename of a script and not the commands of a
script.  
A variable name ...\_SCRIPTS is misleading because it certainly  
means filenames of scripts and not commands of a single script.

@rmetrich by the way I am curious about the original motivation: doesn't

recall testing ReaR with multipath and it seemed to work.

Yes it does. This is just an example where I had to implement this on
Red Hat's 2.4 rear which was not always starting multipathd.  
I'm changing this seems it may be confusing in the end and the admin may
believe multipathd needs to be started manually.

Regarding POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT as exit task I had written:

I guess the intent behind is that with a simple

PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT=( 'database stop' )  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT=( 'database start' )

after a "rear mkbackup" error during backup  
database start is run as exit task.

I wonder if it is the by users usually expected behaviour  
when they had a "rear mkbackup" error during backup.  
Why automatically restarting the database when the backup had failed?  
Perhaps an up-to-date backup is intended before restarting the database?

Also the implementation runs all commands in POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
as exit task after a "rear mkbackup" error during backup  
and I think it is likely not right to "just run" all those commands.

From my current point of view I would not implement that  
oversophisticated looking automated exit task stuff  
also for the new ...\_COMMANDS arrays  
to keep things more safe and simple.

Regarding the code in backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh

    for command in "${POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
        AddExitTask "$command"
    done

I had written:

I still do not like it when all POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS  
get hardcoded added as exit tasks.

...

Because I like to provide "final power to the user"  
I think it must be possible for the user to specify  
which one of his POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS  
he also wants to run in case of error exit during backup.

My immediate idea is that  
when one element in POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS  
has the special value `add_next_as_exit_task`  
the next element in POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS  
gets added as exit task.

So I would like to propose (totally untested) code like

    add_as_exit_task="no"
    for command in "${POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS[@]}" ; do
        if test "$command" = "add_next_as_exit_task" ; then
            add_as_exit_task="yes"
            continue
        fi
        is_true $add_as_exit_task || continue
        AddExitTask "$command"
        add_as_exit_task="no"
    done

and matching code in backup/default/990\_post\_backup\_script.sh  
like

    exists_as_exit_task="no"
    for command in "${POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
        if test "$command" = "add_next_as_exit_task" ; then
            exists_as_exit_task="yes"
            continue
        fi
        if is_true $exists_as_exit_task ; then
            RemoveExitTask "$command"
            exists_as_exit_task="no"
        fi
        Log "Running POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS: '$command'"
        eval "$command"
    done

Hi Johannes,  
I think it makes sense to execute POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT even on backup
failure, this in order to put the system is a stable state again.  
This one would indeed use this for databases to avoid having corruptions
in the database if not shut down while creating the backup.

And I don't see why there would be a matching POST\_BACKUP\_COMMAND for
a given PRE\_BACKUP\_COMMAND.  
So I think it's up to the user to provide some error-safe commands.

It is. It was just moved to line 13-15 because where it was originally
wasn't making sense, specially if there was no POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.

I think almost all usual users assume their commands  
that are intented to run after backup was made  
run under the implicit precondition  
that the backup has been actually (sucessfully) made.

So I would not expect usual users to provide commands  
that are safe to be run after it failed to make the backup.

And what should users specify who do not want their commands  
(or some of their commands) to be run after it failed to make the
backup?

As far as I see the whole automated adding more than one single
command  
as exit task works plain wrong because

    AddExitTask "COMMAND1"
    AddExitTask "COMMAND2"

will run COMMAND2 before COMMAND1 because AddExitTask prepends,  
see the function AddExitTask() in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
so

    AddExitTask "database start"
    AddExitTask "use database"

will let 'use database' just fail because it is run before 'database
start'.

As a test I added at the beginning of
init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh

    AddExitTask "echo 'first' >>/tmp/rear_exit_tasks"
    AddExitTask "echo 'second' >>/tmp/rear_exit_tasks"
    AddExitTask "echo 'third' >>/tmp/rear_exit_tasks"

Indeed. Note that the original form
`AddExitTask "${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"` worked well, because if you
give multiple tasks to one `AddExitTask` command, it will add them in
sequence, rather than in reverse.

@rmetrich @pcahyna  
I would like to progress here.

My proposal:

Either  
do not call AddExitTask for any POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS  
which means we cannot deprecate POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT

Or  
have some more sophisticated code where the user can specify  
what in POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS should be added as exit tasks  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735\#issuecomment-1011070624](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issuecomment-1011070624)  
plus explanatory documentation in default.conf that

    POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS=( "add_next_as_exit_task" "database start"
                           "add_next_as_exit_task" "use database" )

won't work and

    POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS=( "add_next_as_exit_task" "database start ; use database" )

must be used instead which should work because

    # cmds=( "echo first ; echo second" )

    # ( set -x ; for cmd in "${cmds[@]}" ; do eval "$cmd" ; done )
    + for cmd in "${cmds[@]}"
    + eval 'echo first ; echo second'
    ++ echo first
    first
    ++ echo second
    second

but what "man bash" reads seems to contradict

    control operator
      A token that performs a control function.
      It is one of the following symbols:
      || & && ; ;; ;& ;;& ( ) | |& <newline>
    ...
    Simple Commands
      A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments
      followed by blank-separated words and redirections,
      and terminated by a control operator.
    ...
    eval [arg ...]
      The args are read and concatenated together into a single command.
      This command is then read and executed by the shell

so I wonder what `eval 'echo first ; echo second'` actually does  
because the one argument `echo first ; echo second`  
is not a single (simpe) command.  
The confusion happens because "man bash" uses the  
plain word "command" with unclear meaning - i.e. whether  
a "simple command" or a "compound command" is meant.

Hi @rmetrich , I have noticed an asymmetry in these variables.
`PRE_BACKUP_COMMANDS` does not seem to execute at the beginning of the
ReaR run, but before the backup of data gets created (the rescue image
with the disk layout has been created already): "Call this before
Relax-and-Recover starts to do anything in the mkbackup/mkbackuponly
workflow." But `PRE_RECOVERY_COMMANDS` runs at the very beginning of the
ReaR run: "You have the rescue system but nothing else". Would it make
sense to introduce `PRE_RESTORE_COMMANDS` that would be symmetrical with
`PRE_BACKUP_COMMANDS` and run just before the backup is restored? (It
could be used for custom commands that need to make the backup archive
accessible. For example, mount a disk with the archive, if one uses a
`file://` URL.)

@jsmeix returning to this old topic, sorry for the delay. I must say, I
don't like this idea, or generally the idea of using such special values
in lists (I know that there is `all_modules`, but I would prefer to
avoid more such cases). If there is really a need for running some
commands only when the backup has been successful, I see two cleaner
options:

1.  introduce another variable, like `POST_SUCCESSFUL_BACKUP_COMMANDS`
2.  in the command, let the user test the `EXIT_CODE` variable, like
    this: `"(( EXIT_CODE )) || command"`

Users can do the latter already.  
I am not sure if there is much demand for this, though. @rmetrich
provided an example where you want to execute the commands regardless of
the backup status (one may want to halt some service temporarily during
the backup, but one does not want to leave it halted, even if the backup
fails). I can imagine other use cases: one might want to enable the
access to the storage where the backup is to be located in
`PRE_BACKUP_COMMANDS` and disable it in `POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS`, or one
might want to take some kind of snapshot before the backup and back up
the snapshot. In all those cases, it is needed to run the appropriate
cleanup command among `POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS` regardless of the success
of the backup job (you don't want the snapshot to linger and take space,
nor the backup storage being left mounted and thus vulnerable to
accidental damage). Have there been any complaints about the current
behavior, or do you have a concrete use case in mind that requires this
change? If such cases are sufficiently rare, one might leave them to be
covered by explicit testing of `EXIT_CODE` in the command by those who
need them.

@pcahyna  
I do not understand how it should work what you wrote:  
"let the user test the EXIT\_CODE variable ... Users can do the latter
already"

I think the EXIT\_CODE variable is not set when those  
PRE\_RECOVERY/POST\_RECOVERY/PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP  
scripts are run - at least as far as I see according to what

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'EXIT_CODE'

shows me.

Do you perhaps mean "let the user test the EXIT\_CODE variable"  
as an enhancement that the EXIT\_CODE variable should be set  
when those scripts (or commands) are run?

Furthermore - as far as I see - in current master code  
it seems those scripts (or commands) are "just run"  
without any kind of error handling which is against  
"Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

In general I have no personal experience with  
PRE\_RECOVERY/POST\_RECOVERY/PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP  
because I do not use them.  
I have no user or customer reports related to them.

I guess in most cases users do not use them but instead they call  
the right perparation commands outside of ReaR before they call `rear`  
and the right cleanup commands outside of ReaR after `rear` finished  
in particular for PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP scripts  
because those are called during "rear mkbackup"  
via backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh  
and backup/default/990\_post\_backup\_script.sh  
which only happens for ReaR internal backup methods  
so all users with third-party backup methods  
cannot use PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP  
but must use something outside of ReaR.

In contrast PRE\_RECOVERY/POST\_RECOVERY  
could be more useful in general because those  
can be helpful for automated recovery in general  
regardless what backup method is used  
and the initial issue description here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735\#issue-1089733641](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issue-1089733641)  
is about PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT

The exit tasks complication happens  
only for PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP  
but not for PRE\_RECOVERY/POST\_RECOVERY.

I suggest to leave PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP as is  
and only enhance PRE\_RECOVERY/POST\_RECOVERY by  
PRE\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS and POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
via this pull request here.

This way we could move one step forward  
in an area that is actually used by at least one user.

Because all users with third-party backup methods  
cannot use PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP  
but must use something outside of ReaR  
and because I do not know about a user request  
to have such functionality for third-party backup methods  
(regardless that it would be impossible to implement  
such functionality for third-party backup methods in ReaR)  
I assume users won't have problems with calling (outside of ReaR)  
the right perparation commands before they call "rear
mkbackup\[only\]"  
and the right cleanup commands after "rear mkbackup\[only\]" finished  
so PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP is no needed functionality in ReaR  
and we can leave it "rest in peace".

In general I also do not like the idea of using special values in
lists  
when the special values can appear intermixed with normal values  
as it would happen in this case here.  
It was just "my immediate idea" and I had no better one.

On the other hand I also do not like several config variables  
to specify one same thing because usually that leads to complications  
with interdependencies of those variables (i.e. "herding cats")  
that usually results both complicated code and complicated  
to understand by the user how to specify things correctly.

What I do like is special values for config variables  
when the special values do not appear intermixed with normal values  
as we use it often for config variables with "ternary semantics" like

-   either unset or empty,
-   or boolean 'true' or 'false',
-   or "something else"

(the "either ... or" makes things simple and straightforward)  
e.g. as in KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR or AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
or FIRMWARE\_FILES and so on.

The `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` is an unfortunate exception  
because of its long history of issues how it evolved over time.  
I think I vaguely remember that I did not like using  
`MODULES=('yes')` instead of `MODULES=('all_modules')`  
and `MODULES=('no')` instead of `MODULES=('no_modules')`  
because I feared a module named 'yes' or 'no' might appear  
(Unix tradition to use very short names and play with words)  
while I assumed there will never be a module 'all\_modules' or
'no\_modules'  
and the latter special values tell more explicitly what they mean.

hi @jsmeix, quick note - I also don't object against "magic" values for
scalar variables that are otherwise mainly boolean, i.e. ternary (or
quaternary, or even Hexenvariables). My objection was against mixing
special and regular values in lists indeed.

You are right, I am not very familiar with the error and exit handling
code - I find it quite complicated. (`EXIT_FAIL_MESSAGE` does not do the
trick either.)

I have just realized what is the most ugly part of the current
`POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` handling: it is not that it is executed as an exit
task in case of an error exit (that seems fairly OK to me), but the fact
that it is added to exit tasks only if `PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT` is set, and
if it is unset `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` will not be executed in case of an
error exit:

    if test "$PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT" ; then
        Log "Running PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT '${PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}'"
        AddExitTask "${POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"

I have not realized this before and this complicated logic and
interdependency between the two variables is something I would prefer
not to replicate in any newly introduced variable indeed.

So there is an error in the default.conf description:

    In case of any error during backup, if POST tasks were defined,
    ReaR will run those POST tasks within ExitTasks Array.

I will correct the default.conf description to match what  
the current implementation of PRE/POST Backup scripts does  
(I won't touch the current implementation now).

@didacog  
from my current point of view nothing  
is wrong with the code which implements  
PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT

The documentation in default.conf was not sufficiently precise  
which I (hopefully) fixed right now.

What leads to issues is when new config variables  
PRE\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS and POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS  
should be implemented according to how  
PRE\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS and POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
are now implemented.  
See the above comments what those issues would be.  
In current code there are no issues.

@didacog we had a discussion on the current semantics of
`PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT` and `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` and whether it should be
translated to new `PRE_BACKUP_COMMANDS` and `POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS`. (The
motivation for this translation is described in the original description
of the PR.) Briefly, the issues with the current sematics are related to
the exit handling. It is a question whether to run `POST_BACKUP`
commands even when the workflow has failed (i.e. add them to exit
tasks), when it is not done for other `POST_` commands (why should
`POST_BACKUP` be exceptional?) Also, adding `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` to exit
tasks only when there is a `PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT` seems overcomplicated and
not obvious. And there is a general question of whether there is any
real need for `PRE/POST_BACKUP` stuff, since one can simply run the
commands befopre and after the rear run, instead of putting them into
the configuration file (and one has to do it for external backup methods
that are not supported by `rear mkbackup` anyway).  
I would be interested what was the motivation behind these semantics
decisions (why there is a need for `PRE/POST_BACKUP` stuff and if it
would be a problem if `POST_BACKUP` is executed only after a successful
run).  
(Of course, the intent is not to change the actual semantics of
`PRE/POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT`, but to use the possible introduction of
`PRE/POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS` to improve the semantics, if desired. Since
we have not agreed yet what counts as an improvement, we have not added
`PRE/POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS` yet.)

@pcahyna the motivation for this implementation was a need for a
customer to get a full DR of the system with their small sized databases
(mysql, pgsql) with the data in /var/lib/... in a consistent way, being
small DBs is safe and fast to get them with the backup in the system, so
is fast full DR when recovered with no extra steps.

if desired, and where implemented as a pair of variables PRE+POST to
stop services before backup starts (PRE) and start services again after
backup finishes OK or fails, so there is the reason for the exit tasks
of the POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.

The other reason to not run before and after rear execution is that in
case of mkbackup (mkrescue + mkbackuponly) there is more downtime for
the services stopped during mkrescue with no reason, as they need to be
stopped due to data consistency only during the backup phase.

Hopefully this clarified you your doubts about the decisions that made
us implement this way.

@didacog thank you for your explanation. Do you recall why the decision
to add `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` to exit tasks only when there is a
`PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT` defined? The reasoning might be that only if some
command is used before `mkbackup` to bring the system in a quiet state,
another command is needed to bring it back to the normal state even in
case of errors, otherwise not. But I think that this logic is
overcomplicated and against POLA.

@pcahyna no problem at all to add it at the very beginning of
`010_pre_backup_script.sh` script instead of inside the IF statement.

No - there is not "no problem at all" here.  
It would be an incompatible change when  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT gets added to EXIT\_TASKS in any case  
because then things would behave different  
in case of an error during backup when a user  
has no PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT but only a POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.  
Then with current code in case of an error during backup  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is not run.

@jsmeix, yes will behave different, yes, but is not going to cause any
issue, is just going to allow the `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` to execute anyway
in case of failed backup, even if no `PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT`, but is not a
big problem, just a small "change/enhancement" depending of the point of
view. But i was just saying that if you want to change this to allow
only POST to be run anyway in case of error, I do not see problems as
when PRE is going to be present, things would behave the same as now,
IMHO.

Kind regards,

Yes, I've seen that, is far better explained than before. Just wanted to
clarify to @pcahyna that if wanted to change the behavior of this adding
POST to EXIT\_TASKS even if no PRE is present, I would have no
complaints, as it behaves the same when both PRE/POST are present.

@didacog what @jsmeix proposed was, I believe, one of the two:

-   do not translate `PRE/POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` to the proposed better
    `_COMMANDS` syntax at all, and gradually deprecate it (it can be
    replaced by running a command before and after the backup is made
    manually)
-   translate `PRE/POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` to the proposed `_COMMANDS`
    syntax, but do not add `POST_BACKUP_COMMANDS` to exit tasks at all,
    because running it even in case of errors is unexpected
    (`PRE/POST_RECOVERY` stuff does not behave this way).

Hopefully I am summarizing the discussion correctly.  
If I understand correctly, you have a use for `PRE/POST_BACKUP` stuff
and you need `POST_BACKUP` to be run even in case of errors, so those
options do not sound very good to you?

I assume my wording in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735\#issuecomment-1134686196](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issuecomment-1134686196)

    ... PRE_BACKUP/POST_BACKUP is no needed functionality in ReaR
    and we can leave it "rest in peace".

was misleading because I did not intend to drop it  
because I also wrote there

    I suggest to leave PRE_BACKUP/POST_BACKUP as is
    and only enhance PRE_RECOVERY/POST_RECOVERY by
    PRE_RECOVERY_COMMANDS and POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS

I meant `leave it "rest in peace"` literally  
i.e. as `leave PRE_BACKUP/POST_BACKUP as is`  
and not as "bury it".

With  
"PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP is no needed functionality in ReaR"  
I meant we do not need to care much about it and enhance it  
so we can just leave PRE\_BACKUP/POST\_BACKUP as is.

Ok, @jsmeix so it is ok to me to keep it as is, or modify it a little as
I explained before, but I'm not agree to deprecate this feature at all.

I prefer to leave PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT/POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT as is.

Regarding  
adding POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT to EXIT\_TASKS  
only when PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT is set:

If a user wants to have POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT added to EXIT\_TASKS  
but he does not have a PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT, he can set a dummy

    PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT=( "true" )

If a user does not want to have POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT added to
EXIT\_TASKS  
he can prepend a dummy empty first element to his PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT

    PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT=( '' "COMMANDS" )

because backup/default/010\_pre\_backup\_script.sh  
tests the first element in the PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT array

    ... test "$PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT" ...

and an empty first element in PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
should not cause issues with

    eval "${PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT[@]}"
