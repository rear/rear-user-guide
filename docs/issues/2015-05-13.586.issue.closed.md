On a RHEL 6.3 system with approx 939 SCSI devices we run into the
following (it is still rear-1.14):

As you can see user root has still a soft/hard limit of 1024 open files
and that is the reason why rear sometimes break with a huge amount of
open file descriptors (disk devices) when making the layout of the
devices and file systems.  
What we need to do is follow the recommendations described in article:  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8945/how-can-i-increase-open-files-limit-for-all-processes](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8945/how-can-i-increase-open-files-limit-for-all-processes)  
edit /etc/security/limits.conf with entries like:  
@root soft nofile 65535  
@root hard nofile 65535

Will add this to our FAQ section of rear

Why do we not execute `ulimit -n 65536` at each run? As log as the
number returned of `sysctl fs.file-max` is not exceeded?  
Another interesting output is:

    # sysctl fs.file-nr
    fs.file-nr = 7680   0   2417926

I think rear must never ever change environment  
restriction settings like ulimit and things like that  
on its own.

Imagine rear changes restrictions on its own and then  
(because of whatever error or bad luck) rear consumes  
way too much resources (e.g. it could fill up the disk,  
use all available RAM or CPU, whatever else)  
so that other processes fail (e.g. get aborted by  
the kernel out of memory killer), then users would  
rightfully complain that running rear may render  
their production systems inoperable ("rear mkbackup"  
can be run "online").

I think when there are particular restirictions set and  
rear fails because of them, then the admin should  
know what to do so that rear can work.

The only environment where I could agree that rear  
disables any restriction settings is the ReaR recovery  
system - i.e. the environment where "rear recover"  
runs because rear is the only running program there.

I even think strictly speaking there is no need to  
document that especially for ReaR because this  
is well known Unix/Linux standard behaviour  
(i.e. any admin should know about that)  
regardless that when I experience such issues  
I am always initially a bit surprised ("why the heck  
does it fail now?"), recently I was hit by some  
unexpected "out of disk space" issues on my virtual  
machines with a relatively small virtual harddisk ;-)

A general addendum regarding  
environment restriction settings:

Another kind of environment restriction setting  
are network environment restriction settings  
like local firewall rules that forbid that rear can store  
its files on a remote server (e.g. BACKUP=NETFS).

Because rear runs as root it could "simply change"  
any local network packet filtering and NAT rules  
but I hope nobody really wants that rear does this.

To avoid misunderstandings about my above comments:

I am against code in ReaR (as it comes from upstream)  
that changes existing environment restriction settings.

On the other hand because all of ReaR is bash scripts  
(even /etc/rear/local.conf is sourced and executed)  
the user can add any additional commands he likes  
to /etc/rear/local.conf to make rear work in his  
particular environment, cf. some comments in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1052](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1052)  
and also see

Won't be fixed in ReaR as standard solution - must be done as extra step
by end-user (or like @jsmeix mentioned by adding some code in
`local.conf` for example).

Bash can scripts can be given trivial changes to avoid leaking FDs;
