Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template
=======================================

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    rear-1.17.2-1

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 6.7

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

    <pre>
    [root@host1 ~]# cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    # Default is to create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
    # set OUTPUT to change that
    # set BACKUP to activate an automated (backup and) restore of your data
    # Possible configuration values can be found in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    #
    # This file (local.conf) is intended for manual configuration. For configuration
    # through packages and other automated means we recommend creating a new
    # file named site.conf next to this file and to leave the local.conf as it is.
    # Our packages will never ship with a site.conf.
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="http://abcd.partners/"
    OUTPUT_URL="http://abcd.partners/"
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=y

    [root@host1 ~]#
    </pre>

-   Brief description of the issue

I am trying to setup rear using http. I have already verified http
server connectivity from the server with curl download. Let me know
settings that are required for using Http for rear backup/iso upload to
http server. Can anyone provide a sample local.conf for using http.

Is there any userid/password also need to setup on http server ? what
settings will be required from http server side.

I got messages:  
ERROR: The OUTPUT\_URL scheme http requires the 'lftp' command, which is
missing!

-   Work-around, if any

None so far.

That error message comes from  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/04\_check\_output\_scheme.sh  
therein

<pre>
    case $output_scheme in
       (fish|ftp|ftps|hftp|http|https|sftp)
          if [[ -z "$(type -p lftp)" ]]; then
             Error "The OUTPUT_URL scheme $output_scheme requires the 'lftp' command, which is missing!"
          fi ;;
</pre>

I.e. "type -p lftp" results nothing on your system  
which means you have to install the right RPM package  
for your RHEL 6.7 system that provides the lftp program.  
I don't know what RPM package that is on RHEL 6.7.  
E.g. on my SLES12-SP2-RC1 system the RPM  
package 'lftp' provides /usr/bin/lftp.

The "mput: Operation not supported: 405 Method Not Allowed (PUT)"  
error message comes not from rear but from lftp.

You need to find out why the PUT method is not allowed  
on your FTP server.

I.e. check the config of your FTP server so that  
on the client where rear runs (rear runs as root)  
it works to upload files onto your FTP server.

In general see the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover (rear)" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I.e. run "rear -d -D mkbackup" and inspect the rear log file  
what exact lftp command rear runs and then try to run an  
analogous lftp command manually as root on the client  
where rear runs and adapt your FTP server config  
until you can upload files this way onto your FTP server.
