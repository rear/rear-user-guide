Received a RH bugzilla request:
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1179239](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179239)  
Please convert to use the system's crypto policy for SSL and TLS:  
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:CryptoPolicies](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:CryptoPolicies)

If this program is compiled against gnutls, change the default priority
string to be "@SYSTEM" or to use gnutls\_set\_default\_priority().

If this program is compiled against openssl, and there is no default
cipher list specified, you don't need to modify it. Otherwise replace
the default cipher list with "PROFILE=SYSTEM".

In both cases please verify that the application uses the system's
crypto policies.

If the package is already using the system-wide crypto policies, or it
does not use SSL or TLS, no action is required, the bug can simply be
closed.

Probably has to do with
`prep/NETFS/default/09_check_encrypted_backup.sh` and
`/etc/crypto-policies/config` file (which is not yet included by default
in rear image) on Fedora 21.
