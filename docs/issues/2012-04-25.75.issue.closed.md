From

After failed restore from data protector, ReaR offer to make restore by
DP gui and ask to press any key after done. But if you press the key
during attemp to restore they will continue with next step and restore
itself fail. Is it possible to ask for example for "y" to continue?

Some people might thinks this ridiculous, but I can imagine nervous
admin which is in hurt and must start from beginning because he/she
press for example space key during attempt to restore...
