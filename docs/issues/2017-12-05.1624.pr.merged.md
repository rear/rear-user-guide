@jsmeix, as explain directly in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1596\#issuecomment-349390805](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1596#issuecomment-349390805)  
I got the following small bug ...

    RESCUE rear-rhel-142:~ # rear -D recover
    Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-rear-rhel-142.log
    Running workflow recover within the ReaR rescue/recovery system
    Starting required daemons for NFS: RPC portmapper (portmap or rpcbind) and rpc.statd if available.
    Started RPC portmapper 'rpcbind'.
    RPC portmapper 'rpcbind' available.
    Started rpc.statd.
    RPC status rpc.statd available.
    Started rpc.idmapd.
    Using backup archive '/tmp/rear.xAzGbMuWwaH3TfJ/outputfs/rear-rhel-142/backup.tar.gz'
    Calculating backup archive size
    Backup archive size is 1003M    /tmp/rear.xAzGbMuWwaH3TfJ/outputfs/rear-rhel-142/backup.tar.gz (compressed)
    Setting up multipathing
    Activating multipath

    Listing multipath device found
    mpatha  (253, 0)
    Comparing disks
    Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration
    Using /dev/mapper/mpatha (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/mapper/mpatha
    Current disk mapping table (source -> target):
        /dev/mapper/mpatha /dev/mapper/mpatha
    UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 211
    Confirm or edit the disk mapping
    1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    4) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 10 seconds)

`/dev/mapper/maptha` is the original device (means NO MIGRATION)  
but I think the change you introduced in 1e3b0d9 produce this bug:  
Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one
with same size found)

I think the reason is the fact all disk size are put into the
replacement\_hardware\_disk\_sizes array; even the disk which are slaves
of a multipathed device.

extract from my disklayout.conf

    multipath /dev/mapper/mpatha 53687091200 /dev/sda,/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc,/dev/sdd,/dev/sde,/dev/sdf,/dev/sdg,/dev/sdh

In the example above, sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde, sdf, sdg, sdh are
different PATH to the same disk device. mpatha .... So, in the current
code, their sized will be stored several times .... Which conduct to the
following message: (more than one with same size found) and require a
User interaction even if only one multipath device (SAN LUN) is
presented to the system.

This PR avoid to add device size into the
|replacement\_hardware\_disk\_sizes\` array if they are a multipath
slave.

@jsmeix  
Seems to work now, but I still have a strange message printed (I don't
know if it is normal)

    UserInput -I DISK_LAYOUT_PROCEED_RECOVERY needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250_compare_disks.sh line 146

@schabrolles  
regarding the "UserInput ... needed" message in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1624\#issuecomment-349406390](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1624#issuecomment-349406390)  
In debug mode ('-d' or '-D') and only in that mode  
it is intentional so that the user can see what UserInput ID  
value each particular UserInput call has because otherwise  
the user would have to dig in the code and find the right  
UserInput function call before he could specify a predefined  
UserInput value, see the UserInput() function description  
comments in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh and the  
USER\_INPUT\_user\_input\_ID variables description  
in default.conf
