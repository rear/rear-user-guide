##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **New Feature**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Server

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Currently, ReaR allows a password check on SSH sessions only (via
`SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`).

This PR enables the rescue/recovery system to enforce a password check
also on terminal connections (the system console and/or serial
terminals).

This prevents unauthenticated local root access

-   while the rescue/recovery system is being run via a remote SSH
    session, or
-   when a system reboot has inadvertently started the recovery system
    installed on a local disk partition (e.g. where a buggy firmware has
    inadvertently reshuffled the boot order).

##### Usage

1.  Configure `TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD` in the same way as
    `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`.
2.  Run `rear mkrescue`.
3.  Start the rescue/recovery system.
4.  Log in locally, providing the correct password.

##### Example Configuration

Configure the password `test`:

    TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD='$6$SixRXJl0b37m4rl3$alfGpFd3dp1tBk5/EDquyxqiviB2oQQq3z7VULx9qiBHweFlBquivq28.I4YNLknhKjDax1uM/4c2xuVzdNcy1'
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="$TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD"

@OliverO2  
again many thanks for your continuous enhancements!

Only an offhanded idea:

I didn't had sufficient free mind-space to have a closer look  
so I could misunderstand things but I think what this is about is  
to also have a password dialog for the "normal" login on the  
ReaR recovery system console (where currently no password is needed).  
If I am right I appreciate this option to make things more secure very
much!

Do you think an automatism to have TTY\_ROOT\_PASSWORD and  
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD somehow synchronized would be good?

Offhandedly I think about something like:  
If one is set and the other one is empty  
automatically set the empty one to the one that is set, e.g.

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='mypw'
    TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD=''

results that TTY\_ROOT\_PASSWORD is also set to be 'mypw'  
and vice versa.  
The current default that both are empty would not change the
behaviour.  
Only with `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='mypw'` one would get automatically  
also that same password to login at the recovery system console.  
Probably that could get in the way for automated recovery.  
So it must be possible for the user to have SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD set  
but tell ReaR to not set TTY\_ROOT\_PASSWORD.  
This could be done with `TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD='no'` and  
`is_false $TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD ...` to enforce no TTY\_ROOT\_PASSWORD  
and vice versa for SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD.  
This would make the password 'no' impossible but such a password is
nonsense anyway.

It seems my automated sync idea gets too complicated.

@jsmeix  
I had a similar idea: Having separate passwords depending on the
terminal connection used does not make much sense. However, that's the
way ReaR grew up and some people might currently depend on it. I did not
want to change too much in one step, so basically the next logical thing
for me would be:

-   Add a variable `LOGIN_ROOT_PASSWORD` (initially empty).
-   Use the value of `LOGIN_ROOT_PASSWORD` as a fallback for
    `TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD` if these are
    unset/empty.

This way one can have all combinations with `LOGIN_ROOT_PASSWORD` being
the preferred one.

@OliverO2 @jsmeix IMHO I would go for 1 variable `REAR_ROOT_PASSWORD` to
distinguish between the real root password and the one we define for the
ReaR image. For backwards compatibility I would keep `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`
for the time being, but in de default.conf file we should mention it
will become deprecated in favour of `REAR_ROOT_PASSWORD` which should be
used in the same way foor SSH connections or TTY login sessions. Why do
you think about thei proposal?

@gdha The motivation for having a name `REAR_ROOT_PASSWORD` sounds
reasonable. There is one caveat, though: As @schlomo described in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2541\#issuecomment-743217373](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2541#issuecomment-743217373),
a prefix of `REAR_` might suggest that this is an environment variable.
If ReaR would allow that, user's might be tempted to use something like
`REAR_ROOT_PASSWORD='...' sudo --preserve-env rear mkrescue`, which
would make the password end up in their shell command history and in
`ps` output for others to see.

So maybe go for `RECOVERY_ROOT_PASSWORD` instead? Additionally, we
should probably follow best practices and stop supporting plain text
passwords (those are currently allowed for `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`).

About the env names in my opinion 2 things are important:

1.  all officially recognized env variables start from `REAR_` to make
    it visible for which program they are used, similar to `ls`
    expecting `LS_COLOR` or `ssh` expecting `SSH_*` variables
2.  env variables that should be read **by default** (if they exist)
    should have the same name (plus the `REAR_` prefix) as used
    internally

Why? To make it simple for end-users to understand what is going on.

Furthermore, if we ever want to have a generic env variable based
configuration mechanism then we can just iterate over all `REAR_*`
variables and import them (or do we already have this feature?)

What do you think?

So if I understand correctly, there would be

-   `SOME_FUNNY_OPTION` used throughout ReaR with a standard
    initialization in `default.conf`, and
-   `REAR_SOME_FUNNY_OPTION` as an optional environment variable, which
    would initialize `SOME_FUNNY_OPTION` and have priority over possible
    settings of `SOME_FUNNY_OPTION` in `*.conf` files.

If so, that sounds good to me.

Any other opinions on environment variables containing secrets? And the
final naming of the password variable in this case?

Yes, like that.

However I am not sure about the priority question: Should env variables
always override configuration settings? Or should it only override the
built-in defaults?

Probably good to look at other software and follow that.

I have no good precedent at hand, but if I did a test invocation like
this

    REAR_OUTPUT_URL=file:///my/test/destination rear mkrescue

and found out that this would not override `local.conf` or `site.conf`,
I'd be pretty surprised.

So I'd say an environment variable is like a command line parameter: An
explicit setting for a single invocation that must always be honored.
Configuration files must not overturn such explicit user decisions.

@OliverO2 Are we good to merge this PR?  
@jsmeix Any objections against it?

@gdha Yes, this is ready to merge as is. Once we agree on some common
name unifying `TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD` and on whether
to stop using plaintext passwords
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539\#issuecomment-744447047](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539#issuecomment-744447047)),
we could do that in a subsequent PR.

I do fully agree with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539\#issuecomment-767567952](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539#issuecomment-767567952)  
I prefer small steps that are doable and get them done.
