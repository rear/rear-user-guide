In the Debian rules file the make target "install" is used to produce a
clear installation for creating the package. This changes ensure a clean
installation.

@thumm I am sorry I didn't follow up on this one. Can you merge this
branch with the master tree and request a new pull ? I could do it by
hand myself, but that wouldn't reflect well on this pull-request and
would credit me for the initial work. Sorry for that...

No problem, I'll send you a new pull request
