â€¦PR \#1554 found some issues

(like issue \#1668 and \#1665). This is the first batch to correct this
(and hopefuly the last one).  
DUPLY\_PROFILE and BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_URL were running in each others
way for one, had big trouble to  
fix the BACKUP\_DUPLICITY\_GPG\_OPTIONS variable interpretation, but has
been fixed at last.  
More test are required to be 100% sure the recovery is working as it is
supposed to work. For next year (tomorrow?)  
Greeting from 2017 - Gratien
