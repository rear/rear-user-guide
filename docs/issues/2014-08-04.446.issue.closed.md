I tried ReaR on Ubuntu 14.04 using bootable usb disk. Backup went
through without problem but while recovering I can see /dev/sda which is
my main disk having Ubuntu installed on it is not detected. /dev/sda is
missing when I checked with fdisk -l.

Is this known issue or ReaR is not supported on Ubuntu 14.04. What
should I check to debug this issue?

Any help really appreciated.

thanks,

@niteenk It depends how Ubuntu 14.04 is detecting external disk devices:
is udevd used? Could be that on the rescue image udevd wasn't started
properly? The issue must be correlated with udev to my opinion.

I have the same issue.  
i created a vm, installed ubuntu 14.04 x64, installed rear, created an
bootable rescue iso, killed hdd with dd.  
in the recovery system "ps -aux|grep udevd" finds one process, so i
guess it is running.  
rear log says nothing useful for me:

I can now confirm you are right - /dev/sda was not created - and
/sys/block/sda seems to be populated

has to do with systemd-udev:

    /etc/init.d/udev:if [ -e /etc/udev/udev.conf ]; then
    /etc/init.d/udev:  . /etc/udev/udev.conf

    # /sys filesystem and manages the /dev filesystem.

Thanks. I am still getting an error. I created the script and also
copied it over. I still get the same error when I run 'rear recover'
after that. Does anyone have a step by step that worked for them? Thanks
in advance.

@rmerch1 check first the `dmesg` output for the disk name to be created
and then verify if the devices were created under `/dev/`.  
Please check the script `/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/99-makedev.sh`
which is the work-around for Ubuntu 14.04. However, I would rather know
why `udevd` does not get triggered to create automatically the devices?

Thank you for responding. Do I run the script after it gives me the bug
error message and then run 'rear recover'?

@rmerch1 When you boot from the rescue image the `99-makedev.sh` should
run automatically (if you look carefully at your screen it should
mention that it creates block devices. So, once logged in the block
devices should be visible under `/dev/` directory. If not, check with
the `dmesg` command which block device should have been created and then
you could try:

    cd /dev
    MAKEDEV -v <block-device>

@rmerch1 Any luck with rear recovery?

No, thank you for following up. is there a newer version that has the
fix already I could test with? The workaround may work but I was not
able to get it to work. Has anyone else verified it works?

I just wanted to confirm that thankfully this issue and the keyboard not
working in Ubuntu 14.04 both seem to be resolved with 1.17. Thank you.
