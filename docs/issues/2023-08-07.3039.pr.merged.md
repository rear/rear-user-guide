-   How was this pull request tested?  
    At
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3039/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3039/files)  
    in the `doc/rear.8.adoc` header line click on '...'  
    and then choose "View file" which currently leads to  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/9fac32a35de3ec90156766ace42f6dc2f7f65f52/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/9fac32a35de3ec90156766ace42f6dc2f7f65f52/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
    and therein see the `GLOBAL OPTIONS` part

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In doc/rear.8.adoc  
describe the new -e/--expose-secrets option  
and a more exact description what the  
non-interactive mode actually does  
and some general simplifications  
of other GLOBAL OPTIONS texts

The current "description" of `-e/--expose-secrets` is only one line

    -e --expose-secrets
        do not suppress output of confidential values (passwords, encryption keys) in particular in the log file

so this is not really an explanatory description  
but currently I had no good idea how I could describe  
the issue behind without making a long-winded text.
