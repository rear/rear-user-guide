In current rear master code there is in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
TMPDIR=""
export TMPDIR
</pre>

That violates Unix standards e.g. see  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPDIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPDIR)  
where the user can have TMPDIR set to what he likes  
and then all Unix standard compliant programs would  
store their temporary files (instead of the system default).

But for rear this does not work, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/967\#issuecomment-240368699](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/967#issuecomment-240368699)

rear does not honor a specified TMPDIR  
instead it overwrites any specified TMPDIR  
with an empty value by default.

@gdha  
I also assingn you because according to  
"git blame -w usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf"  
you implemented that.

@gdha  
is there a reasoning behind why rear does not work  
in compliance with Unix standards regarding TMPDIR?

FYI:  
When I comment out that in default.conf as

<pre>
#TMPDIR=""
#export TMPDIR
</pre>

then it just works for me as expected:

<pre>
# unset TMPDIR
# rear -d -D mkrescue
</pre>

is using build area '/tmp/rear.qT4gIvw0UUXUxnf'  
and

<pre>
# TMPDIR="/var/tmp" rear -d -D mkrescue
</pre>

is using build area '/var/tmp/rear.gZvwTNixSS7uUyO'

@jsmeix not really - it was an ugly hack to get duplicity working with
rear as `/tmp/` had not enough space. I should have read the proper
man-pages I know. In `rescue.conf` the variable itself will be
implicitly unset.

@gdha  
many thanks for your prompt reply.

For me everything works well when TMPDIR is no longer  
set in default.conf.  
Then rear behaves in compliance with Unux standards.

And when I set in local.conf e.g.

<pre>
export TMPDIR="/myreartmp"
</pre>

(I had created /myreartmp before and I use intentionally a directory  
that does not exist on normal systems for my test)  
then "rear mkbackup" is using build area '/myreartmp/rear...'  
and - as intended - "rear recover" is using build area '/tmp/rear....'

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/969](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/969)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

An addendum regarding "hack to get duplicity working with rear":

I found by "find \* | xargs grep -1 'TMPDIR' | less"  
those interesting code parts:

In restore/DUPLICITY/default/20\_prompt\_user\_to\_start\_restore.sh  
and in restore/DUPLICITY/default/40\_restore\_duplicity.sh  
there is

<pre>
export TMPDIR=$TARGET_FS_ROOT
</pre>

Let's hope nothing after those scripts needs TMPDIR  
set to what it was before ;-)

To be on the safe side I would expect code like:

<pre>
oldTMPDIR="$TMPDIR"
export TMPDIR=$TARGET_FS_ROOT
...
TMPDIR="$oldTMPDIR"
</pre>

is it possible to set and remote FS for TMPDIR e.g. sshfs ?

Does TMPDIR support remote filesystems ? Mounting an sshfs filesystem
and mapping TMPDIR onto it causes permission errors creating the main
ISO file. Excluding the temporary backup.tar file from /tmp/rear.xx /...
will be very usefull for big systemsizes.

Outsourcing the Backupfile while its creation is perhaps possible by
mounting an sshfs in /tmp/rear.kdR0eQobzObpXSK/tmp/isofs/backup. I've
not tested this.

Or is there any config option which creates the backup.tar directly
outside /tmp on remote hosts ?

ReaR implements nothing special for TMPDIR.  
It is the usual Linux/Unix TMPDIR behaviour.  
If you set TMPDIR to "something" it is you who must have  
set up that "something" so that it works for you as needed  
both for "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" and for "rear recover".  
See its description in default.conf - currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L44)

@speefak I don't think it is a good idea to comment on issues closed a
long time ago, unless your comment is directly related to the original
issue (like, if the problem has reappeared). Concerning your questions,
I don't think that there is an option "which creates the backup.tar
directly outside /tmp on remote hosts", but note that in the current
development version TMPDIR is `/var/tmp` instead of `/tmp` by default (
\#2664 and \#2654 ), which may alleviate your problem a bit ( `/var/tmp`
usually has more space ). As for using sshfs for `TMPDIR`, I don't know
why that is not working, can you perhaps try NFS instead? You can also
tell ReaR to write the ISO image directly to somewhere else (outside
`/var`) instead of storing a copy under `/var/lib/rear/output`: see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2700\#issuecomment-948641660](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2700#issuecomment-948641660)
. That should alleviate the space usage of `/var` a bit, if this
helps.  
I suspect there might be a way to let xorriso read tar output from a
pipe and avoid creating backup.tar.gz on the filesystem entirely, but
that would be a bigger change.
