-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Introduce variables EFI\_ARCH{\_UPPER} and GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT. Use
them for various EFI bootloader suffixes, parameters and paths instead
of hardcoding strings like BOOTX64.EFI. EFI\_ARCH is "x64" and
EFI\_ARCH\_UPPER is "X64" and GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT is "x86\_64-efi" on
x86\_64 architecture.

Should make it easier to port the code to e.g. Arm.

See e.g.  
[https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/Make.defaults](https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/Make.defaults)  
for possible values.

Thank you a lot, @pcahyna! This will make the EFI support on `aarch64` I
have implemented locally. much easier to upstream!

@pcahyna Could you generalise the `build_bootx86_efi` function as well,
please?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8564a7b952481e0fdde562207ff88ff1f4b4df9d/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh\#L39-L126](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8564a7b952481e0fdde562207ff88ff1f4b4df9d/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh#L39-L126)

It hardcodes the `x86_64` architecture and the name itself is quite
misleading because `x86` is not the same thing as `x86_64`. Note that
GRUB2 uses the `arm64-efi` directory on `aarch64` Fedora so plain
`uname -m` won't work.

There is still one instance of `BOOTX64.efi` left:

I have not touched the name though

I changed also the name now

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3157\#discussion\_r1511419803](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3157#discussion_r1511419803)

I adapted  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#variables](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#variables)  
so that it now reads:

    Variables

    Curly braces only where really needed:
    $FOO instead of ${FOO}, but for example ${FOO:-default_value}
    except ${FOO} aids readability compared to $FOO for example as in
    PREFIX${FOO}.SUFFIX versus PREFIX$FOO.SUFFIX that is harder to read.

I see now that this "hard to read" problem is partly my fault. I am
using emacs and and syntax highlighting of strings like
PREFIX$FOO.SUFFIX works, so this is readable without curly braces, but
"PREFIX$FOO.SUFFIX" does not (the highlighting of the content of "..."
overrides the highlighting of `$FOO`), so I need curly braces here. But
in vim and perhaps other editors this is not a problem.

@rear/contributors what do you think? What does count as readable and
what does count as unreadable for you?

@pcahyna

It is your code so in general you have  
(to some reasonable extent, e.g. no real bugs)  
final power over your code.

In particular when an issue is basically  
about "aesthetic judgement" it is in general  
a subjective judgement where you are free  
to judge as you like (except exceptions), cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique\_of\_Judgment\#Aesthetic\_Judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Judgment#Aesthetic_Judgement)

@jsmeix sure, but I want to make my code readable for others. Therefore,
I am genuinely curious what is the aesthetic judgement of other
contributors.

yeah I have thought that the comments will be better readable if they
contain concrete examples, even if this makes them incorrect for non-x64
architectures

I also prefer explicit real-world examples in my comments  
in particular because I like to show what there really is  
on my own system while I implement something so that  
there is an actually true example (at least true on  
my specific system at the time when I made the comment)  
which has the advantage that later others can understand  
how it had been when it was implemented and how it may  
differ on their systems and/or at some later time.

@rear/contributors I am still curious how readable longer quoted strings
with embedded variable expansions and curly braces vs. no curly braces
are for you - most likely it will depend on the syntax highlighting
capabilities of your favorite editor.  
If there are no opinions that contradict what I did here (it is somewhat
tuned for Emacs) I will merge the current state tomorrow.
