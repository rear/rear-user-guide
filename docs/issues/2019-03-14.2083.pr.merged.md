-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR updates the OPALPBA workflow in light of recent changes:

-   It sets `USE_RESOLV_CONF='no'` as networking is not
    required/available in the PBA
-   It avoids copying in the entire `/etc/alternatives` directory as
    since d97cfbe74477e7849ccee9880c57ba4d6a31ee25 its links could pull
    in lots of unwanted stuff, which is not required in rescue systems
    (i.e. graphical editors).
