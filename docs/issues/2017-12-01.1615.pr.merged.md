The problem is with systemd regarding recovery image console and
serial-console.

These changes worked in our tests with RHEL7.2 on HP supoerdomeX
hardware with ILO console and serial console, with Debian 9 and Centos7
on libvirt with and without serial port attached:

@didacog This PR breaks recovery on ubuntu16 (virtualbox without serial
console). It kept on respawning and I had to interrupt to login,
therefore, auto-recover failed:

@ghda Let me check this, because we tested it on debian sucessfully.
I'll update with the results.

Thanks!

And then, everything repeats over and over again.
