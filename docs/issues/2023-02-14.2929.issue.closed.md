ReaR 2.7

I think that there is no point in waiting 5 minutes for user input
during fully automated recovery:

The "workaround" was of course hitting ENTER a couple of times, but that
is exactly what I wouldn't want to do during automated recovery.

Later on, the system stays stuck waiting for the user to select 1, 2 or
3 where it should automatically reboot:

Or was this by design?

@schlomo there is a TIMEOUT variable you can tune (see default.conf)

Yes, but shouldn't the `TIMEOUT` automatically be set to `0` in the case
of an automated recovery?

No, because that is too dangerous, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)  
In particular never ever automatically.

Automatic recovery means "without user interaction"  
so (reasonable) timeouts let things still work  
without user interaction.

It seems what you want is  
"automatically and mercilessly and as fast as possible".  
This is possible but it does not happen automatically.

See the description in default.conf about the  
"Relax-and-Recover UserInput function default behaviour"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L240](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L240)

In your case you recreate on a different disk  
so ReaR goes by default into MIGRATION\_MODE where it  
asks for your confirmation where to recreate the system.  
See the description in default.conf about MIGRATION\_MODE  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L397](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L397)

Via the intentionally not explicitly documented

    MIGRATION_MODE='false'

setting you can enforce recreating the disk layout  
mercilessly as specified in disklayout.conf  
(see rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh)  
by using the kernel device nodes as is in disklayout.conf  
regardless what e.g. /dev/sda actually is inside  
the ReaR recovery system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)  
therein in particular see

After reading through much more of our code I came to understand that my
question was ignorant to begin with.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L96-L98](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L96-L98)
explains it quite well and I agree that if the users chooses automatic
recovery in the boot loaded then we don't need to reboot the system
automatically.

Looking at our configuration we also have
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L951-L957](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L951-L957)
and also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1257-L1263](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1257-L1263)

and maybe I just forgot about that stuff.
