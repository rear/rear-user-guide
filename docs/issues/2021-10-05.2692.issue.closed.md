Because you use UEFI it may work for you to use "ebiso" instead of
"mkisofs",  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf about "ebiso" and for an example
see  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf  
but I cannot tell you where you could download "ebiso" binaries for
Gentoo.

Alternatively use another ISO creation tool that supports UEFI  
which is already ready-to-use provided by Gentoo  
and then you may have to adapt  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/820\_create\_iso\_image.sh  
so that your particular ISO creation tool is called with appropriate  
command line options as needed for UEFI in your case.

thanks for your answer, i downloaded the centos rpm from here  
[https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=Archiving%3ABackup%3ARear&package=ebiso](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=Archiving%3ABackup%3ARear&package=ebiso)  
and did:

rpm2targz ebiso-0.1.4-1.el6.x86\_64.rpm  
tar xzfv ebiso-0.1.4-1.el6.x86\_64.tar.gz  
mkdir /opt/ebiso  
mv usr/bin/ebiso /opt/ebiso/ebiso

and added the line

ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN=/opt/ebiso/ebiso

to /etc/rear/local.conf

no complaining anymore and the iso is created and uploaded to my nfs
share.

I'll start testing the created image now.

thanks again.

edit: latest rpm from here  
[https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Agozora&package=ebiso](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Agozora&package=ebiso)  
seems to work too.

@redgloboli  
thank you for your explanatory feedback  
what exact steps you did to make it work for you.  
This could be helpful for other Gentoo users.
