Steps:  
1.Took backup of VM through rear by using NFS share.  
2.created boot-able USB using iso.  
3.On physical machine started recovery through rear.  
4.on rear shell got error "Message: Mount command 'mount -v -t nfs -o
rw,noatime 10.31.199.183:/NFS\_DATA /tmp/rear.BTQ14pIsHuKqdsy/outputfs'
failed."

1.  After making changes in /usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh it
    got worked.

Please find the difference in code.& after that you can check in .

Please let me know anything more details needs to be shared,

So basically the diff is:

    <     local defaultoptions="rw,noatime,nolock"
    ---
    >     local defaultoptions="rw,noatime"

the `nolock` is probably required for you as the NFS server is version
4, right? I think it would be better if we would foresee NFSv4
capabilities in rear itself instead of sating by default NFSv3 or v2.  
We had already similar issues around this topic (issue \#158)

@gdha Yes.NFS version is 4.

Also when tried to recover virtual machine which was having static ip on
to physical machine having DHCP domain.

So here the issue o observed is:

1.when i started recovery , rear shell generally dont assigns IP to
machine or it will take the VM machine IP as it is.  
2 Now here it should get automatic DHCP IP through DHCP server where it
does in other OS platform like RHEL .

3.But in case of Ubuntu12.04\_x64 ,it doesn't take IP.

So to tackle this i executed dhclient interface (still machine dint get
DHCP IP) &  
then tried to assign IP by using ifconfig interface <ip adress>  
then it got assigned a DHCP IP to that machine so i think here REAR is
failing to take DHCP IP automatically.

Please update your comments.

NFSv4 support should be added in rear-1.18
