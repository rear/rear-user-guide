    after creating restore-ISO file with  
    /usr/sbin/rear -v -c /etc/rear/server2backup mkrescue &gt;
    /var/log/rear/rear\_rescue.log  
    and creating backup with  
    /usr/sbin/rear -v -c /etc/rear/server2backup mkbackuponly &gt;
    /var/log/rear/rear\_backup.log

we want to restore server by booting with rescue-ISO image.

Choosing "Automatic recover" and the following kernel parameters:

kernel initrd=initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw selinux=0
console=ttyS0,9600 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0 auto\_recover
unattended ip=139.1.xxx.xxx nm=255.255.255.192 netdev=eth0
gw=139.1.xxx.xxx

the restore process stops in  
rear&gt;

"Please start the restore process on your backup host."

But this host is just an NFS server.

What to do next ?

Regards and thanks in advance.  
Will.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Not yet.

ReaR version 1.17.2 is rather old - from August 2015, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)

Try out if a more current version works better for you, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

See  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)  
what has changed from ReaR 1.17.2 to the current ReaR 2.4.  
There are some possibly backward incompatible changes.

I would also recommend to try out our current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code as follows:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).

I don't know if your issue is a bug in ReaR, a missing feature in
ReaR,  
or if it is caused by inappropriate configuration settings by you.

If your issue is a bug or a missing feature in ReaR:

Bugs in older ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR
upstream).  
Missing features in older ReaR versions are not backported by us.

Bugs in older ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (provided the fix can be backported  
with reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got
your  
older ReaR version.

Missing features in older ReaR versions are usually not backported  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.

If the issue also happens with current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
please provide us a complete ReaR debug log file of "rear -D recover"  
plus your initial/original disklayout.conf file from your original
system  
so that we can have a look how it behaves in your particular
environment  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If it works with current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
we would really appreciate an explicit positive feedback.

Thanks for reply. I have opened a ticket at RedHat. For me, the issue is
the old 2.6.xx kernel, which is not able to re-read the partition layout
after parted.

I guess that upgrading to RHEL 6.10 does not change anything

I remember that re-reading the partition table was working in 2015 and
even in 2008 and before. So maybe there is another reason for your
problem? Can you try `sfdisk -R` instead? Or `blockdev --rereadpt` (not
sure if available on your OS). Maybe `fuser -avm /dev/sd*` will show you
the culprit?

As a workaround, maybe the following works: restart the system and try
again and then choose to continue the restore script.

Hi Schlomo...

Thanks for the quick reply.  
I´ve tried your commands in ReaR 2.4-git

    rear> sfdisk -R /dev/sda
    BLKRRPART: Device or resource busy
    This disk is currently in use.

    rear> blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda
    BLKRRPART: Device or resource busy

    rear> fuser -avm /dev/sd*
    bash: fuser: command not found   ( --> not integrated in the rear-iso)

Rebooting and re-initiating the recovery process didn´t solve the
problem. ReaR created the disk layout again and the kernel tried to
re-read the partitions... and failed.

Regards.

@will-code-for-pizza  
as far as I see special issues like your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1912\#issuecomment-423191706](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1912#issuecomment-423191706)  
can be in general solved by editing the diskrestore.sh script  
as you need it in your particular case.

The diskrestore.sh script is run with `set -e` which lets it  
exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

I think in your particular case it might work when you simply  
disable the `partprobe` calls or change them to something like

<pre>
... partprobe ... || true
</pre>

to get a command that exits always with zero exit code.

Background information how "rear recover" recreates the disk layout:  
According to the disk layout information in the disklayout.conf file  
the diskrestore.sh script is generated. The diskrestore.sh script  
contains all commands that are needed to recreate the disk layout.  
Accordingly by editing the diskrestore.sh script you can change  
anything as you need it to make recreating the disk layout work  
in your particular case.

In general when you know in advance about an issue  
I would recommend to edit the diskrestore.sh script  
before it is run and not after it was run partially and failed  
because when it was run partially you have a partially  
set up disk which means a second run of the (now edited)  
diskrestore.sh script may fail early because of whatever  
conflicts with stuff that was already partially set up.

To be able to edit the diskrestore.sh script before it is run  
you need to enforce the so called "migration mode"  
where manual disk layout configuration happens  
via several user dialogs where in particular one of  
those user dialogs lets you edit the diskrestore.sh script.

To be able to enforce the "migration mode"  
you need a current ReaR version, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)  
about the changes related to "migration mode".

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf about how to  
enforce the "migration mode":  
In the running ReaR recovery system call

<pre>
export MIGRATION_MODE='true'
</pre>

before you run `rear -D recover`.

@will-code-for-pizza  
your  
[https://pastebin.com/VjPfvRHU](https://pastebin.com/VjPfvRHU)  
for ReaR 2.4-git shows that diskrestore.sh fails with

<pre>
+++ parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos
Warning: WARNING: the kernel failed to re-read the partition table on /dev/sda (Device or resource busy).  
</pre>

so that now it is `parted` itself that fails which does not look really
promising.  
Nevertheless you may try out if things work when you ignore that warning
via

<pre>
parted ... || true
</pre>

For the (not really) fun of it you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/793)  
and other issues linked therein, in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)

@will-code-for-pizza  
in your  
[https://pastebin.com/VjPfvRHU](https://pastebin.com/VjPfvRHU)  
it seems you have LVM volumes or things like that.

Perhaps you get that  
`kernel failed ... /dev/sda (Device or resource busy)`  
because you are hit by things as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)  
or in the other issues linked therein.

Does it perhaps help when you manually wipe the disk  
like I described in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)  
in the running ReaR recovery system before you run `rear recover`  
i.e. something like

<pre>
wipefs -a -f /dev/sda9
wipefs -a -f /dev/sda8
...
wipefs -a -f /dev/sda1
wipefs -a -f /dev/sda
</pre>

(which `wipefs` options work depend on your particular `wipefs`
version).

Yes, it does. All systems are RHEL 6.9

> I meant to chose `5` in the error menu where you chose `6`

Hi Schlomo,

if I choose 5) from the list in 1.17-2, it throws the following message:

"Script /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh has not been changed,
restarting has no impact." and returns to the list.

**Nevertheless, the rear-2.4-git from TODAY (last commit 24b5853) works
out of the box ! :-)**  
The 2.4-git from Thursday doesn´t.

This is funny, because the only change was in  
rear/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8c835421ace2f86df80c6c70d8138e22e358d471\#diff-f00be59f5ba7104a134e2ddc6864a423](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8c835421ace2f86df80c6c70d8138e22e358d471#diff-f00be59f5ba7104a134e2ddc6864a423)

and for me the commits have no relations to my problem. But I might be
wrong.

Additional tests with 1.17-2 results with ongoing and steady problems,
as described above.  
I now will patch the 1.17-2 script with the " || true" option for all
"parted" calls.

Keep your fingers crossed.  
Regards.

Yes, this message occurs permanently.

Unfortunatelly 'wipefs' is not available on the rescue ISO (RHEL 6.9)
:-(  
Would it help to install the rpm ? Would it be integrated in the rescue
ISO after "mkrescue" ??

@will-code-for-pizza  
regarding 'wipefs' not available on the rescue ISO:

If 'wipefs' is installed on your original system it should get  
automatically included in the ReaR recovery system via  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh

<pre>
# If available wipefs is used in the recovery system by 130_include_filesystem_code.sh
# as a generic way to cleanup disk partitions before creating a filesystem on a disk partition,
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/540
# and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649#issuecomment-148725865
# Therefore if wipefs exists here in the original system it is added to REQUIRED_PROGS
# so that it will become also available in the recovery system (cf. 260_crypt_layout.sh):
has_binary wipefs && REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" wipefs ) || true
</pre>

You can make anything available in the ReaR recovery system  
provided you have that installed on your original system  
when you specify it via config variables like  
COPY\_AS\_IS, PROGS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, and LIBS,  
see default.conf about those config variables.

To make 'wipefs' available in the ReaR recovery system use

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" wipefs )
</pre>

To see what there actually is in the ReaR recovery system set

<pre>
KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
</pre>

and ReaR's (temporary) working area where it builds in particular  
the rescue/recovery system ISO image is not automatically removed  
at the end of "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" so that you can  
inspect the ReaR recovery system content in  
`$TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/`  
directly without the need to extract it from the initramfs/initrd  
in the ISO image (again see default.conf for that info).
