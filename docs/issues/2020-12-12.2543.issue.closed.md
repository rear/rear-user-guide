At least in Ubuntu security updates default setting is to download and
install updates automatically.  
If sw upgrade is running at the same time as ReaR is running, e.g during
mkbackup or mkrescue commands,  
the output of those commands can be inconsistent and might cause
failures during recovery.

Also if rear mkbackup or rear mkrescue commands are launched from cron,
it is possible that user accidentally runs package management tasks when
rear is running.

If the system is using LVM, consistent backups are possible with LVM
snapshots but not all systems are using LVM.

My proposal is that ReaR should be capable of preventing simultaneous
run with OS sw management tools.  
That means either blocking OS sw management tools (apt, yum, ...) while
rear is running or blocking rear until a running OS sw management tool
has finished.  
At least in Ubuntu this can be done by getting exclusive lock on file
/var/lib/dpkg/lock.

This capability could be configured with few new variables, e.g. like
this:

    # If DISABLE_CONCURRENT_SW_MANAGEMENT="yes" then ReaR checks at startup whether sw package manager is running, 
    # if sw package manager is running then ReaR waits until sw package manager has ended.
    # If sw package manager is not running then ReaR acquires exclusive lock preventing sw package manager to start 
    # and keeps the lock until end of ReaR operation.
    # If DISABLE_CONCURRENT_SW_MANAGEMENT="no" then ReaR does not check sw package manager running status at all.
    # Default setting DISABLE_CONCURRENT_SW_MANAGEMENT="no" is backward compatible
    DISABLE_CONCURRENT_SW_MANAGEMENT="yes"

    # TIME_LIMIT_WAIT_SW_MANAGEMENT: Number of seconds ReaR waits for the sw package manager to finish its job 
    # if the sw package manager is running when ReaR is started.
    # If the sw package manager is still running after time limit has elapsed, then ReaR aborts its operation and exits with error status.
    # If TIME_LIMIT_WAIT_SW_MANAGEMENT=0 then wait for indefinitely.
    # This setting has no effect if DISABLE_CONCURRENT_SW_MANAGEMENT="no"
    TIME_LIMIT_WAIT_SW_MANAGEMENT=0

@jk-10 interesting idea and as you have given it a good though why not
write a PR yourself?

@jk-10  
a precondition is reliable autodetection of all possible OS sw
management tools  
for all Linux distributions and all their various versions where ReaR is
supported.

In general ReaR is neither a backup software nor a backup management
software  
and it is not meant to be one, cf. the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads (excerpts):

    ReaR only calls an external tool that does the backup
    of the files during "rear mkbackup" ...

    It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent ...
    E.g. you may have to stop certain running programs
    (e.g. whatever services or things like that) that could
    change files that get included in your backup
    before your backup tool is run. 

Another excerpt from  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

    What "consistent backup" means

    Consistent backup means that all files in the backup
    are consistent for the user. For example assume the
    user is running an application program that changes
    several files simultaneously (in the simplest case
    think about the user is manually changing several
    files simultaneously, e.g. 'root' or a setup tool may change
    several config files). When that program is running during
    files backup, the backup may contain old data in some files
    and new data in other files which could be an inconsistent
    state. Such inconsistencies could lead to errors in that
    application after such an inconsistent backup was restored
    or probably even worse the application blindly continues
    to operate on inconsistent data which could make the
    overall state more and more inconsistent over time until
    at the very end all might be completely messed up. 

I.e. there are zillions of other things that could result  
an inconsistent backup.
