    USB device gets suspended after plugging in and triggering
    `rear udev`

    `UDEV_SUSPEND=n`  
    or

Hi guys, during my experimenting with USB I've came across a piece of
code, which purpose I don't really understand.  
In file `/usr/share/rear/lib/udev-workflow.sh` we have code which
suspends USB device for some reason.  
First I thought that if I run `rear recover/mkrescue` it will resume
somehow, but no :-(.  
Here is mentioned code from commit 2af02d9

     +    # Suspend USB port
     +    if [[ "$DEVPATH" && "$UDEV_SUSPEND" =~ ^[yY1] ]]; then
     +        path="/sys$DEVPATH"
     +        Log "Trying to syspend USB device at '$path'"
     +        while [[ "$path" != "/sys/devices" && ! -w "$path/power/level" ]]; do
     +            path=$(dirname $path)
     +        done
     +        if [[ -w "$path/power/level" ]]; then
     +            Log "Suspending USB device at '$path'"
     +            echo -n suspend >$path/power/level
     +        fi
     +    fi

The outcome (at lease on my Centos) is that whenever I plug in the USB
device and udev triggers `rear udev` device gets suspended and
consecutive backup will fail with obvious message:  
`Message: Mount command 'mount  -o rw,noatime /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /tmp/rear.fntaUA9e1X5YWFc/outputfs' failed.`
As a workaround I can wake up the device or set variable
**UDEV\_SUSPEND**, however I don't think this is how defaults should be
set.

Do you have any clue why is suspending implemented like this?  
Did I something wrong or is this some kind of regression?

@dagwieers  
can you provide background information about  
the reasoning behind your "USB suspend support"  
in particular the reasoning why you have in default.conf

<pre>
# Suspend the (USB) device when udev handler has finished ?
UDEV_SUSPEND=y
</pre>

I am not at all a udev expert but as far as I understand  
in etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules

<pre>
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{ID_FS_LABEL}=="REAR-000", RUN+="/usr/sbin/rear udev"
</pre>

the RUN+="/usr/sbin/rear udev" means  
according to the following "man udev" excerpt

<pre>
  RUN{type}
    Add a program to the list of programs to be executed
    after processing all the rules for a specific event
    ...
    This can only be used for very short-running foreground
    tasks. Running an event process for a long period of time
    may block all further events for this or a dependent device.
    Starting daemons or other long-running processes is not
    appropriate for udev; the forked processes, detached or not,
    will be unconditionally killed after the event handling has
    finished.
</pre>

that the udev workflow might be unconditionally killed  
after the event handling has finished.

As far as I understand in usr/share/rear/lib/udev-workflow.sh

<pre>
    # Run udev workflow
    WORKFLOW_$UDEV_WORKFLOW "${ARGS[@]}"
</pre>

this runs the WORKFLOW\_$UDEV\_WORKFLOW function  
(by default.conf it is the WORKFLOW\_mkrescue function)  
as the same process as the udev workflow itself  
but that process will be killed by udev after a  
short time (as far as I understand "man udev").

From my current non-udev-expert point of view  
the whole udev workflow cannot work this way.

@jsmeix you might not be an udev expert but you are definitely expert in
finding things! üëç  
That udev kill thing explains a lot, because recently I'v tested EFI USB
boot on Debian and `rear udev` workflow was terminated (after a while)
without any further notification (hence it was not suspended at the end)
...

@gozora  
to avoid that the rear udev workflow is run whenever  
you plug in your "REAR-000" labeled USB stick,  
remove the etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules file  
(or whatever the name of your rear usb rules file is).

&lt;shameless self-praise mode&gt;  
after working 17 years at SUSE where I maily have to deal  
with all kind of "strange issue reports" from users and customers  
I think I got some experience in finding "smelling" things ;-)

I asked a colleague who is a udev expert  
and he explained it to me:

There is a hard 120 seconds timeout in udev  
after which any by udev started process is killed.

The reason is that udev proceeds event by event  
and as long as there is a process running that was  
started by udev for an event, udev cannot proceed  
with any subsequent event for that device.

Therefore udev kills any process running that was  
started by udev for an event after 120 seconds.

Bottom line is:  
udev cannot be used to launch longer running tasks  
when a udev event happens.

Accordingly the whole udev workflow in rear  
cannot work as it is currently.

@gozora  
does it work to avoid that the udev workflow interferes  
when you remove the udev rule file that triggers  
the rear udev workflow?

I.e. without the automated udev workflow  
does it work when you manually do what  
you like to do?

If yes, I would like to close this particular issue here  
because I submitted the general issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)  
that the current udev workflow cannot work at all.

Yep, that is also an workaround ...

strange that centos runs whole `rear udev` without interrupting, I'm not
so sure but I'd say that it was running longer that 2 minutes ...

@jsmeix I can try it later today.  
I have no problem closing this issue, it was open just to discuss code
parts that was not clear to me.

So feel free to close it...

Regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838\#issuecomment-219715419](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838#issuecomment-219715419)

Perhaps the udev kill timeout value is different depending  
on the udev version / Linux distribution / whatever ...

But that does not change the generic fault here  
that running a rear workflow with a time bomb  
is not "the right thing" from my point of view.

By the way:  
As far as I see the rear udev rules file is not included  
in rear RPM packages (because as far as I see  
it does not get installed by rear's "make install")  
so that this problematic udev workflow should not  
affect users who install rear by a RPM package.

@gozora  
I guess you installed rear by copying the GitHub  
sources directly so that you got the rear udev rules file.

Yes exactly, I'm just doing copy from rear directory. I thought that
udev rule is part of installation. If not than it should not affect any
user ....
