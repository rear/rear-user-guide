@jholland-vin-dit  
the error exit happens in  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh\#L156](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh#L156)

I am not a Fedora user so I cannot reproduce what goes wrong  
on Fedora 32 that a kernel module `nls_cp437` seems to exist  
but without a file that contains the module.

E.g. on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system things look normal:

    # modinfo -F filename nls_cp437
    /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp151.28.48-default/kernel/fs/nls/nls_cp437.ko

    # KERNEL_VERSION="$( uname -r )"
    # modinfo -k $KERNEL_VERSION -F filename nls_cp437
    /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp151.28.48-default/kernel/fs/nls/nls_cp437.ko

You could inspect the ReaR log file  
when you run it in debug mode like "rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup"  
what happend during build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
regarding the `nls_cp437` module, cf.  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

As a workaround try in etc/rear/local.conf

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )

which runs simpler code in build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
that should not fail because of whatever inconsistencies of kernel  
module names versus kernel module files.

Read the `MODULES` description in your  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf file.

@jholland-vin-dit  
thanks for your feedback that things work now for you.  
It is important for us at ReaR upstream to get such explicit feedback  
so we know whether or not there could be a hidden issue inside ReaR.  
FYI:  
Since ReaR 2.5 `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` is the default, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L211](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L211)  
so this issue should no longer happen with ReaR 2.5 default behaviour.

Well, that got me past *that* hurdle. Then I ran into another one with [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996  ](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996  ) I followed the advice near the bottom of that issue page to
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

remove the linuxefi module which seems to not exist anymore,  
ending up with having same line as for slackware.

I have followed your sugestion and also removed multiboot (it was causing the same problems as linuxefi)
========================================================================================================

Now my backup has completed and created the big tarball and iso.  
I am going to try a restore when I get a spare HD to restore onto.

It's great to get the help, thank you!

@jholland-vin-dit  
in our current ReaR upstream master code we have substantial changes  
how UEFI booting of the ReaR recovery system ISO is implemented,  
in particular see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2293](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2293)

So you may like to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
from within a separated directory as a test to find out if things work
better  
with current ReaR upstream master code compared to your installed  
ReaR version, see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Of course I am totally selfish when I suggest you should test  
our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code because  
we at ReaR upstream need tests with recent Fedora versions ;-)

Sorry, but I probably won’t do that very soon. Maybe sometime in the
future.

So I got a spare hard drive and tried to restore my fedora 32 backup. It
seemed to be having problems with the source disk being encrypted? It
looked like it was trying to prompt for a password but it wasn’t letting
me enter it. I tried going in the rear shell but didn’t see anything
that looked helpful.

@jholland-vin-dit  
I am not a CIFS user so I won't reproduce CIFS issues  
or could even fix possible bugs with CIFS in ReaR.

From plain looking at the ReaR documentation that  
mentiones cifs I see in "man rear"

    BACKUP_URL=cifs://
    To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path.
    To provide credentials for CIFS mounting use a
    /etc/rear/cifs credentials file and define
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"
    and pass along:

    username=_username_
    password=_secret password_
    domain=_domain_

and in usr/share/rear/conf/examples/USB-and-Samba-example.conf

    # Backup to a network share:
    BACKUP=NETFS
    # When using CIFS as backup/output destination make sure that cifs-utils package is installed
    # Path to the cifs share:
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://server/share
    # Username and password of a valid Samba/Active Directory user:
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="username=sambauser,pass=password"

so in both cases username and the secret password  
must be provided either in a /etc/rear/cifs file  
or directly in the BACKUP\_OPTIONS config variable  
which means the ReaR recovery system contains  
the secret password.

From plain looking at the ReaR code that is related to `cifs` I see  
in usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/100\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh

    mount_url $BACKUP_URL $BUILD_DIR/outputfs $BACKUP_OPTIONS

that leads to usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh

    ### Mount URL $1 at mountpoint $2[, with options $3]
    mount_url() {
    ...
        case $(url_scheme $url) in
        ....
            (cifs)
                if [ x"$options" = x"$defaultoptions" ];then
                    # defaultoptions contains noatime which is not valid for cifs (issue #752)
                    mount_cmd="mount $v -o rw,guest //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
                else
                    mount_cmd="mount $v -o $options //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
                fi
                ;;

so your `BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"`  
should result a mount command of the form

    mount -v -o cred=/etc/rear/cifs ...

to mount the CIFS share at a local mointpoint.

As far as I see there is currently no way in ReaR how to provide  
CIFS username and the secret password in an interactive way  
via some kind of user dialog in ReaR.

In "man mount.cifs" I see

    OPTIONS
    ...
    password=arg|pass=arg
    specifies the CIFS password. If this option is not given
    then the environment variable PASSWD is used.
    If the password is not specified directly or indirectly
    via an argument to mount,
    mount.cifs will prompt for a password,
    unless the guest option is specified.
    Note that a password which contains the delimiter
    character (i.e. a comma ',') will fail to be parsed correctly
    on the command line. However, the same password defined
    in the PASSWD environment variable or via a credentials
    file (see below) or entered at the password prompt
    will be read correctly.

    credentials=filename|cred=filename
    specifies a file that contains a username and/or password
    and optionally the name of the workgroup.
    The format of the file is:
        username=value
        password=value
        domain=value
    This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext
    in a shared file, such as /etc/fstab .
    Be sure to protect any credentials file properly.

Accordingly it seems in your case it is mount.cifs that  
prompts for a password because you did not provide  
it via ReaR options or via the environment variable PASSWD  
before you launched "rear recover".

But you won't see when mount.cifs prompts for a password  
because while usr/sbin/rear is running both stdout and stderr  
are redirected into ReaR's log file, cf.

@jholland-vin-dit  
according to your `lsblk` output you use  
LVM on LUKS encrypted volume.

So when you made the CIFS access working for you  
the next possible issue could be already waiting for you:

Thanks for looking into it,  
I think I will wait a bit before trying REAR on Fedora 32 again. I like
REAR when it works as it did on RHEL 8 for me. It’s too disruptive for
me to test/troubleshoot it on Fedora though.

Just for kicks (I only upgraded to FC32 yesterday and got bitten by this
problem today), adding the following line to
`usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh` at line 108 right
after the line containing

    modinfo $module 1>/dev/null || continue

fixes the problem for me:

    grep -q $(echo $module | tr '_-' '..') /lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION/modules.builtin && continue

Feel free to use this workaround if you want. :slightly\_smiling\_face:

Bye,  
Thomas

This is interesting. I don’t think I’m going to continue trying REAR for
Fedora as doing full backups of Fedora seems silly since it is such a
moving target. Congratulations on solving it though!

@z1atk0  
thank you for your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414\#issuecomment-668632798](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414#issuecomment-668632798)

I implemented it for current GitHub master code via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469)

FYI:  
I am not a Fedora user so I cannot reproduce Fedora specific issues  
but on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system I noticed that there are modules  
that are listed in /lib/modules/\*/modules.builtin and also exist as a
file:

    # uname -a
    Linux linux-h9wr 4.12.14-lp151.28.52-default ...

    # for builtin_module in $( cat /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp151.28.52-default/modules.builtin ) ; do \
     module_name=$( basename $builtin_module | cut -d '.' -f1 ) ; \
     modinfo $module_name &>/dev/null && echo builtin module $builtin_module found by modinfo ; done
    builtin module kernel/lib/crc32.ko found by modinfo

    # grep crc32 /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp151.28.52-default/modules.builtin
    kernel/crypto/crc32c_generic.ko
    kernel/lib/crc32.ko

    # modinfo crc32 -F filename
    /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp151.28.52-default/kernel/arch/x86/crypto/crc32-pclmul.ko
    /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp151.28.52-default/kernel/crypto/crc32_generic.ko

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469)  
the new behaviour is that when modules are listed in modules.builtin  
and are shown by modinfo then those modules are skipped.  
Before
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469)
for such modules  
the modules file(s) would have been included in the recovery system.  
This would be a backward incompatible change if we had not already  
`MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` by default so the different behaviour  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469)
should affect only exceptional cases.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469)
merged  
the initially described issue "... fails due to missing module file"  
should be avoided.
