#### Problem

ReaR 2.2 with cryptsetup 1.6.6 (as on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS) uses
compiled-in default values which are not up-to-date in terms of
cryptographic security:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Option</th>
<th>cryptsetup 1.6.6 Default</th>
<th>More Secure</th>
<th>Auto-detectable</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Key size</td>
<td>--key-size 256</td>
<td>--key-size 512</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Passphrase processing time (msecs)</td>
<td>--iter-time 1000</td>
<td>--iter-time 2000</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Random number generation device</td>
<td>--use-urandom</td>
<td>--use-random</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For details, see [Encryption options for LUKS
mode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Encryption_options_for_LUKS_mode)
in the ArchWiki.

In addition, ReaR can neither auto-detect nor use existing keyfiles for
the automatic decryption of recreated LUKS volumes. A recovered system
will ask the user for a passphrase where the original system would not.

#### Solution

This PR improves LUKS recovery with these characteristics:

-   Auto-detect the `--key-size` option from the original volume.
-   Auto-detect keyfiles in
    [crypttab](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man5/crypttab.5.html)
    and add them to recreated LUKS volumes.
-   Allow additional cryptsetup options, which cannot be auto-detected,
    to be configured.

#### Strategy

See comment in commit c9e7e1bdc5a788590e3a378839fbc6e099158a04.

Note: Removing the documented `mode` option is an incompatible change,
which simplifies the code by processing each option in the same way.
Since `disklayout.conf` is usually re-generated before being edited,
introducing this change seems OK to me.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.

@OliverO2  
as far as I see in your comments in your  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/240\_reassign\_luks\_keyfiles.sh

<pre>
original keyfiles should have been restored from the backup
</pre>

it means that with this pull request nothing secret  
will be added into the ReaR recovery system?  
At least not by default without an explicit user setting?

@jsmeix  
Yes, no secrets will be added to the rescue medium as stated in the
comment of commit c9e7e1bdc5a788590e3a378839fbc6e099158a04:

> Auto-detect 'keyfile' option, enable unattended (password-less)  
> decryption via temporary keyfile without leaking original keyfiles
> on  
> rescue medium, securely re-assign keyfiles after restore.

Also see [this comment in
160\_include\_luks\_code.sh](https://github.com/OliverO2/rear/blob/c9e7e1bdc5a788590e3a378839fbc6e099158a04/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh#L42-L44).

When you have encrypted disks and you leak secrets onto the unencrypted
rescue medium it is like building an expensive underground bank vault
and then putting the key into a tin box on your desk. So I just went the
extra mile to avoid this.

I agree with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472\#issuecomment-328459748](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472#issuecomment-328459748)
and below.

My next task is actually to provide a ReaR option to encrypt ssh keys
which

-   currently leak onto ReaR's rescue media, and
-   may lack passphrase-protection for unattended operations, and
-   may provide access to the central backup repository.

The idea incorporates asking the user for an initial *recovery master
password* (resembling
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1444\#issuecomment-324294539](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1444#issuecomment-324294539)),
although I would not recommend putting this into configuration files.

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your explanation.

As you can also see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1489\#issuecomment-329424147](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1489#issuecomment-329424147)  
encryption stuff is not one of my favourite areas of interest.  
Accordingly I do very much appreciate it when you check  
and even improve those things in ReaR.  
I look forward to your ssh improvements.  
As long as in etc/rear/local.conf even a dumb

<pre>
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
</pre>

still "just works" to "just get" ssh access into the recovery system  
I am happy because I use that all the time on my testing systems.  
( I do not what to have the "good old times" back when one had  
to do special setup to get ssh access into the recovery system. ;-)

Isn't that the original system administrator's decision that we just
recreate during recovery? He has finally decided to go with crypttab
keyfiles after all. Do you think that this decision should be overruled
by ReaR?

You are right. I'll correct this. Can you point me to the manpage you've
used? It seems to be a rather old version of the cryptsetup suite as
newer versions ([like this
one](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man5/crypttab.5.html))
don't seem to allow verbatim passwords there anymore.

Like I said, for me this is politics, I don't like politics. ReaR is my
spare time project and I don't do thing I don't like in my spare time.  
So again, if @schlomo does not object neither me will object.

I don't think so.

But to answer your question I've used `man crypttab` from CentOS 7.3

OK, I misunderstood this one:

> The third field specifies the encryption password.

It initially sounded to me like is was meant to be a verbatim password
first, and a path to a keyfile only under certain circumstances. When
reading more carefully, it was never really meant to be a password. So
they have just improved the explanation in newer incarnations of that
manual page.

Anyway, I'll take care of the special cases of 'none' and '-'.

A "caution!" regarding running any programs in ReaR  
that may (sometimes) do interactive user dialogs like  
"a passphrase will be read interactively from the console":

In ReaR interactive user dialogs won't work by default because  
both STDERR and STDOUT are redirected into ReaR's log file,

@gozora Should work now:

-   temporary keyfiles are named after the target (`/dev/mapper`) name,
    which must be unique
-   `none` entries in crypttab are recognized

@jsmeix  
I've even tried to use the new `UserInput -C` variant to gather a
password in `layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh`,
replacing the two branches in the `elif ... fi` section at the end with:

        else
            if [ -n "$password" ] ; then
                password="$(UserInput -I LUKS_DEVICE_PASSWORD -C -t 0 -p "Please enter the password for LUKS device $target_name ($source_device):")"
            fi
            echo "echo \"$password\" | cryptsetup luksFormat --batch-mode $cryptsetup_options $source_device"
            echo "echo \"$password\" | cryptsetup luksOpen $source_device $target_name"
        fi

UserInput works as advertised...

    2017-09-26 16:17:10.938445407 UserInput: called in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh line 54

    2017-09-26 16:17:26.970608078 UserInput: 'read' got user input

...but passwords then appeared in `diskrestore.sh` and in the logfile
nonetheless:

    +++ echo '2017-09-26 16:18:11.732036596 Creating luks device Foxtrot-02 on /dev/sdb1'

    +++ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 Foxtrot-02
    +++ echo abcdef5
    +++ component_created /dev/mapper/Foxtrot-02 crypt

So I've reverted this change.

@OliverO2 isn't that in debug mode? Then I would expect the passwords to
show up. Users are not expected to use ReaR in debug mode so that
regular usage would be save.

@schlomo Invocation was just `rear recover`. Neither `-d` nor `-D` were
used.

Seems like it's in `diskrestore.sh`, which begins:

    #!/bin/bash

    LogPrint "Start system layout restoration."

    mkdir -p /mnt/local
    if create_component "vgchange" "rear" ; then
        lvm vgchange -a n >/dev/null
        component_created "vgchange" "rear"
    fi

    set -e
    set -x

Log output looks like this:

Only a side note how to run commands really silently:  
To run commands that deal with confidential data  
really silently in ReaR see the comment in the  
UserInput function that reads:

<pre>
#       If confidential user input is needed also in debugscripts mode the caller of the UserInput function
#       must call it in an appropriate (temporary) environment e.g. with STDERR redirected to /dev/null like:
#           { password="$( UserInput -I PASSWORD -C -r -s -p 'Enter the pasword' )" ; } 2>/dev/null
</pre>

I.e. you need to put confidentially working commands into  
an appropriate silencing enviroment for example like

<pre>
{ root_password="$( grep '^root:' /etc/shadow | cut -d ':' -f2 )" ; } 2>/dev/null
{ echo "$root_password" ; } 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
</pre>

You cannot rely on that 'set -x' is not somehow set.  
The user can set it, a script may set it, whatever else...
