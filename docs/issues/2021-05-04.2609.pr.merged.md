@pcahyna @gozora  
currently we have in output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh (excerpt)

        # Create configuration file for "Relax-and-Recover" UEFI boot entry.
        # This file will not interact with existing Grub2 configuration in any way.
        (   echo "set btrfs_relative_path=y"
            echo "insmod efi_gop"
            echo "insmod efi_uga"
            echo "insmod video_bochs"
            echo "insmod video_cirrus"
            echo "insmod all_video"
    ...
        ) > $grub_config_dir/rear.cfg

We cleaned up that kind of explicit `insmod GRUB_module`
specifications  
some time ago because those had caused various issues, e.g. see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2390](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2390)

@pcahyna @gozora  
could you please have a look here if same kind of cleanup  
is perhaps also needed in output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
or correct me if I am wrong.  
Thank you in advance!

@jsmeix storage modules are detected automatically, but I had to re-add
video modules in 361268355f493aeb0c22069c3e143bdba5be7203, otherwise
graphics did not work. We then cleaned up those modules in
2470edf534bc836a3f13d8c48e3007a24bb63bf4 and
0cc1b6a7450133f952b8c187e85d61397a45dbe1 because we determined that
`all_video` is enough: discussion in \#2388.  
Unfortunately, the change did not propagate from `create_grub2_cfg()` in
bootloader-functions.sh to here, because 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh has its
own version of GRUB2 config code (see the XXX in
361268355f493aeb0c22069c3e143bdba5be7203)

@pcahyna  
thank you for finding the matching git commits!

I like to summarize:

On Dec 15, 2019  
the GRUB2 modules `efi_gop` `efi_uga` `video_bochs` `video_cirrus`
`all_video`  
and `set gfxpayload=keep` were added to 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/361268355f493aeb0c22069c3e143bdba5be7203](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/361268355f493aeb0c22069c3e143bdba5be7203)

On May 7, 2020  
the GRUB2 modules `video_bochs` `video_cirrus` were removed from
create\_grub2\_cfg via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0cc1b6a7450133f952b8c187e85d61397a45dbe1](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0cc1b6a7450133f952b8c187e85d61397a45dbe1)

On May 13, 2020  
the GRUB2 modules `efi_gop` `efi_uga` were removed from
create\_grub2\_cfg via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2470edf534bc836a3f13d8c48e3007a24bb63bf4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2470edf534bc836a3f13d8c48e3007a24bb63bf4)

So now there is in create\_grub2\_cfg only

    insmod all_video

    set gfxpayload=keep
    insmod gzio
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod ext2

while in 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh we have currently still

    insmod efi_gop
    insmod efi_uga
    insmod video_bochs
    insmod video_cirrus
    insmod all_video
    set gfxpayload=keep

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/361268355f493aeb0c22069c3e143bdba5be7203](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/361268355f493aeb0c22069c3e143bdba5be7203)

    XXX the Grub2 config file generation for GRUB2_RESCUE should be unified with
    config file generation for ISO (create_grub2_cfg).

things in 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh should match what we meanwhile have in
create\_grub2\_cfg  
so I should change 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh so that the code there becomes

        # Create configuration file for "Relax-and-Recover" UEFI boot entry.
        # This file will not interact with existing Grub2 configuration in any way.
        (   echo "set btrfs_relative_path=y"
            echo "insmod all_video"
            echo ""
            echo "set gfxpayload=keep"

Is that right?  
If yes I would change 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh accordingly.

What about

    insmod gzio
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod ext2

that we have in create\_grub2\_cfg but not in 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh ?

Would it be feasible to just use `create_grub2_cfg()` in
940\_grub2\_rescue.sh instead of carrying a copy of the code?

I don't know. This seemed a bit arbitrary (why ext2? What if we are
using some other filesystem?) but I avoided touching that part when
changing the GRUB2 stuff, because it was not causing any immediate
problems. Looking at log, it was added in 33305d0fa without any
explanation and it appeared de novo (the tree at that point does no have
any other occurrence of `insmod ext2`).

I am neither a sufficient UEFI expert nor a sufficient GRUB2 expert  
to implement using create\_grub2\_cfg() in 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh

Additionally this would be a too major change that exceeds too much  
the intent of this pull request.

Of course we could need some major cleanup of the whole grown  
various pieces of different bootloader related code parts in ReaR,  
e.g. cf.

the GRUB2 configuration file that is created by
output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
does no longer "insmod" the GRUB2 modules `efi_gop` `efi_uga`
`video_bochs` `video_cirrus`  
to create this GRUB2 configuration file like the create\_grub2\_cfg
function does it  
cf.

When this is wrong I can revert it back to what it was before or change
it  
to whatever I am told what "the right list of GRUB2 modules" should be
here.

@gozora @rear/contributors  
could you have a look here and ideally do a review provided you have
time for it?  
If not I would like to merge it as is "bona fide" on Monday afternoon.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your review.  
Currently I cannot do the needed complete cleanup regarding  
our various different kind of UEFI boot setup code places  
so I only added a TODO comment to have it at least described.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it as is tomorrow
afternoon.

@jsmeix no further comment on the changes from me, a TODO is enough for
the scope of the PR, but I think you should adjust the PR title and the
merge commit message, because in addition to improving user messages you
did some functional changes (removing the GRUB video modules from
generated config).

@pcahyna  
thank you for all your help here to move one step forward in the UEFI
area.
