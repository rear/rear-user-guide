-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not at all tested by me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/save/GNU/Linux/210\_raid\_layout.sh  
treat the RAID layout value '-unknown-' same as an empty value  
to avoid that layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120\_include\_raid\_code.sh  
will create a 'mdadm' command in diskrestore.sh like  
"mdadm ... --layout=-unknown- ..."  
which would fail during "rear recover" with something like  
"mdadm: layout -unknown- not understood for raid0"
