When LOGFILE is set in /etc/rear/local.conf, rear mkbackup end with an
error:

-&gt; rear mkbackup
===================

ERROR: Could not copy /var/log/rear-itsustdcrhvm02.log to nfs location  
Aborting due to an error, check /tmp/rear-itsustdcrhvm02.log for
details  
Finished in 38 seconds  
Terminated

This is in my /etc/rear/local.conf:  
LOGFILE="/var/log/rear-itsustdcrhvm02.log"

The logfile is already created before */etc/rear/local.conf* is used, so
Rear is creating it in the standard location as defined in
*default.conf*, however your new location from LOGFILE in
*/etc/rear/local.conf* seems to be used in subsequent code which cannot
find the actual log file.

If we want LOGFILE to be set by */etc/rear/local.conf* we have to change
the order in which the log file is created and the
*/etc/rear/local.conf* is read. Or instead move the logfile as soon as
it has been defined to something else, although I think that's more
trouble than necessary.

BTW we are in the process of changing the location of the log file by
default as discussed in \#103.

The default log file has now moved to */var/log/rear/*, more information
in issue \#103.
