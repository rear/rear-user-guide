ReaR version 1.17.2 is too old.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
that version is from August 2015.

Initial support for the ARM architecture was introduced  
by @Lukey3332 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662)  
that got merged in February this year (2018).

You need a more current version, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

Because the current ReaR version 2.3  
was released in December 2017  
it does not provide the initial support  
for the ARM architecture.

Accordingly you need to try out our current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code as follows:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs and add enhancements.

If the current (limited) initial support for the ARM architecture  
is insufficient for your use case you need to adapt and enhance ReaR  
as you need it for your use case, see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and the sections about  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"  
"How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover"  
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Bugs in older ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR
upstream).  
Missing features in older ReaR versions are not backported by us.

Bugs in older ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (provided the fix can be backported)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.  
Missing features in older ReaR versions are usually not backported  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.
