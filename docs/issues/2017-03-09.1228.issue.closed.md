I found a two digit named script  
backup/NETFS/GNU/Linux/30\_stop\_selinux.onhold  
and I wonder how it came into the current ReaR master.

@gdha  
I assign this issue to you because

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/GNU/Linux/30_stop_selinux.onhold
</pre>

shows that the script was renamed by you  
from 30\_stop\_selinux.sh to 30\_stop\_selinux.onhold  
in July 2011.  
Currently I cannot explain why it was not renumbered.  
Perhaps because its extension is not '.sh' but '.onhold'.

The script `backup/NETFS/GNU/Linux/310_stop_selinux.sh` is a symlink to
`backup/RSYNC/GNU/Linux/310_stop_selinux.sh` and is exactly the same
script as `30_stop_selinux.onhold`  
We better remove it.
