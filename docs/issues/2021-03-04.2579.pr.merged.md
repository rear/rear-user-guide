-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**  
    Without this adaption "rear mkrescue" on SLES15-SP3 errors out
    with  
    `ERROR: unix exists but no module file?`  
    bexause `unix` is a builtin kernel "module"  
    when not the default `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` is used  
    i.e. when modules need to be copied individually.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested by me and others at SUSE on the upcoming SLES15-SP3

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Make build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh fail-safe against  
newer modinfo (in particular modinfo in kmod-27 since SLES15-SP3)  
that outputs on stdout for builtin kernel "modules" and exits with zero
exit code like

    # modinfo -F filename unix
    name:           unix
    (builtin)

in contrast to older modinfo (in particular modinfo before kmod-27 since
SLES15-SP3)  
that outputs nothing on stdout for builtin kernel "modules" and exits
with exit code 1 like

    # modinfo -F filename unix
    modinfo: ERROR: Module unix not found.

because otherwise copying builtin kernel "modules" would let "rear
mkrescue"  
error out with e.g. "ERROR: unix exists but no module file?"

Furthermore ensure that kernel modules that should be loaded  
during recovery system startup (i.e. those in MODULES\_LOAD)  
get always copied into the recovery system.

@rear/contributors  
could you have a look here (perhaps you notice an obvious mistake)?  
If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.
