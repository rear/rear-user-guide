##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    I think the impact is `high` regardless that in practice it should
    be rarely needed  
    but when files in the recovery system are corrupt it is basically a
    must to detect them.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859)  
    and  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my usual simple SLES12 QEMU/KVM test system.  
    I expect some more false positives where it fails to verify the
    md5sum of certain files  
    on other systems and in particular in more complicated environments.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    During "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" the new script  
    build/default/995\_md5sums\_rootfs.sh  
    creates md5sums for all regular files in in the recovery system  
    and stores the result as /md5sums.txt in the recovery system.  
    During recovery system startup a new section in the  
    skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup script  
    verifies the md5sums of the files in /md5sums.txt.  
    Via the new config variable EXCLUDE\_MD5SUM\_VERIFICATION  
    the user can specify what files should be excluded from being
    verified  
    during recovery system startup or alternatively via  
    EXCLUDE\_MD5SUM\_VERIFICATION='all'  
    the whole stuff can be completely skipped.  
    By default certain files get excluded where it is known that their
    md5sum verification  
    will fail (i.e. the already known false positives are excluded by
    default).

@gdha @schabrolles  
because in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859\#issuecomment-404791010](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859#issuecomment-404791010)  
you agreed in general to this functionality  
I would like to merge its current implementation  
in this pull request soon today unless you object now.  
Of course if issues with the current implementation appear I will fix
them.
