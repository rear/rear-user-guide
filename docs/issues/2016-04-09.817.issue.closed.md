    I have done a backup via "rear -v mkbackup" and it went successfully
    but later on when I tried to boot from the .iso generated (55MB)
    I've got "no operating system installed" message. The .iso file is
    fine apparently, I was able to mount it and there are two files in
    there:

One lead... from rear.log file I've got:  
...  
...

-   source /usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ppc64.conf  
    ....

that file has:  
...  
...  
COPY\_AS\_IS=(  
"${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]}"  
/usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot  
/usr/lib/yaboot/ofboot  
/usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot.debug  
/usr/lib/yaboot/addnote  
)  
...  
...

But there is no "/usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot" file, instead I see this:
"/lib/lilo/pmac/yaboot"

well.... momentarily solved by editing
"/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/30\_create\_yaboot.sh" and skip
returning if /etc/yaboot.conf doesn't exist, because if it returns it
will never hit the last line of that file which injects "etc=etc
ppc=ppc" in the iso image creation.

Can you provide a diff what exactly you changed  
in what files so that it is easier and more clear  
what you did to make it work for your particular case.

I have basically zero personal knowledge about the PPC architecture  
but when I know what exactly you changed in what files  
to make it work for your particular case, I could perhaps  
derive a generally working solution on my own  
or I could show your changes to my colleagues at SUSE  
who know about the PPC architecture.

hello, see below but it's only a temporary workaround to get over this:

    # diff 20_install_yaboot.sh 20_install_yaboot-changed.sh
    3c3
    <   return
    ---
    >   echo return

it basically allows the script to continue even when there is no
/etc/yaboot.conf file in my system, at the end of this script it places
the "ppc" and the "etc" in the iso image, otherwise it was not readable
by my P8 system.

I'm not sure what was the rationale behind that "if" at the beginning.

@k0da  
could you have a look what goes on here.

Many thanks in advance!

@jsmeix on SLES yaboot is located at /lib/lilo/chrp/yaboot.chrp

@k0da  
regarding "on SLES yaboot is located at /lib/lilo/chrp/yaboot.chrp":

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/817\#issuecomment-207794210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/817#issuecomment-207794210)
@arielrolfo reported "I see this: /lib/lilo/pmac/yaboot"

The lilo RPM package of SLE-11-SP4 contains both  
/lib/lilo/chrp/yaboot.chrp and /lib/lilo/pmac/yaboot  
with same size and also "strings" results the same  
for both but "diff -s" tells they are different.

I don't know anything about yaboot and the above confuses me.

But it seems rear 1.18 is not yet working well  
on PPC architecture on SLE11  
at least not when yaboot is used.

@jsmeix the one @arielrolfo mentioned is for power mac. On IBM Power
systems we need to use chrp one

@arielrolfo  
in general when files are missing in the rear recovery system  
you can specify them in /etc/rear/local.conf via the  
COPY\_AS\_IS and REQUIRED\_PROGS array variables  
as described in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for example like

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" additional_program1 additional_program2 )
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2 )
</pre>

for some real examples have a look at  
/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf

@k0da I'm using a Power System E870  
@jsmeix I know that already, no issues with that, this is not related to
it.

@k0da see this pls
[https://www.debian.org/ports/powerpc/inst/yaboot-howto/ch1.en.html](https://www.debian.org/ports/powerpc/inst/yaboot-howto/ch1.en.html)
it says *"...Yaboot is a bootloader for PowerPC computers (NewWorld
PowerMacs and IBM CHRP)..."*

@arielrolfo yes, the sources are the same but binaries are different.
Please use chrp one

@k0da great, how do I pick that one ?

It should come with lilo package

rpm -ql lilo | grep yaboot.chrp
===============================

/lib/lilo/chrp/yaboot.chrp

Is there still something need to be done within rear for this issue?

@gdha, Please have a look at \#1061.  
`/etc/yaboot.conf` is not created when SLES11 is installed with LVM
system layout.  
This prevent ReaR to recreate bootloader for the DVD and the system
restrored.

@arielrolfo  
if you like to test if current ReaR GitHub master code  
(that contains
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1061](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1061))  
now works o.k. for you:

How to test the currently newest rear GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
# cd rear
# vi etc/rear/local.conf
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

I assume it works because "no news is good news".
