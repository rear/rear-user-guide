#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    OS\_VENDOR=Debian  
    OS\_VERSION=8

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<pre>
# Default is to create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
# set OUTPUT to change that
# set BACKUP to activate an automated (backup and) restore of your data
# Possible configuration values can be found in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
#
# This file (local.conf) is intended for manual configuration. For configuration
# through packages and other automated means we recommend creating a new
# file named site.conf next to this file and to leave the local.conf as it is. 
# Our packages will never ship with a site.conf.

OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL="nfs://192.168.0.5/path/to/my/share/"
</pre>

-   Real hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) and/or virtual
    machine (KVM guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    PC/Server - Dell PowerEdge R210 II

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER PPC64/PPC64LE or what
    excat ARM device):  
    x86

-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot (Open Firmware or
    Petitboot)?  
    Unsure

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Booting from the recovery iso that was made during "mkrescue" works.
    I can select auto recover option and then output gets stuck on "The
    original network interface Eth0 \[MAC Address\] is not available"

The 2 other network interfaces are listed with the numbers to select
them but pressing the number keys on the keyboard does not register. In
fact no keys on the keyboard register. The backup was done on a headless
server machine via ssh.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    None found so far.

Hi @ChrisGet,

We also had problems sometimes with some USB keyboards and we solved
them using:  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' ) in rear config (/etc/rear/local.conf).

You'll need to re-run backup with this variable in place. I hope this
solve your issue with the keyboard detection.

Regards,  
Didac

Thanks! I will try again and let you know how it goes

This fixed the keyboard problem. Thank you very much.

It seems this one is basically the same as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1860](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1860)

In both cases a Debian system is used.  
Perhaps on Debian something is different that results  
that at least on Debian 8 and 9 a USB keyboard  
does not "just work" in the ReaR recovery system?

I cannot help with Debian specific issues because I do not use it.

@didacog  
when you had already a few of such issues  
perhaps you could imagine if there is something in common  
under what circumstances those issues happen which could help us  
to enhance ReaR so that a USB keyboard always "just works"  
because nowadays that is basically mandatory.

Yes sorry I saw the other bug once I closed this one. I did look through
existing issues before raising this one but didn't think to check the
closed bugs. Apologies for the duplicate issue. I would have found my
answer on \#1860

@ChrisGet  
what I am most interested is what the actual root cause is why
sometimes  
a USB keyboard does not "just work" in the ReaR recovery system.  
If you have an idea or if you could dig into it you could help much.

@jsmeix

I had this issue 2/3 times previously and I guessed that some module was
not loading in rescue. I used 'all\_modules' to solve it, and I didn't
have time to go deeper onto the root problem. I think it was also with
Debian, then we have now an starting point to see whats happening. Maybe
@ChrisGet can try it again and check the modules loaded in the rescue
image with and without 'all\_modules' set and we can try to figure out
which module is missing.

This does not happen all times, I've recovered lots of debian systems
without issue...
