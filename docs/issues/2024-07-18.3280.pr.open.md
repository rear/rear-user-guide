##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? Not at all

-   Description of the changes in this pull request: We have scanners
    that check that no log is world readable for compliance reasons. The
    default as it is set now violates this. I currently solve it by
    fixing the mode with ansible after package install. But since the
    possibly sensitive nature of this log I think it others should not
    have read permissions. This is something only a system adminstrator
    should have a look at.

@GitarPlayer  
see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
what info we normally need.

Additionally provide information how to reproduce  
your particular issue because for me all seems to be OK:

@GitarPlayer  
oops - sorry - I falsely thought it is an issue  
but it is a pull request...

@rear/contributors

I don't know about the intended use case of  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/rsyslog.conf  
so I cannot properly review the requested change here.

@schlomo  
according to the output of

    git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/rsyslog.conf

you are basically the author of it (originated in 2009)  
so I dare to ask for your review of this pull request.

@GitarPlayer thank you for contributing to ReaR!

Can you please provide more context about how your compliance scanner
find a file that exists only on the rescue system that runs purely in
memory?

The configuration file that you want to change comes into effect only on
the rescue system and only if `rsyslog` is used.

I'd actually recommend against running compliance scanners on the rescue
system as the rescue system is very short lived and not a standard Linux
distro.

Maybe this is actually a false positive of your scanner, where the
scanner finds a file named `rsyslog.conf` and complains about it even
though it is not used on the host system?

wow thank you both for such prompt replies. So my audit scanner just
keeps complaining about world readable log files. So he basically checks
if any file in /var/log has the other bit set to anything other than
zero. But I think @schlomo is correct that it is probably not that file
causing the issue.

But what really confuses me is that now and then I do end up having a
other readable log file in /var/log/rear. Just today I received one that
was rw-rw-r. But I am not entirely sure how this happens. My
rsyslog.conf:

    module(load="imuxsock"    # provides support for local system logging (e.g. via logger command)
           SysSock.Use="off") # Turn off message reception via local log socket; 
                              # local messages are retrieved through imjournal now.
    module(load="imjournal"             # provides access to the systemd journal
           UsePid="system" # PID nummber is retrieved as the ID of the process the journal entry originates from
           StateFile="imjournal.state") # File to store the position in the journal
    global(workDirectory="/var/lib/rsyslog")
    module(load="builtin:omfile" Template="RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat")
    include(file="/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf" mode="optional")
    *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages
    authpriv.*                                              /var/log/secure
    mail.*                                                  -/var/log/maillog
    cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron
    *.emerg                                                 :omusrmsg:*
    uucp,news.crit                                          /var/log/spooler
    local7.*                                                /var/log/boot.log

my rsyslog.d/00-globals.conf:

    $FileCreateMode 0640
    global(
      DefaultNetstreamDriver="ossl"
      DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile="/etc/pki/rsyslog/ca-bundle.crt"
    )

have you ever encountered something like that in the past with rear? Or
am I the only one. I will definitely try to nail down the issue more
precisely.

Here we create the logfile and set the file permissions to be private:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0fa49b3089ad0015f1ab67335c596fc28066f2df/usr/sbin/rear\#L658-L660](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0fa49b3089ad0015f1ab67335c596fc28066f2df/usr/sbin/rear#L658-L660)

Maybe your problem is related to how you run ReaR? It doesn't run by
itself unless you set that up yourself.

@GitarPlayer I'd suggest you to reach out to us for [professional
support](https://relax-and-recover.org/support/) to help you with this
as it seems to be to be not directly a ReaR topic.
