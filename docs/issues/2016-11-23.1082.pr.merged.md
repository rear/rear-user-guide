Simplified blkid test to make restore from multiple ISOs  
also work on SLE12, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1081](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1081)  
and generally cleaned up the code for multiple ISOs.  
In particular improved messaging in case of multiple ISOs.

Now multiple ISOs "just work well"  
at least for me on SLE12.
