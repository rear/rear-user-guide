### ReaR version

Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / 2022-07-13

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

`mktemp` is called ([Line
623](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7a59d972d7368f6400bb4831f0d3d06b9ef42bad/usr/sbin/rear#L623))  
before `local.conf` is sourced ([Line
809](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7a59d972d7368f6400bb4831f0d3d06b9ef42bad/usr/sbin/rear#L809)),  
which means that a user-specified `$TMPDIR` gets not respected.

### Platform

Linux x64

### OS version

OS\_VENDOR=SUSE\_LINUX OS\_VERSION=15

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

specify in `/etc/rear/local.conf`:

    export TMPDIR='/var/tmp/rear'

expected:  
ReaR would place temporary Directories like
`/var/tmp/rear/rear.aGDiX8SMeWnpJYX`

actual:  
ReaR still creates temporary Directories like
`/var/tmp/rear.aGDiX8SMeWnpJYX` instead

@cocker-cc  
specifying TMPDIR in etc/rear/local.conf is not supported.

In ReaR 2.7 usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf shows

    # To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover call
    #   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
    # before calling 'rear' (/prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist).

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L53C1-L55C81>

In the current ReaR 2.9 release we have a check in sbin/rear

    saved_tmpdir="$TMPDIR"
    ...
    # All workflows need to read the configurations first.
    ...
    if [ "$saved_tmpdir" != "$TMPDIR" ] ; then
        Error "Setting TMPDIR in a configuration file is not supported. To specify a working area directory prefix, export TMPDIR before executing '$PROGRAM'"
