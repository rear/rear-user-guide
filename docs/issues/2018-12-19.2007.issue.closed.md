-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    When rear is called through a script that runs from crontab, no Borg
    stats appear in the log file, as was the case until at least rear v
    2.00. If rear is run manually in the command line then the stats
    appear in the screen but not in the log files. As we are analyzing
    Borg stats in the log files to decide if the backup was successful
    for over 100 servers, this creates a problem for us.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    To manually replace the new "500\_make\_backup.sh" script with the
    old one, every time rear is updated.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Probably.  
Is there any other way to have Borg stats to the log file?

For now, after every version upgrade we are copying the older
"500\_make\_backup.sh" files to all servers using Ansible.

In backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh (excerpt)

    borg create ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8

runs `borg create` with the original stdin, stdout, and stderr file
descriptors  
when `rear` was launched that are saved as fd6, fd7, and fd8
respectively,  
cf. "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Accordingly it should work to launch `rear` with appropriately
redirected  
stdout, and stderr to some separated log file.

For example for me

    usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue 2>&1 | tee -a /tmp/rear.tty.log

seems to work as expected (I get in `/tmp/rear.tty.log`  
the same as I get on my terminal where I run it).

Regarding stdin see "It should be possible to run ReaR unattended" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Nice idea, but I'm also getting in the log file all the mumbo jumbo of
the borg progress output. It would be very nice if I could only get the
final stats.

I am not a Borg user so that I don't know what  
`the borg progress output` actually is, if it is caused  
by the `--progress` or `--stats` option but basically it seems  
to be in backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh the lines

    # Only in ReaR verbose mode also show borg progress output and stats
    local borg_progress=''
    test "$verbose" && borg_progress='--progress --stats'

where you get both if you run `rear -v`.

I guess one of them should be only shown in debug mode, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1588\#issuecomment-346308767](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1588#issuecomment-346308767)  
i.e. something like

    # Only in ReaR verbose mode also show Borg stats output
    # and in ReaR debug mode additionally show Borg progress
    # (debug mode implies verbose mode, cf. usr/sbin/rear):
    local borg_progress=''
    test "$VERBOSE" && borg_progress='--stats'
    test "$DEBUG" && borg_progress='--progress --stats'

or similar (not tested by me because I do not use Borg).

@jsmeix like many time before your guess is right!  
I'll prepare PR to allow user to decide if he wants to have stats and
progress shown or not.  
My idea would be to give user final power to decide what will be shown
using booleans BORGBACKUP\_SHOW\_STATS="yes/no" and
BORGBACKUP\_SHOW\_PROGRESS="yes/no"

The reason why I don't like
`test "$DEBUG" && borg_progress='--progress --stats'` very much is that
some users might want to see just a progress without additional
debugging information.

@nikasl You will still need to `tee` output somewhere ...

With `BORGBACKUP_SHOW_PROGRESS="yes"`

    fedora:(/root)(root)# rear mkbackuponly      
    851.51 MB O 424.73 MB C 2.19 MB D 7042 N usr/lib64/python3.6/distutils/__pycache__/unixccompiler.cpython-36.opt-2.pyc       

Side-effect of this change is that what Borg shows is not longer
controlled by `rear --verbose or rear --debug`, but I think this gives
finer control for output.

Thanks for your help guys, it should be much better this way, to have
finer control on the output.

@nikasl  
a side note regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2007\#issuecomment-448613291](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2007#issuecomment-448613291)  
`/usr/sbin/rear -v -C local mkbackup`:

According to `man rear`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
the `-C` option is only for an `additional config file`  
and not for the default config files like etc/rear/local.conf.

With `-C local` the default config file etc/rear/local.conf  
gets sourced (and executed) two times.  
First by default and then again because of `-C local`  
cf. in usr/sbin/rear "Combine configuration files" in particular
starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L442](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L442)

Usually this has no negative effect but when you specify e.g.

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/var/log/lastlog' '/var/lib/mysql' )

you get that executed two times which results that '/var/log/lastlog'
and  
'/var/lib/mysql' are added two times to the BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE
array  
which probably does by luck also not have an actual negative effect  
but things do not work fully right this way.

@jsmeix

Thank you very much for this info!!

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2008](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2008)
merged user can now decide with:

    BORGBACKUP_SHOW_STATS="yes/no"
    BORGBACKUP_SHOW_PROGRESS="yes/no"

if he wants to see Borg stats after ReaR backup finished and/or Borg
progress during ReaR backup session.  
Since this output will not be stored into ReaR log file, user is advised
to use other Linux tools to store this information.  
One great example can be found in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2007\#issuecomment-448618562](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2007#issuecomment-448618562).

I guess no one would mind if I close this issue now.

@nikasl  
because neither @gozora nor I are Borg users  
we need now your feedback whether or not the enhancement in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2008](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2008)  
makes things work for you as you need it.

FYI:

How to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
into a separated directory and then configure and run ReaR  
from within that directory like:

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear.github.master

    # cd rear.github.master

    # vi etc/rear/local.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".
