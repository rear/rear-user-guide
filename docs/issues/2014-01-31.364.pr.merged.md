Hi,  
After the backup of a server with the eth0 interface configured in DHCP
mode.  
I started the recovery system, and the dhclient command has not been
executed. The culprit is get\_device\_by\_hwaddr that returns no
interface. I think this command was executed too early because when I
sourced manually 58-start-dhclient.sh the script works fine ! Adding a
sleep 5 before calling get\_device\_by\_hwaddr fixes this issue (tested
5 or 6 times to be sure )

    RESCUE # cat /etc/rear/rescue.conf
    # line below was automatically added by 21_include_dhclient.sh
    USE_DHCLIENT=y
    DHCLIENT_BIN=dhclient
    DHCLIENT6_BIN=
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=""
    NETFS_PREFIX="node11"
