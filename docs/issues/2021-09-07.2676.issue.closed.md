It works with that etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null

@jsmeix you can assign the issue to me if you want. Some analysis here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667\#issuecomment-914447326](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667#issuecomment-914447326),
there are probably many places that are not prepared to handle empty
`OUTPUT_URL`, especially an empty output from `url_scheme`.

Continuing the discussion from \#2667 :

> If so, one might simply set `OUTPUT_URL=null`, if otherwise unset, in
> default.conf or in some script.

This would need to happen after
`usr/share/rear/prep/default/020_translate_url.sh` and
`usr/share/rear/prep/default/030_translate_tape.sh` as these two scripts
set `OUTPUT_URL` if otherwise unset.  
This also means that the semantics of empty `OUTPUT_URL` is somewhat
special: it means, take the value from `USB_DEVICE` if set, else set it
to `BACKUP_URL`, and if still empty, set it according to `TAPE_DEVICE`.
(Why is `TAPE_DEVICE` handled differently from `USB_DEVICE`?)

Hi @jsmeix, it seems that the simplest fix would be to treat empty
scheme as `null`.

WDYT?

@pcahyna

In output/default/250\_create\_lock.sh

    scheme_supports_filesystem "$scheme" || return 0

does not help because `scheme_supports_filesystem ""` returns success  
so `scheme_supports_filesystem()` needs to be made more fail-safe  
(in general it is better to improve the function instead of all its
callers)  
so this change fixes this issue here for me

By the way:  
We also have backup/NETFS/default/250\_create\_lock.sh  
and its symlink backup/BLOCKCLONE/default/250\_create\_lock.sh  
but those don't call scheme\_supports\_filesystem.

Currently I cannot foresee what unexpected obscure side effects might
appear  
in this or that special cases if we set an empty scheme as "null".  
I would have to do a thorough analysis of how all that code actually
works  
but I would prefer to not having to do that right now ;-)

What worries me is code like

    scheme=$( url_scheme $BACKUP_URL )

Because the scheme is the leading part up to '://' in a URL  
it means if we set an empty / non-existent scheme as "null"  
such calls would result that scheme="null" but perhaps  
the caller's code expects scheme="" when there is no  
leading part up to '://' in a URL?

@pcahyna  
if my change of scheme\_supports\_filesystem() in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676\#issuecomment-915133176](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676#issuecomment-915133176)  
looks OK to you (i.e. if you would approve such a change)  
I would add that change to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2675](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2675)  
and merge it to get both
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667)  
and this one
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)
fixed.

Sure. Adding quotes around `$scheme` are necessary to support empty
scheme properly, but not sufficient, other changes are needed.
