Hello,

After rear upgrade to version 1.19, I have just noticed that
basebackup.txt and timestamp.txt files are not updated.

@gkanmaz  
And what exactly goes wrong now for you?

I implemented real incremental plus differential backup  
after the ReaR 1.19 release which was on Oct 11 2016.

Since I implemented real incremental plus differential backup  
there are no loger the timestamp.txt and basebackup.txt files,  
see my commit from Nov. 18 2016:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/eca18f9459ea78d440061e005c35713918985ecd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/eca18f9459ea78d440061e005c35713918985ecd)

I.e. you do not use the ReaR 1.19 release  
but some current ReaR GitHub master code.

All needed information is now calculated from  
the backup file names.

All that happens in 070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh)

I tried to implement it so that it works in a backward compatible way  
as far as possible - except that now BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental  
is real incremental backup and for the previous behaviour one  
needs now BACKUP\_TYPE=differential, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073\#issuecomment-264127724](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1073#issuecomment-264127724)

See default.conf how now real incremental or differential backup  
works.

@jsmeix

I have below script runs daily in order to prune incremental and full
backup files older than last full backup date. The script uses date
value in timestamp.txt file.

Source of the script :
[https://www.harperink.de/?p=2735](https://www.harperink.de/?p=2735)

\#!/bin/bash  
SYNOLOGY\_BASE="/volume1/NFS/rear/"  
cd $SYNOLOGY\_BASE

for dir in `ls -1`;  
do  
tar\_dosya\_sayisi=`ls $SYNOLOGY_BASE$dir/*.tar.gz | wc -l`  
if \[\[ -f "$SYNOLOGY\_BASE$dir/timestamp.txt" && $tar\_dosya\_sayisi
&gt; 1 \]\]  
then  
echo "$dir - $tar\_dosya\_sayisi"  
cd $SYNOLOGY\_BASE$dir  
find $SYNOLOGY\_BASE$dir/\*tar.gz -type f ! -newer
$SYNOLOGY\_BASE$dir/timestamp.txt | xargs rm -f  
fi  
done

You need to adapt your script so that  
all needed information is calculated  
from the backup file names.

This is not an issue in ReaR but in that script  
(a third-party script - from ReaR's point of view).

FYI:  
My personal opinion to prune backups based on whatever information  
in whatever additional files is unreliably.  
To prune old files I would implement it in a way to query  
the files directly - not any indirect other source of information  
(cf. RFC 1925 item 6a: "It is always possible to add another  
level of indirection").  
In case of backups I would even try to inspect the content  
of the backup if possible to get the needed information and  
use the backup file dates only as fallback.
