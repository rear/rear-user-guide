#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / 2017-07-20
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release
    -a):OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer 7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NSR
NSRSERVER=xxxxhpsrm411
NSR_SERVER=xxxxhpsrm411
NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME=DD411-SRVBACK
NSR_RETENTION_TIME="4 week"
</pre>

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    i think uefi
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I want to create an rescue-ISO of my backup-server, named
    xxxxhpsrmn03 and save it on the second Backup-Server named
    xxxxhpsrm411 to have rescue-system available if xxxxhpsrmn03
    crashes. I use EMC Networker 9.1.x.  
    xxxxhpsrmn03 is configured as a client on xxxxhpsrm411 and the
    backup runs without problems.  
    To configure rear, I created a local.conf with this content:

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NSR
NSR_SERVER=xxxxhpsrm411                                        the destination backup-server
NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME=DD411-SRVBACK      the destination pool on xxxxhpsrm411                                       
NSR_RETENTION_TIME="4 week"
</pre>

“rear dump” looks fine:

<pre>
…
                    local.conf : OK
Backup with NSR
                   NSR_DEFAULT_POOL_NAME = DD411-SRVBACK
                   NSR_RETENTION_TIME = 4 week
                   NSR_ROOT_DIR = /nsr
                   NSR_SERVER = xxxxhpsrm411
                   BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK =
</pre>

The command, that is created at runtime looks like this:

<pre>
root     23291 28340  0 16:06 pts/0    00:00:00 save -s xxxxhpsrmn03 -c xxxxhpsrmn03 -N REAR.20171025 -b DD411-SRVBACK -y 4 week /var/lib/rear/output/rear-xxxxhpsrmn03.iso
</pre>

NSR\_SERVER=xxxxhpsrm411 in local.conf is not considered. I also tried
NSRSERVER, but that is missing in “rear dump”  
Where does rear take the NSRSERVER/NSR\_SERVER from if not from
local.conf ?

-   Work-around, if any:

I have no experience with NSR but right config variable looks to be
[NSRSERVER](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1090)

check of
[460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/NSR/default/460_save_nsr_server_name.sh)
might help you to check how NSRSEVER is set in ReaR.

Hello Vladimir,  
thank you for the hint , where to find the place where NSRSERVER is
handled.  
I had to dig a little deeper to find the reason for my problem.  
I will try to describe it here:  
If you start rear for the first time, the script
rescue/NSR/default/460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh  
finds the NSRSERVER and writes it to /var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr\_server.
Rear delivers the output as exepected.  
If you decide to use another backupserver and you add the line  
"NSRSERVER=anotherbackupserver" to the local.conf file, the
NSRSERVER-variable is set in the main script. During the workflow, the
script layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh sets
NSRSERVER back to the "old" value, stored in
/var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr\_server.

NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR\_DIR/recovery/nsr\_server)  
CLIENTNAME=$(hostname)

The script rescue/NSR/default/460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh runs after
650... and has nothing to do,  
because NSRSERVER is already set, but with the wrong value.  
After i removed the line NSRSERVER=... form 650... rear worked as i
expected.

Another little point is, that NSRSERVER should be displayed in "rear
dump". But  
the variables are only displayed if they have an underscore. For
example, NSR\_SERVER would be displayed. Please see lib/dump-workflow.

Thank you and best regards  
thuens

Cannot be done until ReaR 2.3 is released  
so that I set the milestone to ReaR 2.4.

@thuens So, the request is to rename variable `NSRSERVER` into
`NSR_SERVER`, right? If we do that we should make sure that if the
variable `NSRSERVER` is set (legacy name of the variable) it is copied
into the new variable `NSR_SERVER` (during the **prep** phase).  
I have no objection against it - will you prepare a pull request?

As not response came back - I will close this request until further
notice.
