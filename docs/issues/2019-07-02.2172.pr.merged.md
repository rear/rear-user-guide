… in the actual raw block device, we fail to confirm it via udev since
TEMP\_USB\_DEVICE never gets set via the first two conditions... so,
let's check to see if we've set RAW\_USB\_DEVICE also.

@gdha  
I assign it to you because that code part originates from you according
to

Sure thing... what's the etiquette here for adding another change?
Second pull request? Modify original pull request? My github-fu is
lacking...

Oh, nevermind... duh. Looks like it pulled in my follow-up commit
automagically. Neato.

So, I think looking at this more, that passing in a raw block device,
such as /dev/sdc isn't ever going to work, since the usb code path
doesn't assert that any partition be created and used, such as /dev/sdc1
... I was assuming that if you gave a raw block device, it would assume
that. So, this change, as the tool is presently designed... is mostly
pointless.

@sidrew  
you must run once something like

    rear -v format /dev/sdc

or e.g. with a format workflow specific option like

    rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdc

to prepare your USB device for use with ReaR.

Note the mandatory '--' before the format workflow specific  
options ('-v' is the generic rear option).  
Without that the format workflow specific options won't work  
(for background information about that see the getopt documentation).  
Valid format workflow options are: `-e/--efi -f/--force -y/--yes`  
(for details inspect the code in usr/share/rear/lib/format-workflow.sh  
and mainly in
usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh).

"rear format" prepares a whole disk device like /dev/sdc  
by creating partitions and creating filesystems on it, cf.  
the various USB\_DEVICE\_\* config variables in default.conf  
and see "man rear" e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and the section "Configuring Relax-and-Recover for USB storage devices"
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)

Sure, that's not the issue. I had formatted the drive. The problem is
that when the base block device is passed in via USB\_DEVICE, e.g.
/dev/sdr ... rear tries to use that to install the rescue image. It
doesn't scan the device looking for any label... it doesn't assume
/dev/sdr1 ...

This pull request was to address that if I passed the base block device,
this helper script was unable to determine RAW\_USB\_DEVICE... since
it's expecting to have a partition passed in USB\_DEVICE. This patch
addressed it being able to figure out RAW\_USB\_DEVICE... but, doesn't
address the overall issue that really, the rest of the workflow needs to
know about a partition in which to install rescue and backup data.
