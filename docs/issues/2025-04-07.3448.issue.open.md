### Requesting support or just a question

I can backup to SMB, but backup to tape drive fails.

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output

Debian12, rear installed from Debian repository. Relax-and-Recover 2.7 /
Git. New Lenovo Server with Ultrium9 SAS drive. I've tested read and
write with tools like mt and tar. Drive works fine. Until the tape drive
arrived, I had used rear with a SMB network share with no problems.

Modified the local.conf to reflect new tape drive. Here are the relevant
lines:

    OUTPUT=OBDR
    TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0

    rear -d mkbackup results in this:
    ... (not including previous lines)

    Running 'rescue' stage ======================
    Creating recovery system root filesystem skeleton layout
    ERROR: Failed to copy '/usr/share/rear/skel/default' contents to /var/tmp/rear.wqVfrLLtDdiDtFk/rootfs
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 010_merge_skeletons.sh:
      2025-04-07 08:22:15.177389748 Creating recovery system root filesystem skeleton layout
      2025-04-07 08:22:15.186073304 Copying '/usr/share/rear/skel/default' contents to /var/tmp/rear.wqVfrLLtDdiDtFk/rootfs
      tar: /dev/nst0: Cannot open: Device or resource busy
      tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

The first ERROR looks like a failure to copy one folder into another. I
thought maybe a permissions or something, but modifying the local.conf
to go back to a SMB share works and I don't see how changing the output
could affect a file copy on the local hard drive. The second issue is
the "tar: /dev/nst0: Cannot open: Device or resource busy" line. Makes
it seem the tape drive is busy, but I assure you that nothing else is
using it. I tried running "lsof | grep nst0" to see if anything had it
open, but nothing.

Any help is appreciated as I'm under a deadline to get this machine into
production with a good backup/restore solution.

@DebianGuru Please use `rear -D mkbackup` so we can see the logs in more
detail - thanks for trying OBDR - it has been ages ago somebody used it.

First and foremost:  
I never used a tape device with Linux  
so I cannot really help with tape device issues  
and I may not see things which are obvious  
for users who actually use a tape device.

So only FYI:

In general regarding OBDR we had  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637)

In particular regarding OBDR and 'tar' we  
got this information:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637\#issuecomment-1475690995](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637#issuecomment-1475690995)

    Here we need to update config file with "" and ()
    because of tar behavior, mentioned also in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911
    ...
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

Apparently  
/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh  
is not yet fixed, see current master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540_set_backup_compression.sh)  
and same in ReaR 2.7  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540_set_backup_compression.sh)

@DebianGuru

you may try out if it perhaps helps when you modify  
/usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh  
to this content

    # Disable compression (as tape drive does compression already)
    Log "Disable compression for backup (BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_*)"
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

and/or set in local.conf

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

For the details behind you may read through

In general regarding code that sets BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS='

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:
    # like BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( -I 'gzip -9 -n -c' )
    # Furthermore for advanced things like BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=("--zstd")
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( --gzip )

    usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540_set_backup_compression.sh:
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=

    usr/share/rear/output/OBDR/default/840_write_image.sh:
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()

In usr/share/rear/output/OBDR/default/840\_write\_image.sh  
setting BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS was fixed by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/48338ae142b8b585a52e17f2438e31e46dd2c312](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/48338ae142b8b585a52e17f2438e31e46dd2c312)  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2963](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2963)

But apparently setting BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS correctly in  
usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh  
had been forgotten.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3450](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3450)  
intends to get that generic syntax error finally fixed.

@DebianGuru

for "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue" it cannot help to modify  
usr/share/rear/verify/OBDR/NETFS/default/540\_set\_backup\_compression.sh  
because scripts in usr/share/rear/verify/  
are not run for "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue"  
(they are run for "rear recover" and "rear restoreonly")  
so syntactically false setting of BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
is likely not the reason why "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue"  
fails for you and BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS is not used in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/010\_merge\_skeletons.sh  
which is where "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue" fails for you.

Fellas, thanks for the help.  
I did find the strangest thing.  
I was running this as root via "sudo su - " then running rear.  
I also had environment variable "TAPE=/dev/nst0" in bash.  
I removed the environment variable then, run the command with just "sudo
rear -v mkbackup" and it worked.

Unfortunately, afterwards, I cannot find any way to get my Lenovo SR
650V3 to boot of the SAS Ultrium9 drive.  
I tried UEFI and legacy.  
So I'm back to the drawing board of building an .iso somewhere then
burning/booting from CD. (or perhaps using a flash drive to boot).

Unfortunately, another issue has cropped up and that will be in my next
post.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3451](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3451)

Thanks again for all the help and suggestions.

@DebianGuru  
I have no idea how an environment variable "TAPE=/dev/nst0"  
could influence what "rear mkbackup" does because  
as far as I see TAPE is not used as variable in ReaR.  
Only TAPE\_BLOCKSIZE TAPE\_DEVICE TAPE\_LABEL are used in ReaR.  
Perhaps a program which is called by rear  
may use TAPE as environment variable?

Current GitHub master code and same in ReaR 2.7:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'TAPE' | grep -v 'TAPE_DEVICE'

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:
    # (NETFS, ISO, TAPE ...)
    TAPE_BLOCKSIZE=

    usr/share/rear/prep/TAPE/default/500_set_tape_blocksize.sh:
    Log "Set tape block size to ${TAPE_BLOCKSIZE:-0}"

    usr/share/rear/prep/OBDR/default/500_check_tape_label.sh:
    [[ "$USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL" == "${TAPE_LABEL:0:8}" ]]
