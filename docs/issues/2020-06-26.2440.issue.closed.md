-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I have a system which is used for different OS flavours .. i.e. SLES
12SP3, 12SP4, RHEL 7.5, 7.6 etc  
when I perform the rear back, it moves the previous backup in to .old
folder on NFS mount.

when I am doing a restore, how do I pick a specific backup.tar.gz ?  
by default it seems to pick the latest backup.tar.gz

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Simply put: You cannot (from within the ReaR recovery system).

With

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.254.132.1/export/rear/

you get the backup of your files made with tar and stored on your NFS
server  
there in a $HOSNTAME directory as backup.tar.gz file.

During "rear recover" that exact backup.tar.gz file  
from the $HOSNTAME directory on your NFS server gets restored.

This means whatever backup.tar.gz file you have  
in that $HOSNTAME directory on your NFS server will get restored.

So what you can do to restore another backup is to place  
another backup.tar.gz file in the $HOSNTAME directory on your NFS
server  
before you run "rear recover".

Some background information  
regarding how to restore different operating systems  
on same hardware (could be also same virtual hardware).

Precondition:  
At a point in time there is only one operating system installed on the
hardware.  
I.e. the different operating systems are installed mutually exclusive.

Example use case:  
One has several production servers with same hardware  
where different operating systems should be used for different
servers.  
One has one piece of that server hardware in the testing lab.  
On the testing hardware the different operating systems get installed
mutually exclusive.

To recreate the one testing hardware with different operating systems  
by using "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" it is crucial to know  
where "rear mkbackup" stores what information of the system.

"rear mkbackup" results the same as "rear mkrescue" and then "rear
mkbackuponly".

"rear mkrescue" creates the ReaR recovery system.

"rear mkbackuponly" makes only a backup of the files of the system.

The ReaR recovery system is specific for the system where "rear
mkrescue" was run.  
The ReaR recovery system contains in particular
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
where the disk layout (partitioning, filesystems, mountpoints, and so
on) is stored  
and it contains etc/rear/local.conf where in particular backup related
config variables  
like `BACKUP_URL` are stored.

The backup contains only the plain files (and directories) of the
system.

What ReaR recovery system is booted determines what disk layout  
(partitioning, filesystems, mountpoints, and so on) will be recreated  
and wherefrom the backup will be restored (via `BACKUP_URL` and  
other backup related config variables) when "rear recover" is run.

To recreate the one testing hardware with different operating systems  
one needs different ReaR recovery systems plus different matching
backups.
