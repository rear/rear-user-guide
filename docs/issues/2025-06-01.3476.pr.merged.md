@gdha, you should never manually rebase dependabot PRs. Please, use the
`@dependabot rebase` command instead.

Good to know - thanks @lzaoral

@lzaoral  
out of curiosity:  
Why should one never manually rebase dependabot PRs?

The reason why I ask is that it worries me  
when there are different types of PRs  
where special insider knowledge is needed  
to recognize them and to handle them properly.

@jsmeix Sorry for not replying sooner, I must have somehow missed the
notification.

> Why should one never manually rebase dependabot PRs?

If you push extra commits to a branch created by dependabot, you will
effectively disable it, unless you tag it directly using the
`@dependabot` command as noted in the PR description and docs:
<https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates#allowing-dependabot-to-rebase-and-force-push-over-extra-commits>

Of course, if you are aware of this behaviour and you still wish to push
to dependabot's branches, that's fine.

@lzaoral  
thank you for your reply, in particular with  
the link to the matching Dependabot documentation!

Unfortunately it seems I am too slow-witted to understand it  
because I fail to see WHY "Dependabot will stop rebasing  
a pull request once extra commits have been pushed to it".  
It must be obvious for everyone who works with it  
so no reason needs to be told (or it is told at another place)  
and for me it means it is better when I stay away from it ;-)

A newer version of redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck
exists, but since this PR has been edited by someone other than
Dependabot I haven't updated it. You'll get a PR for the updated version
as normal once this PR is merged.
