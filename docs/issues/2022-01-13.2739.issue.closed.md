    # This file etc/rear/local.conf is intended for the user's
    # manual configuration of Relax-and-Recover (ReaR).
    # For configuration through packages and other automated means
    # we recommend a separated file named site.conf next to this file
    # and leave local.conf as is (ReaR upstream will never ship a site.conf).
    # The default OUTPUT=ISO creates the ReaR rescue medium as ISO image.
    # You need to specify your particular backup and restore method for your data
    # as the default BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does not really do that (see "man rear").
    # Configuration variables are documented in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    # and the examples in /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ can be used as templates.
    # ReaR reads the configuration files via the bash builtin command 'source'
    # so bash syntax like VARIABLE="value" (no spaces at '=') is mandatory.
    # Because 'source' executes the content as bash scripts you can run commands
    # within your configuration files, in particular commands to set different
    # configuration values depending on certain conditions as you need like
    # CONDITION_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special_value" || VARIABLE="usual_value"
    # but that means CONDITION_COMMAND gets always executed when 'rear' is run
    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When running the `rear -dvV mkrescue` command, it gives the error:

    Copying all kernel modules in /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64 (MODULES contains 'all_modules')
    ERROR: Failed to copy all kernel modules in /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 400_copy_modules.sh:

    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-rhel7-9-packer2.log for details

From the debug output, it looks like ReaR is running the command:

`cp --verbose -t /var/tmp/rear.wFxcnNuhnHxRVPZ/rootfs -a -L --parents /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64`

When I run this command manually, it gives this message:

    # cp --verbose -t /var/tmp/rear.wFxcnNuhnHxRVPZ/rootfs -a -L --parents /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64 | grep cp:
    cp: cannot stat ‘/lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64/build’: No such file or directory
    cp: cannot stat ‘/lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64/source’: No such file or directory

NOTE: I added the grep command to remove all the successful copy
messages.

If I run `ls -la` on those two files, I see this:

    # ls -la /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64/build /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64/source
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 44 Jan  4 11:54 /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64/build -> /usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root  5 Jan  4 11:55 /lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64/source -> build

If I run `ls -la` on `/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64` we
see that it does not exist:

    # ls -la /usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64
    ls: cannot access /usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64: No such file or directory

It seems that this invocation of the `cp` command cannot deal with links
that go nowhere.

-   Workaround, if any:

If I touch the missing file, the `rear mkrescue` command will work:

` touch /usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64`

@DamaniN I could reproduce this on an actual CentOS 7.9 VM with current
github version of ReaR. Your current workaround would be to use ReaR 2.6
release / `Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / 2020-06-17` instead.  
It also shows the broken symlinks but continues creating the rescue
image.

Simple reproducer:

    # mkdir cp-L_test

    # cd cp-L_test

    # echo foo > foo

    # ln -s foo foosymlink

    # ln -s bar barsymlink

    # file *
    barsymlink: broken symbolic link to bar
    foo:        ASCII text
    foosymlink: symbolic link to foo

    # mkdir /tmp/somewhere

    # cp -t /tmp/somewhere -L *
    cp: cannot stat 'barsymlink': No such file or directory

    # echo $?
    1

    # file /tmp/somewhere/*
    /tmp/somewhere/foo:        ASCII text
    /tmp/somewhere/foosymlink: ASCII text

Unfortunately there is no `cp` option to let it skip/ignore broken
symlinks and  
unfortunately the `cp` exit code cannot be used to distinguish this case
from real errors.

This happens since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/bd8e32c06bf49a8630ade196be54193aa129d146](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/bd8e32c06bf49a8630ade196be54193aa129d146)

    Update 400_copy_modules.sh
    ...
    Additionally in case of MODULES=( 'all_modules' ) also use 'cp -L' to
    copy the actual content to avoid dangling symlinks in the recovery system.
    ...
         if IsInArray "all_modules" "${MODULES[@]}" ; then
    ...
    -        if ! cp $verbose -t $ROOTFS_DIR -a --parents ...
    +        if ! cp $verbose -t $ROOTFS_DIR -a -L --parents ...

so the simpler and better workaround is to remove that '-L' there  
in usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
so you can still use our GitHub master code and test it on your
systems  
and report issues to us which we need from you and which is much
appreciated  
because for me it "just works" (of course - otherwise I would not have
commited it).

So now I have to also care about dangling symlinks on the original
system.

@DamaniN A simple workaround is to add a

`MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' ) `

to Your `site.conf` if You do not need to use the rescue image for
migrations. In my VM Your issue just occurs for the `all_modules`
(default) use case.

Maybe there is an easier approach:  
I suppose You can keep the `-L` in the `MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )`
case resuming the struggle in \#2677 was related to the `readlink -e`
part determining the real path of the loaded modules.

For the case `MODULES = ( 'all_modules' )` You might revert to the
previous 2.6's `cp -a` solution since this did not cause an issue.

@jsmeix, thanks for the workarounds. I would suggest that since adding
the `-L` option to `cp` seems to be a breaking change to existing
systems, users should have to opt-in to it. Providing some flag to
enable `-L` on `cp` may be preferred for the GA release of the next
version of ReaR. Otherwise, many working systems may be broken by the
update.

When on the original system there is  
`/lib/modules/symlink -> /somewhere/else/kernel_module`  
the recovery system must contain the actual kernel module  
and not only the dangling/broken symlink `/lib/modules/symlink`.

This is why '-L' is also needed for `MODULES = ( 'all_modules' )`.  
If '-L' would be omitted for `MODULES = ( 'all_modules' )`  
and `kernel_module` is really needed (e.g. when it is loaded by the
kernel)  
then the recovery system would work with
`MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )`  
but it would fail with the default `MODULES = ( 'all_modules' )`  
which means ReaR would result by default a broken recovery system.

The latter would be a much more severe bug compared to the current  
error exit during "rear mkrescue" because of a bug in the original
system  
(dangling/broken symlinks can happen but they cannot be "right")  
that can easily be fixed by the admin of the original system  
(remove the broken symlink if is is not needed or install  
the actual content where the dangling symlink points to).

When Linux distributions have /lib/modules/ with broken symlinks  
it is a bug in what they provide.  
E.g. on my one openSUSE leap 15.3 system there is no symlink in
/lib/modules/  
(`find /lib/modules/ -type l` shows nothing)  
and on my other openSUSE leap 15.3 system with Nvidia drivers I have

    # find /lib/modules/ -type l | xargs file
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/source:                                 symbolic link to /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/weak-updates/updates/nvidia-uvm.ko:     symbolic link to /lib/modules/5.3.18-57-default/updates/nvidia-uvm.ko
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/weak-updates/updates/nvidia-peermem.ko: symbolic link to /lib/modules/5.3.18-57-default/updates/nvidia-peermem.ko
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/weak-updates/updates/nvidia-modeset.ko: symbolic link to /lib/modules/5.3.18-57-default/updates/nvidia-modeset.ko
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/weak-updates/updates/nvidia-drm.ko:     symbolic link to /lib/modules/5.3.18-57-default/updates/nvidia-drm.ko
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/weak-updates/updates/nvidia.ko:         symbolic link to /lib/modules/5.3.18-57-default/updates/nvidia.ko
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/build:                                  symbolic link to /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37-obj/x86_64/default

A problem with those particular symlinks

    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/source -> /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37
    /lib/modules/5.3.18-59.37-default/build -> /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37-obj/x86_64/default

is that `cp -a -L` copies all in /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37  
and all in /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37-obj/x86\_64/default  
which contain in my case 17549 and 9944 files that are no kernel
modules  
that needlessly increase the recovery system size by 123M (uncompressed)

    # du -hs /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37 /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37-obj/x86_64/default
    107M    /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37
    16M     /usr/src/linux-5.3.18-59.37-obj/x86_64/default

which increases the recovery system initrd size by about 16M
(compressed).  
But this is a separated problem.

In general:  
ReaR is not there to silently ignore bugs in the original system.  
ReaR is also not there to search for bugs in the original system.  
But when ReaR is hit by a bug it must not silently ignore it,  
cf. the section "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

The question is if ReaR really needs to error out when  
`cp -a -L` fails for `MODULES = ( 'all_modules' )`  
or if only a LogPrintError user info message  
could be reasonably sufficient in this case?

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e929ae63c65ef604c678322d92ca13ff99675b63](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e929ae63c65ef604c678322d92ca13ff99675b63)  
we do no longer error out if 'cp -a -L' failed to to copy all contents
of /lib/modules/...  
but we tell the user about the issue so he could inspect his system and
decide.

At least for now this issue should be reasonably mitigated.  
Perhaps a real solution could be developed later.

The actual root cause is a broken original system (i.e. broken symlink).

BTW, does not `490_fix_broken_links.sh` take care about those broken
links anyway?

build/default/490\_fix\_broken\_links.sh cares about broken symlinks
inside the recovery system  
but 'cp -L path/to/broken\_symlink' won't copy the broken symlink into
the recovery system  
and build/default/490\_fix\_broken\_links.sh can only fix broken
symlinks in the recovery system  
where the matching symlink on the original system is not broken (i.e.
has an actual target).  
Only the user can fix a broken symlink on his original system:  
Either remove the broken symlink if is is not needed  
or provide the right content where the dangling symlink points to.

@hpannenb  
or do you mean that we should in general not specfically care about
symlinks  
in the individual scripts i.e. that in general we just copy symlinks as
symlinks  
and leave it completely to build/default/490\_fix\_broken\_links.sh  
to fix the broken symlinks inside the recovery system?

On first glance this looks wrong because each code part should do its
task right  
but on a second glance fix only actually broken symlinks in a generic
script at the end  
could have general advantages.

Example:  
Assume in the original system there are

    /path/to/huge_file
    /path1/to/symlink1 -> /path/to/huge_file
    /path2/to/symlink2 -> /path/to/huge_file

then 'cp -L' results that in the recovery system  
both /path1/to/symlink1 and /path2/to/symlink2 are regular files  
with identical contents as /path/to/huge\_file  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2739\#issuecomment-1012949307](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2739#issuecomment-1012949307)  
so 'cp -L' can result needlessly duplicated content  
in particular when /path/to/huge\_file gets included anyway.

Another reason is that in practice it gets rather complicated  
to deal correctly with symlinks (e.g. this issue here) at each code
place  
so it could be better in practice to not care at each code place  
and only fix what actually needs to be fixed at the end.

So it could be better in practice to copy symlinks as symlinks  
and only add actually missing symlink targets at the end.

In principle that is what I meant.

Yes.

Whether or not to  
copy symlinks as symlinks and add missing symlink targets at the end  
needs to be discussed via
