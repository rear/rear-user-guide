SLE 11 SP3 **dosfsutils** package does not include **dosfslabel**
utility. This patch obsoletes **dosfslabel** by **blkid** and
**mkfs.vfat**. The installation of no external **dosfsutils** package
would be required on UEFI booting system. See also \#229.

@gdha more pull requests will come :) We've done a lot of tests with the
UEFI, SAN-booting, btrfs-based system last weeks, all the commits I am
pulling are based on experience from that.
