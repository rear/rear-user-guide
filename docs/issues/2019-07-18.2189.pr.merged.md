-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me, see  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2183\#issuecomment-512791873](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2183#issuecomment-512791873)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In the function apply\_layout\_mappings (therein in its "step 3")  
only treat leftover temporary replacement words as an error  
if they are in a non-comment line (comments have '\#' as first non-space
character),  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2183\#issuecomment-511394129](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2183#issuecomment-511394129)

Additionally I added in 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
the missing word 'bytes' to DebugPrint messages  
so that the output changes e.g. from

    New /dev/vda is 21474836480 smaller than old disk

to

    New /dev/vda is 21474836480 bytes smaller than old disk

Because it "just works" for me I would like to merge it soon today  
unless there are objections right now.
