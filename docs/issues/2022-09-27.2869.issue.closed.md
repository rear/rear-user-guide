-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

We pack commvault (Galaxy) software into the initrd  
because of which the ISO fails to boot.  
Is there an option in the default.conf to copy  
the commvault binaries outside the initrd  
as part of ISO creation?

-   Workaround, if any:

Backup:  
Mount ISO; unpack the initrd;  
mv the software outside initrd;  
repack initrd;  
recreate ISO

Recovery:  
Boot ISO;  
mv back the software back to the original folders and proceed with
recovery

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"

@anarayancv1  
I cannot find `COMMVAULT` in our current ReaR upstream sources,  
in particular no variable names with `COMMVAULT` or `CV_...`  
so I am wondering what ReaR you use - it seems you don't use  
our ReaR but something else from somewhere else?

Regardless what ReaR you use regarding your actual question:

    Is there an option in the default.conf
    to copy ... binaries outside the initrd
    as part of ISO creation?

There is no such config option in default.conf  
that does what you exactly ask for.

The reason is that the initrd contains the files  
of the whole ReaR recovery system - i.e. the system that is  
running (from a ramdisk) after you booted from the ReaR ISO.  
Not including files that belong to the ReaR recovery system  
in the initrd contradicts the basic idea behind  
what the initrd is meant to contain.

But there is a config option in default.conf  
that should help to automate what you do as workaround,  
in particular the workaround part during "rear recover":

    RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL

See its description in the section

    Relax-and-Recover recovery system update during "rear recover"

your default.conf which (hopefully) matches  
your (apparently modified) ReaR that you use,  
or see our ReaR upstream default.conf currently starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L361](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L361)

Regarding the backup method, the manual page has this:

        BACKUP=GALAXY
           Use CommVault Galaxy 5 to restore the data.

       BACKUP=GALAXY7
           Use CommVault Galaxy 7 to restore the data.

       BACKUP=GALAXY10
           Use CommVault Galaxy 10 (or Simpana 10) to restore the data.

so I am a bit surprised to see `BACKUP=COMMVAULT` instead of
BACKUP=GALAXYsomething.

Anyway, concerning the underlying problem with the ISO failing to boot:
do you get an error message? How do you know that it is because of the
initrd size? It is probably a reasonable assumption, but I am curious if
you have anything specific that indicates this (like a kernel error of
GRUB error).

I forgot to ask: what is actually the "bad" initrd size (when it fails
to boot) and "good" size (when it boots)?

excluding kernel modules you do not need may be the best way to reduce
the size.

From my experience the kernel firmware files  
need much more space than the kernel modules, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2640\#discussioncomment-908335](https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2640#discussioncomment-908335)  
that reads (excerpt)

    ... I get about 200M for the bare ReaR recovery system
    plus about 250M for all kernel modules
    plus about 500M for the firmware files

So excluding kernel firmware files one does not need  
is the most effective way to reduce ReaR's initrd size  
(see FIRMWARE\_FILES in default.conf)  
and excluding kernel module files one does not need  
is the second most effective way to reduce the initrd size  
(see MODULES in default.conf)  
but excluding kernel modules could become tricky because  
of unexpected/obscure kernel module dependencies,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2041)  
so in the end excluding kernel firmware files one does not need  
is the simplest and most effective way to reduce initrd size.

also keep in mind that your RAM size also limits the max ISO size you
can boot. Just in case this is a limiting factor here.

I just remembered there is also a config option for the partition size
so a larger iso will fit - in case this was the issue.
