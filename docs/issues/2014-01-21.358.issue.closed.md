The date format used in
/usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/39\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh

    TSM_RESTORE_PIT_DATE=$( date -d "$REPLY" +%Y.%m.%d 2>&8 )

should be explicitly defined as dateformat '5' according to:
[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsm.client.doc%2Fr\_opt\_dateformat.html](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsm.client.doc%2Fr_opt_dateformat.html)
and  
[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v1r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsmfdt.doc%2Fans50000268.htm](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v1r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itsmfdt.doc%2Fans50000268.htm)

so "-date=5" should be added to TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS

That should also fix any local dateformat settings, as I suspect was the
real issue in \#318?

Tested with TSM Client Version 6, Release 2, Level 2.3 - but should work
with any version according to the 2 documents mentioned above.

@clausa could you verify if the fix as requested? If it is ok you may
close the case. Thx for reporting it.

@gdha We successfully tested it (although by configuring it in
local.conf)

@clausa what did you configure in `local.conf` file?

@gdha Sorry for not being clear - we tested by adding:

TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS="-date=5"

to local.conf (that was before a13553d)

@clausa was the fix done in 13553d not correct, or you didn't test the
default setting?

@gdha I have not tested 13553d - yet.

I have however tested the "-date=5" setting by manually applying the
following to /etc/rear/local.conf:

TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS="-date=5"

That would give the same result as the fix in 13553d I guess?

@clausa I hope so ;-)
