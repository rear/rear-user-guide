You want me to downgrade? I am running 2.6 / 2020-06-17 at the moment.

It is a long tread - I'll will have to dig into it after work...

Well that would be progress, wouldn't it :-)

As I have never worked with ReaR before: I would like to know what to
expect when I some day manage to boot from the USB stick? Will it load a
GRUB menu, a kernel starting to load, or some ReaR related menu?

So I removed ReaR 2.6 and found Rear v. 2.3 in OpenSUSE's official
repository. I removed "USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=yes" from the config, and
did another run. No difference - the Lenovo still refuses to boot.

That is actually a good sign, means one problem less.  
When time permits. I'll install OpenSUSE 15.2 with ReaR 2.6 on USB and
Borg back-end and try to reproduce your problem.

@MrManor  
I am not at all a booting expert and even less an expert with UEFI
booting  
so just as a basically blind shot into the dark:

Do you perhaps have other hardware that can boot from USB?  
If yes could you try if the USB with the ReaR recovery system boots on
different hardware?  
Of course you would not run "rear recover" on the other hardware but
there should be no harm  
when you only boot the ReaR recovery system and when it boots only shut
it down.

My reason behind is that I noticed that you have a NVMe disk  
which indicates that the Lenovo X390 is rather modern hardware  
and perhaps this particular hardware behaves somehow special?

@gozora  
for SUSE systems we have  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2116)  
therein in particular `UEFI (secure boot NOT enabled) + GRUB2-EFI`  
so it seems on SUSE systems calling "shim-install" is needed in any case
for UEFI  
so it may be also needed to make a UEFI bootable USB device  
but I am no expert here and may confuse things.

@MrManor  
regarding how things look like when booting from USB via UEFI and GRUB  
you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276)  
where @gozora posted some screenshots, e.g.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276\#issuecomment-559269612](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276#issuecomment-559269612)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276\#issuecomment-562843028](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276#issuecomment-562843028)  
how the GRUB menue would look like  
provided the UEFI firmware was able to load and run GRUB which seems to
fail here.  
Then in the GRUB menue you could select what kernel (and initrd) GRUB
should load.

> Do you perhaps have other hardware that can boot from USB?

I found a very old desktop, one capable of both EFI and legacy boot. I
am sure no expert on UEFI boot either, so I am not sure if the "U" makes
any difference.

Tried the USB keys made using ReaR v. 2.3 and also the one made using
ReaR v. 2.6. They both loaded successfully when selecting EFI from the
PC boot menu. I came to a grub menu in both cases, although only one
menu item from the v2.3 generation. From the v 2.6 I selected "Secure
boot" and in both cases I managed to boot up all the way, to a root
login prompt.

Yes it is quite new. But it should be possible to build a USB boot stick
for it. After all, it came with windows and I replaced it using a [LEAP
15.2
install](http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.2/iso/openSUSE-Leap-15.2-NET-x86_64.iso)
placed on a USB

@MrManor  
The `RAWDISK` output method in ReaR has its independent implementation
for creating bootable media. It creates an image file which can be
copied with `dd` to a USB stick. You could quickly try if that works for
you:

1.  In your ReaR configuration file:
    -   Change `OUTPUT=USB` to `OUTPUT=RAWDISK`
    -   Add `OUTPUT_URL="file:///var/lib/rear/output"`
    -   If secure boot is enabled, set `SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER` to your
        system's shim path, e.g.
        `SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/shim.efi"` as
        described in `default.conf`.
2.  Run `sudo rear mkrescue`
3.  Copy the image to your USB stick:
    -   Use `lsblk -o +MODEL` to find the correct disk device path for
        your USB stick (typically `/dev/sdX`).
    -   **RE-CHECK. The following command will overwrite the entire USB
        stick.**
    -   Use the following command, replacing `USB-DEVICE` with the USB
        stick’s device name.
            sudo zcat "/var/lib/rear/output/$(hostname)/rear-$(hostname).raw.gz" | sudo dd bs=1M of=/dev/USB-DEVICE

@OliverO2: Thanks for looking into this problem.

I found the shim.efi and modified site.conf like this (rest of site.conf
is like shown in my first post):

But it failed. I really cant guess why. There is plenty of space on
disk, the ../output catalog is there, but not mutch in it.

By the way. This using the downgraded 2.3 version of Rear as suggested
by @gozora earlier.

Thanks for providing detailed information.

As `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` premiered in ReaR v2.4, it was not used in your last
run with v2.3. So you need to use a more recent version of ReaR. Version
2.6 will be fine.

So now I know how to build a usb for rescue boot. Not very user frendly
- but it can boot.  
Can I modify my settings to use this way of creating a boot stick during
normal **rear mkbackup**? (I did try to just change RAW back to USB and
run rear mkbackup, but this was no good)

`RAWDISK` was created to have bootable disk images which can be
transferred to any kind of disk (USB stick or other). `RAWDISK` recovery
images are expected to be stored somewhere in the regular file system
and `dd`'ed to a USB stick when necessary. In my case, I store those
disk images on backup media right next to the backup data.

So no, there is no built-in mechanism to automatically transfer
`RAWDISK` images to a USB stick during `mkbackup`.

Only as a side note about a similar issue see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)

Accordingly something like

    rear mkbackup && dd bs=1M if=<RAWDISK_image_file> of=<USB_disk_device>

could do "all in one" automatically  
but it mercilessly overwrites any &lt;USB\_disk\_device&gt; that exists
at that time  
so manually overwriting the right USB device is probably safer.

Alternatively "inside" ReaR one could use POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3145](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3145)  
but POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT only works for the mkbackup/mkbackuponly
workflows  
(i.e. not for "rear mkrescue").

@jsmeix  
Good point. While you're at it, you might consider compression (enabled
by default) and change the line to something similar as posted above:

    sudo zcat "$image_file" | sudo dd bs=1M of="$disk_device"

Thanks a lot for your attention and pointing me to a workable solution.
I guess this issue can be closed by that. Sorry if my limited English
made me miss some points during this issue, but I do suspect others will
end up in the same situation like me - pussled by not being able to boot
after running rear mkbackup.

@MrManor  
thank you for your issue report and your cooperative feedback.  
Don't worry about your English - it is more than good enough.

I reopen the issue because we need some enhancement in ReaR  
to make a UEFI bootable USB medium for the `OUTPUT=USB` method  
that works as good as `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` already does.

But I am not at all a sufficient UEFI expert to implement that myself.  
So someone else would have to compare the `OUTPUT=USB` code  
with the `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` code to find out what `OUTPUT=RAWDISK`  
does better and then improve the `OUTPUT=USB` code accordingly.

Because all that would have to happen on a voluntary base  
it means it is unknown if that would happen and when.  
Accordingly the "Milestone" of this issue is "ReaR future",  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones)

So at least for now using `OUTPUT=RAWDISK`  
plus manual creating the bootable USB medium  
is the right way for those cases where `OUTPUT=USB`  
fails to make a UEFI bootable USB medium.

Thanks for your feedback - and I must say I was very unsure if I should
close the issue. I could not really grasp from your feedback if you
considered the problem as solved.  
I will stay following this issue and please let me know if I can of any
assistance in testing.

A customer using IoT Lenovo SE30 with Ubuntu 20.04 seems to have the
same issue as above issue is describing - by adding  
*REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION=lzma*

to local.conf file and reformatted the USB device and then made the
image.

It fails to boot.  
Then I go into and edit the boot strings and **add (hd0,1)** to both,
kernel and initrd lines.  
Then I boot, it takes a good 3 min and guess what, I get the “ReaR”
login screen now, awesome!!!

*Note*: have a closer look at
[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755256](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755256)  
When we are using `REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION=lzma`  
we should include with grub2 configuration the line:  
**insmod xzio**  
and perhaps also something like:  
**set root='hd0,msdos1'**

I think that with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2763](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2763)
merged  
this issue should be fixed - if not we can reopen it.

Likely not fully automated everywhere but the new  
GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND config variable  
should at least provide "final power to the user"  
to specify what he needs in his particular case.
