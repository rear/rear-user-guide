@dewagner1  
your ReaR version and system info and your /etc/rear/local.conf
contents  
match the ones in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002)  
and your attached eniesdbp102p.txt contains  
for your "2nd Attempt" and "3rd Attempt"

    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/mapper/20017380034880281 => /dev/sda

which matches the "Description of the issue" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002\#issue-389454923](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002#issue-389454923)

@dewagner1,

I notice that a device like `/dev/mapper/SIBM_XXXX` was detected during
the first attempt.

As describe is this previous here
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002\#issuecomment-446209344](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002#issuecomment-446209344))
this usually indicates a SAN configuration problem. (This could explain
why during 2nd and 3rd attempt no multipath devices were found).

Issue \#2002 was solved by checking SAN and XIV Storage configuration
with SAN Admin
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002\#issuecomment-446343401](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002#issuecomment-446343401))

Could you have a look?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002\#issuecomment-446635663](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2002#issuecomment-446635663)  
means that at

    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/mapper/20017380034880281 => /dev/sda

    UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.s                                              h line 275
    Confirm or edit the disk mapping
    1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    2) n/a
    3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    5) Abort 'rear recover'

you can choose "Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here"  
to interrupt rear restore and in the Relax-and-Recover shell you can  
run `multipath -r` to reload multipath.

Alternatively it might help to manually call `multipath -r` to reload
multipath  
before you call "rear recover"?

FYI:  
I am neither a SAN nor a multipath user so that I cannot provide real  
educated help but I try nevertheless - @schabrolles is our ReaR
upstream  
expert for IBM POWER in general and for SAN and multipath in particular.

@dewagner1  
I was wrong in my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2016\#issuecomment-454334115](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2016#issuecomment-454334115)

I won't help to choose "Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to
here"  
and run `multipath -r` because reloding multipath at this point  
won't let ReaR create a new disk mapping table, see the code in  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh)

@schabrolles  
could it be that things happen too fast during "rear recover" in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/210\_load\_multipath.sh  
because there is not any waiting time between

    multipathd >&2 && LogPrint "multipathd started" ...

and

    LogPrint "Listing multipath device found"
    LogPrint "$(multipath -l ...

Perhaps a started multipathd needs some time  
until `multipath -l` could reliably report multipath devices?

Is it perhaps even an error when multipathd needs to be started  
but then no multipath devices can be found?

@jsmeix,

The log shows a device named `/dev/mapper/SIBM_2810XIV_780348802B1` ...
This one looks strange to me and usually means something wrong in the
SAN zoning configuration.

@dewagner1,

-   You can exit to shell and send the output of `multipath -l`
-   If possible, double check the SAN zoning configuration with your SAN
    admin.

Thank you for your quick response. I went back to our SAN team and they
discovered an issue in their zoning configuration.

@dewagner1  
thanks for your feedback.  
Such explicit feedback helps us when we know the root cause was  
outside of ReaR and not something (possibly subtle) within ReaR.

@schabrolles  
do you think there is a sufficiently simple and sufficiently reliable
test  
that ReaR could do to autodetect when the SAN configuration seems  
to be broken?  
(I assume grep for '/dev/mapper/SIBM' is not sufficiently reliable.)  
If there is such a test ReaR could show at least a warning message  
(or even error out) instead of blindly proceed and error out later  
with various weird errors, cf. "Try to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@jsmeix,  
I don't see an easy way to detect such kind of SAN issue. the fact the
`/dev/mapper/SIBM***` means there is something strange with the SAN
zoning is just based on my personal experience with Linux and IBM SAN
storage... I can't really tell what strange multipath name will be used
with other storage vendors.  
I usually look at the `multipath -ll` output to check the number of the
available paths to verify the SAN zoning (You should do it only the
first time a system is booted). I think the problem here is that the
rear backup is not restored to the original system but on a fresh NEW
built system (with sometimes some SAN misconfiguration).

@schabrolles  
thank you for the explanation.  
It is much appreciated!
