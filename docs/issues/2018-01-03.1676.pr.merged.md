@OliverO2 Thanks for fixing this!

For me on SLE11 and SLE12  
the OWNER.GROUP syntax also works

<pre>
# touch /tmp/foo

# ls -l /tmp/foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan  4 10:07 /tmp/foo

# chown lp.lp /tmp/foo

# ls -l /tmp/foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 lp lp 0 Jan  4 10:07 /tmp/foo
</pre>

But "man 1 chown" on SLES11 and SLES12 only talks about  
the OWNER:GROUP syntax and 'colon' so that this pull request  
is at least a "cleanup" of the code.

@OliverO2  
I would like to know what system you use  
where the OWNER.GROUP syntax may not work  
so that there is a real bug here.

@jsmeix `chown` on Ubuntu 16.04 also accepts the OWNER.GROUP syntax, but
as far as I remember, it has never been documented. I'd regard this as
sort-of deprecated.

Cf.
[https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html\_node/chown-invocation.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/chown-invocation.html):

> Some older scripts may still use ‘.’ in place of the ‘:’ separator.
> POSIX 1003.1-2001 (see Standards conformance) does not require support
> for that, but for backward compatibility GNU chown supports ‘.’ so

> contains ‘.’.

Other code in ReaR (e.g.
`usr/share/rear/rescue/default/010_merge_skeletons.sh`) consistently
uses the colon notation so we can be confident that getting rid of the
dot notation does not break things.

@OliverO2  
many thanks for the info where the OWNER.GROUP syntax  
is documented!

I never menat that this change to the OWNER:GROUP syntax  
(which is the only right one according to my man pages)  
could break anything.  
I only liked to know if there is an actual bug somewhere.

For the fun of it:  
There are various "interesting effects" that could happen  
(depending on this and that in some particular environment)  
when "unusual" characters are used in usernames  
which is the reason why "man useradd" one SLES12 states

<pre>
Usernames must start with a lower case letter
or an underscore, followed by lower case letters,
digits, underscores, or dashes.
They can end with a dollar sign.
In regular expression terms:
  [a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*[$]?
Usernames may only be up to 32 characters long.
</pre>

In particular non-ASCII characters in usernames  
have even "very interesting effects":  
For my latest example you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5143](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5143)  
or more in general you may also have a look at  
"Use non-ASCII characters in usernames ..." in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)
