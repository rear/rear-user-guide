-   How was this pull request tested?

Seems to work well for me on openSUSE Leap 15.0

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Found EFI system partition /dev/sda1 on /boot/efi type vfat
    Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The - from my point of view - needlessly overcomplicated  
local variables (sometimes uppercased) and their `awk` constructs  
are simplified into using plain `grep` and a bash array  
to avoid inexplicable wrong behaviour in some cases  
that is somehow related to the `nullglob` bash option, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2095\#issuecomment-481833946](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2095#issuecomment-481833946)  
together with different kind of `awk`, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2095\#issuecomment-481838163](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2095#issuecomment-481838163)

Additionally there is better user info in debug mode via `DebugPrint`  
(in particular when things do not work as usually expected).
