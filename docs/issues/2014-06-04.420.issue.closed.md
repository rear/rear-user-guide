we found a bug in ReaR (1.15) when recovering xfs filesystems. The
recovery fails if rear tries to recover a partition with a valid xfs
filesystem. The mkfs command for xfs does not overwrite existing
partitions unless the -f option is given.

Problem is in
`rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13_inlcude_filesystem_code.sh`

            xfs)
    cat >> $LAYOUT_CODE <<EOF
    LogPrint "Creating $fstype-filesystem $mp on $device"
    mkfs -t $fstype $device
    EOF

The `mkfs` line for xfs must read

`mkfs -t $fstype -f $device`

Hi,

in rear 1.16 should be a fix for that case. Have a look on that pull
request:

That is correct and rear-1.16.1 has also been released in the meantime.
Especially for Novel to re-pack it in their HA packages
