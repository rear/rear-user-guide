Hi ReaR team,  
I installed ReaR in a rhel9 server and configured it. I took a full
backup last week, and now the server is not working after patching it. I
am trying to restore the server from the ReaR backup. However, I am
getting an error **"failed to load ldlinux.c32".** The backup was stored
in an NFS share, and I am using the Iventoy tool to boot the system from
the network. I have both the iso file and the zip file with full backup.
Did misconfigure the /etc/local.conf file? Now, can I restore the backup
when the system is only starting on rescue mode? I am stressed out and
desperate; please help me out. Below is the configuration file content,
and the second one is the backup directory files list.

i dont know about iventoy, you may consider booting the iso in a
different way. I guess the iso image thats been created may not be
compatible to PXE boot.

To be able to boot the generated ISO Image via PXE you would have
needed` OUTPUT=PXE` in your configuration file (which is not present,
see:
[https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/basics/configuration.html](https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/basics/configuration.html))

The generated ISO image may only boot via USB or using an emulated ISO
image forward via the servers remote console (or other ways to attach
the iso image virtually, if not possible on site)

I included OUTPUT=PXE and ran the command rear -v mkbackup, and it ran
successfully. However, it didn't include an iso file. Just curious that
without an iso, how can we restore the backup through PXE? Updated
/etc/rear/local.conf file contents and backup file's content. Is there
anything else that needs to be done?

It didn't allow me to attach it as an attachment so it got uploaded to
the  
Google drive. It's a virtual machine that created Linux KVM. Please let
me  
know if anything else is needed. Thanks

Edit: I removed the ISO link; I wasn't sure if it's publicly
available.

yes, in this situation an initrd an kernel image are stored with the
backups instead of an ISO image.

which can then be booted via PXE, depending on the environment you need
to place these files on an PXE boot  
server which serves these via TFTP to boot.

The main problem however is why the generated iso image does not boot.

> rear-bitwarden.iso

i loop mounted the iso image on my system and it seems like most files
within the generated iso image are corrupted. The iso images contents
dont look sane to me. So either there has been a problem during creation
of the iso image or it has been corrupted by a third party (like
storage, even some anti-virus software are known to alter files they
think they are suspicious to them).

The syslinux files and especially the file which cant be loaded during
boot are usually ELF executable files:

    file /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/ldlinux.c32
    /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/ldlinux.c32: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped

but within your iso image most of them are only "data" files containing
basically only zeroes, even the kernel and initrd:

    /mnt/isolinux/ 
    hexdump -C kernel
    00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
    *
    00cf9870  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                           |........|

some files are OK, but most of them are corrupt:

    mount -o loop rear-bitwarden.iso /mnt
    file /mnt/isolinux/*
    /mnt/isolinux/boot.cat:     data
    /mnt/isolinux/chain.c32:    ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped
    /mnt/isolinux/hdt.c32:      ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped
    /mnt/isolinux/initrd.cgz:   data
    /mnt/isolinux/isolinux.bin: data
    /mnt/isolinux/isolinux.cfg: data
    /mnt/isolinux/kernel:       data
    /mnt/isolinux/ldlinux.c32:  data
    /mnt/isolinux/libcom32.c32: data
    /mnt/isolinux/libgpl.c32:   data
    /mnt/isolinux/libmenu.c32:  data
    /mnt/isolinux/libutil.c32:  data
    /mnt/isolinux/menu.c32:     data
    /mnt/isolinux/message:      data
    /mnt/isolinux/pci.ids:      data
    /mnt/isolinux/poweroff.c32: data
    /mnt/isolinux/rear.help:    data
    /mnt/isolinux/reboot.c32:   data
    /mnt/isolinux/vesamenu.c32: data

This explains why the ISO image does not boot. Either there was an
broken iso image created (which i doubt) or the image was corrupted due
to other issues.

Does the backup log where the ISO Image was created
(rear-rhel-server-02.log) still exist?

Can you provide me with all the contents that need to be added to the
local  
.conf file? I added all the content to the ticket. I will be using
another  
server via NFS to store the backup files. I don’t want to have the
same  
issue in the future. If you can update the existing content with the  
correct parameters, I can use it.  
I appreciate your help.

No, the log file doesn't exist; I had two cron jobs run an hour apart,
the first one ran to take backup, and the second one deleted the log
file. That log file is removed, and the server is not booting up; that's
why I wanted to restore the backup. Thanks

unfortunately not, this is the log of the backup command (tar) not the
log of the mkrescue step that generated the image.

When the mkbackup job ran, it created a full backup; I mean, with iso,
there is also a tar file **2024-07-19-0000-F.tar.gz**, which contains
all of the directories such as / var, etc. boot, usr, etc. Is there a
way to restore the server using the .tar.gz file? Thanks

without a working iso image it will be complicated. You can only setup a
system (re-install) with similar layout and restore the contents from
the file backup (2024-07-19-0000-F.tar.gz) manually as required.

Understood. I will reinstall the OS and test the file copying process.
To prevent a similar issue in the future, I believe it's necessary to
re-configure the local.conf file with the correct parameters. I've added
the following content to the file and executed the 'rear -v mkbackup'
command. This command successfully created a full backup, but it did not
generate a .iso file. Could it be that the 'pxe' value for output field
in local.conf file is preventing the creation of an iso file? My aim is
to have a backup that can be restored via network boot.

OUTPUT=PXE will create two files as explained before. The linux kernel
image and the initrd (rhel-server-XX\[kernel,\].initrd.cgz) Both can be
booted via PXE. Complete ISO images are usually not booted via PXE, the
PXE boot solution (iventoy) you are using seems to extract required
contents from the ISO Image to make them boot via PXE.

On a regular PXE server you only need to place these two files and serve
them via TFtP to boot from it.

You can also try with OUTPUT=ISO and create an iso image as before
(which hopefully is not corrupted this time) and attempt to configure
this one in your iventoy server, but i dont know if this is going to
work. It seems iventoy has a curated list of supported ISO images:

[https://www.iventoy.com/en/isolist.html](https://www.iventoy.com/en/isolist.html)

it can well be that iventoy cannot handle the REAR iso image due to its
specific folder layout. Best would probably be to create the iso image
and test booting it with QEMU/virt-manager, to rule out an general
issue.
