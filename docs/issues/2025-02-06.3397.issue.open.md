### ReaR version

Relax-and-Recover 2.9 / 2025-01-31

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

Greetings REAR developers =)

i have an ubuntu 22.04 system (this behavior also occurred on RHEL
7.9),  
it has a sata SSD /dev/sda as the REAR target, that was formatted by
REAR using "rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sda"  
i created a backup by executing "rear -v mkbackup" and i get this error
right before returning to prompt:

what does "since it's on a different device" mean?

some info about the environment:

    cat/etc/rear/local.conf

    cat /etc/os-release

    lsblk - note that the lsblk shows the still mounted rear mount

it happened recently on two different environments (repeatedly) and i'm
not sure how to avoid it or what i'm doing wrong,

can you advise?

### Backup

### Storage layout

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

1.  install latest rear
2.  backup using rear -v mkbackup to a preformatted /dev/sda

### Workaround, if any

i can just unmount and delete the folder, but i'm not sure if it this
error indicates something is wrong

### Additional information

i did not see this error in REAR v2.6 & 2.7 for more than a year of
using it
