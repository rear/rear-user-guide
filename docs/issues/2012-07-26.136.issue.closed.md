Please consider disabling "&gt;&2" redirects in scripts when in debug
mode, allowing commands to fully display what they're doing, esp during
things like filesystem creation

So you mean redirecting &2 to stdout, or instead to the log file ?

I thought we already did this... What is the current behavior and what
do you expect ?

errr ... stdout would be my vote for debug messages. Can you do both?

I don't see the point in having command output being send to the screen
at all. It belongs in the log file, together with the executed commands,
shell debugging and log messages. Why would you want this on screen
rather than in a log that can be inspected, scrolled, transferred, ... ?

Realtime process context, not to to say that logging isn't necessary,
too. I needed to remove by hand them to see that disks aren't being
labelled when their filesystems are being created.

There's no data purged so I don't see the need for real-time data here.
(Nothing that `less` or `tail` cannot already match)

But feel free to propose a pull request with a good argumentation and
maybe someone finds the implementation useful.

Thing is, watching rear.log as rear operates requires either a second
ssh session to the system being restored or running rear in single step
mode so that it can be backgrounded in order to check the log. However,
i maintain that it is a pain and unproductive to be bouncing back and
forth between the recovery console and second a log-monitoring terminal.
IMHO, some of the silent redirects, esp in the disk layout sections,are
unnecessary. Let debug dump a ton of information - that's what debugging
does. If you feel strongly otherwise, i can't argue.

There shouldn't be any bouncing back and forth if the log file contains
*all* information anyway. If, however, you report some items missing
from the log file during debugging which requires going back to the
console, than that's something we may have to look into.

The reason we prefer everything logged is because for troubleshooting
(after the fact) we requiring a full log file. That's what we ask people
to share with the developers to understand in detail what is happening.
If the output is on screen instead of the log file, it is no longer
useful for post-mortem debugging.

PS Debugging does indeed require to open a second ssh session (or a
second console, or a second screen session). It's not unusual (I would
even say, it's common) that debugging a running process requires more
than one console. Normal usage should not, so anything we could improve
for normal users by adding more/better output is worth a feature-request
!

OK, fair enough. I see where single-step + -d with a second log-watching
session accomplishes pretty much what i'm asking about. I'll readjust
myself accordingly

cheers

Sorry for being pedantic here. I am closing this issue, if there's
something in this thread we should retain to improve Relax-and-Recover,
please reopen with the details ;-)

Thanks for the feedback !
