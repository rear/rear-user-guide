Found same kind of issue against "final power to the user"  
in output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_grub.sh  
by hardcoded setting of GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND  
regardless what the user may have specified.

The code being changed misses the intent of the code before \#2662 .
`set root=cd0` and
`search --no-floppy --set=root --file /boot/efiboot.img` should be both
executed (`set root=cd0` sets a sensible default that works in most
cases and applies when
`search --no-floppy --set=root --file /boot/efiboot.img` fails to do its
job properly), but right now one executes only one of them ( with
`set root=cd0` taking precedence), which fails as soon as the DVD is not
in the first DVD drive.

I works OK for my personal test case  
(which does not mean much because I am not an expert in this area).

My original system is a KVM/QEMU VM

Using the resulting ISO file in a virtual CDROM drive  
on my replacement system which is another  
same KVM/QEMU VM with OVMF "TianoCore" UEFI firmware  
it boots the ReaR recovery system for me.

I only tried UEFI without secure boot.

Inside the ReaR recovery system:

    RESCUE localhost:~ # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
    NAME        KNAME     PKNAME   TRAN   TYPE FSTYPE  LABEL      SIZE MOUNTPOINT

    |-/dev/vda2 /dev/vda2 /dev/vda        part ext4              12.5G 
    `-/dev/vda3 /dev/vda3 /dev/vda        part swap                 2G 

I also did a test with "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover"  
which worked for me.

What I personally like most is that now  
GRUB2 shows which 'root' device it uses  
and which devices are available.

Hopefully this avoids lengthy confusions as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3024](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3024)  
until finally (thanks to @pcahyna who found it out)  
it became clear what the actual issue was, see

Tested how it behaves with two CDROM drives  
on the replacement system using the same ISO as above  
but now the ISO is in the second CDROM drive  
(the first CDROM drive is empty):

![Screenshot from 2023-07-13

GRUB2 now uses 'cd1' as 'root' device  
and it boots well from it.

Inside the ReaR recovery system:

    RESCUE localhost:~ # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
    NAME        KNAME     PKNAME   TRAN   TYPE FSTYPE  LABEL      SIZE MOUNTPOINT
    /dev/sr0    /dev/sr0           sata   rom                    1024M 
    /dev/sr1    /dev/sr1           sata   rom  iso9660 REAR-ISO 185.2M 
    /dev/vda    /dev/vda                  disk                     15G 
    |-/dev/vda1 /dev/vda1 /dev/vda        part vfat               512M 
    |-/dev/vda2 /dev/vda2 /dev/vda        part ext4              12.5G 
    `-/dev/vda3 /dev/vda3 /dev/vda        part swap                 2G

Also `rear recover` worked well and  
the recreated system boots normally.

First things first:  
I will not clean up the whole create\_grub2\_cfg() usage  
via this pull request.  
Via this pull request the create\_grub2\_cfg() usage  
should only get fixed where it was actually wrong.  
The implementation of the fix introduces the additional  
GRUB2\_SET\_ROOT\_COMMAND config variable to get consistency  
regarding how GRUB2 sets and/or searches its 'root' device.  
A general cleanup of the whole create\_grub2\_cfg() usage  
should be done via a subsequent separated pull request.

it even works reasonably well with Secure Boot for me:

I also did "rear mkbackup".

Same replacement system as above  
but with Secure Boot enabled:

    RESCUE localhost:~ # rear -D recover

    Installing secure boot loader (shim)...
    ...

When rebooting the recreated system  
with the ReaR ISO still in its CDROM drive it booted from the ISO  
but then via the default GRUB menu entry `Boot next EFI`  
it loaded my SLES15 SP4 system but then that aborted to boot  
with some "system is compromised" Secure Boot message  
so I removed the ISO from the CDROM drive so that  
it boots the recreated system directly from its harddisk  
and that "just worked" for me (in Secure Boot mode).

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025/commits/c5eb197aa6f3aa88cd2a98874e56bdb2277ee21b](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025/commits/c5eb197aa6f3aa88cd2a98874e56bdb2277ee21b)  
in particular with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025/commits/e368c4200cce9bfb4bf60d0862497ff467282304](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025/commits/e368c4200cce9bfb4bf60d0862497ff467282304)  
create\_grub2\_cfg() no longer accepts a third argument  
(nowhere is create\_grub2\_cfg() called with a third argument)  
that could be a "search GRUB2 'root' device command" string.  
Now create\_grub2\_cfg() uses GRUB2\_SET\_ROOT\_COMMAND and  
GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND directly as usual with other config
variables.  
Therefore the lower case variables `grub2_set_root_command`  
and `grub2_search_root_command` are no longer needed, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#discussion\_r1262376052](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#discussion_r1262376052)

I still won't do a general cleanup via this pull request.

@pcahyna @rear/contributors  
as far as I can imagine currently I think I am now done  
with fixing the create\_grub2\_cfg function usage  
to the extent what I could reasonably do  
within one single pull request.

If you like you may have a look at my current changes.  
Perhaps you may spot some obvious mistakes.

Tomorrow I will redo my above tests with my latest changes.

Ideally - if all goes well - I would like to merge it  
later this week (Thursday afternoon at the earliest).

I did my above tests with my latest changes  
and my tests worked again as before.

Two remarks:

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1635876186](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1635876186)

    When rebooting the recreated system
    with the ReaR ISO still in its CDROM drive it booted from the ISO
    but then via the default GRUB menu entry 'Boot next EFI'
    it loaded my SLES15 SP4 system but then that aborted to boot
    with some "system is compromised" Secure Boot message
    so I removed the ISO from the CDROM drive so that
    it boots the recreated system directly from its harddisk
    and that "just worked" for me (in Secure Boot mode).

It also works to set in the OVMF "TianoCore" UEFI firmware  
to use the harddisk as first boot device.

This time I made a screenshot how it looks when  
it shows the "system is compromised" Secure Boot message:

The second remark is about the  
reinstalled bootloader during "rear recover":

What one gets after reboot after "rear recover"  
are those two boot options

    SLES 15-SP4
    Advanced options for SLES 15-SP4

(see the above screenshot).

What is not there after "rear recover" is

    UEFI Firmware Settings

which is normally there on SLES 15-SP4 which leads  
into the OVMF "TianoCore" UEFI firmware setup menu.

To get the `UEFI Firmware Settings` entry  
I did run the YaST bootloader module,  
therein I changed an unimportant setting  
(I changed in "bootloader options" the timeout)  
so that YaST did actually reinstall the bootloader.  
Now I get again the usual SLES 15-SP4 bootloader screen:

As far as I see Secure Boot of the ReaR recovery system  
is not yet supported for OUTPUT=USB because it seems  
for OUTPUT=USB it does not use Shim  
(SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/sles/shim.efi")  
as first stage UEFI bootloader 'BOOTX64.efi'  
and no second stage UEFI bootloader files for Shim like  
/boot/efi/EFI/sles/grub.efi /boot/efi/EFI/sles/grubx64.efi  
get copied into the directory where Shim (BOOTX64.efi) is  
as done in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1635876186](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1635876186)

But UEFI without Secure Boot works for me.

So I had to switch off Secure Boot  
on my replacement system (same as above)  
to get the ReaR recovery system booted.

I did "rear recover" and rebooted to verify  
that the recreated system works.

Then I shut down the replacement system and switched on again  
Secure Boot in its OVMF TianoCore UEFI firmware setup menu  
and booted it which also works, i.e. the recreated system  
also boots with Secure Boot.

So "rear recover" did "the right thing" to also reinstall Shim,  
cf. usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
in my case because I use SLES 15-SP4.  
I didn't test if "rear recover" reinstalls Shim also  
for other Linux distributions.

Looks good. The only potentially questionable part is the use of

    contains_visible_char "$GRUB2_SET_ROOT_COMMAND"
    contains_visible_char "$GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND"

which, IIUC, prevents setting the variables to e.g. `" "` as a way to
avoid using any set/search command at all.  
As an example for another option, I have recently recommended the use of
`MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS=" "` as a way to disable all XFS options (and thus
using mkfs.xfs defaults), which is very useful in some situations.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your review!

Regarding questionable 'contains\_visible\_char' usage:

I introduced it because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#discussion\_r1260972359](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#discussion_r1260972359)

First I thought it would be against "final power to the user"  
if the user could not specify to not use any set/search command.

But then I tested in etc/rear/local.conf

    GRUB2_SET_ROOT_COMMAND="echo 'No set root command'"
    GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND="echo 'No search root command'"

which works for me to get the GRUB2 default 'memdisk'  
but this cannot boot the recovery system  
(because its kernel and initrd is not on 'memdisk').

Because it cannot work without any set/search command  
I think the 'contains\_visible\_char' usage is OK here  
to avoid that things don't work.

What is still questionable is if ReaR should  
try to silently "correct" a user specified value  
like "only blank characters" == "no characters",  
cf. "sequence of zero bytes" == "end of file" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3027\#issuecomment-1641940634](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3027#issuecomment-1641940634)  
or  
if ReaR should not try to "correct" user specified values?
