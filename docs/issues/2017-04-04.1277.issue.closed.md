C.f.
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf):

    ##
    # TMPDIR
    #
    # Relax-and-Recover needs a (temporary) working area where it builds in particular
    # the rescue/recovery system ISO image (and perhaps even stores the backup archive).
    # The directory name of the working area is created in /usr/sbin/rear by calling
    #   mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    # which usually results /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX or $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    # the latter when the canonical Linux/Unix environment variable TMPDIR
    # is set in the environment where /usr/sbin/rear is called.
    # To have a specific working area directory prefix for Relax-and-Recover
    # specify in /etc/rear/local.conf something like
    #   export TMPDIR="/prefix/for/rear/working/directory"
    # where /prefix/for/rear/working/directory must already exist.
    # This is useful for example when there is not sufficient free space
    # in /tmp or $TMPDIR for the ISO image or even the backup archive.
    # TMPDIR cannot be set to a default value here, otherwise /usr/sbin/rear
    # would not work in compliance with the Linux/Unix standards regarding TMPDIR
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968

See the documentation,  
e.g. from "man rear":

<pre>
See the default configuration file
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
for an overview of the possible methods
and their options.
