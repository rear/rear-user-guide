It was hardcoded to search and use grub-mkimage, now it will search for
grub2-mkimage and use it if exists

@OliverO2  
FYI if you like have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2277](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2277)  
because it is about your  
output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/270\_create\_grub2\_efi\_bootloader.sh

@jsmeix Thanks for keeping me updated. Actually, I have some local
changes from my secure boot experiments hanging around here (not even
committed to my local repo). Unfortunately, these changes overlap with
this PR.

@franciscohosting, if you are OK with it, I'd like to come up with a
separate PR that would incorporate the requirement to search for
`grub2-mkimage`. In that case you would no longer need to work on this
PR. I'll promise to finish over the weekend. Please let me know!

I have noticed that
`usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/300_include_grub_tools.sh` tries `grub`
and `grub2` prefixes for a number of grub tools, so probably more code
has to be reviewed if any of those tools are used.

@OliverO2 Of course! go ahead, I'm new to this, should I close this pull
request?

@franciscohosting Thanks for the quick reply. I'll go ahead. I just
wanted your confirmation first as I did not want to frustrate you by
interfering. Even if you are new to ReaR, everyone here welcomes your
contribution! And I know, it's easy to overlook stuff in ReaR, as it has
grown over time to a certain level of complexity... ;)

You might close this PR or you might as well wait a bit and see if I did
the right thing. Do as you like and have a fantastic weekend!

@OliverO2  
no, ReaR can't be complex - it's just bash scripts ;-)

@franciscohosting @OliverO2  
I wish you a relaxed weekend

@OliverO2  
regarding your  
"local changes from my secure boot experiments hanging around"

Currently I am in the process to get a little bit  
better understanding of UEFI booting, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2275\#issuecomment-554028783](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2275#issuecomment-554028783)  
and subsequent comments  
that should (hopefully) result in some cleanup of  
how ReaR re-installs the UEFI bootloader pieces.  
But I will need some time until I got things sorted out  
so that I could implement a proper cleanup,  
cf. "Maintain backward compatibility" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

So I look forward to your improvements regarding secure boot.  
Hopefully we could use same code for same functionality in ReaR.

@OliverO2  
FYI the reason behind why I think some cleanup of  
the UEFI and secure boot related code in ReaR is needed:

While working on an internal SUSE issue I noticed the following  
(excerpts from what I wrote in that internal SUSE issue  
and adapted to match our current ReaR master code):

    That various UEFI related variables in ReaR drive me nuts:

    In finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh there is
    -------------------------------------------------------
    # For UEFI systems with grub2 we should use efibootmgr instead,
    # cf. finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh
    is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER && return
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Accordingly GRUB2 is not installed when UEFI is used
    but instead finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh
    is called which sets 'NOBOOTLOADER=' when succeeded.

    In the new finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/675_install_shim.sh is
    -------------------------------------------------------
    # USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER empty or not true means using BIOS:
    is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return 0
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Accordingly shim is not installed when UEFI is not used
    (i.e. shim is only installed when UEFI is used)
    but then GRUB2 is not installed (cf. 660_install_grub2.sh above)
    and later 675_install_shim.sh contains
    -------------------------------------------------------
    # Skip if GRUB2 (cf. "GRUB2-EFI" = "$BOOTLOADER" above) was not successfully installed
    # because a successfully installed GRUB2 bootloader is a precondition for installing shim.
    # In this case NOBOOTLOADER is true, cf. finalize/default/050_prepare_checks.sh
    if is_true $NOBOOTLOADER ; then
        LogPrintError "Cannot install secure boot loader (shim) because GRUB2 was not successfully installed"
        return 1
    fi
    -------------------------------------------------------

    By accident this skip does not happen
    when 670_run_efibootmgr.sh succeeded
    because that sets 'NOBOOTLOADER='.

    So I think in the end that mess even works
    but it clearly needs to be cleaned up...
