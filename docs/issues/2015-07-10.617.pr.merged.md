Hi,

I first did not want to create this pull request because I still have
some kind of bug in it. The fix is working *correct*. When systemd is
present in a recent version, then - in recovery - no additional drivers
are loaded.

But when recovery starts, it find the disk (with same size), recreates
the LVM group but then fails to create the filesystem on /. I'm very
sorry, that I don't have the error message right here (only at home). I
think I remember, that I saw a message, that
`0 logical volumes are now active` and because of this, the `mkfs`
fails. Later, in recovery shell, I could manually do the `mkfs`, so this
might be a timing problem.  
I will append further information as soon as possible and I hope, that
this information is useful for you.

Hmm...I still have this strange bug and I don't get it. After loading
rear rescue system, first start of `rear recover` stops at the first
filesystem it should re-create.

    +++ echo -e 'Creating ext3-filesystem / on /dev/mapper/system-lv_root'
    +++ mkfs -t ext3 -b 4096 -i 16367 /dev/mapper/system-lv_root
    mke2fs 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)
    The file /dev/mapper/system-lv_root does not exist and no size was specified.

When I enter the rear shell and look at `/dev/mapper` I can see the
needed links and also a `fdisk` returns some information about the
device. Then exit rear shell and `Continue restore` I have to first edit
the `diskrestore.sh` script. Just input something, delete it again and
save it (no changes to file contents), running `Continue restore` again,
the recover works as expected.

Can you tell me, where I can put a `sleep` just before the filesystem
re-creation? So the `sleep` automatically gets included in the
`diskrestore.sh` script?

I know, this is not the prettiest patch as the sleep should be put just
infront of the first filesystem creation but with this patch, I was able
to just recover my system without any error again. And, because nor
additional storage drivers have been loaded into recovery, the
"original" initrd has not been altered afterwards. (md5sums are the
same)
