-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

<!-- -->

    WARNING:
    For this system
    RedHatEnterpriseServer/8.2 on Linux-i386 (based on Fedora/8.2/i386)
    there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system
    or the code that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.
    Please contribute appropriate code to the Relax-and-Recover project,
    see http://relax-and-recover.org/development/
    Take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize - for example
    for PC architectures like x86 and x86_64 see the script
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh
    and for POWER architectures like ppc64le see the script
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660_install_grub2.sh
    ---------------------------------------------------
    |  IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL A BOOT LOADER MANUALLY,  |
    |  THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BOOT.     |
    ---------------------------------------------------
    You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login'
    to change into the recovered system and
    manually install a boot loader therein.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    None. Tired to manually extract the tarball from rear shell based on
    this article but didnt seem to work

@illmaticone  
to have a chance to understand what goes on on your particular system we
need your  
`rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup` and your matching `rear -D recover` debug
log files  
plus your `var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file.  
See in particular the section "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
(I recommend to read through that whole long article).

Ony as a blind shot into the dark:  
Does perhaps specifying GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES help, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2918](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2918)  
perhaps together with specifying BOOTLOADER?  
See also the other bootloader and \[U\]EFI related config variables in
default.conf.

By the way:  
I do not unserstand what "UEFI BIOS but in Legacy mode" means  
in particular not together with a "/boot/efi" EFI System Partition
(ESP).  
When UEFI firmware is used in Legacy BIOS mode I would expect  
a 'bios\_grub' partition and/or a 'legacy\_boot' partition but no ESP.  
With a ESP it looks as if the UEFI firmware is used in its native EFI
mode.  
But I may misunderstand or confuse things here because  
I am not at all a bootloader expert.

FYI:  
There is no such thing as "UEFI BIOS", cf.

@illmaticone Noticed you were running ReaR on RHEL 8.2 - you can open an
incident report at RedHat so they can investigate it further, but
therefore use the official rear-2.4 from RHEL itself. It is benificial
for all parties to have a clear understanding what goes on? Is the issue
a RHEL one or a ReaR one. RH can help you with this if you have an
official subscription with RH.

Just adding a note here for anyone else.....

This can be caused if you are using a VM /setup and you set the WRONG
boot system when you init the disk  
if the system you came from was UEFI and you set your VM as "legacy
BIOS"  
or visa versa.

it can also happen on older systems that get erased then reinited to a
different boot standard.

Then at the very last stage of rear bootloader creation it will error ,
and you get the message....

REAR cannot put right incorrect settings in hardware or VM below the
stage at which it operates.

Simply switching boot systems when you init the VM or system , gives a
successful result.
