I have not yet found a case where the new code produces a different
output from the old code, but so far I have not invested much in it. I
still feel that it would be better to keep the old code. I believe there
is probably a good reason to keep only interfaces with routing
information and I am afraid of breaking it. Unfortunately, currently I
have very little time for investigating it.  
I don't entirely agree with the reasoning in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2902\#issuecomment-1369567575](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2902#issuecomment-1369567575)
"there are new user options available for NICs (i.e.
EXCLUDE\_NETWORK\_INTERFACES=()) giving the user enough power to
excluded unwanted NICs instead of implicitly filtering them elsewhere."
It would be unfortunate if we forced users for whom the previous
autodetection has worked well to use an explicit configuration (which
then would need to be maintained - interfaces can change their names, be
different on different machines even if the machies are otherwise
similar, etc.)  
@hpannenb could you please change you approach to use the output of
`ip -6 r`, as suggested by @jsmeix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2902\#issuecomment-1368967611](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2902#issuecomment-1368967611)
? (I know that it is not straightforward, because the IPv6 routes lack
the `src` keyword used in the filter for the IPv4 routes.)

In any case, the comment

@pcahyna Well done and valid point.

So the task in the code is to gather all interfaces that are configured
with an IP (either IPv4 and/or IPv6).

In the earlier times of the code all available network interfaces were
selected. My PR is reverting to this approach. See e.g.

Hello,  
the idea was to select only interfaces backed on physical device and
which would be useful when starting the recovery (i.e. to fetch the
backup).  
Everything not backed by a physical interface doesn't need to be
restored while in the rescue env.

@rmetrich  
thank you for your explanation!

What @pcahyna reports in his above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2907\#issuecomment-1381116451](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2907#issuecomment-1381116451)  
is

    ... two interfaces, one of them (eno2) is connected, but not configured.

I think this means the connected but not configured interface  
is "somehow linked to a physical device"  
but it has no IP when "rear mkrescue" is run.

I think any interface that is "somehow linked to a physical device"  
could be later useful to fetch the backup during "rear recover"  
(the admin would then have to assign an IP manually)  
regardless whether or not an interface was actually usable  
when making the backup during "rear mkbackup".

In particular for third party backup tools normally  
"rear mkbackup" is useless (because normally ReaR does  
not implement making a backup with third party backup tools)  
so only "rear mkrescue" is used for third party backup tools  
(also for BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE)  
and then it is possible that an interface is not usable  
during "rear mkrescue" time but that interface could be used  
when the backup is made with a third party backup tool.  
Of course this example is rather theoretical (I don't assume  
admins disable special interfaces that are only used for  
special things like making a backup with some backup tool)  
but this is only an offhanded example for my actual point  
which is:

I wonder if ReaR should automatically exclude something  
when there is no hard reason to exclude it?

I think something should be automatically excluded only when  
including it would cause problems in the ReaR recovery system.  
E.g. when things fail in the recovery system if it was inculded  
or possible security/privacy issues if secrets were included.

I am not a sufficient networking expert to make a decision  
if it could cause problems in the ReaR recovery system  
when interfaces are included that are linked to a physical device  
but have no IP.

I added a comment that also appears in network\_devices\_setup\_script

This is only to show how the current code (without this change here)  
is meant to work.  
Of course that comment (and likely some other comments)  
change when we decide here to include more interfaces.

@rmetrich Thanks for the insights. Indeed this is how this mechanism
works (well documented by You in the code). The interesting question to
me is what YOur intentions was to change the network interface selection
mechanism from previous approach to "select IPv4 with routing NICs
only". BTW, so far this seems to have worked flawlessly.

Honestly I cannot remember. Probably I never got a pure IPv6 system and
never saw any Red Hat customer have such, so in the end restoring the
network for IPv4 only was sufficient.

@jsmeix Likewise. But it seems this has never been (reported as) an
issue until now with either the old or the new approach of collecting
the network interfaces.

Sure. I just raised the questions because it could have been a special
decision by You to do so.

The system I am dealing with is a hybrid: E.g. the management interface
is IPv4 only whereas the connection to the backup service is via IPv6
only.

@jsmeix Under point 4 in my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2902\#issuecomment-1369567575](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2902#issuecomment-1369567575)
I mentioned it is possible to exclude NICs with
`EXCLUDE_NETWORK_INTERFACES =()` already in case they should be excluded
from the rescue environment. So user has the power to do something in
case it is harming on the NIC side.

BTW, from purely looking at the code this approach should have made the
test passed of @pcahyna putting the `eno2` onto this list. Obviously the
comment section of the algorithm needs a slight update then.

I adjusted the comments in my PR to align it with my code change.

Since this change is working as such (as already shown with earlier ReaR

*and* IPv6 NICs in the rescue environment.

It is a great piece of code @rmetrich provided since it covers almost

@rear/contributors  
I would like to be bold here  
and merge it next Monday (27. March) afternoon  
unless there are objections.

@pcahyna  
I think because we are in ReaR 2.8 development phase  
it is OK to "just merge" something like this one because  
it does not look as if instantly hell broke loose  
because of this changes (at least it "just works"  
for @hpannenb so it cannot be wrong in any case)  
and whether or not it is wrong in some cases  
we learn best how it actually goes wrong  
when various interested users who use our  
current GitHub master code try it out  
in their individual networking environments.
