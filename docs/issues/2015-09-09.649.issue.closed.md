Hi!

I am having problems with the uuid of /dev/sda1 in the initrd created
within the recovery process.  
my setup:

-   SLES12 with latest patches applied
-   Relax-and-Recover 1.17.1 / Git
-   /boot on /dev/sda1
-   the rest on lvm with /dev/sda2 as PV

I do a restore of the same machine where the backup comes from. Before
the restore my disks are discoverd like this:

<pre>
RESCUE BLIXESX3:/dev/disk/by-uuid # ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Sep  9 14:27 2015-09-02-16-23-48-00 -> ../../sr0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Sep  9 14:27 ef2113b0-9341-415d-a45d-6835beae7148 -> ../../sda1
</pre>

After the restore i have strange devicelinks underneath
/dev/disk/by-uuid/. Sadly the links in there are used by the systemd in
the initrd.

</pre>

I don't know why there are 2 links for every dm-file. But in my opinion
the link for **/dev/sda1** should match the output of blkid:

<pre>
RESCUE BLIXESX3:/dev/disk/by-uuid # blkid /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: UUID="<b>ef2113b0-9341-415d-a45d-6835beae7148</b>" TYPE="xfs" PARTUUID="000dc137-01"
</pre>

This is also the uuid which is defined in disklayout.conf and according
to the logfile, the creation of the xfs filesystem on /dev/sda1 works
without errors.

<pre>
RESCUE BLIXESX3:/var/lib/rear/layout # cat disklayout.conf | grep sda1
part /dev/sda 270532608 1048576 primary boot /dev/sda1
fs /dev/sda1 /boot xfs uuid=ef2113b0-9341-415d-a45d-6835beae7148 label=  options=rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota
</pre>

The problem is that the generated initrd searchs for the disk
**c9227301-e341-47df-970f-46f786beead8** and therefore the restored
system won't boot.

chrooted to /mnt/local/

<pre>
BLIXESX3:/ # lsinitrd | grep "initrd.target.wants/dev"
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           78 Sep  9 15:22 etc/systemd/system/initrd.target.wants/dev-disk-by\\x2duuid-c9227301\\x2de341\\x2d47df\\x2d970f\\x2d46f786beead8.device -> ../dev-disk-by\\x2duuid-c9227301\\x2de341\\x2d47df\\x2d970f\\x2d46f786beead8.device
</pre>

The expected result would be a unitfile for
ef2113b0-9341-415d-a45d-6835beae7148 in the initrd.  
As a workaround I can again reboot the system with to rear iso, mount
all the filesystems and recreate the initrd with dracut. this way the
correct unitfile is created.  
If its a bug maybe it is fixed in 1.17.2 but I didn't find anything that
sounds related to me.

Please excuse my bad english!

@mattihautameki I am trying to understand where the
`c9227301-e341-47df-970f-46f786beead8 -> ../../sda1` is coming from. Did
you check the rear.log after the recovery?  
If I understand it well in the savelayout file and before the recovery
the UUID was the correct one (`ef2113b0-9341-415d-a45d-6835beae7148`)?
Therefore, we need to find out why the UUID was changed after recovery?
Was it forced somehow?

There is a problem in the rear.log which belongs to the integrity check.
But this is because of my ISO\_MAX\_SIZE setting.  
Yes, before the recovery and in the savedlayout the uuid is correct.
Accodring to the log, the Filesystem aswell is created with the correct
uuid.

I found some errors in the journal

Thing is, that multipath does not exist in the recovery and on the
original System it is located under /sbin/ instead of /usr/sbin/

@jsmeix Is this something you have seen before with SLES12?

I do not regularly test rear with LVM.

My recent tests are with SLES12-SP1 and rear 1.17.2 on a virtual
KVM/QEMU machine with a single 20GB virtual harddisk and there only the
SLES12-SP1 default btrfs structure (i.e. no LVM) and for me the
recovered system boots.

I am totally unable to regularly test various different kind of setups
that are listed as supported by rear - I simply will never ever have the
time for that.

@mattihautameki  
what is the complete content of your disklayout.conf file (i.e. without
"grep sda1")?

In general when a particular rear version does not work, you should try
out the newest version on a test machine (of course not on your
production server). Even if it also does not work with the newest rear
version this is the version where development happens.

@mattihautameki  
if you like you may try out the newest SUSE-specific rear version  
that is rear 1.17.2 with SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch that makes it work  
specifically for the default btrfs structure in SLE12-SP1, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556)

You can get it from the openSUSE Build Service project "Archiving"  
therein the package "rear" e.g. for direct RPM download  
for SLE12 x86\_64 from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/SLE\_12/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/SLE_12/)

I now upgraded the Server to the latest SLE12 Patchlevel and installed
rear-1.17.2-1.x86\_64. So far no difference. Initrd still has wrong Disk
in **initrd.target.wants**.

Interestingly, I noticed that the problem only exists when I do the
restore on the same machine the backup was created from. When the
"destination /dev/sda1" has a different uuid than the the one from
disklayout.conf or it has no layout at all, then everything works fine.

You wrote  
"problem only exists when I do the restore on the same machine"  
and this together with that strange "multipath" stuff might  
indicate that the root cause is "magic strings" on the disk  
that get autodetected by such tools, see "man wipefs"  
(excerpt)

<pre>
wipefs can erase filesystem, raid or partition-table signatures
(magic strings) from the specified device to make the
signatures invisible for libblkid.
</pre>

In the rear 1.17.2 files I cannot find "wipefs" which indicates that  
rear does not use it so that such special signatures on the disk  
are not removed during recovery.

@gdha  
wasn't there already another issue related to "wipefs"?

In general when re-using a used disk one should use wipefs  
to clean up possible remainders of the previous usage.

You may have a look at my script for  
"Generic system installation with the plain SUSE installation system"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how I use wipefs on all partitions before I create filesystems there  
(YaST does the same during installation).

@gdha  
I think wipefs support should be added to rear.  
It could be done optionally like:  
If wipefs executable exists in recovery system, then use it.

@mattihautameki  
the rpm from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/SLE\_12/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/SLE_12/)  
has no change compared to upstream rear 1.17.2  
that could solve this issue (as far as I can imagine).

@mattihautameki

an untested proposal how to add wipefs support:

In  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
directly before each "mkfs ... $device" command  
insert a "wipefs -a $device" for example as follows (untested !):

<pre>
wipefs -a $device
mkfs -t ${fstype}${blocksize}${fragmentsize}${bytes_per_inode} $device &gt;&amp;2
.
.
.
wipefs -a $device
mkfs.xfs -f $device
.
.
.
mount | grep -q $device || { wipefs -a $device ; mkfs -t $fstype -f $device ; }
.
.
.
wipefs -a $device
mkfs.vfat $device
.
.
.
wipefs -a $device
mkfs -t $fstype $device &gt;&amp;2
</pre>

Because this way wipefs is called unconditioned  
in the recovery system you must make it available there  
ususlly in /etc/rear/local.conf by using

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" wipefs )
</pre>

I implemented my above proposal how to add wipefs support  
and did a quick test with my SLE12-SP1 test system  
with btrfs and recovery still works for me (but I never had  
such an issue where wipefs would actually be needed).

@mattihautameki  
please also implement my above proposal how to add wipefs support  
and test on your system if wipefs helps in your case.

I put a simple Debug log in every ".sh" File in /usr/share/rear just to
see when the the link is not correct anymore.

1st and 2nd Line:

    MYDEBUGDEV="`ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/ |grep sda1`"
     Log "DEVICE for sda: $MYDEBUGDEV"

Here is the output
[http://pastebin.ca/3213322](http://pastebin.ca/3213322)  
I also noticed that a udevadm trigger does correct the by-uuid-link
instantly after the restore.

@jsmeix  
I will report the outcome of your wipefs approach shortly.

@mattihautameki  
note that currently for using wipefs you must have

Making wipefs automatically available to the rear recovery system  
when it is available in the original system is a next step, cf.

@mattihautameki we received no feedback since a long time from you - is
this issue closed for you?

Sry! I was busy. Just now I tested commit
8190db4ffd7d1a5a7bc5cec796bdaf2d48788f95 with no success. I inserted
"udevadm trigger" before the initrd is created. This seems to fix the
problem but not the cause.

@gdha I inserted 'udevadm trigger' in
[https://github.com/mattihautameki/rear/commit/f46722a3d1480cd391568be4bd73e21280278713](https://github.com/mattihautameki/rear/commit/f46722a3d1480cd391568be4bd73e21280278713).
Is it possible to implement something like that or do you think that
this may cause any other problems?

@mattihautameki it won't hurt so why not preparing a pull request?

@gdha I just created a pull request. I wanted to ask because I was not
sure you would accept a workaround rather than a fix for the real cause.

For what it's worth, I'm having the same problem and I don't think it
has anything to do with wipefs or pre-existing metadata. Every time I
repeat the installation I get the same error about how
/dev/disk/by-uuid/--random-UUID-- does not exist. but --random-UUID-- is
different each time I run it even though it fails. Out of the 8 systems
I'm testing on, 2 of them exhibit this behavior. One has identical drive
geometry and the other does not.

@exedor What distribution do you use? For me this issue only appears on
SLES12 and not on RHEL7/CentOS7. Since the workaround in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f46722a3d1480cd391568be4bd73e21280278713](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f46722a3d1480cd391568be4bd73e21280278713)
SLES12 works for me. I always tested on one machine (make backup -&gt;
restore backup on the same host)

I was running Fedora Core 21 and using the latest checkout of the source
repository. I eventually figured out what the problem was and tested a
fix that works equivalently on all other platforms as well. The shell
script in rear was using mkfs to create the file system which generates
a random UUID. Then afterward it was calling tune2fs to set the UUID
back to the one used on the original backed up system. That call to
tune2fs was not sticking so when the system would go to mount the
filesystems using the original UUID on reboot after restore the OS load
would fail looking for the wrong UUID. I'm still not entirely sure why
that was the case but mkfs takes a command line param for setting the
UUID and using that (only when present of course) instead of tune2fs
resolved the issue.

I think
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649)
fixes it.  
Therefore I close it.  
If I am wrong, it can be reopened.

Sounds good.

Typo in my comment
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649\#issuecomment-248609839](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/649#issuecomment-248609839)

I meant the fixes for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851)  
(in particular
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894))  
also fixes this issue here.
