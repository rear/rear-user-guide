The objective of this PR is to update the network migration process in
ReaR.

Before this PR, network migration was based on udev rules files to
detect and update mac or interface name.

A) The problem is that newer Linux distro (rhel7, ubuntu) does not
automatically update anymore the udev network rule files.

This prevent ReaR :

-   to propose new interface in case of migration
-   to rename interface and properly activate network in recovery mode
-   to perform Network Migration on the restored image.

=&gt; Migration is also currently impossible with `biosdevname` network
interface name format (which is the new default for ubuntu/redhat.)

B) Network parameter migration (ip/routes via
`/etc/rear/mapping/ip_addresses` or `/etc/rear/mapping/routes`) are only
compatible with RedHat/Suse sysconfig file format. (not debian/ubuntu)

This PR propose a migration compatible with latest RH / ubuntu (not
based in udev rules but biosdevname) while keeping compatibility with
udev rules for older distro.

1.  always propose new interface (even when udev rules is not used or
    empty)
2.  keep udev rules renaming as default (for compatibility)
3.  perform a direct migration of network system-setup scripts (only if
    udev migration cannot be done.) =&gt; to activate network in rescue
    mode
4.  Allow a migration of debian/ubuntu network configuration files
    (currently only redhat/suse)

Tested in migration on POWER with rhel 7.3 / suse 11 / suse 12 / ubuntu
16.04 (with and without `net.ifnames=0`)

Only for the fun of it:  
Perhaps the initial comment in  
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
is no longer fully right:  
"rewrite all the network configuration files for SUSE LINUX"  
;-)

@jsmeix thanks for the quick review and trust :-) ... But I will wait
the other to test this one with vagrant to cross check and hunt any
regression / issues.  
Especially @gdha as I think it should solves some of the issues he had
with ubuntu and `biosdevames` (\#1400, \#951 and \#1020)

@schabrolles  
don't overestimate my trust here ;-)  
Basically all I can do is to "bindly trust" you here  
because I am mostly clueless in this area  
so better do not trust my review here.

@schabrolles  
because you added your functions to lib/network-functions.sh  
I had a first look at that script (I never had something to do with
it)  
and I saw its strange looking functions (some of them even  
just call 'exit' which is totally unusual in "normal" ReaR scripts).

Now I am wondering (in particular after reading its initial comment)  
if lib/network-functions.sh was ever meant to be sourced  
by usr/sbin/rear to make its strange functions avaiable  
to all ReaR scripts?

In current (i.e. without this pull request) code  
lib/network-functions.sh is explicitly sourced by  
skel/default/bin/dhclient-script and  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
which matches the initial comment in lib/network-functions.sh

Currently the only "normal" ReaR script that calls  
a function from lib/network-functions.sh is  
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
which calls only the prefix2netmask function and that call  
was added by @gdha via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8472c46b31de2b748a6f948325101a970c452e61](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8472c46b31de2b748a6f948325101a970c452e61)

From my current point of view lib/network-functions.sh  
was never meant to be sourced by usr/sbin/rear to have  
its functions available in all "normal" ReaR scripts.

From my current point of view lib/network-functions.sh  
is only meant to be sourced and used to setup dhclient  
during recovery system initialization via the 'skel' scripts.

Simply put:  
I think some general cleanup is needed here.  
I think this should be done as a separated issue:  
I think network-functions.sh should be renamed into  
somethinmg like dhclient-setup-functions.sh  
and moved away from usr/share/rear/lib  
probably into usr/share/rear/skel and the two 'skel' scritps  
that source it should be adapted.

@schabrolles  
accordingly I think that your new networking functions  
should be implemented in a new separated file  
so that later we can do the dhclient setup functions  
cleanup.

The problem is that lib/network-functions.sh is the exact right name  
for generic networking functions for normal ReaR scripts  
so that the current lib/network-functions.sh should be right now  
renamed e.g. into dhclient-setup-functions.sh but then the two  
'skel' scripts need to be adapted right now which means  
that general cleanup needs to be done right now :-(

@schabrolles  
what do you think?

@gdha  
I see now that lib/network-functions.sh was added via your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/38d5bd280654dd4e05a8a408daad8e08925c3ab0](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/38d5bd280654dd4e05a8a408daad8e08925c3ab0)

Can you explain if that strange looking functions therein  
are really meant to be always available in all normal  
ReaR scripts?

What I mean is:  
None of the functions in lib/network-functions.sh  
uses any of the standard ReaR functions that we have  
but instead those functions in lib/network-functions.sh  
implement all on their own so that I think those functions  
basically come from a foreign world and live in that world  
which makes them not well suitable to be used by normal  
ReaR scripts.

@schabrolles  
I really dislike it when a specific issue like this one  
out of a sudden "explodes" into a monstrous task  
to overhaul major parts of ReaR.  
I do want to Keep Separated Issues Separated (KSIS).  
Therefore it should be best when you first merge  
this pull request as soon as possible.  
Afterwards we can do the lib/network-functions.sh  
cleanup as time permits.

I missed two functions in lib/network-functions.sh  
that are currently called by a normal ReaR script:  
is\_ip and get\_ip\_from\_fqdn are called in
lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
which was implemented by @schabrolles via

@jsmeix  
I've source `lib/network-functions.sh` in the **skel** `00-functions.sh`
to have access to `get_device_by_hwaddr()` function in
`55-migrate-network-devices.sh` (also part of **skel**).  
=&gt; The purpose is to have to IP set to the good interface (recognized
by its IP) during boot in rescue mode. (when `/etc/scripts/system-setup`
and `/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/*` scripts are executed.)

I'm not sure that `usr/sbin/rear` will execute
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00-functions.sh`.... But I may be wrong.

@schabrolles  
just proceed here as you like and as it works for you  
because as I wrote above we should do any  
"grand cleanup" via a separated issue/pull-request  
later at any time as time permits because currently  
nothing goes wrong so that there is no need to do  
such a "grand cleanup" right now.

@schabrolles @jsmeix I agree that network-functions.sh is collection I
grabbed from an old RHEL system to get the job done as easy as possible
(at that time - many, many years ago).  
I agree we better split it apart (network piece required for DHCP in
skel and network functions which are required by main rear script). That
will make it easier afterwards to clean it up.  
I also agree to merge this PR asap to get things going as the PR is a
good thing to have.  
@schabrolles rear will not execute
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00-functions.sh` or source it as it is part
of the booting up part of the rescue image (it is sourced by
/etc/scripts/system-setup script)

@gdha thanks for your review.  
Did you try it on your ubuntu 16.04 systems (where you have biosdevname)
? It solves the issues on my side; I just wanted to know if it solves
yours.

@schabrolles No, I did not test it yet with ubuntu16 yet as I was
struggling with ubuntu14 provisioning (just got it working without
errors). Pff - what people need to do to earn some money...  
I would say just merge it and I'll test it upcoming Friday with Ubuntu16
(if I did not break the Ubuntu16 provisioning now as everything is now
one cookbook).
