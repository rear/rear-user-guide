-   @schlomo, The change made in
    d89623404c08cf8b4b485e35295fb4caf2a35232 can produce error in some
    Linux Distro (like Sles11).  
    It is not directly link with the Linux version, but how scripts are
    dealing with `apply_layout_mappings()` function. In
    `250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh` a list of file to migrate is
    provided to the function. Depending to the configuration, some of
    them can e empty (or a link which point to an empty file.)

I think we just need to be sure that the function is called with 1
argument...  
But the fact to provide an empty file to the function should not produce
an ERROR which kill the recovery process. After all, if the file is
empty, no modification will be done.

-   I also made some changes in `250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh` in
    order to modify link target when absolute path is used. @schlomo
    @jsmeix your feedback/review is welcome here. (other scripts in
    finalize workflow should be modified in the same way, but lets
    validate this one before changing the others.)

@schabrolles  
I fail to understand how $1 is used in your  
apply\_layout\_mappings function because I find '$1'  
therein only in

<pre>
    [ "$1" ] || BugError "..."
...
    if [ -s "$1" ] ; then
</pre>

but afterwards it seems $1 is nowhere used?

FYI only a cosmetical proposal:  
In your apply\_layout\_mappings function you could eliminate the outer

<pre>
    # Only apply layout mapping on non-empty file.
    if [ -s "$1" ] ; then
        ...
    fi
</pre>

clause by "Return early, return often" coding style via

<pre>
    # Only apply layout mapping on non-empty file:
    test -s "$1" || return 0
</pre>

Is the apply\_layout\_mappings function perhaps meant like this:

<pre>
function apply_layout_mappings() {

    # Nothing to do if not in migration mode:
    test "$MIGRATION_MODE" || return 0

    local file_to_migrate="$1"

    # apply_layout_mappings needs one argument:
    [ "$file_to_migrate" ] || BugError "apply_layout_mappings function called without argument (file_to_migrate)."

    # Only apply layout mapping on non-empty file:
    test -s "$file_to_migrate" || return 0

    ...
</pre>

@jsmeix, I've seen the `$1` issue during my test this morning. it is
corrected now.  
I also really like your test proposal.... It is very clean. I will
certainly update the code with it.

@jsmeix @schlomo Updated with @jsmeix test proposal. Feedback welcome.

From plain looking at the code it looks very good now  
and I even understand what the apply\_layout\_mappings  
function is meant to do :-)
