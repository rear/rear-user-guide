@gdha  
oops - I changed it very much - I hope you don't mind.  
Hopefully with my changes it is still OK for you.

@gdha  
I do not like in my current code that the last command in the loop is an
error exit.  
I would perfer the last line is the normal output when all is ok.  
I could re-reorganize the error checking code if you like.

When code looks bad it is bad so I re-reorganized the error checking
code:  
Now it looks much simpler and it is more straightforward (KISS).  
In particular it checks the abort condition first and errors out
directly there.

@gdha  
would you like to do more tests before you merge it  
or should I merge it right now (provided you agree with my changes)?
