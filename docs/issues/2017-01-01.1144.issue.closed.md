#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):1.19 / 2016-12-23

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): 16.04.1 LTS

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_PROG=tar  
    OUTPUT\_URL=null  
    ISO\_URL="file:///media/nigel/5dd07191-9647-432f-bd4c-22fb863ad950/Ubuntu
    backup"  
    BACKUP\_URL=iso:///backup/  
    BACKUP\_OPTIONS=rw  
    KERNEL\_CMDLINE="forcepae"

-   Brief description of the issue: When running sudo usr/sbin/rear -v
    mkbackup an archive is created to the size of the free space of the
    system partition (on which the /tmp directory is). The process then
    fails with the following messages in the log:  
    mkdir: cannot create directory '/tmp/rear.0DSlFdKHTlVFu9K/tmp/boot':
    No space left on device  
    2017-01-01 11:18:11 ERROR: Could not mkdir
    /tmp/rear.0DSlFdKHTlVFu9K/tmp/boot

The harddrive I'm trying to back up is 320GB that is partitioned as:

-   30GB Filesystem Root (of which only 7GB is used)
-   Extended partition  
    - 267GB Mounted at /home (84GB used)  
    - 20GB Mounted at /usr/local (nearly totally empty)  
    - 3.1GB Swap

I'm really only needing to the rescue disk to backup the system
partition and I suppose the 20GB partition to an external 4TB usb hdd.
(The files in the home partition are backed up separately.) Any ideas
how I can achieve this?

Attached is the REAR log.

-   Work-around, if any: none.

Please use `ISO_DIR` instead of `ISO_URL` (`ISO_URL` is deprecated. Use
`OUTPUT_URL` instead). So, what you did was just redefining
`OUTPUT_URL`.

And, if `/tmp` does not have enough disk space you can redefine a
directory for temporary space with the variable `TMPDIR`

I assume the backup of the 84GB used home partition  
makes it too big for the 23GB free space on the root partition.

By default all mounted "normal" local filesystems are included  
in the backup except things in BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE  
see /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

To only backup the system partition either use  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE to specify what local  
filesystems should not be included in the backup.

Alternatively when you use the current ReaR GitHub code  
you could use BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE plus  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE to specify only what local  
filesystems should be included in the backup.

See the description of those variables in the current default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

ReaR calls 'tar' with the options '--one-file-system' and '--anchored'  
as follows (from my backup.log on my test system):

<pre>
tar --warning=no-xdev --sparse --block-number
 --totals --verbose --no-wildcards-match-slash
 --one-file-system --ignore-failed-read --anchored --gzip
 -X /tmp/rear.s0ZaD9wlm6SlToD/tmp/backup-exclude.txt
 -C / -c -f - / /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-e205.log
</pre>

On my test system '/' is the only mounted "normal" local filesystem:

<pre>
# mount | grep sda
/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
</pre>

Thank you very much gdha and jsmeix for your assistance. I'm yet to find
a chance to implement your suggestions and test but will let you know
when I do.

I assume at least for now this issue is sufficiently answered  
so that I close it hereby.  
If there are further questions that belong to this same issue  
it can be reopened.  
If there are further different questions, new separated issues  
should be opened to keep different topics separated.
