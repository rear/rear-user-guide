-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    when building a USB stick I have to use efi or syslinux for boot.  
    efi is not supported by this machine.  
    syslinux/extlinux does start but not boot anything.  
    it would be nice to choose grub for this. Everything would use the
    same boot system and would work fine.

I am not at all a booting expert and  
I know basically nothing at all about coreboot.

Perhaps @pcahyna could tell a bit more about  
using GRUB as bootloader also for OUTPUT=USB?

An alternative to OUTPUT=USB is OUTPUT=RAWDISK, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500)  
for an example and see the RAWDISK\_\* config variables  
in our current usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

According to default.conf and `man rear` (excerpt):

    OUTPUT=RAWDISK
        ...
        supports Legacy BIOS boot if syslinux is installed

So OUTPUT=RAWDISK also uses syslinux for BIOS boot  
so that OUTPUT=RAWDISK may fail same as OUTPUT=USB  
in case of coreboot (if syslinux does not work with coreboot).

FYI:  
With ReaR version 2.6 RAWDISK output fails to boot on Ubuntu
&gt;=18.04.4  
when using Grub 2 + UEFI but without Secure Boot, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2419](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2419)  
which is fixed in current ReaR GitHub master code.  
Regarding using current ReaR GitHub master code see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in

the output=rawdisk method is actually working fine with this machine. So
we have found a workaround and we know the issue is in the way the usb
disk is prepared.  
This workaround however need some additional scripting to write the file
to the disk and create a second partition for later backup storage (borg
in my case). This is not at all a solution for my usecase.

Edit:

1.  As a sidenote output=iso and then writing the iso to USB should work
    the same way. I however did not test it.
2.  With grub one can boot from a iso file stored on disk. I may use
    that method in the future.
3.  output=usb is broken in most modes - the only combination working
    fine for me is uefi + gpt (uefi however is not supported on this
    device)

Since serial display was not fully/correctly working for me (different
issue - PR follows soon) I did try most boot entries but not all of
them.

The chainloading from other disk and the topmost entry may have worked
while all the ones I expected to work (around +/-2 from the default one)
did not. Since I started to fix all sorts of issues in the scripts and
will PR them soon I am not sure if that one entry at top was actually
working all the time or just due to other fixes.

@DEvil0000  
thank you in advance for your pull requests!

I recommend to have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
to avoid that you do major coding work on your own  
but then we at ReaR upstream may have many questions about  
what the code is meant to do and why it does this or that specific
thing  
and why things are implemented in this or that specific way.

In particular the USB bootloader setup code is rather old code  
e.g. 50% of the code in output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
is 10 years old (from 2011 according to what 'git blame' shows)  
so large parts of the USB bootloader setup code is not in compliance
with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

In the past I tried several times to generally clean up the USB
bootloader setup code  
but I failed because I am not a sufficient bootloader setup expert to
understand  
how the current code works in all cases.  
I could fix a specific booting issue with my own USB disk at my own
computer  
by trial and error attempts until it works for me in my specific
environment  
but I cannot do a general cleanup of the USB bootloader setup code.
