[\#3359 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3359) `open`: BACKUP\_PROG=rsync: Is it possible to backup and restore to/from an NFS share that has root squash enabled?
============================================================================================================================================================================

I'm trying to use rsync to backup to an NFS share with root squash
enabled. It's not clear to me what root squash enabled means, but I
believe all root file permissions are mapped to the nobody user.  
I'm getting lots of errors like the one below in the
rsync-<hostnmae>.log file:

2024/12/07 14:54:28 \[17059\] rsync: chown
"/tmp/rear.CClpFWqalqYxnZo/outputfs/watch/backup/home/bs/.cache/evolution/addressbook"
failed: Operation not permitted (1)

AI and Google searches indicate that this is being caused by "root
squash enabled" on the NFS share. AI suggests adding these options to
the rear command:

sudo rear -v mkbackup -- --rsync-options="--no-owner --no-group"

I suspect that if I use those options, then I'll be unable to perform a
restore from the backup since all the file permissions will be set to
nobody:nobody.

Any tips on how to configure Relax-and-Recover to backup to an NFS share
with root-squash enabled?

Happening on serveral servers. Right now I'm troubleshooting a RHEL 6.10
server running ReaR 2.4.

Thanks,

` -- --rsync-options="--no-owner --no-group"`

I am afraid that AI has made that up.

Please show your local.conf file (without any passwords / secrets of
course)

Looks like site.conf is being used to configure rear. Here are the
contents:

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_PROG=rsync  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://hetnas1/mnt/tank/backups/rear\_backups  
AUTOEXCLUDE\_AUTOFS=y  
BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS=(--sparse --archive --hard-links --numeric-ids
--stats --log-file="$LOG\_DIR/rsync-$HOSTNAME.log")  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS=nfsvers=3,nolock

local.conf contains the commented out default message "This file
etc/rear/local.conf..."

Thanks,

@scook207 Why not using the `BACKUP=RSYNC` workflow? Have a look at
`/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` file for how-to...

@scook207

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_PROG=rsync

I see, not sure if there is some rsync trick to make it work under such
conditions (you can try `--fake-super`, but you will need extended
attributes enabled on the share). The easiest option is to use `tar`
(which is the default for `BACKUP_PROG` ) instead of `rsync`, if a
single tarball as the backup is enough for you. Another option is to use
`BACKUP=RSYNC` as @gdha has suggested, if `rsync` can connect to your
backup location (either over `ssh` or over the rsync protocol).
