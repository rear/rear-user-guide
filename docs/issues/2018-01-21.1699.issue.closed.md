Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / 2017-12-20  
borg 1.1.4

When using Borg there is no option to set umask variable.  
Default it is 077, so there is a problem when few users try use one borg
repository.

To resolve this issue:  
add new variable: BORGBACKUP\_UMASK  
and set it correctly in borg\_set\_vars function.

Just a guess, but did you try to set *umask* in your *local.conf* ?

Yes. I tried to set BORGBACKUP\_UMASK="0007" and a few more combinations
(including system environment variables) but I see that rear uses only a
few BORGBACKUP\_XXX variables to compose borg command line options.  
When borg is run without --umask option it uses default 077 and moreover
it is passing it to borge serve (if run through ssh). And it doesn't
matter if borg backup repository was created with different umask

OK, I see your point now.  
I'll write a patch for this.

@pavl00 feel free to test
[https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/borg\_umask](https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/borg_umask),
for changes related to Borg umask ...

If there will be no objections, this code will be merged in couple of
days into ReaRs upstream.

Yes it works with borg create.  
But as I can see now --umask must be used in all repo related borg
commands, here in rear: create,prune, init(probably).

Hmm, I've forgotten about `borg prune ...`, thanks for reminding me!  
I'll add it later today.

@pavl00 I've added *BORGBACKUP\_UMASK* for `borg prune ...`.

I'll wait ~24 hours and do the merge, if no other issues arise.
