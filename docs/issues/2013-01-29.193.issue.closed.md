Enhancement request:  
Would be great if PXE\_TFTP\_PATH and PXE\_CONFIG\_PATH support URL
syntax, similar to OUTPUT\_URL, such that PXE kernel, initrd, message,
menu and links can be uploaded directly to remote server.

I wonder which role `OUTPUT_URL` could play with PXE? Should we expand
the possibilities of `PXE_TFTP_PATH` and `PXE_CONFIG_PATH` or not?  
Please share your thoughts...

I'd say, if `OUTPUT_URL` is defined in the same time as `PXE_TFTP_PATH`
and `PXE_CONFIG_PATH`, than both are honored, i.e. `${RESULT_FILES[@]}`
are uploaded to `OUTPUT_URL`. In the same time, menu and MAC symlinks go
to `PXE_CONFIG_PATH` url and kernel and initrd go to `PXE_TFTP_PATH`
url.

With this

-   default works same as now.
-   if user wants to upload everything required for boot to one place,
    he'll define `OUTPUT_URL`
-   if user wants to upload pxe output stuff directly to bootp/tftp
    server, he'll define `PXE_{TFTP|CONFIG}_PATH` URLs.

Would be more readable than, to rename `PXE_{TFTP|CONFIG}_PATH` to
`PXE_{TFTP|CONFIG}_URL`.

@pavoldomin is this issue still relevant?

I have had no time to dig into this yet, sorry. I suppose it is still
relevant - as soon as recent lftp commits have not addressed it.

@pavoldomin perhaps an interesting feature you would like to test?

It works for me, closing this one. If problems arise I'm pretty sure a
new issue will be opened.
