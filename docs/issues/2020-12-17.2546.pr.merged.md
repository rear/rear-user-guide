-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**
-   Impact: **Normal**
-   How was this pull request tested? **manually by me - only the no
    label but uuid path**
-   Issue \#2548 related to this PR but it is not the same
-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    mkfs.vfat (used for e.g. uefi partition) did not honor the uuid from
    the layout so "boot original system" was failing (by id/no label)
    after a recover. It also adds new boot menu entries and changes boot
    order on HP machines when a efi partition with new id is detected.
    The change tries to use -i option to set the uuid on creation and
    falls back to not using it when it fails (like done in the script
    for ext and others). This fixes the issues.

I thought its more save and readable to do the check in any case. It
does not harm to do it. If you insist I will restructure it.
