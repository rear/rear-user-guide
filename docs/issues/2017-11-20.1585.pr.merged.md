With the new config variable  
NON\_FATAL\_BINARIES\_WITH\_MISSING\_LIBRARY  
the user can specify an 'egrep' pattern what programs  
(i.e. files in a /bin/ or /sbin/ directory) where the 'ldd' test in  
build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh reports 'not found' libraries  
are non-fatal so that those programs in the recovery system  
do not lead to an Error abort of "rear mkrescue/mkbackup".

This is a generic method so that the user can avoid issues  
in particular with third-party backup tools that soemtimes  
have unexpected ways to use their specific libraries like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533)
(for TSM) and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1560](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1560)
(for FDR/Upstream).

I consider it as a "minor bug" when there is no generic method  
in ReaR where the user can overrule an automatism in ReaR  
and as an "enhancement" when such a method is added.
