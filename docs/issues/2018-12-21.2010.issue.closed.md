This is a follow-up and generalization of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005)  
`Provide final power to the user for mkfs.xfs options if needed`

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

Current ReaR GitHub master code

-   Description of the issue:

Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005\#issue-238745807](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005#issue-238745807)  
Via new optional `MKFS_$FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS` config variables  
the user can specify mkfs options for all `mkfs -f $FILESYSTEM` calls  
and/or via optional device specific config variables like  
`MKFS_$FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS_SDA2` the user can  
specify mkfs options only for the `mkfs -f $FILESYSTEM` call  
for that dvice (e.g. for /dev/sda2 via MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS\_SDA2)  
where device specific config variables take precedence over  
the `MKFS_$FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS` config variable which  
takes precedence over the not changed default behaviour  
where some device specific options for the mkfs calls are set in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
via some stored values in disklayout.conf

-   Workaround:

<!-- -->

    # export MIGRATIN_MODE='true'
    # rear -D recover

and then in layout/recreate/default/100\_confirm\_layout\_code.sh  
at its `Confirm or edit the disk recreation script` dialog  
do `Edit disk recreation script (.../diskrestore.sh)`  
but I consider code hacking within the recovery system  
in general not really user-friendly, cf.

As far as I know for certain filesystems there is no support in ReaR  
to recreate the filesystem with all its option settings as it was on
the  
original system because there is no support in ReaR that stores all  
its option settings so that this issue could be even considered as  
an initial fix for that missing support in ReaR (not yet fully
automated  
but at least the user can then manually specify any mkfs options).
