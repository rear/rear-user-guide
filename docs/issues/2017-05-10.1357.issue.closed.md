Hi,  
do you know if rear is working on aarch64? We deployed RHEL-7 for this
architecture, but I see that rear doesn't create iso file with backup.
What with that?

    # cat /etc/rear/local.conf 
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://localhost/mnt/rear/

    # rear -v mkbackup

@tcerna We have no **aarch64** system available to play I'm afraid.
Donation is always welcome.

On aarch64 is not grub2 (as probably expected), but grubby. Is there
some support of grubby?  
There can be similar problem as on s390x architecture:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1261](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1261)  
Grubby on aarch64 is also mentioned in issue:
