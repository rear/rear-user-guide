Hello Community :-)

Sorry if i ask dummy question, but i'm a rear beginner.  
I have installed RPM provided by rear website for Suse (no-arch one).  
It's working but not creating any ISO file.

Please find my config:

<pre>
# rear -V
Relax-and-Recover 1.17.1 / Git
# cat os.conf
OS_VENDOR=SUSE_LINUX
OS_VERSION=12
</pre>

The Suse is on IBM Power server.

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=file:///nfs/mksysb
AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y
BOOT_OVER_SAN=y
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/' )
BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/nfs' )
</pre>

Result of rear -v mkbackup command:

<pre>

But no ISO image created.

I have tried to install release 2.00 with make install but it fails
immediatly with a BUG with Grub2.

Any help will be very appreciated for this tool who seems to be very
helpfull for us.

Many thanks  
Nico

Hi @nicovd737,

Your ISO is most probably located in */var/lib/rear/output*, but that is
not the main problem ...  
I'm guessing that your */nfs* is NFS share, if so, let ReaR handle
mounting/unmounting of network share by using config similar to this
one:

    BACKUP_URL=nfs://<NFS_server>/mnt/rear
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://<NFS_server>/mnt/rear/iso

With your current config you will most probably face some missing
binaries during recover phase.

Hi @gozora

Thanks for your reply. If try the OUTPUT\_URL settings but it's the same

On my systems (all of them x86\_64) ISO image is created by
*output/ISO/Linux-i386/820\_create\_iso\_image.sh*.  
This part of ReaR is not executed on your Power HW.  
To be honest I have never hands on experience with such HW :-( hence
have no idea how boot works there.

You can have a look on issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/663](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/663),
similar to yours, which includes patch
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/672](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/672)
introduced in ReaR 1.18 (however I can't evaluate if it will help or
not). I guess you can try to download ReaR 2.0 and check if it solves
your problem ...

Simply put:  
ReaR 1.17.1 is too old to be used on IBM Power.

Recently there have been many adaptions and enhancements  
from @schabrolles regarding ReaR on Power (ppc64/ppc64le)  
and there have been further adaptions and enhancements  
also from @schabrolles regarding ReaR with MULTIPATH  
and I think also regarding ReaR with SAN.

@nicovd737  
because you use ReaR on Power with MULTIPATH and SAN  
I think you basically must use the latest ReaR code.

FYI:

Regarding your BACKUP\_URL=file:///nfs/mksysb  
As far as I know this does not work.  
I always use

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
</pre>

where 10.160.4.244 is the IP of my NFS server  
so that ReaR mounts the NFS share.  
Let ReaR mount the NFS share is in particular useful  
during "rear recover" so that you do not need to manually  
mount your NFS share from within the ReaR recovery system  
before you can run "rear recover".

In general have a look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular all the sections from the start up to  
"Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)"  
plus all the later sections until the end starting at  
"Virtual machines".

@nicovd737  
thanks for your prompt feedback  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368\#issuecomment-302328892](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368#issuecomment-302328892)  
that is works with the current ReaR code.  
Such feedback helps us a lot to know that it really works in practice!

@schabrolles  
once more many thanks for your various adaptions and enhancements  
regarding Power architecture and MULTIPATH and SAN.  
It helps so much when experts in that areas contribute!

@nicovd737  
one more FYI:  
In latest ReaR there are some example configs in  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ in particular there is  
a RHEL7-PPC64LE-Mulitpath-PXE-GRUB.conf  
from @schabrolles which is probably also helpful  
on SLES12 - of course you cannot just copy it, the  
example configs are meant as hints what config variables  
are of interest regarding a particular setup.  
For example when you use the default SLES12 btrfs structure  
you should additionally have a look at  
SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf or SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
(depending on whether you have SP1 or SP2 which are  
incompatible in their default btrfs structures) and  
if you use e.g. SAP-HANA or UEFI you should  
check some more example configs...

@gdha  
I guess such extra prep script stuff is more meant for me  
because the usage of snapper together with btrfs on SLE12  
is a very SUSE specific thing.

Because SUSE's default btrfs setup in SLE12 is so complicated  
(or at least it looks so complicated to me) I have currently  
no good idea how to automate that stuff so that  
it works reliably with reasonable effort.

Therefore at least for now I must leave it to the (poor) user  
to manually "do the right settings" in local.conf to avoid  
that users get a wrong and misleading expectation  
that "ReaR just works with SLE12 and btrfs".

Or in other and more general words:  
Unless I can make an automatism working reliably  
I won't implement an automatism.

My hope is that for the upcoming SLE15 ( 12 + 1 = 15 ;-)  
the SUSE default btrfs setup stabilizes and then  
I may try another attempt to make its usage easier in ReaR.

But when the SUSE default btrfs setup still changes  
in incompatible ways I cannot do much because I will not  
implement overcomplicated and oversophisticated code  
that tries to "do things automatically right" for all those  
different and incompatible SUSE default btrfs setups.

@schabrolles  
thanks for your example!  
By the way when reading it I wonder if the comment at

<pre>
### write the rescue initramfs to USB and update the USB bootloader 
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL="nfs://10.7.19.177/rear" 
</pre>

is a meanwhile false leftover from a former version?  
I also wonder what special stuff your final command

<pre>
Tu trouveras ...

actually does on your SLES12 on POWER system ;-)

@jsmeix : :D .... copy / past from email ....  
I will may be propose the same example with POWER + PXE for SUSE 12 with
clean comment

Regarding the specifique setup for SLE12 with btrfs, I agree with @gdha.
It should be part of a script somewhere to be automated...  
Why not started with a script specific to SLE12, that just set the
variables :

    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" snapper chattr lsattr )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE[@]}" $btrfs_subvolume_without_snap )

There cannot be a "script specific to SLE12"  
because for SLE12 there are several different  
incompatible btrfs default setups:

SLE12-SP2 btrfs default setup is incompatible compared to  
SLE12-SP1 btrfs default setup which is incompatible compared to  
SLE12-GA (a.k.a. SLE12-SP0) btrfs default setup.

Therefore there are three different example configs:  
For SLE12-SP2: conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
for SLE12-SP1: conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf  
for SLE12-GA/SP0: conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf

Also there cannot be three scripts each one specific  
to SLE12-SP2, SLE12-SP1, and SLE12-GA/SP0  
(or in one script with three different cases therein).

Reason:

When a user has initially installed SLE12-GA/SP0 from scratch  
(then initially he needs a SLE12-GA/SP0 specific ReaR setup)  
and updated to SLE12-SP1 and to SLE12-SP2,  
then - as far as I know - the usual update  
only replaces RPMs with newer versions  
but it leaves the btrfs structure unchanged  
so that the user still needs a SLE12-GA/SP0 specific ReaR setup  
(only what is in his backup is now newer files)  
but - as far as I know - the updated system shows itself  
as a SLE12-SP2 system.

When a user has initially installed SLE12-SP1 from scratch  
(then initially he needs a SLE12-SP1 specific ReaR setup)  
and updated to SLE12-SP2,  
then - as far as I know - the usual update  
only replaces RPMs with newer versions  
but it leaves the btrfs structure unchanged  
so that the user still needs a SLE12-SP1 specific ReaR setup  
(only what is in his backup is now newer files)  
but - as far as I know - the updated system shows itself  
as a SLE12-SP2 system.

When a user has initially installed SLE12-SP2 from scratch  
(then initially he needs a SLE12-SP2 specific ReaR setup)  
and the system shows itself as a SLE12-SP2 system.

This means we cannot rely on what version strings  
the system tells about itself.

We must inspect "the real thing",  
i.e. the really existing btrfs stuff.

When we inspect the really existing btrfs stuff  
it means the btrfs stuff in ReaR works generically.

And this is what I have currently implemented:  
The btrfs stuff in ReaR works generically.

It works independent of what a particular system  
tells in whatever strings as what it likes to be  
recognized by users who look at that strings.

The current btrfs stuff in ReaR works only on real hard facts  
(at least I tried to implement it in this way).

This is what I can maintain - at least to some extent - see below.

This way the current generically working btrfs stuff in ReaR  
also works on Red Hat and on whatever other systems  
without having specific scripts for each one.

But the current generically working btrfs stuff in ReaR  
has some limitations.

It does not and cannot "just work" for any possible  
btrfs structure one can set up manually.

In particular it fails - as far as I can imagine - for  
interwoven btrfs subvolumes, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497\#issuecomment-71650367](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497#issuecomment-71650367)  
and the subsequent comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497\#issuecomment-71652667](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497#issuecomment-71652667)

And I think somehow I messed up something  
while I implemented support for the incompatible  
SLE12-SP1 btrfs stuff (compared to SLE12-GA/SP0)  
(since SLE12-SP1 snapper is 'in between')  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556)  
so that there is currently this bug  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1036](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1036)

I do appreciate any fixes, adaptions, and enhancements  
that make the generically working btrfs support in ReaR  
work better and more reliably in general.

In contrast I think Linux distribution specific scripts or  
even special Linux distribution version specific scripts  
will not really help because in the end any user on any  
recent Linux system can manually create any btrfs structure  
so that in the end only generically working btrfs scripts  
could properly implement btrfs support in ReaR.

@jsmeix if SLES12 is incompatible between service packs then it seems to
me that we should start to treat "12SP1" as the "version" for ReaR
andnot just "12". That way we can have different scripts for that.

Maybe this is also a very good moment to go back to actually have
different OS\_VERSION and OS\_MASTER\_VERSION for SLES where we for
example use OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR=SUSE and OS\_MASTER\_VERSION=12 for the
stuff that is generic enough for all SLE12 and openSUSE12 while we use
OS\_VENDOR=SLE and OS\_VERSION=12SP1 for SLE12-SP1 specifically.
openSUSE specials can then go to OS\_VENDOR=openSUSE or something like
that.

@schlomo  
didn't you read my reasoning why  
Linux distribution version specific scripts  
cannot work in general?

A SLES12-SP2 user can maunally setup a btrfs structure  
that matches the one in SLES12GA/SP0 or in SLES12-SP1  
or in Red Hat or in Ubuntu or anything else whatever he likes.

Linux distribution version specific scripts will "just fail".

Erwischt :-(

OK :-)

To avoid misunderstanding:

I think what could of course be done is to automate things like

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" snapper chattr lsattr )
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )
</pre>

because I assume it is possible to autodetect sufficiently reliably  
whether or not that stuff is needed during "rear recover" and  
if that stuff is copied into the recovery system regardless  
that it is not actually needed there it should cause no failure  
(just the recovery system is bigger than actually needed).

An addendum regarding whether or not  
a SLE12-SP1 system that was upgraded to SLE12-SP2  
shows itself as a SLE12-SP2 system or still as SLE12-SP1:

When upgrading with plain "zypper dup" the /etc/os-release file  
is left unchanged so that afterwards it still shows itself as SLE12-SP1.

One needs to do a so called "service pack migration", see  
the "Service Pack Migration" section in the SUSE documentation  
in particular therein see "Migrating with Zypper" at  
[https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book\_sle\_deployment/data/sec\_update\_migr\_zypper\_onlinemigr.html](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/sec_update_migr_zypper_onlinemigr.html)

This is another reason why scripts won't work reliably  
if they only check version strings to behave different  
(the better way is to check "the real thing" directly).
