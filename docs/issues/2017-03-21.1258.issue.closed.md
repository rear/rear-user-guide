In my **recovery** environment **$HOSTNAME** resolves to **localhost**.

Which is not the name of the directory where backups are stored.

On the other hand in /prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive the
correct location is chosen,
/verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive needs some fixing
to handle the localhost case correctly for **USB/NETFS**.

As far as I remember ReaR's default behaviour  
for backup on USB is "strange", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164)  
and follow the links therein.

What worked for me is using USB\_SUFFIX.  
I never got used to use ReaR's default way  
for backup on USB.

@ProBackup-nl  
I think the root cause of the issue here is that  
in your recovery system $HOSTNAME='localhost'.

I think a lot of things would fail when in the  
recovery system $HOSTNAME='localhost'.

In contrast to you I have in my recovery system

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # echo $HOSTNAME
e205
</pre>

As far as I can imagine this is basically a mandatory  
precondition so that "rear recover" can work normally.

Regarding how HOSTNAME is set in the recovery system see  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot

<pre>
# set hostname
export HOSTNAME="$(cat /etc/HOSTNAME)" # set hostname in THIS shell
hostname "$HOSTNAME" # set hostname in the system

echo Hostname set to $(uname -n)
</pre>

In my recovery system I have

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # cat /etc/HOSTNAME 
e205
</pre>

and /etc/HOSTNAME in the recovery system is created by  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/100\_hostname.sh

@ProBackup-nl  
I think you shoud do some debugging with "rear -d -D mkrescue"  
and KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes" what happens during  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" in your case and what that results  
as /etc/HOSTNAME in the recovery system in your case.

@jsmeix

/etc/HOSTNAME in the recovery system is correctly set to "d2".

`usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot` is there and seems to set
the hostname.

I don't see any `usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot` script
output in the recovery boot process. The file exists on the recovery
medium.

@ProBackup-nl  
what is the content of /etc/rear/rescue.conf in the recovery system  
or with KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes" after "rear mkbackup"  
in /tmp/rear.$TMPDIR/rootfs/etc/rear/rescue.conf ?

I have in rescue.conf in particular

<pre>
NETFS_PREFIX="e205"
</pre>

where "e205" is the hostname of my original system  
where I run "rear mkbackup".

@jsmeix I am back from a cycling trip through the south of the
Netherlands and Flanders and some hedge trimming at the soon to-be solar
farm location.

My rescue.conf lists:

    ...
    USE_DHCLIENT=y
    DHCLIENT_BIN=dhcpcd
    DHCLIENT6_BIN=

    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=""
    NETFS_PREFIX="rear/d2/20170324.2344"

    ...
    unset TMPDIR
    USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1
    UEFI_BOOTLOADER="/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi"

Where "d2" is the hostname of my original system (backup source).

I think the root cause is still that somehow in your recovery system  
HOSTNAME is not set to the hostname of the original system.

I assume when you do in your recovery system manually  
what usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot  
does to set the right HOSTNAME, i.e.

<pre>
export HOSTNAME="$(cat /etc/HOSTNAME)"
hostname "$HOSTNAME"
</pre>

or something like that, then it should work.

I added some debugging stuff to my  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot  
and I also think that script is not run at all.

That script is listed in usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/inittab  
but /etc/inittab is only for the sysv-compatible init process  
and nowadays we have - hooray - systemd!

I guess in your particular case systemd does not  
do "the right things" in your recovery system  
to setup the HOSTNAME.

Fortunately ;-) I am not at all a systemd expert  
so that I cannot really help further - if the root cause  
is really related to systemd.

FWIW:  
It seems there are three systems unit files  
that run /etc/scripts/system-setup in the recovery system:

<pre>
$ find usr/share/rear/skel | xargs grep -l 'ExecStart=/etc/scripts/system-setup'

usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sysinit.service
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/run-system-setup.service
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service
</pre>

I will never ever understand systemd...

@jsmeix Also strange is that `recover` script
`/usr/share/rear/verify/USB/NETFS/default/540_choose_backup_archive.sh`
tries to detect backup in a **non-existing outputfs directory**
'/tmp/rear.xyz/outputfs/'.

    # ls /tmp/rear.xyz
    rootfs  tmp

Where `./rootfs` is empty and `./tmp` contains a file named
`storage_drivers`.

I had some trouble with 540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
and the root cause is that the default ReaR behaviour  
for BACKUP\_URL=usb is incompatible with other  
BACKUP\_URLs for BACKUP=NETFS, see my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258\#issuecomment-288993939](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258#issuecomment-288993939)  
and you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166)  
in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166\#issuecomment-272857089](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166#issuecomment-272857089)  
that explains why 'USB' behaves strange.

I would recommend to use the compliance mode via USB\_SUFFIX.

But even USB\_SUFFIX would not fix the root issue here  
that in your recovery system $HOSTNAME somehow  
contains a value that does not work with ReaR.

@jsmeix Thanks for the manual hostname setup. The first export step runs
fine. The `hostname` command does not exist
(`hostname: command not found`) in the recovery system.

At least the only result of `find / -name hostname` is:
`/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`

My lean source (Arch Linux) system hasn't got a `hostname` command on
board:

    # find / -name hostname
    /etc/hostname
    /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
    /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/hostname
    /usr/lib/gettext/hostname

I think these are the issues here:

1.  the recover filesystem needs to have a lower case `/etc/hostname`
    instead of `/etc/HOSTNAME` file for Arch Linux systems
2.  the usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot need to have an
    alternative way to set the hostname on Arch Linux systems using
    `hostnamectl`, for example `# hostnamectl set-hostname myhostname`;
    and `/usr/bin/hostnamectl` should be copied to the recovery medium.
3.  there should be some kind of warning when neither `hostname` nor
    `hostnamectl` commands are available during the `mkrescue` phase.

@jsmeix I can confirm that on Arch Linux the lower case `/etc/hostname`,
instead of upper case `/etc/HOSTNAME`, correctly sets the hostname in
the recovery environment.

@ProBackup-nl  
there are tons of missing tests during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
for things which would fail later during "rear recover", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1233](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1233)

Any additional test during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
that makes the result of "rear recover" more predictable  
is much appreciated.

In general regarding "warning" messages see  
[http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

@jsmeix @ProBackup-nl We could foresee a symbolic link from
`/etc/hostname` to `/etc/HOSTNAME` in our skeleton directory structure,
wouldn't this solve it?

@gdha I can't find any reason why a symbolic in the recovery environment
wouldn't solve this issue. Where should I create the symbolic link to
test the symbolic link solution?

In `rear/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/` ?

I did revert my changes that created a lowercase /etc/hostname. Then I
did this:

    # cd usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/
    # ln -s HOSTNAME hostname
    # cd ~/rear
    # usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

That made the hostname appear in the (Arch Linux based) recovery
environment.

I think  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/100\_hostname.sh  
is the right place to create all needed stuff in the  
recovery system so that setting HOSTNAME works  
during startup of the the recovery system.

I would prefer to do all what belongs to the  
"set HOSTNAME in the recovery system" functionality  
in the 100\_hostname.sh script instead of splitting that  
functionality over several places i.e. have it partially  
in 100\_hostname.sh plus a symbolic link in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/  
Furthermore one cannot provide any comment in such a  
symbolic link in usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/ that  
could tell about why that symbolic link is there, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
in contrast to creating that link in 100\_hostname.sh

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/515451?u=4f985fa15d087babc5049c337be90b42b56c8b8b&v=4" width="50">[ProBackup-nl](https://github.com/ProBackup-nl) commented at [2017-04-13 08:37](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258#issuecomment-293828366):

For the lack of documentation capabilities, and the symbolic link
pointing to a not-yet-existing file, I wouldn't prefer the symbolic link
solution.

Instead modify
[usr/share/rear/rescue/default/100\_hostname.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2c12a52b3322f833c81cae2a8bc5baa799c3187d/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/100_hostname.sh)
to first try to detect whether there is `/etc/hostname` or
`/etc/HOSTNAME` on the source system and use that name. In case both are
not available, use `/etc/HOSTNAME`.

In
[usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/9627d9059dab1a7a3661e049f3acea441cf69cc4/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot#L37)
I would make the "set hostname" section conditional to the existence of
/etc/HOSTNAME. For Arch Linux the hostname will still be set as long as
`/etc/hostname` is available, it doesn't need this scripted setting of
the host name.
