I succeeded in the past when the destination disk was a Crucial MX500
SSD  
I tried it today (with that SSD) and it failed with the "no space"
error.  
I re-ran the format process, tried again, same error.  
I then switched to a brand new, never used WD BLUE 1TB SSD  
Same error: ... no space

The crucial part is

    '/tmp/rear.mZskxippnJnLTyE/tmp/initrd.cgz' -> '/tmp/rear-efi.A0Iu8RqU9F//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz'
      cp: error writing '/tmp/rear-efi.A0Iu8RqU9F//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz': No space left on device

so there is no space left on those device where initrd.cgz should be
copied to  
and that is where the /tmp/rear-efi.A0Iu8RqU9F//EFI/BOOT/ directory is  
which is the device where /tmp/ is.

Nowadays /tmp/ is often on a tmpfs which is usually on RAM,  
cf.
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tmpfs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tmpfs)  
so no space left on a tmpfs is related to no RAM left.  
To check how much free space there is where /tmp/ is you may call

    # df -h /tmp

By default up to ReaR 2.6 it uses the traditional Unix/Linux  
directory for temporary files which is /tmp/  
see the description about TMPDIR in your  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf file  
or in our rear-2.6 branch here online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L44)  
how you could specify a different directory for temporary files  
where there is more space available by setting TMPDIR.

In current ReaR master code (i.e. what will be released as ReaR 2.7)  
we use now by default /var/tmp/ which is usually not a tmpfs  
but on the system disk where sufficient space should be available,  
cf. the current ReaR master code default.conf file online currently at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L44)

Nope. Doesn't fix it. Exact same error. I've added
`export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}"` to my `/etc/rear/local.conf` file
and tried again. Same error at same point in the process. Well, more
precisely ...

Notice how `/var/tmp` is now used but also notice the copy from
`/var/tmp` to `/tmp`

Ah!  
The code where it fails is in  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
(excerpts)

    local efi_mpt
    efi_mpt=$( mktemp -d $TMPDIR/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX ) || Error "mktemp failed to create mount point '$TMPDIR/rear-efi.XXXXXXXXXX' for EFI partition '$efi_part'"

    local efi_dir="/EFI/BOOT"
    local efi_dst="$efi_mpt/$efi_dir"
    .
    .
    .
    # Copy initrd:
    cp -L $v "$TMP_DIR/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME" "$efi_dst/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME" || Error "Failed to copy initrd to $efi_dst/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME"

This is from our current GitHub master code.  
In ReaR 2.6. it was rather different (in particular hardcoded '/tmp/').

So where it copies to is the mountpoint of an EFI partition  
so there is "No space left on device" on the EFI partition on your USB
disk.

See in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
the descriptions about `USB_...` config variables in particular
USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE  
that is currently by default 512 MiB `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="512"`

You could specify e.g. 1 GiB with `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="1024"`  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2774](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2774)  
and format again your USB disk with `rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdb`  
which is the clean way.

Alternatively you may try to reduce the size of the ReaR initrd  
(the ReaR initrd contains the ReaR recovery system)  
with things like

    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )

(see the descriptions in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
but that makes your ReaR recovery system less generally usable  
up to completely unusable when mandatory firmware files are missing  
that are needed on your particular hardware or when you try to  
recreate your system on compatible but not identical replacement
hardware  
then mandatory kernel modules for the replacement hardware could be
missing  
cf.
