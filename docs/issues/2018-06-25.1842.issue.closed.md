-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    ReaR 2.4 and probably some earlier versions

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    SLES10

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine):  
    x86 compatible (x86\_64)

-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot?  
    BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    ReaR 2.4 and probably some earlier versions do no longer work on
    SLES10.

The ReaR recovery system ISO boot menue is not the "usual" one  
where one can select boot entries via a ncurses-like UI with cursor
keys,  
instead it is a rather simple plain text thingy.  
Manually typing `rear` makes it boot.

I get lots of LVM related entries in disklayout.conf  
regardless that I have no LVM on my test system.  
Most LVM related entries in disklayout.conf are commented  
but some are active and that let "rear recover" fail.  
Manually commenting all LVM related entries in disklayout.conf helps.

In diskrestore.sh there are non working parted calls (wrong syntax -
easy to see).  
Manually adapting them in diskrestore.sh helps.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Enforcing migration mode via `export MIGRATION_MODE=yes` before
    `rear recover`  
    and then manually adapting disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh at the
    matching dialogs  
    helps to make `rear recover` working successfully even on SLES10,  
    at least on a simple SLES10 system as my test system  
    with a single 20GiB disk with ext3 and DHCP networking.

This issue is no bug in current ReaR because  
since ReaR 1.17 we had dropped officially support for SLES10,  
see the doc/rear-release-notes.txt diff in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/86009877e7ae15d768d9eb3b6d0e660118dfdf42](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/86009877e7ae15d768d9eb3b6d0e660118dfdf42)

For the next ReaR 2.5 I will explicitly tell in its release notes  
that it does not work on SLES10, see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1765\#issuecomment-381520313](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1765#issuecomment-381520313)  
and in general see

@jsmeix Perhaps, by the end of this year we can also drop builds on OBS
of SLES10 and RHEL5 (as they are not supported anymore \[officially\])?

@gdha  
it is perfectly fine for me to no longer officially build for officially
unsupported targets  
because that avoids false expectations by the users.

Inofficially a user can download any latest ReaR package  
and forcefully install that on his officially unsupported system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1837\#issuecomment-399076717](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1837#issuecomment-399076717)  
because ReaR is only bash scripts so that it should not matter  
in practice for what specific version of a distribution it was built.

Alternatively a user can `git clone` our latest GitHub master code and  
therein he can even go back step by step until a certain git commit  
where that state still works on his officially unsupported system, cf.

I documented in the release notes for the upcoming ReaR 2.5  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md)  
that ReaR-2.4 (and probably also some earlier versions)  
is known to no longer work reasonably well for SLES 9 and 10, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/72ce3e18f5220055d7852ef18cf5341ec1f64125](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/72ce3e18f5220055d7852ef18cf5341ec1f64125)
