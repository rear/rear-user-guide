-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In conf/examples/SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf  
removed the meanwhile outdated and  
obsolete information about ebiso, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084\#issuecomment-1833496190](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084#issuecomment-1833496190)
so with /usr/bin/xorrisofs it "just works"  
to make a UEFI bootable ISO image  
that should boot even with Secure Boot, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084\#issuecomment-1835773844](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084#issuecomment-1835773844)
Additionally I added a part about SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3300](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3300)  
Furthermore I overhauled the whole comment texts.

Seems ok to me, may we add some options in case of SAN boot volumes  
(some enterprise HW for hana woks that way).

    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
    BOOT_OVER_SAN=y

    # the following may not be required,
    # but we had some issues loading the module in the past.
    MODULES=( ${MODULES[@]} dm-multipath )
    MODULES_LOAD=( ${MODULES_LOAD[@]} dm-multipath )

Some SAN and multipath example stuff is in  
conf/examples/RHEL7-PPC64LE-Multipath-PXE-GRUB.conf

I neither know about SAN nor multipath  
nor could I test it with reasonable effort from homeoffice  
so I don't plan to change or enhance SAN and multipath examples  
in particular not "by the way" via this pull request.

I added a hint regarding SAN and multipath to look at  
conf/examples/RHEL7-PPC64LE-Multipath-PXE-GRUB.conf

@rear/contributors  
unless there are objections I would like  
to merge it next week on Tuesday afternoon.

This is only an example (i.e. primarily it is documentation)  
which means unless there is something plain wrong therein  
we can have it "as is" in our GitHub master code so that  
later others could further adapt and enhance it as needed.

Thank you for updating our docs and please merge as you see fit. When I
gave my initial approval that meant that I'm fine with you merging it as
you see fit.

@schlomo @didacog @gdha  
thank you for your reviews!  
It helped to make this example more generic  
and more clear which config settings are mandatory  
versus which are only meant as optional suggestions.

I think in its current state it is at least "good enough"  
to be merged so I will merge it soon today...
