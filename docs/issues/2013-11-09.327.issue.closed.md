Hi , i have 3.10.9 kernel running with udev 204.  
While running rear recover im getting the following error :


    ERROR: Mount command 'mount /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER /tmp/rear.fbhHW5ocbWdLhET/outputfs' failed

i have 2 block devices detected :


    ls -l /sys/block/ |grep -v "ram\|loop"
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov  9 21:58 sda -> ../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0d.0/ata1/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov  9 21:58 sr0 -> ../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.1/ata4/host3/target3:0:0/3:0:0:0/block/sr0

so it seems kernel was able to detect my virtual disk and
cdrom(virtualbox)

the disk/by-lable is empty :


    ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/
    total 0

Any suggestions on how to solve and where is there is the problem?

Actually the problem remains. What happened is that i accidentally
created 2 exact issues ( 326 and 327) and i just closed one of them.  
I'm still looking fir the solution...
