-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git

-   OS version: Ubuntu 18.04 Server and others

-   Description of the issue:

    ReaR can auto-detect a DHCP client on the original system and
    configure the rescue system accordingly. Currently, the
    auto-detection relies on finding a running DHCP client process.

    Ubuntu 18.04 Server by default uses
    [systemd-networkd(8)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/systemd-networkd.8.html),
    which has a built-in DHCP client. ReaR should detect if this is
    enabled (cf.
    [systemd.network(5)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man5/systemd.network.5.html))
    and configure the rescue system accordingly.

    Note that Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop by default still uses
    *NetworkManager* which fires up *dhclient*. This was already
    correctly detected by ReaR before.

    Also note that Ubuntu 18.04 by default uses
    [netplan(5)](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man5/netplan.5.html)
    to configure the networking setup. Netplan uses a YAML configuration
    to generate the respective configuration files for
    *systemd-networkd* or *NetworkManager*. Yet, these generated
    configurations can be overridden:

    In case of *systemd-networkd*, if *netplan* had generated a
    configuration file `/run/systemd/network/10-netplan-eno1.network`,
    it could be overridden by creating a configuration file
    `/etc/systemd/network/10-netplan-eno1.network`.

-   Note: PR upcoming
