-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):

> 1.17.2. / Git as well as 1.18 / Git

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    lsb\_release -a

> No LSB modules are available.  
> Distributor ID: Debian  
> Description: Debian GNU/Linux 8.3 (jessie)  
> Release: 8.3  
> Codename: jessie

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

> OUTPUT=ISO  
> BACKUP=BAREOS  
> BAREOS\_CLIENT=primaryserver  
> OUTPUT\_URL=cifs://10.25.0.100/rearimages/  
> OUTPUT\_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"

-   Brief description of the issue  
    I am running

> /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue -v

creating a iso on my NAS, which works fine. My server is used headless,
but during install and maintenance, I (may - if not going ssh) use HDMI
and a usb keyboard.

To test my setup, I have an exact clone of my hardware. The only
difference is the network interface and MAC. I use
unetbootin-windows-613 to copy the rear iso image to my usb stick. I use
this stick for any linux installation, so I am sure that this one is
fine. My clone hardware starts, but suddenly hangs with a message

> The original network device eth0 00:11:22:33:44:55 is not available.  
> Please select another device:

> 1.  eth1 00:12:34:56:78:90 r8169

This of course is absolutely correct. However, my usb keyboard, which is
plugged in during this process from the very beginning, does not accept
any input. All I can do is to turn off my computer at this point. I then
thought that maybe some kernel modules are missing and tried to force
rear by adding

> MODULES\_LOAD=( input mousedev keybdev usbcore uhci\_hcd usbhid )

to my config(right underneath BAREOS\_CLIENT).

Still no luck. I then upgraded rear to 1.18 from Git. It behaves exactly
the same. Am I missing out on something? Could it be that NIC modules
are started before the USB module, creating a runtime issue here?

Dear community, I am absolutely stuck!

Thanks for any help or hints. I am really impressed by the concept of
rear and would like to dive deeper into this fantastic tool once it is
up and running for the first time! My idea is to do a PXE boot at the
very end... but I somehow need to start out with a iso and USB solution
to get a basic start.

Solved by adding  
`LOAD_MODULES( cherry_hid )`  
to my local.conf.  
I disconnected my keyboard when I executed the rear mkrescue via SSH or
cronjob. The module was not loaded.  
In order to find all kinds of available kernel modules of the hid-\*
(like hid-cherry), I searched my system by executing  
`find  / -name "hid-*.ko" | sed 's/.*\///' | tr '-' '_' |  sed 's/\(.*\)\..*/\1/' | tr '\n' ' ' > /etc/rear/modlist.txt`
