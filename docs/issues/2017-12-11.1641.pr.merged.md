-   This will prompt for TSM password earlier.  
    Moving this script before `390_request_point_in_time_restore` will
    give better user experience (\#1534)

Only FYI:  
The subtle "no newline at end of file" issues are the reason  
why I usually have a trailing empty line at the end of my scripts  
(i.e. actually there are two newlines at the end) because  
then it is obvious in a text editor that there is at least  
one newline at the end of the file.
