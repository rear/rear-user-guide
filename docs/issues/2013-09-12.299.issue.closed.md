[\#299 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/299) `closed`: TSM Recovery uses timers during data input
===========================================================================================================

when doing a restore using TSM ReaR asks several questions. All these
questions are done via a timed read which is currently on 30 seconds.  
In an emergency situation when recovery is needed this adds a lot of
unwanted stress as decisions which filesystems have to be recreated need
to be done during that 30 seconds time period. To have that timer
configurable would help a lot.
