tested boot on PCEngines APU2 (BIOS) and HP gen9 UEFI.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    As discussed in \#2698 this is a startingpoint for implementing a
    hybrid boot supporting BIOS and UEFI from the same media.

-   prerequisit:  
    For this to work you must have the following packages installed:
    `grub-efi-amd64-bin` and `grub-pc-bin`. They will install the grub
    binaries needed for efi and bios boot installation. Don't confuse
    those packages with `grub-efi`, `grub-efi-amd64` and `grub-pc` which
    configure the systems primary boot option and they conflict the
    other one for a reason I don't quite get. (this is on ubuntu 20.04)

-   format command change  
    In addition to the --efi format switch I added a --bios switch. If
    none is given it will do a hybrid installation.

-   more details:  
    This is more like a minimal changeset and prrof of concept but not a
    full featured or super clean PR.  
    Since realizing how this is done in `RAWDISK` (basically a complete
    rewrite bypassing lib code and features) and that `RAWDISK` does use
    syslinux but not grub (with which I am more familiar) I decided to
    ignore the `RAWDISK` for the moment.  
    I mostly rearanged the code in 300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh without
    changing much beside checking the --efi/--bios switches. There are
    however two fixes to mention: 1) setting esp with parted for EFI to
    have the correct partition type set. 2) using partprobe more offten
    to make sure data gets written to the correct locations. I think
    this code change is very clean.  
    The code change in 850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh is a bit more
    hacky and you may want to do this differently.  
    I did not change output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_grub.sh for the
    moment since it was not strictly needed but it may be better to
    install the grub efi binary with
    `grub-install --efi-directory=<path> --target=x86_64-efi --recheck <device>`
    instead of the way done in 850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh and such.

-   future work:

1.  while working on this I realized once more that the same basic stuff
    like partitioning, formatting, writing bootloaders and boot config
    is written multiple times in the code base and basically every
    workflow and output method has its own rewrites instead of using
    some common lib code for those things. I think a major cleanup of
    those things would make perfect sense. Maybe starting with the
    partitioning code - moving in a library script and creating
    functions out of it.
2.  Also testing is very time consuming and a bit of a pain due to all
    those options and combinations. Maybe it would be a good idea to use
    some build/test server. For example by adding travis jobs or such.
3.  Since I only did the work for `output=USB` and `GRUB` it may make
    sense to add this feature to all variants or deprecate some of
    those. Also keep in mind that GRUB could mount a ISO image and boot
    from there (stored on boot partition / where the kernel and initrd
    is stored).
4.  When using Serial tty and non Serial tty machines the grub config is
    at the moment not flexible enough to provide both options. One with
    ttyS0 and one entry with just tty. This issue may occur everywhere a
    tty is used in some sort. So thats also some feature or more
    flexibiliy to consider adding.

Of course I would like to see a merge and the hacktoberfest-accepted
label ;)  
I am aware that this PR is not touching all config variants and is maybe
not super clean. A complete integration on all configuration variants
would however mean a quite big change.

edit: please note that there is no 32bit grub efi I know of but it may
exist

@DEvil0000  
thank you for your enhancement and cleanup work.  
It is much appreciated!

I will test it soon...

I think the reason why in ReaR same functionality is implemented  
several times in separated code instead of using common library
functions  
is that contributions happen this way.

I think this is because for an individual contributor it is simpler  
and more straightforward to implement what he specifically needs  
in his own separated code than to adapt and enhance already existing
code  
because the latter may cause regressions in special cases of the
existing code  
or in areas of the existing code where the current contributor has no
good knowledge  
in particular when the existing code is not well documented so the
current contributor  
cannot fully understand why existing code is as is so he better does not
touch it,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Also we ReaR uspream maintainers usually don't have sufficient
knowledge  
in all those various different areas what ReaR is about (we are not
better  
than any other contributor) to be able to make generic common
functions  
from various code pieces that do not have regressions or shortcomings.  
In particular we can not at all test all the possible cases of existing
code  
so in general we don't touch existing code unless we must.  
Simply put: There is no "master mind" who could clean it all up.

I think in the end we must accept that in practice  
ReaR's code as a whole cannot be clean,  
cf. "Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

This does not mean that certain parts of ReaR's code cannot be cleaned
up.  
It is only meant to explain why ReaR's code is not clean by default.  
It is a lot of laborious work to make code clean.

Here a quotation from a colleague at SUSE  
where I do 100% agree:

    If you look at things from an evolutionary point of view
    the solution that works good enough while consuming
    least amount of resources wins.
    It does not have to be perfect, or even good,
    just as good or better than alternatives.
    And here I think is the biggest strength of Linux, the pragmatism,
    we try out things and keep these that work well enough.
    In that sense Linux is full of ugly hacks that, in the end,
    resemble how biological systems are structured.
    Sure it's hell to maintain, it's complex, we are unable to
    build an abstract model the system and reason about it,
    but in the end it does the job.
    Sometimes I wonder if this is unevitable property
    of the universe we live in.
    Maybe you can't have nice and clean system
    that is efficient enough.

@jsmeix I was not asking why it is like it is but more pointing out
arear where things can or should improve. Maybe it is a good iead to
track such things in tickets and assign a milestone. Maybe lable them as
"help welcome" or such.

Booting from that USB disk works well for me  
on my other older x86\_64 laptop with traditional BIOS  
both booting the ReaR recovery system and  
chainloading its bootloader on its built-in harddisk  
to boot its original system.

@rear/contributors  
could you have a look here if you find time for it.

I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon unless there are objections.
