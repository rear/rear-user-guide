-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low** / **Critical**

Low impact (actually there should be no impact) under normal
circumstances.

In contrast critical when the backup is included in the ISO with
BACKUP\_URL=iso://  
where the backup archive file (e.g. backup.tar.gz) could be greater or
equal 2GiB.  
When there is a 2GiB file size limit a backup.tar.gz that is greater
than 2GiB  
will get corrupted in the ISO so backup restore via "rear recover" would
fail  
but then it is too late and the backup in the ISO is unusable.

Therefore such a test is critical because without such a test  
for the user it appears af if everything went OK during "rear
mkbackup"  
until he finds out later during "rear recover" that his backup got
corrupted.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    "rear mkrescue" still works well for me.  
    I did not yes test with a file greater or equal 2GiB for the ISO.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

There is a limit of the ISO 9660 file system that is 2GiB or 4GiB
according to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_9660\#The\_2/4\_GiB\_file\_size\_limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660#The_2/4_GiB_file_size_limit)

To be on the safe side we use by default a 2GiB limit.  
2GiB is at least the actual limit when ebiso is used, cf.  
[https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues/12](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues/12)

Under normal circumstances files greater or equal 2GiB should not appear
in the ISO.

An exception is when the backup is included in the ISO with
BACKUP\_URL=iso://  
where the backup archive file (e.g. backup.tar.gz) could be greater or
equal 2GiB.

The user might adapt ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT provided he verified that
"rear recover"  
actually works in his particular environment even when there are files
in his ISO  
(in particular backup.tar.gz) that are actually greater than the default
2GiB limit.  
When there is a 2GiB file size limit a backup.tar.gz that is greater
than 2GiB  
will get corrupted in the ISO so backup restore via "rear recover" would
fail.

Also the ReaR recovery system initrd could become greater or equal
2GiB  
(e.g. because of accidentally too much in COPY\_AS\_IS) which is very
likely an error  
so we error out when files greater or equal ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT
should be included in the ISO.

There are various scripts that make an ISO image  
so this test should probably become a function.

The scripts that are suspect are

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'ISO_MKISOFS_BIN' | grep -v '.conf$'

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/800_create_isofs.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/810_prepare_multiple_iso.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/820_create_iso_image.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/830_create_iso_image_EFISTUB.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250_populate_efibootimg.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ia64/800_create_isofs.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/800_create_isofs.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/820_create_iso_image.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/ISO/GNU/Linux/320_verify_mkisofs.sh

and from those scripts the most suspect are

    # for f in $( find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'ISO_MKISOFS_BIN' | grep -v '.conf$' ) ; \
     do grep -H 'pushd ' $f ; done

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/810_prepare_multiple_iso.sh:    pushd $TEMP_ISO_DIR 1>/dev/null
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/820_create_iso_image.sh:pushd $TMP_DIR/isofs >/dev/null
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/830_create_iso_image_EFISTUB.sh:pushd $TMP_DIR/isofs >/dev/null
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ia64/800_create_isofs.sh:pushd $TMP_DIR/isofs # so that relative paths will work
    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64le/820_create_iso_image.sh:pushd $TMP_DIR

I will check them all...

With artificial too small `ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=12345` in
etc/rear/local.conf  
"rear -v mkresue" fails for me with (excerpt)

    Making ISO image
    ERROR: File for ISO chain.c32 size 20192 greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=12345

It seems with /usr/bin/mkisofs  
at least the one on SLES12-SP5 from the cdrkit-cdrtools-compat RPM  
it works for files greater 2GiB in the ISO, see  
[https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues/12\#issuecomment-733766152](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues/12#issuecomment-733766152)

Perhaps with /usr/bin/mkisofs another ISO file size limit appears  
later (e.g. 4GiB or something like that).

I think it is good to have a default ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT of 2 GiB in
ReaR  
so users who exceed that limit in exceptional cases get a hard info  
to have a closer look whether or not things work for them  
with files greater or equal 2GiB in their ISO

According to my reasoning in default.conf  
why the default ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT is 2GiB and why we error out  
when files greater or equal ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT should be included in
the ISO  
I think meanwhile  
it is really needed to have a default ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT of 2 GiB  
so users who exceed that limit in exceptional cases get a hard info  
to thoroughly test and verify whether or not things actually work for
them  
in their particular environment with files greater or equal 2GiB in
their ISO.

@rear/contributors  
to get user feedback from users who use current GitHub master code  
I would like to merge this pull request early (i.e. tomorrow
afternoon)  
if there are no objections.

Now things work well for me as far as I tested it  
so I would merge it in about 30 minutes  
unless there are objections.

Now let's wait and see  
how many users hit the default 2GiB ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT  
that results now an error exit like

    ERROR: File for ISO backup.tar.gz size 2345678901 greater or equal ISO_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=2147483648
