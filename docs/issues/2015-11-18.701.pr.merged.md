An attempt for "secure boot" support for ReaR:

-   if `shim.efi` is used as a bootloader, we also copy follow-up loader
    to the image (we assume it's `grub*.efi`)
-   In addition, `KERNEL_CMDLINE` option is now honored also for
    uefi-booting menu.

We also slightly re-arrange the uefi code, moving some common parts to
libs/  
I tested this only on SLES11 SP3 (boot-from-san, btrfs).
