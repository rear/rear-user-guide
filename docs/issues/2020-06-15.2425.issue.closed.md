-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git
-   OS version: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
-   System architecture: x86\_64
-   Firmware and bootloader: UEFI, Grub 2 without Secure Boot
-   Description of the issue:

After unlocking self-encrypting disks via ReaR's TCG Opal-2 PBA, a
system is expected to boot into its regular OS. Sequence:

1.  System powered on. Self-encrpyted boot disk is locked and shows its
    PBA boot sector only.
2.  The PBA (pre-boot authentication) system boots and asks for a
    password.
3.  The PBA unlocks the boot disk, which now shows its partitions for
    the 'real' OS.
4.  The PBA initiates a reboot.
5.  The UEFI firmware runs the bootloader for the real OS (Grub 2 in our
    example).
6.  Grub 2 loads kernel and initramfs.
7.  Grub 2 hands over control to the kernel.

Probably due to an UEFI firmware glitch, on an HPE ML10Gen9 server the
boot process for the 'real' OS hangs in step 7, probably in the kernel's
early initialization phase before console output can be seen.

PR including a workaround for the issue upcoming.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2426](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2426)
merged  
this issue is fixed.

@OliverO2  
thank you so much for your continuous testing and for your prompt fixes!

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2455](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2455)
merged  
there should be now a sufficient workaround for this issue  
where the root cause seems to be a firmware issue on an HPE ML10Gen9
server  
where the only reliable way to boot is a power cycle after Opal disks
were unlocked.

@OliverO2  
again thank you for your continuous testing and for your improvements in
ReaR  
to work around possible firmware issues on special hardware.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for quickly integrating everything. Including stuff like this
covering a somewhat exotic use case.

Covering also exotic use cases in ReaR is not exactly the same  
but it matches the basic idea behind "Dirty hacks welcome" in
