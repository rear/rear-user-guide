Adds an automatic recovery mode (which is the default) to the Bareos
workflow.

Before, you had to do the actual restore manually via bconsole.  
The old behaviour can still be selected by setting  
BAREOS\_RECOVERY\_MODE=manual  
in the rear configuration.

Also fixes some missing directories on the rescue image.
