In its current state it somewhat works for me with

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="rear"
GRUB_SUPERUSER="root"
</pre>

as follows

Now I have an additional GRUB 2 menue entry "Relax-and-Recover"  
and when I select it I get asked for username (I enter root) and  
password (I enter rear) and then the rear recovery system starts  
where I can log in as root (without password) and therein I could  
run "rear recover" but I did not yet test that.

In its current state what does not look o.k. for me is  
that now I get the GRUB 2 password dialog also for  
the default SLES12 boot entry.

This is an unexpected change compared to before  
where I could boot the default SLES12 without  
a GRUB 2 password dialog.

I.e. I need to find out how to set up GRUB 2 so that  
its password dialog happens only for the "Relax-and-Recover"  
boot menue entry...

@gdha  
many thanks for your careful code review.

Yes, the ';' was missing.

I also removed the '2&gt;&8'.

Regarding GRUB 2 config using '--set=root' I don't know.  
For me it did not work with "linux /rear-kernel"  
and "initrd /rear-initrd.cgz" but for me it works with  
"linux /boot/rear-kernel" and "initrd /boot/rear-initrd.cgz".

Now I changed it so that setting GRUB2 password  
is only optionally (ugly quick and dirty if then fi added  
without proper indentation for now).

I only liked to check hwo it behaves for me without  
setting GRUB2 password i.e. with explicit specifying  
empty values:

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD=""
GRUB_SUPERUSER=""
</pre>

For me it behaves better now because now I can still boot  
the default SLE12 entry without a password.  
Of course now also the "Relax-and-Recover" boot entry  
can be booted without password.  
But to get his system replaced one must run "rear recover"  
and from my current point of view this is sufficient protection  
against accidentally overwriting his system in particular  
because the whole GRUB\_RESCUE is disabled by default.

I.e. who actively enables GRUB\_RESCUE gets what he  
actively asked for.

@jsmeix after a bit of comparing why Centos protects only ReaR entry
with password and SLES12 does all, I've probably found the reason.

In order to allow boot entry without password you need to specify in
grub.cfg option **--unrestricted** to entry you don't wish to protect
with password.

e.g.  
`menuentry 'SLES 12-SP1'  --class sles --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-cc564292-9ed5-48d4-a186-30e7c3a0478e'`

I guess RedHat guys are using this option as default, that why they
don't had trouble with such setup ...

Yes, while working on it I also learned  
about the --unrestricted option.

But I will never ever implement that via GRUB\_RESCUE  
also all the other boot entries get changed by adding  
the --unrestricted option to all other boot entries.

I find it scaring enough that via GRUB\_RESCUE  
the bootloader of the currently running system gets  
changed by adding one more boot entry to it but I will  
never ever modify exitsing other entries.

Therefore my current code makes GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD  
and GRUB\_SUPERUSER optional so that the user can avoid  
that "rear mkbackup" via the GRUB\_RESCUE feature  
changes the behaviour of all its other boot entries  
because (at least on SLE12) now all boot entries become  
password protected.

Meanwhile I think I like to change the default to empty  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD and GRUB\_SUPERUSER  
because with current defaults

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="REAR"
GRUB_SUPERUSER="rearadmin"
</pre>

the GRUB\_RESCUE feature (at least on SLE12)  
silently adds password protection to all boot entries  
with username and password values that are unknown  
for the user unless he had carefully read the defaults  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-07-26 10:19](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#issuecomment-235228001):

Now I implemented support to set GRUB2 password only optionally  
in nice looking code.

Additionally one can (also optionally) use an existing  
GRUB2 user via GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER without the need  
to let rear create a GRUB2 superuser.  
The GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER behaves backward compatible  
because when GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER is empty it uses  
the GRUB\_SUPERUSER value.

Two examples how in now works for me on SLES12-SP1:

With

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="rear"
GRUB_SUPERUSER="root"
GRUB_RESCUE_USER=""
</pre>

Now it works sufficiently well for me on SLES12-SP1.

From my current point of view it could be merged  
provided others do not find bugs.

Note that this pull request is only about GRUB 2  
i.e. only about 94\_grub2\_rescue.sh

If GRUB\_RESCUE works sufficiently well for nowadays GRUB 2  
I may also have a look at GRUB Legacy in 94\_grub\_rescue.sh  
as time permits but that would be a separated task.

FYI:

The only left drawback from my current point of view is  
that it does not yet automatically delete stuff  
that had been added before.

For example if one does "rear mkbackup" with

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="bar"
GRUB_SUPERUSER="foo"
</pre>

one gets a GRUB 2 superuser 'foo' set up  
plus GRUB 2 password protection.

If later one changes local.conf to be only

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
</pre>

the previously set up GRUB 2 superuser 'foo' is  
not deleted and the GRUB 2 password protection  
is still active regardless that the rear menue entry  
in /boot//grub2/grub.cfg does no longer contain  
a "password\_pbkdf2" line.

To get rid of previously set up GRUB 2 superuser  
and GRUB 2 password protection one must manually

<pre>
rm /etc/grub.d/01_users
</pre>

@jsmeix maybe I've overlooked, but did you manage to solve problem on
SLES12 when all grub entries were protected by password?

I did not (and I will not) deal with when all grub entries  
get protected by password see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942\#issuecomment-235189863](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#issuecomment-235189863)

I only documented that unexpected possible result in default.conf

<pre>
When GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is set
it may result password protection for all GRUB2
menue entries of the currently running system
unless the '--unrestricted' option is set for those
GRUB2 menue entries that should not have
password protection.
</pre>

Currently the only way to avoid that unexpected result  
is to not set up GRUB2 password protection.

Damn!

Seems to be again a nice mess how GRUB 2 works  
on different Linux distributions:  
On my SLES12-SP1 "linux /rear-kernel" and "initrd /rear-initrd.cgz"  
just failed to boot so that I changed it to the absolute path  
"/boot/rear-kernel" and "/boot/rear-initrd.cgz" but that  
fails on CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core), see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703\#issuecomment-235404491](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-235404491)

Currently I don't know how to fix such Linux distribution mess  
so that it works in a generic way on all Linux distributions.

Furthermore regarding the GRUB 2 password protection see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703\#issuecomment-235506494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-235506494)

Bottom line:

I think I will remove GRUB 2 password protection setup from rear  
because it can mess up the GRUB 2 setup in unexpected ways  
and GRUB 2 password protection setup in the currently running  
system is really not at all an expected native functionality of rear.  
If a user wants GRUB 2 password protection he can do that  
on his own as he likes and needs it.

With my latest commit I removed GRUB\_SUPERUSER support  
in a (hopefully) reasonably backward compatible way  
(see my comments in default.conf).  
Now one must use GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER  
plus GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD  
if the otional GRUB 2 password protection is wanted.

Wow!

With removed GRUB\_SUPERUSER support  
it seems to work perfectly well for me.

With old-style

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="bar"
GRUB_SUPERUSER="foo"
</pre>

I get

<pre>
Setting up GRUB_RESCUE: Adding Relax-and-Recover rescue system to the local GRUB 2 configuration.
Setting up GRUB 2 password protection with GRUB 2 user 'foo'.
Skipping GRUB 2 superuser setup: GRUB_SUPERUSER is no longer supported (see default.conf).
Modifying local GRUB 2 configuration.
Finished GRUB_RESCUE setup: Added 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB 2 menu entry.
</pre>

and a "password\_pbkdf2 foo grub.pbkdf2.sha512..."  
entry in /etc/grub.d/45\_rear and accordingly  
also in /boot//grub2/grub.cfg for 'Relax-and-Recover'.

But I have no /etc/grub.d/01\_users file  
so that I expected that I cannot boot 'Relax-and-Recover'  
because there is no GRUB 2 user "foo".

But it "just boots" nevertheless (without password prompt).

I.e. it seems GRUB 2 behaves fail-safe when there is  
a "password\_pbkdf2" entry but that user does not exist.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-07-27 10:34](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#issuecomment-235548994):

Still can result a mess if one is not very careful.

With that manually created /etc/grub.d/01\_users

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
set superusers="baz"
password baz rear
password foo bar
EOF
</pre>

and non-matching /etc/rear/local.conf entries

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="blah"
GRUB_RESCUE_USER="foo"
</pre>

I cannot boot 'Relax-and-Recover' as user foo  
regardless what password (bar or blah) I use.  
I can only boot it as GRUB 2 superuser with his password.

Therefore I am now thinking about also dropping support  
for GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD in rear and only keep  
support for GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER and make the  
'Relax-and-Recover' menue entry not with  
"password\_pbkdf2"  
but instead with "--users $GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER"  
when GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER is non-empty or  
with "--unrestricted" when GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER is empty  
according to how that is described at  
[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red\_Hat\_Enterprise\_Linux/7/html/System\_Administrators\_Guide/sec-GRUB\_2\_Password\_Protection.html](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-GRUB_2_Password_Protection.html)

This would mean when GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER is non-empty  
the user must have already set up this user for GRUB 2  
because rear does not do that because GRUB 2 users setup  
is general GRUB 2 configuration and rear will not mess up  
with the general GRUB 2 configuration.

Perhaps I might implement a check that looks if a  
non-empty GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER can be found  
in /etc/grub.d/01\_users but I do not like that because  
as far as I know the filename '01\_users' could be  
anything else so that it could become the next nightmare  
to implement such a check so that it works gererically  
everywhere.

With my latest commit I also removed  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD support  
in a (hopefully) reasonably backward compatible way.

Now only GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER can be used  
(which needs already setup GRUB 2 users)  
if the otional GRUB 2 password protection is wanted.

Now the whole GRUB 2 password protection stuff  
seems to work o.k. for me for the first time simple  
and straightforward without unexpected behaviour.

What I tested:

I have a manually created /etc/grub.d/01\_users

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
cat << EOF
set superusers="root"
password root rootpw
password rear rearpw
EOF
</pre>

With

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_USER="unrestricted"
</pre>

I get this /etc/grub.d/45\_rear

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
cat << EOF
menuentry 'Relax-and-Recover' --class os --unrestricted {
          search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 45fd0fdf-b85e-4d10-9e0b-a4395ac6db11
          echo 'Loading kernel /boot/rear-kernel ...'

          echo 'Loading initrd /boot/rear-initrd.cgz (may take a while) ...'
          initrd /boot/rear-initrd.cgz
}
EOF
</pre>

which results that I can boot that without password dialog  
regardless that for the default SLES12 boot entry I get  
a password dialog (because I have a GRUB 2 superuser).

With

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
GRUB_RESCUE_USER="rear"
</pre>

I get this /etc/grub.d/45\_rear

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
cat << EOF
menuentry 'Relax-and-Recover' --class os --users rear {

          initrd /boot/rear-initrd.cgz
}
EOF
</pre>

which results that I can boot this as GRUB2 user 'rear'  
with its password or as GRUB 2 superuser.

With only

<pre>
GRUB_RESCUE=y
</pre>

I get this /etc/grub.d/45\_rear

With my latest commit I use different

depending on the Linux distribution  
at least for now (until a generic solution is found).

Currently the absolute path for SLE and openSUSE

This means for SLE and openSUSE  
one gets in /etc/grub.d/45\_rear

From my current point of view the GRUB\_RESCUE functionality  
should now work sufficiently well for GRUB 2  
on SUSE and Red Hat based Linux distributions.

When there are no objections  
I will merge it in a few hours  
to have the current state in GitHub master code  
so that also other rear users can test it more easily.

Ha!  
Now
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942\#issuecomment-235867334](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#issuecomment-235867334)  
reads "2 hours ago" which is sufficient for "a few hours"  
so that now I can merge it!
