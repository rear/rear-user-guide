workaround the problem in which the partition containing `/boot/` is
detected with a wrong uuid when creating the initrd.  
As mentioned, it's a workaround because it fixes the problem but not the
cause.

Hi @gdha!  
I changed the call as you suggested about 10 days ago. I don't know
whether you get a message for every new commit or not.  
Greetings matti!
