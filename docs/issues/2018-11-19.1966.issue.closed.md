-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):

Distributor ID: Debian  
Description: Debian GNU/Linux 9.6 (stretch)  
Release: 9.6  
Codename: stretch

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

HP DL 360 hardware server

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

AMD64

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

local disk

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Apparently the Borg integration can either handle SSH connections or a
local USB device. In my case I am usually using a mounted NFS file
system to access the backup server. It looks like REAR currently does
not support that scenario. If the BORGBACKUP\_HOST variable is set then
it enforces an SSH connection. If it is not set then a local USB device
must be present. But a repository that is accessible at e.g.
/mnt/backup-server/rear-volume cannot be used.

If I try to omit BORGBACKUP\_HOST and also the USB setting then REAR
dies with messages like:

    Using log file: /opt/rear/var/log/rear/rear-reartest.log
    ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -o rw,noatime / /tmp/rear.cg4UEAoZfJI8rUT/borg_backup' failed.
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 250_mount_usb.sh:

      mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.cg4UEAoZfJI8rUT/borg_backup'

-   Workaround, if any:

None known.

Hi @Signum,

Did you try to use backup over SSH to localhost?

This should work fine for you ...

Thank you. That works indeed. But doesn't that add overhead for the SSH
encryption?

I would expect a significant performance degradation when using
localhost SSH compared to direct mounting.

@Signum do you feel like preparing a pull request to fix this? This is a
typical case of a use case that didn't show up so far. I would suggest
to add logic that compares `BORGBACKUP_HOST` with the local host name
and with `localhost` in order to activate direct mounting. It might be
possible that it is enough to adjust the variables to trigger the right
code path. That way you could use the same configuration everywhere and
the backup would work locally if it is on the backup server.

In
[https://github.com/schlomo/rbme/blob/master/rbme\#L486](https://github.com/schlomo/rbme/blob/master/rbme#L486)
(my own backup tool) I had to solve the same problem.

@schlomo I am pretty sure I can provide a decent pull request, yes.
Thanks for the discussion. Feel free to leave this issue open until
then. Give me roughly a week.

When I was writing BORG support for ReaR, I was thinking about direct
mounting, but using localhost over SSH looked to be much more universal
solution comparing to writing mount code for all the different
networking file systems out there.  
Currently @Signum have NFS mounted but soon Samba share might appear,
afterwards some "fuse you name it file system".  
But in general if we can have universal code for Borg honoring universal
mounting I have not problem with that.

@Signum I think that ssh encryption factor on HP DL 360 is negligible
;-)

While trying with "localhost" I just realized that the boot medium would
have to mount the NFS mountpoint to that borg can access the backup. I
couldn't find anything in the REAR docs on how to do that. Is it
supported? Because if NFS mounts wouldn't work then an automated
recovery would not work.

You need to include NFS related sw like [kernel
modules](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1076)
and
[binaries](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1573)
like mount.nfs, all the rpc.\* stuff .., into ReaR recovery system.  
One way to do it would be to use MODULES and PROGS\_BORG options in
local.conf.

I am not a BORG user so only a blind shot in the dark:

Because  
`for f in $( find usr/share/rear/ -type f | grep -i borg ) ; do grep -H 'BACKUP_URL' $f ; done`  
does not show something I assume the current BORG code in ReaR  
does not use the BACKUP\_URL config variable.

For BACKUP=NETFS primarily the BACKUP\_URL config variable  
determines what stuff gets included into the ReaR recovery system via  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/050\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
and also via its symbolic link  
usr/share/rear/prep/BLOCKCLONE/default/050\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
for BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE.

Therefore I wonder if that code for BACKUP=NETFS might be relatively
easily  
also used for BACKUP=BORG with an appropriate BACKUP\_URL setting  
because there should be no conflicts with the other existing code for  
BACKUP=BORG when BACKUP\_URL has an arbitrary value?

Another not so blind shot in the dark:

It seems what @Signum needs is some functionality of BACKUP=NETFS  
together with BACKUP=BORG which looks somewhat related to  
"Using Multiple Backups for Relax-and-Recover" as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

@Signum  
have a look if it might work as a first step towards what you need when
you do  
some kind of "Mis-Using Multiple Backups for Relax-and-Recover"  
to combine BACKUP=NETFS support together with BACKUP=BORG  
in one same ReaR recovery system.

@jsmeix Thanks for the clarification. Yes, I would like to use NETFS but
not copy the entire machine but rather do incremental backups. Multiple
backups seemed pretty complicated. My task is to run a PostgreSQL server
at a remove location with no IT staff on-site. So having REAR seemed to
be the best way for disaster recovery. And preferable the "Automatic"
variant.

I will re-read the page about multiple backups. Although it feels like
I'm doing something I shouldn't be.
