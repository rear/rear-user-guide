Sorry, I would like to backup all files into 1 single ISO. So if that
possible to make that iso file large than 4GB?

@crazy90cc Please start using rear-2.0 on RHEL 6 as 1.17.2 is too old.
Version 2.0 is also supported by RH. And, yes it should be possible to
make a single ISO image bigger than 4GB.

Hi dgha,

Finnally i have make the 1 single iso. But i realized that rear will
make the iso into directory /var/lib/rear/output, and after that will
copy to the OUTPUT\_URL location. How to make that clean the directory
/var/lib/rear/output itselt? Or just directly copy the iso file to
OUTPUT\_URL?

@crazy90cc See also issue \#734 and try to make `OUTPUT_URL=null` and I
never defined the `BACKUP_URL=iso://cifs/path` -&gt; did it work? I
always used a path on a local path on the system with enough disk space.
