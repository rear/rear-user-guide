Type: Bug Fix and Enhancement

Impact: High  
Without those changes the Data Protector 10.70 and later won't be able
to use systemd (over xinetd). Restore performance from BACKUP=DP has
been increased by doing parallel restores now.

How was this pull request tested?  
Applied the changes to a SLES15 SP1 system running rear 2.6.1. Created a
new ISO, booted the system and ran through various test cases.

Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
Additional changes to Data Protector branding and general script
cleanup  
Adjustment required to support systemd-only with Data Protector 10.70
and later in addition to xinetd-only deployments  
Parallel restore support from BACKUP=DP

@sebastian-koehler  
thank you for your ongoing contributions and improvements for
`BACKUP=DP`!

It is much appreciated in particular because we at ReaR upstream
usually  
do not use third-party backup tools (personally I use only
`BACKUP=NETFS` with `tar`)  
and in particular we usually do not have proprietary third-party backup
tools  
so we totally depend on contributions form users who use third-party
backup tools.

Thanks for the valuable feedback. I have implemented and tested the
recommendations and this makes everything so much easier. Let me know if
you find anything else where I can improve the BACKUP=DP scripts from
today's point of view.

@sebastian-koehler  
I am sorry, via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2443/commits/33e477ccf30d60263622a456ad28459cd0aeee37](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2443/commits/33e477ccf30d60263622a456ad28459cd0aeee37)  
it happened that I did basically a rewrite of 500\_restore\_ssc.sh

My initial intent was to not error out here at this late state of "rear
recover"  
after the backup was restored because error out here would make all  
what had worked up to this point useless for the user.

I added to skip that script when when the certificate files already
exist in the recreated system.  
I assume the certificate files in the ReaR recovery system are same as
those on the original system  
because of default.conf `COPY_AS_IS_DP=( ... /etc/opt/omni/client )`  
so I think when when the certificate files already exist in the
recreated system there is no need  
to copy them from the recovery system into the recreated system.

I have a general question related to this:  
I would expect that all what belongs to the Data Protector client  
(in particular `/etc/opt/omni/client`) is included in the backup  
so that during backup restore all what belongs to the Data Protector
client  
gets restored into the recreated system so that in particular the  
Data Protector client certificate files already exist in the recreated
system  
after the backup was restored.  
So I wonder what the reason is why 500\_restore\_ssc.sh is needed at
all?  
I mean when the backup is incomplete there is not much what ReaR could
do.

First of all, thanks for the additional changes to 500\_restore\_ssc.sh.
I have completed testing, found and fixed a typo preventing proper
execution and did a few cosmetic changes. This looks pretty good now and
we're ready for the merge.

To answer your question, the client certificate is currently excluded
from a Data Protector backup due to security concerns. This means we're
not able to restore it using BACKUP=DP. This is something we may change
within Data Protector, but this will take some time. The current
implementation in ReaR will get the required files from the running
client, use it during rear recover and place it on the recovered system
as a last step (if not found). This allows us to resume backup and
restore operation without manual intervention. Also the current
implementation will not replace the certificate in case
localhost\_key.pem is restored using BACKUP=DP (in the future).

@sebastian-koehler  
thank you four your explanation why 500\_restore\_ssc.sh is needed.  
Now I do perfectly understand the reasoning behind.

A generic note regarding things like "client certificate" and "security
concerns":

By default (i.e. unless explicitly configured by the user)  
the ReaR recovery system should be free of secrets.

The default behaviour with BACKUP=DP should be improved so that the user
knows  
that with BACKUP=DP there will be secrets in his ReaR recovery system  
so that he knows that his recovery system ISO image and any recovery
medium  
needs to be protected against unwanted access.

See in default.conf the places that mention `secret` e.g. the section
about  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED and BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1041](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1041)  
and in particular the section about  
SSH\_FILES and SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD and SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1562](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1562)

For the reasoning why the recovery system should not contain secrets  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472\#issuecomment-328129375](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472#issuecomment-328129375)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472\#issuecomment-328459748](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472#issuecomment-328459748)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472\#issuecomment-328461809](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472#issuecomment-328461809)  
that read (excerpts)

    In general the ReaR recovery system is intended
    to not contain possibly private or confidential data
    so that in general no files like /etc/shadow will be copied
    from the original system into the recovery system.
    I.e. it is the intended behaviour to not have /etc/shadow
    in the recovery system.
    For ReaR only the backup needs to be protected
    against unwanted access but the recovery system ISO image
    should be more or less considered to be "world readable".

    I forgot to tell about the reason behind why the recovery system
    ISO image should not contain private or confidential data
    (at least not unless the user explicitly configured something):
    As far as I remember the reason behind is that one can burn
    the recovery system ISO image onto a CD or DVD and then
    one can take that recovery system medium anywhere without
    the need to protect it (e.g. against it gets lost).
    E.g. the admin could misuse a ReaR recovery system CD
    after work as beer coaster in the next pub and he could
    even forget it there after his Nth beer but still sleep well ;-)
    ...
    In particular when one has both the ReaR recovery system
    plus the backup in the ISO, then it is clear that such an ISO
    usually needs to be protected against unwanted access.
    Accordingly in this case having /etc/shadow also in the ReaR
    recovery system won't make things less secure because
    usually /etc/shadow is in the backup anyway.
    Except one uses backup encryption ...
    then /etc/shadow also in the ReaR recovery system
    does make things less secure.

    The core and basic design principle for ReaR looks like this:

    The rescue system contains metadata but not data.
    That means that it contains everything required to recreate
    the target system but nothing that goes into the target system.
    Therefore the rescue media is not a secret.

    The backup system or tool contains all the data
    that goes into the target system and therefore
    it also contains the secrets of the target system
    and must be protected accordingly.

I tried to explain in default.conf the client certificate files

Communication)  
so that the user is informed ( "is" because users are expected to read

@sebastian-koehler FYI:  
It is possible to have several ReaR versions in parallel

other  
and without conflicts with a normally installed ReaR version via RPM
