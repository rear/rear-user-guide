I feel like I should add that this was done on a minimal install of
CentOS 7.5. Other errors have been encountered; I've been installing
packages as I go to resolve issues.

@ProfElectric

usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/340\_find\_mbr\_bin.sh  
calls the `find_syslinux_file` function which is defined in  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh as

<pre>
function find_syslinux_file {
    # input argument is usually isolinux.bin
    # output argument is the full path of isolinux.bin
    local syslinux_file=""

    for file in /usr/{share,lib,libexec,lib/syslinux}/*/"$1" ; do
        if [[ -s "$file" ]]; then
            syslinux_file="$file"
            break # for loop
        fi
    done
    echo "$syslinux_file"
}
</pre>

I assume it does not find a `mbr.bin` file on your  
minimal install of CentOS 7.5 so that the root casue is  
likely that you have to install whatever RPM package  
that provides the needed `mbr.bin` file.

FYI: On my SLES12-SP3 system I have `/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin`  
which is provided by the syslinux RPM package.

To prove my above assumption run `usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue`  
with full debugging information and inspect the ReaR log file.

In general you may hit by various problems when you use ReaR  
on a minimal install of whatever Linux distribution because ReaR needs  
a lot of stuff that is "usually there" and if it is not there then ReaR
fails at  
various places.

In particular you must verify that "rear recover" actually works, cf.  
"No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation" in
