#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.00
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? both
-   Brief description of the issue:

Hello Everybody,

we made our first footsteps with REAR (Relax-and-Recover 2.00). When
generating a bootable ISO the ebiso generates a "Segmentation Fault"
error message.

Even after upgrading rear and ebiso the newest releases the problem
still occurs.:  
ebiso 0.2.3  
rear 2.00

Hi,

1.  I guess you should rather use
    [https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues).
    (assuming this is fault of ebiso)
2.  can you send output of `uname -a` from your system
3.  can you paste log from `rear -d -D mkrescue`
4.  can you send me core file created by ebiso crash

Thanks

V.

Aaaand a bit more: :-)

1.  how did you install ebiso (sources, RPM, ...)?
2.  where did you get ebiso from? (SUSE, GIT, gozora.sk, ...)

@dilli1  
To create core file following should work:

`ulimit -c unlimited && rear mkrescue`

Just a short update on this topic.  
This issue happens only after `rear recover` of system and if TMPDIR
runs on XFS.

I need to investigate 2 things:

1.  What is the difference between original XFS setup and what ReaR
    changed during `rear recover`. I assume that there was some change
    as @dilli1 confirmed that ebiso worked fine before restore
2.  In spite of XFS parameter change, ebiso should not misbehave, so I
    need to do a bit of debugging on XFS

I've probably find out where the problem is.  
[Full story
here](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/issues/9#issuecomment-282850152)

From my point of view ebiso is the main trouble maker, but ReaR behavior
is not correct as well.

I did not check ReaR code deeper, but I suspect that it does not call
`xfs_info` to store current filesystem attributes during
`rear mkbackup/mkrescue`. So if user have filesystem created with some
non-default options (crc, attr, ftype ...) , ReaR just ignores this and
creates filesystem with default options.

Next days I'll be writing patch for ebiso and then I can have a look on
how could be XFS options correctly recovered.

@gozora  
awesome!  
I can hardly express in words how impressed I am  
about your outstanding debugging.  
As always your contributions to ReaR are very very valuable.

Regarding the general underlying problem in ReaR:  
In general ReaR may recreate anything (in particular filesystems)  
with any kind of possibly subtle but severe differences, cf.  
"Deployment via recovery installation" and  
"The limitation is what the special ReaR recovery system can do" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@dilli1  
see also  
"Let's face it: Deployment via the recovery installer is a must" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@gdha  
I think it should be better documented in ReaR  
that at least currently

<pre>
"rear recover" may recreate the system
with possibly subtle but severe differences
</pre>

so that the users are better informed in advance  
about current general limitations in ReaR.

As side note only FYI:  
The "Deployment via the recovery installer is a must"  
is another main underlying reason for my attempts  
to enhance ReaR so that one can also do  
the initial system installation with ReaR,  
cf. "ReaR system deployment" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1085\#issue-191661559](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1085#issue-191661559)

@gozora  
in general regarding how to recreate a filesystem  
exactly as it was before:

I think some time ago a colleague told me that it is  
in general not possible (or not possible with reasonable effort)  
to autodetect all settings for a filesystem.

I think for particular filesystems the admin can do whatever  
special tuning settings that cannot be reliably autodetected  
in the running system.

Furthermore when ReaR autodetects all filesystem settings  
that can be autodetected, it results the problem that then  
ReaR will store zillions of filesystem options/attributes  
in the 'fs' lines in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

I think this results a conflict because ideally the  
filesystem options/attributes in disklayout.conf  
should only show non-default settings - i.e. what  
is intentionally set different compared to the results  
of plain "mkfs.FSTYPE /dev/sdXN".

I think when all filesystem options/attributes would be stored  
in disklayout.conf the 'fs' entries become a meaningless  
"dumb dump" of tons of system values.

And even then some special filesystem options/attributes  
would be missing when they cannot be autodetected.

Therefore I think ReaR should provide configuration  
variables where the user can specify his particular  
wanted special filesystem options/attributes, cf.  
"too much secretly working 'magic automatisms' in ReaR" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-282252947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-282252947)

In general FYI:

Another subtle but severe setting in SLES12 (since SP1)  
with its default btrfs structure is that some btrfs subvolume  
directories (/var/lib/pgsql /var/lib/libvirt/images /var/lib/mariadb)  
have the "no copy on write (C)" file attribute set  
so that chattr is required in the recovery system, cf.  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
When that file attribute is not set the system will  
probably behave normally for some time after "rear recover"  
but the default btrfs behaviour (copy on write) on those  
btrfs subvolumes will result that when those databases  
are in use their databse files will get totally fragmented, cf.  
[https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gotchas\#Fragmentation](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gotchas#Fragmentation)  
so that after some time those databases will beome  
unusable slow (delays of seconds up to minutes).

Currently ReaR only supports the "no copy on write (C)"  
file attribute on SLES12 for btrfs subvolumes but  
currently there is no general support in ReaR for  
'chattr' file attributes (search for 'chattr' in the ReaR code).

Thanks for your kind words!

@gdha, @jsmeix  
In general I agree with everything you've say in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208\#issuecomment-282991951](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208#issuecomment-282991951).  
I was thinking to implement attribute capture only for XFS, as it looks
to me that missing some of attributes drastically changes its behavior.
You can see this issue and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065\#issuecomment-260148740](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065#issuecomment-260148740)

My idea would be to check only for parameters which we had trouble with
in the past (crc and ftype for a start) Especially **ftype** is captious
one as it can make application segfault after restore out of the sudden.
it is correct that during `rear recover` user can change
*diskrestore.sh* but it is not much worth if you don't know original
values.

In this issue it was only ebiso which segfaulted (mostly because of my
bad work) but there can be more applications wrote by programmers like
me.

I'll put together some example code and we can discuss it further, if it
will be worthy to continue or not.

First part of this issue is solved with release of
[ebiso-0.2.5](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso/releases/tag/v0.2.5).  
Second part of this problem is discussed in \#1213, so I guess we can
close this one.
