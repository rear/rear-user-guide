#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.2
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): any
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? any
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Seems that since some changes in \_input-output-functions.sh the
    Error function is returning exit code 0 and DRLM remote mkbackup
    execution cannot detect the error in the rear execution.  
    When a backup fails DRLM cannot detect the error (previously &gt;0)
    and hangs.
-   Work-around, if any: NOT yet

I'm on this and could be an issue with some rare OS environment
settings.  
Please do not take this issue yet, I will update it with my results.

Thanks!

@didacog FYI:  
any return code of the Error function should be meaningless  
for the exit code of the usr/sbin/rear program because the  
Error function terminates the usr/sbin/rear program by  
sending SIGUSR1 for which a trap exists that kills  
the usr/sbin/rear program (via the default SIGTERM)  
so that the exit code of the usr/sbin/rear program  
is in this case always 143 which is 128+15  
and 15 is the value of SIGTERM (see "man 7 signal").

You can verify this e.g. by adding to  
usr/share/rear/init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
a very first line like

<pre>
Error "testerror"
</pre>

(I misuse 030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh for such tests  
because that is an 'init' script that is always and early run)  
and then I get

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue
Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear.master/var/log/rear/rear-e205.log
ERROR: testerror
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear.master/var/log/rear/rear-e205.log for details
Terminated

# echo $?
143
</pre>

When I change the Error function to this

<pre>
    ...
    kill -USR1 $MASTER_PID
    exit 99
}
</pre>

it still terminates with exit-code 143.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1134](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1134)  
therein

<pre>
... the already used bash exit codes:
...
128+n Fatal error signal "n"
e.g.  kill -9 $PPID of script   
      $? returns 137 (128 + 9)
...
</pre>

@didacog  
because "no news is good news" I just assume that with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1485\#issuecomment-329098522](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1485#issuecomment-329098522)  
the issue is sufficiently answered so that I can close it.  
If not you can of course reopen it.

@jsmeix  
Sorry for the late response and for not updating on the issue, I was
figuring out what happened with this issue and solving some critical
issues in a customer.  
Somehow our testing environment VMs got corrupted and all VMs started to
malfunction with strange environment issues during tests.  
We've re-deployed a new environment for testing and all seems is working
fine now.

Thanks for updating and closing this issue.

Regards,  
Didac

@didacog  
many thanks for the information what the actual cause was.  
It helps (at least me) a lot to have an explicit confirmation  
when there was no (possibly obscure) issue in ReaR.
