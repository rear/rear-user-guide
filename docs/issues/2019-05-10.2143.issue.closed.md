This is a known limitation because currently the `LOGFILE`  
and `RUNTIME_LOGFILE` handling happens in usr/sbin/rear  
there in particular via this code parts:

At the beginning

    # Use RUNTIME_LOGFILE for the logfile that is actually used during runtime
    # so that the user can specify a different LOGFILE in his local.conf file.
    # During runtime use only the actually used RUNTIME_LOGFILE value.
    # By default RUNTIME_LOGFILE is the LOGFILE from default.conf:
    RUNTIME_LOGFILE="$LOGFILE"
    # Set the right RUNTIME_LOGFILE value depending on whether or not
    # this currently running instance can run simultaneously with another instance:
    can_run_simultaneously=""
    # LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS can run simultaneously with another instance by using LOGFILE.lockless.
    # FIXME: Only one lockless workflow can run otherwise the same LOGFILE.lockless
    # would be used by more than one simultaneously running lockless workflows:
    for lockless_workflow in "${LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS[@]}" ; do
        if test "$WORKFLOW" = "$lockless_workflow" ; then
            RUNTIME_LOGFILE="$LOGFILE.lockless"
            can_run_simultaneously="yes"
            break
        fi
    done
    # SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS are allowed to run simultaneously
    # but cannot use LOGFILE.lockless instead they get a LOGFILE with PID
    # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1102
    # When a workflow is both in LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS and in SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS
    # its right LOGFILE value is the one for SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS:
    for simultaneous_runnable_workflow in "${SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS[@]}" ; do
        if test "$WORKFLOW" = "$simultaneous_runnable_workflow" ; then
            # Simultaneously runnable workflows require unique logfile names
            # so that the PID is interposed in the LOGFILE value from default.conf
            # which is used as RUNTIME_LOGFILE while the workflow is running
            # and at the end it gets copied to a possibly used-defined LOGFILE.
            # The logfile_suffix also works for logfile names without '.*' suffix
            # (in this case ${LOGFILE##*.} returns the whole $LOGFILE value):
            logfile_suffix=$( test "${LOGFILE##*.}" = "$LOGFILE" && echo 'log' || echo "${LOGFILE##*.}" )
            RUNTIME_LOGFILE="${LOGFILE%.*}.$$.$logfile_suffix"
            can_run_simultaneously="yes"
            break
        fi
    done
    ...
        LogPrint "Using log file: $RUNTIME_LOGFILE"

And at the end after the requested workflow was run

    # Usually RUNTIME_LOGFILE=/var/log/rear/rear-$HOSTNAME.log
    # The RUNTIME_LOGFILE name is set above from LOGFILE in default.conf
    # but later user config files are sourced where LOGFILE can be set different
    # so that the user config LOGFILE is used as final logfile name:
    if test "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" != "$LOGFILE" ; then
        test "$WORKFLOW" != "help" && LogPrint "Saving $RUNTIME_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE"
        cat "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" > "$LOGFILE"
    fi

Therefore the "Saving $RUNTIME\_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE" part  
is not run in case of an Error exit from within the running workflow  
but usually this does not matter because usually  
the RUNTIME\_LOGFILE value is the same as the LOGFILE value.

This issue here happens only in case of an Error exit from within  
running one of the SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS  
which are defined in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

    # SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS are also allowed to run simultaneously
    # but cannot use LOGFILE.lockless as the LOCKLESS_WORKFLOWS.
    # Instead the SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS get a LOGFILE with PID
    # because simultaneously runnable workflows require unique logfile names
    # so that the PID is interposed in the LOGFILE value from default.conf above,
    # i.e. by default SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS use during runtime
    # a logfile named /var/log/rear/rear-$HOSTNAME.$$.log that gets
    # at the end copied to a final possibly used-defined LOGFILE,
    # see /usr/sbin/rear and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1102
    SIMULTANEOUS_RUNNABLE_WORKFLOWS=( 'mkbackuponly' 'restoreonly' )

I will have a look if it is possible with reasonable effort to also do  
the "Saving $RUNTIME\_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE" part in case of an  
Error exit from one of the SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS.

My offhanded idea is to do the "Saving $RUNTIME\_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE"
part  
as one of the EXIT\_TASKS but I need to check the details...

I had a quick look at the logfile handling code parts  
in various places in various scripts and I remember from the past  
when I implemented things like RUNTIME\_LOGFILE  
and SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
that the logfile handling code in ReaR became an overcomplicated pile  
of awkward convoluted "worms" (you may just call it a "can of worms"
;-)  
because I wanted to keep things behave backward compatible  
as far as possible.

So from my current point of view I will not add  
more worms into that can for ReaR 2.x where things  
must behave backward compatible.

Instead I will completely clean up the logfile handling code  
for ReaR 3.x cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1390](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1390)  
where I can do things right from the beginning  
to support SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS.

In the end this means no special code for  
SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS  
but the new logfile handling code works generically  
also for SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS

Simply put:  
The new logfile name will contain the PID in any case  
(basically what RUNTIME\_LOGFILE currently is  
in case of SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS).

@gdha @jsmeix Please reopen because this bug is important when viewing
the /var/log/rear/rear-$HOSTNAME.log and the workflow failed, only the
old log is viewable and not the correct log with the error.  
Bug also present in ReaR 2.6.  
Maybe it could be part of ReaR 2.7?
