-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement** / **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **High**

There might be regressions when installing old bootloaders  
like GRUB1, LILO, and ELILO (none was tested, see below).

-   How was this pull request tested?

Works for me on SLES15 and SLES12 - both use GRUB2.  
Other bootloaders (like GRUB, LILO, and ELILO) not tested.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now /proc /sys /dev and /run are bind-mounted  
at the beginning of the finalize stage via one single new  
finalize/default/110\_bind\_mount\_proc\_sys\_dev\_run.sh

All existing mount and umount commands in finalize scripts  
for /proc /sys /dev and things like that were removed and  
as needed such scripts were further adapted, in particular  
finalize/GNU/Linux/430\_create\_multipath\_config.sh  
and finalize/Linux-i386/610\_install\_lilo.sh  
and in finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_elilo.sh  
a not yet fixed bug is marked as FIXME and left to be fixed  
by someone who knows better than I about ELILO...

The old finalize/default/100\_populate\_dev.sh was removed  
because what it intended to do is now done by the new  
finalize/default/110\_bind\_mount\_proc\_sys\_dev\_run.sh

Because finalize/default/110\_bind\_mount\_proc\_sys\_dev\_run.sh  
calls `mountpoint` that program is added to  
REQUIRED\_PROGS in default.conf, cf.

@gozora  
I moved your
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/100\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
to usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/150\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
i.e. after
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/110\_bind\_mount\_proc\_sys\_dev\_run.sh

I think your EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh should not use a 1nn number  
in the finalize scripts because usr/share/rear/finalize/readme reads

    000-099: initialization
    100-199: creating devices on TARGET (/dev)
    200-299: disk device migration
    300-399: network device migration
    400-499: Update some configuration on TARGET (like multipath)
    500-599: rebuild initrd
    600-699: bootloader installation 
    700-799: 
    800-899: Last Check
    900-999: Remount all TARGET FS in /mnt/local + post-recovery (NBU)

i.e. the numbers 100-199 are meant for creating devices on TARGET  
while the numbers 600-699 are meant for bootloader installation.

Is there a special reason why EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh must  
run so early during finalize stage?

@jsmeix I've totally forgotten about *usr/share/rear/finalize/readme*
:-(

Excerpt from
[100\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh](/home/sodoma/devel/projects/rear/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/100_EFISTUB_run_efibootmgr.sh)

    # This script should be triggered BEFORE any other boot loader installation scripts
    # in this directory. If EFI_STUB is enabled, we will automatically set
    # NOBOOTLOADER variable empty to avoid other boot loader installation attempts,
    # which will most probably fail (due missing binaries on original system).
    # If creation process of boot entry later fails, we will just print information
    # message to user to create boot entry manually, because ending restore process
    # with error in such late stage is not desirable.

So you can update its name to *609\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh* without
breaking anything.

Hello @jsmeix

This patch have uncovered problem.  
Namely with *finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh*. It looks
like it benefited from missing */proc*.

More precisely following condition:

    ...
    [[ ! -f "$file" ]] && continue # skip directory and file not found
    ...

will evaluate true when $file=&lt;symlink\_pointing\_to\_proc&gt; or
more specifically in my case:

    arch-efi:(/root)(root)# ll /etc/mtab 
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 19 Dec  6 15:19 /etc/mtab -> ../proc/self/mounts

So in current ReaR master code (without this patch merged) condition
will evaluate true (because */proc* is not mounted) and happily stops
current loop iteration and continues with next one.

However since your patch will correctly mount */proc*, condition will
evaluate as false, and remaining code in loop iteration will execute
which fails with:

    ++ PrintError '  2019-02-18 19:24:36.230447973 Including finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh

For completeness, current ReaR master code behaves like this:

    ++ for file in [b]oot/{grub.conf,menu.lst,device.map} [e]tc/grub.* [b]oot/grub/{grub.conf,grub.cfg,menu.lst,device.map} [b]oot/grub2/{grub.conf,grub.cfg,menu.lst,device.map} [e]tc/sysconfig/grub [e]tc/sysconfig/bootloader [e]tc/lilo.conf [e]tc/elilo.conf [e]tc/mtab [e]tc/fstab [e]tc/mtools.conf [e]tc/smartd.conf [e]tc/sysconfig/smartmontools [e]tc/sysconfig/rawdevices [e]tc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml [b]oot/efi/*/*/grub.cfg
    ++ [[ ! -f etc/mtab ]]
    ++ continue

Some time ago */etc/mtab* changed from regular file to symlink pointing
*/proc/mtab* resp */proc/self/mtab* and since this change we should not
anyhow touch this file and poking aroud */proc* with `sed` (I think that
using `sed -i` in /proc is not even possible).  
Migrating */etc/mtab* with *280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh* should be done
only on OLD systems where */etc/mtab* is actual file.

Your patch is fully OK, but if it will be merged other things might stop
working because your patch actually fixed something :-) (what an irony)!

@gozora  
thank you so much for finding the issue  
with finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
I will fix that too.

Regarding NNN\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
I cannot have it as 609\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
because we have already 600\_install\_elilo.sh and  
600\_install\_yaboot.sh and 600\_restore\_arm\_bootloader.sh  
so that I need to do some more re-numbering in this area...

Anytime!  
If you decide for essential rework of
*finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh* just void my (rather
simplistic workaround)
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2048](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2048)
;-)

I guess we can use 609\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh after all. Because
files from *Linux-i386*, *Linux-ppc64*, *Linux-arm*, *Linux-ia64* or
*Linux-ppc64le* directories will never execute simultaneously.

@gozora  
could you please re-test if now
finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
behaves better in your case?

I don't know how to trigger that 280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh gets
actually run.  
On my SLES15 and SLES12 systems I do not get a $FS\_UUID\_MAP file  
so 280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh returns immediately in my case.

@schabrolles  
I would much appreciate it if you could verify on POWER architecture  
that this changes here do not cause obvious regressions  
(I had to renumber all the bootloader install scripts).

I would much appreciate it if you could verify on Red Hat systems  
that this changes here do not cause obvious regressions  
in particular on older Red Hat systems that do not use GRUB2
