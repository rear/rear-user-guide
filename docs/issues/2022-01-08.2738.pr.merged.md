-   How was this pull request tested? yes in my own environment with 2
    different virtual machines.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Due to the performance issues involved when using TFTP for file transfer
modern PXE server support HTTP(s) downloads as well.  
Since it is necessary for rear to mount the upload target during
creating of the rescue information HTTP targets are not supported. Hence
the url specified via $PXE\_TFTP\_URL used for nfs, sshfs upload and
TFTP download may differ from the HTTP source offered by the same PXE
server.

Therefore the change introduces a new config variable $PXE\_HTTP\_URL to
specify explicitly the HTTP download source for PXE.  
If the variable is set the PXE config file will generate an additional
3rd boot option besides the unchanged standard option "rear" (via TFTP)
and "local". Namely "rear-http" which includes the HTTP url information
to download the kernel and initrd data.

@rear/contributors  
because I am not a PXE user I can only look at the plain code  
so I would appreciate it if one of you could also have a look here  
(as time permits) - ideally someone who knows about PXE

@Flunkyball  
thank you for your PXE enhancement!  
It helps us so much to get a PXE enhancement by someone who actually
uses it.

Now there is at least an initial HTTP support for PXE  
so if your enhancement may not yet work for another PXE user  
it is now much easier to further enhance what is already there.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections from one of you  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.
