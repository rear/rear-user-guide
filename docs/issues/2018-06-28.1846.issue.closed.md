    Relax-and-Recover 2.4-git.3020.aa7b197.master / 2018-06-21
-   OS version:  
    At least CentOS 6 and Debian 7 (fully updated)
-   ReaR configuration files:

    classic BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I've found an issue while trying to use the RAWDISK output on old
    linux distroes (Centos 6 and Debian 7)  
    When the mkrescue commands reaches the
    [280\_create\_bootable\_disk\_image.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280_create_bootable_disk_image.sh)
    file, it creates the raw file with dd, and adds correctly the rescue
    partition. However, on line 86 (mkfs.vfat) the program does not find
    the loop device's partition (/dev/loop0p1).

I tried running the losetup command myself and in fact no /dev/loop0p1
appears, even though if I run gdisk on the loop0 device it finds
correctly the partition created beforehand.

I guess it has to do as how those distros handle "refreshing" the
partitions available but I don't really know how to work around that.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    None yet.

Support for RAWDISK output  
(plus TCG Opal 2-compliant self-encrypting disks)  
was implemented by @OliverO2 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659)  
where `The code has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.`

@OliverO2  
could you please have a look what goes on here?

Just tried on Ubuntu 14 LTS and it works fine.

Then I tried to update (using backports) the Debian kernel to 3.16 and
it does not change.  
But as debian 7 is not supported anymore (my info were outdated) we
might choose to drop it. It still leaves CentOS 6 which is still active.

On other news, using debian 8 there is no issue.

Might be related to losetup/util-linux version.

I know nothing at all about RAWDISK output  
but from plain looking at the code in  
usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280\_create\_bootable\_disk\_image.sh

<pre>
disk_device="$(losetup --show --find "$disk_image")"
...
local boot_partition="${disk_device}p1"
...
mkfs.vfat $v "$boot_partition" ...
</pre>

it seems one cannot assume that the boot\_partition device name  
is always of the form `${disk_device}p1`.

I assume how partitions are named in this case also depends on  
what each particular Linux distribution likes to do in this area  
like the various ways how each version of each Linux distribution  
implements their naming of multipath device nodes differently, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1765](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1765)  
in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1765\#issuecomment-381498504](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1765#issuecomment-381498504)

@GreenBlood  
if my above assumtion is right we would need to know  
how on each version of each of your Linux distributions  
the partitions are actually named in case of loop devices.

You could add a line

<pre>
read -p "Press ENTER to continue ... " 0&lt&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

anywhere in
output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280\_create\_bootable\_disk\_image.sh  
e.g. directly before the `mkfs.vfat ...` line so that it stops there  
and you could inspect what there actually is  
at exactly that state on your system.

@GreenBlood Thanks for reporting and your research done so far.

@jsmeix What you have argued so far sounds reasonable. I'll try to
figure out what could be done to improve portability.

@jsmeix Yeah, i've actually already tried to run the commands by hand
(dd, gdisk, losetup and such) and the loopXp1 does not appears anyhow.
But running losetup -a or fdisk -l /dev/loop0 show that the loop device
is activated.  
**HOWEVER**  
Using a more recent kernel on the centos 6 i've managed to get it
working.

I noticed that util-linux was on a different version between CentOS 6
and 7, so I went and grabbed the last version source rpm and compiled
it.

Using the newly compiled binaries (I have not installed them as its a
pretty important package), I got this result :

    [root@centos6 util-linux-2.23.2]# losetup --show --find /tmp/rear.MOL0gr9BL4uKxck/tmp/rear-centos6.raw
    /dev/loop0
    [root@centos6 util-linux-2.23.2]# partx -a /dev/loop0
    HDIO_GETGEO: Inappropriate ioctl for device
    [root@centos6 util-linux-2.23.2]# ./partx -a /dev/loop0
    [root@centos6 util-linux-2.23.2]# ls /dev/loop*
    /dev/loop0  /dev/loop0p1  /dev/loop1  /dev/loop2  /dev/loop3  /dev/loop4  /dev/loop5  /dev/loop6  /dev/loop7  /dev/loop-control

*While the compiled recent partx reloads the partitions, the system one
does not work*  
Using the standard kernel and the compiled partx, it does not work
anymore. So I guess it's the combination of the kernel version and a
partx update that does the trick.

I don't know what to do with these informations, I feel like I went too
far but meh. Seems like a dead end to me. My VM is now a CentOS
Frankeinstein monster.

AFAIK creating device names for partitions is a kernel excercise.
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a tool which reports assigned
partition device names. For example, `partprobe --summary` just outputs

    /dev/loop0: gpt partitions 1

As it looks like there are different opinions on how to create partition
devices names and no one to ask, my best guess would be to just rely on
the fact that partition names will consist of the device name followed
by some appendix. In this case, there is only one partition, so its name
shouldn't be too hard to guess...

@GreenBlood Could you change the line

    local boot_partition="${disk_device}p1"

to

    local boot_partition="$(echo "${disk_device}"?*)"

in
`usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/280_create_bootable_disk_image.sh`
and see if that works on each distribution?

@GreenBlood There was an overlap in our comments: If it's not a naming
issue but a kernel failing to update its partitions table, there is
probably not much we can do here. Modern kernels should update their
partition tables automatically. Otherwise `partprobe "$disk_device"`
should instruct them to. Another idea would be to use losetup's
`--partscan ` option like this:

    disk_device="$(losetup --partscan --show --find "$disk_image")"

Would this make it work?

@OliverO2 Well, It seems that CentOS 6 being nearly ten years old,
losetup does not includes `--partscan`.

Using my compiled losetup, it accepts this argument but does not work
any better.

    [root@centos6 util-linux-2.23.2]# ./losetup --show --find --partscan "/tmp/rear.IdSQo1PE0lrU95R/tmp/rear-centos6.raw"
    /dev/loop0
    [root@centos6 util-linux-2.23.2]# ls /dev/loop*
    /dev/loop0  /dev/loop1  /dev/loop2  /dev/loop3  /dev/loop4  /dev/loop5  /dev/loop6  /dev/loop7

I guess CentOS 6 is off the list for RAWDISK, unless there is a way that
I'm unaware of.

@OliverO2  
as a minimal improvement could you add a test  
that such a $boot\_partition actually exists  
and error out if not like

<pre>
local boot_partition="${disk_device}p1"
test -b "$boot_partition" || Error "Cannot ceate raw disk image (no $boot_partition partition on $disk_device)"
</pre>

This does not make things work in environments where it currently cannot
work  
but it would at least tell the user what is unexpected or wrong in his
environment.

@OliverO2  
in general regarding things like "kernel failing to update its
partitions table"  
you may have a look at the somewhat similar or related issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)

@GreenBlood Maybe there is a solution after all if you're able to
install the `kpartx` tool on your older distributions: Could you just
try to apply commit bcb0ed3e01d5e9225c6e243bb4971de90ea3c57b in my
branch
[https://github.com/OliverO2/rear/tree/feature/rawdisk-portability-improvements](https://github.com/OliverO2/rear/tree/feature/rawdisk-portability-improvements)?

@jsmeix This should also improve the error message. I'll create a PR if
this has been tested successfully (currently I don't have one of these
older kernels available so I could not test it fully).

@OliverO2 Ok so I tried your patch but no luck.

But I think what @jsmeix was suggesting earlier might be the issue we're
facing. It seems that running `losetup`, then `kpartx -a /dev/loopX`
makes the device appear in /dev/disk/by-\*  
See:

    [root@centos6 ~]# losetup -d /dev/loop0
    [root@centos6 ~]# losetup --show --find rear-centos6.raw 
    /dev/loop0
    [root@centos6 ~]# ls /dev/disk/by-id/
    (System disks)
    [root@centos6 ~]# kpartx -a /dev/loop0
    [root@centos6 ~]# ls /dev/disk/by-id/
    dm-name-loop0p1   dm-uuid-part1-loop0        (System disks) 

So even though `kpartx` says that its adding a /dev/loop0p1 device it's
not the case in this situation. On my server the symlinks in
/dev/disk/by-\* were to /dev/dm-2.  
I integrated it in rear workflow to test using the correct devices on
the server and it works.  
I have this very ugly diff to show you what I modified (hardcoded value,
but it was just for testing purposes :

I don't currently know how to "detect" where the loop device is going
tho.

**EDIT :** It would seem that using
`lsblk -n --output "KNAME" $disk_device` show on the second line where
in /dev the partition is.  
Debian 8 :

    root@debian8:~# lsblk -n --output "KNAME" /dev/loop0
    loop0
    loop0p1

CentOS 6 :

    [root@centos6 ~]# lsblk -n --output "KNAME" /dev/loop0

    dm-2

Ubuntu 16 LTS :

    root@ubuntu16:/tmp# lsblk -n --output "KNAME" /dev/loop0
    loop0
    loop0p1

I'd have to test on more Linux distros but as `lsblk` is part of
util-linux it's *a priori* in every distro.

@GreenBlood Thanks for trying. I think we're at least on the right path
here. Note that my patch uses the `-u` option of `kpartx`, not `-a`.
Unfortunately, kpartx is not well documented so it's trial and error.

Note that the mapping device `dm-name-loop0p1` you saw is absolutely OK.
`kpartx` creates device mappings like these but should also create links
for the proper loop device path `/dev/loop0p1`.

Diagnosis
---------

Could you post the relevant section of the rear log when running the
code with my patch? Maybe you could run it again even examine the state
after the kpartx call by inserting

    read -p "Press ENTER to continue ... " 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8

before the comment

    # If unsuccessful, say so.

and look for loop devices.

What does `kpartx -l` say?

Alternative solution without losetup:
-------------------------------------

In addition, could you try this?

1.  Replace the lines

<!-- -->

    local disk_device  # separate 'local' statement to avoid losing $(...) exit status - cf. https://stackoverflow.com/a/10397996
    disk_device="$(losetup --show --find "$disk_image")"
    StopIfError "Could not create loop device on $disk_image"
    AddExitTask "losetup -d $disk_device >&2"

    local boot_partition="${disk_device}p1"

with

    local kpartx_fields=($(kpartx -asv "$disk_image"))
    [[ ${#kpartx_fields[*]} == 6 ]] || Error "kpartx could not create loop device and its partitions (result: $kpartx_fields)"

    local disk_device="${kpartx_fields[4]}"
    local boot_partition="/dev/${kpartx_fields[0]}"

    AddExitTask "kpartx -d $disk_image >&2"

    LogPrint "loop device: $disk_device, boot partition: $boot_partition"

1.  Uncomment these lines:

<!-- -->

    losetup -d "$disk_device" || Error "Could not delete loop device"
    RemoveExitTask "losetup -d $disk_device >&2"

1.  Then run rear and post the relevant section of the log.

@GreenBlood  
with

merged  
this issue should be fixed where "fixed" means that now  
ReaR tries as far as possible to make the needed partition device nodes
appear  
but if they finally won't appear it must error out because it cannot
proceed  
without the needed partition device nodes.
