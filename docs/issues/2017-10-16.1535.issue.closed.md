Currently the ReaR disk label 'REAR-000'  
is hardcoded used at several places in the code.

With a config variable like

<pre>
REAR_DISK_LABEL="REAR-000"
</pre>

users could use several differently labeled disks  
for example differently labeled USB disks as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1520](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1520)  
or a label that they like more in their environment as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1492](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1492)

@jsmeix I would propose to use a name like `REAR_USB_DISK_LABEL` instead
- makes it clear where the name stands for, otherwise, we create more
confusion instead of making the end-user easier. Remember, the more
choices there are, the number of errors may increase due to
misunderstanding the meaning of these variables

My initial variable name proposal was just a shot in the dark.

Meanwhile I think this config variable should be named  
in compliance with the other config variables that are  
used for "rear format" i.e. with a "USB\_DEVICE\_" prefix.

I would like to avoid "REAR" in ReaR config variable names  
because in general it is meaningless to have "REAR" in  
ReaR config variable names because obviously all  
those variables are about ReaR (and "REAR" is  
wrong spelling of "ReaR" ;-)

Accordingly I think we should use in default.conf

<pre>
USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL='REAR-000'
</pre>

It matches well what there is currently described in default.conf

<pre>
# Filesystem to use for the 'REAR-000' labeled ReaR data partition
...
USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM=ext3
</pre>

And USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_LABEL is technically correct  
because that label is set during "rear format" in  
format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh  
and in  
format/USB/default/350\_label\_usb\_disk.sh  
as a label of a particular filesystem (like /dev/sdb2)  
and not as a label of a whole disk (like /dev/sdb).

We have already "USB\_DEVICE\_PARTED\_LABEL"  
which might be confusing but if things are sufficiently  
documented in default.conf everything should be clear.

@jsmeix üëç I agree.
