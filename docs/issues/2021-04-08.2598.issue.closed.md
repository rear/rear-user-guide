#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

cat /etc/os-release

NAME="SLES"

ID\_LIKE="suse"  
ANSI\_COLOR="0;32"  
CPE\_NAME="cpe:/o:suse:sles:15:sp2"

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

cat /etc/rear/site.conf
=======================

site.conf
=========

another config file that is sourced BEFORE local.conf
=====================================================

could be used to set site-wide settings
=======================================

you could then distribute the site.conf from a central location while you keep
==============================================================================

the machine-local settings in local.conf

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://10.98.48.106/backup/NonProd/SUSE15/

Do NOT use MANUAL\_INCLUDE mode. In MANUAL\_INCLUDE mode, only the filesystems explicitly specified
===================================================================================================

in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE will be saved. MANUAL\_INCLUDE (=YES) is only useful, if your systems do always have the
=================================================================================================================

same basic mountpoints you want to save (either flat partitions or LVM or even mixed) and want to ignore
========================================================================================================

additional filesystems, that might have been included into the system (via SAN) to not blow up the
==================================================================================================

recovery system
===============

Be sure to test your recovery when you want to use this mode! Default is NO
===========================================================================

MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

VMWARE virtual machine

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86 compatible

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

N/A

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

VMDK

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):

lsblk

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I need to know whether there is an option to install just one file using
the REAR backup that is stored on the NFS server.

NFS server output:

ls -l
=====

total 4411140  
-rw------- 1 root root 202 Apr 7 00:38 README  
-rw------- 1 root root 265 Apr 7 00:38 VERSION

-rw------- 1 root root 5641172 Apr 7 00:38 rear-sg6w3100.log

Is there an option with REAR that I could only restore the /etc/passwd
file on the running system without restoring the entire system?

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

There is no method implemented in ReaR to restore  
on the running system something from the backup.

To restore on the running system something from the backup  
you need to do it manually:  
You have to manually mount the NFS share at a local mountpoint  
so that you can access the backup.tar.gz locally on the running system  
and then manually restore what you need from the backup.

FYI:

When your system does no longer boot or no longer works normally  
e.g. because of deleted or corrupted essential files  
you can restore such essential files "from outside" by booting  
the ReaR recovery system and restore the files from there, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2553\#issuecomment-785069808](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2553#issuecomment-785069808)

But also in the ReaR recovery system there is no method implemented  
to restore only some specific files from the backup.  
You also have to manually mount the NFS share at a local mountpoint  
so that you can access the backup.tar.gz locally in the ReaR recovery
system  
then mount your target system filesystems manually or via
`rear -D mountonly`  
and finally manually restore what you need from the backup into
/mnt/local  
i.e. into the mounted target system's filesystems.

Note that currently the 'mountonly' workflow may fail with certain  
complicated filesystem structures like LVM on top of LUKS cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2542](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2542)  
regardless that according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2269](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2269)  
it was tested with "LVM Logical Volumes and a LUKS-encrypted
filesystem"  
but perhaps not with LVM on top of LUKS and  
also the complicated SUSE btrfs structure often causes special issues.
