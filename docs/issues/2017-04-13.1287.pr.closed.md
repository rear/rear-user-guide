After merging issue \#1286 this enhancement beautifies the recovery
environment scripting, to not run unnecessary code for:

1.  cases where /etc/HOSTNAME does not exist
2.  things that the operating system already has taken care of.

Target: Arch Linux  
Hostname set in /etc/hostname (lowercase)  
Only that /etc/hostname file present, will already set the hostname in
(1) system and (2) shell for Arch Linux, without the need for this
script to set any of these 2.

@ProBackup-nl  
according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258\#issuecomment-289167853](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258#issuecomment-289167853)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258\#issuecomment-293558696](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258#issuecomment-293558696)  
I think usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot  
i.e. /etc/scripts/boot in the recovery system is  
only run in the recovery system when the  
the sysv-compatible init process is used  
in the recovery system and I asume that  
in your recovery system already systemd is used  
so that changes in etc/scripts/boot do not matter  
in your case and in general when systemd is used.

If you nevertheless like to enhance etc/scripts/boot:  
When I looked at that script during debugging  
of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1258)  
I was wondering about why it uses $(uname -n)  
to show the HOSTNAME value to the user  
and not what it had actually set?

In other words:  
After calling

<pre>
hostname "$HOSTNAME"
</pre>

I wonder if then

<pre>
echo Hostname set to $(uname -n)
</pre>

really shows the right output.  
On my SLES12 system it works

<pre>
# hostname testy

# hostname
testy

# uname -n
testy
</pre>

but woudn't

<pre>
echo Hostname set to $( hostname )
</pre>

be the more straightforward way to do it?

Simply put:  
I do not understand why there is the indirection of using  
the "uname -n" output instead of the "hostname" output.

@gdha  
I would appreciate it if you coud you also have a look here.

I would suggest to keep `$(uname -n)`, to rule out edge cases where
anything goes wrong, that the actually outputs the value of the current
hostname setting.

And I think checking for the existence of /etc/HOSTNAME is better then
assuming that it is there.

See also \#1316 - it will conflict - to be decided which direction we
want to take

I like the simple way as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1316](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1316)  
to have two files /etc/hostname and /etc/HOSTNAME with  
same content in the ReaR recovery system.  
Perhaps we should even have those two same files  
in any case in the ReaR recovery system?

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1316](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1316)
is merged  
both /etc/hostname and /etc/HOSTNAME exists in any case  
so that this pull request in its current form with

<pre>
if [[ -e /etc/HOSTNAME ]] ; then
 ...
</pre>

does no longer make sense.
