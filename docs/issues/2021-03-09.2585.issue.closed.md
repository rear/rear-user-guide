Hello. There were some changes in the UEFI bootloader support, can you
please try a version without those changes? You can try the rear-2.4
package included in CentOS, because it does not have the changes in
question.

By the way, does "only on physical machine" mean that on a virtual
machine it is working properly?

Note that you will need the grub2-efi-x64-modules package, I believe it

By the way, do you use ReaR from Git? If so, does your version contain
the commit 60f28eea7864227a8cea4d543031babee290d1fc? I am asking because
you say that you are using 2.6 and your issue looks a lot like \#2434
(resolved in \#2453), and this fix is planned for 2.7, not for 2.6.

@jsmeix thanks, indeed GitHub master should fix the issue.  
I am thinking what would be possible workaround for those that have
created rescue media using 2.6 and the media don't boot...  
I suspect it could be as simple as issuing the commands

    linux (cd0)/isolinux/kernel
    initrd (cd0)/isolinux/initrd.cgz
    boot

manually in the GRUB command line.  
@cvijayvinoth can you please attempt this workaround?

sure let me try once @pcahyna. I have used edit option on the menu (
**pressed e** ) and updated (cd0) before the /isolinux. It didn't work.
Let me check with GRUB command line manually and update.

My bad, I have not realized that the latest Git version identifies
itself as "Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git", not as 2.7.

2.7 has not been released yet, if you use master branch from Github, you

Can you please try several other things?  
git commit 2be7f8b1728d0b8b1eacbd476fe011211a14f052 - that's the git
version just before the merge that possibly caused the issue  
git commit c9e61bad2cb365f42b500f07bc43b3c9e38d41f4 - that's immediately
after  
and in a version which works (like 2.4), try interrupting GRUB in the
rescue CD and in the command line, enter  
`echo ${root} ${prefix}`  
and report the result.

sure @pcahyna. Now the restore is going on with rear 2.4 version. Let me

fine. Its booting now.

Thank you for testing. Can we make a summary what works and what does
not? First iteration:

current ReaR master - broken  
ReaR 2.4 from CentOS 7 repos - works  
ReaR revision 2be7f8b - works?  
ReaR revision c9e61ba - ?

> rear 2.6

You mean rear from Git master, not the 2.6 release, right? Anyway,

> echo ${root} ${prefix}  
> hd0,msdos1 (cd0)/EFI/BOOT

That's very interesting. I did not expect this. I guess that it finds
the EFI partition on the hard disk, instead of the EFI files on the
CD.  
I also think that if the disk content were completely destroyed and you
were restoring entirely from scratch, this problem would not occur.

First tried with ReaR revision 2be7f8b - not working.  
echo ${root} ${prefix}  
cd0 (memdisk)/boot/grub

Post that with ReaR revision c9e61ba and revision 2be7f8b  
works fine as expected

I missed to check ReaR revision c9e61ba only. Sorry my bad.

so revision 2be7f8b never worked after all?

That's strange because 2be7f8b is before my changes that I suspect were
causing the problem. c9e61ba is after. So my changes seem to have
improved it, if I understand correctly. Now the question is, why 2.4
works, even if it is way older, and current Git version does not, even
though it contains my change.

That's strange, 2be7f8b did not use memdisk yet.

yes, rear from Git master only.  
Yes you are correct. It is finds the EFI partition on the hard disk, if
the OS is exists.

Tried with revision 2be7f8b couple of times. It never worked. Even I am
trying to understand the changes in rear 2.6 code base and 2.4 version.

Actually /boot/grub2 should be assigned for grubdir.  
But As per the logic grubdir="${boot\_dir}/grub" is assigned.

Good catch, the code does not take into account the possibility of
having both `/boot/grub` and `/boot/grub2`.  
But this does not seem to be your problem, as this will affect only GRUB
fonts and locales.  
Also this code has been there for a long time.
