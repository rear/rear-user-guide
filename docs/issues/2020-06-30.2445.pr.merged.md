@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate a second review from any other ReaR contributor.

Yes this is intentional. That file was causing the Rubrik agent to be
started twice. The functionality was moved to another file in an earlier
update but the file was never removed at that time. Starting the agent
twice was contributing to \#2441.

@DamaniN  
thank you for your prompt replies and your further code enhancements.

Now things are clear to me so I approve it.

@rear/contributors  
a second review from another ReaR contributor would be nice to have.  
If there is none and if there are no objections I would "just merge" it
tomorrow afternoon.

I tested it as far as I could without a Rubrik (CDM) cluster
environment  
by simulating things as far as possible with reasonable effort.  
To me things look OK now.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it as is tomorrow
afternoon.  
We are in early ReaR 2.7 development phase so we can fix things if
needed.
