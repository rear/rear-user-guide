-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

We have cloned the existing Puppet module puppet-rear and because of our
company policy, we prefer not to modify the modules directly (so we
don't have to constantly maintain them when getting new version from
upstream), but instead redefine things in dedicated YAML files.

Unfortunately the puppet-rear module already defines both BACKUP\_URL
and OUTPUT\_URL and we don't want those:  
output\_url = 'nfs://192.168.0.1/srv/rear'  
backup\_url = 'nfs://192.168.0.1/srv/rear'

What we need and what worked great for us with manual testing or ReaR
without Puppet was:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NBU  
... and both backup\_url and output\_url should be undefined in
local.conf

Now we don't want to touch the module itself but redefine these 2 values
back to DEFAULT in our YAML file.  
How to properly do this please?  
We can't leave them empty because then values from the puppet module
will be used, so we need to manually set BACKUP\_URL and OUTPUT\_URL to
default values.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Modifying the Puppet module itself, but that's not what we want.

@pdanek `OUTPUT_URL=null` is a possibility. For `BACKUP_URL` we do not
have a `null` setting as that makes no sense. However, if you use
`BACKUP=NBU` it really doesn't matter what the content is of
`BACKUP_URL`  
Why question - what do you do with the ISO image? Does it stay on the
system itself?

PS: interesting puppet cookbook - I'm not using puppet myself, but I'm
using Chef instead. It is on my list to create a Chef cookbook for rear
as well someday.

@gdha Blazing fast reply as always, so we can use following?  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=null  
BACKUP=NBU  
BACKUP\_URL='nfs://192.168.0.1/srv/rear'

And it will be exactly the same effect as having only this?  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NBU

Reply to why question: yes we keep the ISO locally on each server in
/var/lib/rear/output/ where it gets replaced with every new mkrescue.  
This ISO will:

-   get automatically backed up by Netbackup
-   we want to schedule UC4 job which will copy the ISO from each server
    to another server with large HNAS filesystem where last 1 or 2
    copies of ReaR image will be stored (so in case of disaster, we
    don't have to restore thousands of ISO files for each server from
    Netbackup)

(I closed this by mistake, still need confirmation please)

@pdanek yes that should do the trick. Just test it out ;-)

@pdanek any feedback from your end?

Yes, that did the trick, thanks!  
Apologies for forgotten feedback.
