    not yet tested

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Use `grep ' on / '` with explicitly specified spaces as separators
    instead of `grep -w 'on /'`  
    because on SLES with btrfs and snapper the latter results two
    matches that result  
    two same UUIDs (with newline) that end up (with newline) in the boot
    menuentry

@gozora  
could you please review it because you implemented that code originally
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b81693f27a41482ed89da36a9af664fe808f8186](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b81693f27a41482ed89da36a9af664fe808f8186)

Hello @jsmeix,

Actually I'd like to ask my previous me, why were the spaces not added
when this code was originally written :-)

V.

@gozora  
I was surprised to learn by this issue that the actual `grep -w`
behaviour  
does not match what I naively expected it to be  
but according to `man grep` that reads for my GNU grep 2.16

<pre>
-w, --word-regexp
Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of the line,
or preceded by a non-word constituent character. Similarly, it must be either
at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.
Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.
</pre>

grep works as documented because a dot `.` is a non-word constituent
character  
so that the dot in `/.snapshots` separates it into two words `/` and
`snapshots`  
so that `foo /.snapshots bar` matches `grep -w '/'` (and
`grep -w 'snapshots'`).
