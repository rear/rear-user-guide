Implemented simple functions get\_bash\_flags\_and\_options\_commands  
and apply\_bash\_flags\_and\_options\_commands that are used  
in a fail-safe way via an explicit variable that  
stores the current bash flags and options commands  
and using that explicit variable to re-apply them, i.e. like

<pre>
      saved_flags_options_cmds="$( get_bash_flags_and_options_commands )"
      ... [change bash flags and options] ...
      ... [do something] ...
      apply_bash_flags_and_options_commands "$saved_flags_options_cmds"
</pre>

Currently those functions are used in framework-functions.sh  
when "Entering debugscripts mode" and "Leaving debugscripts mode"  
so that the workaround by using DEBUGSCRIPTS\_OPPOSITE\_ARGUMENT is
obsoleted.

@jsmeix I'm good with your enhancements - perhaps if I need to say
something - add a remark in the main script that functions belong the
the library scripts, but that these 2 are exceptions on the rule.  
And, add yourself to the AUTHORS list, ok?
