    Not at all tested by me because I do not use TSM

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    A blind attempt by plain looking at the code  
    which is intended as a proposal how I think  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1948](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1948)  
    might be implemented.

@schabrolles  
I noticed inconsistencies about the date format  
for TSM Point-In-Time Restore in what was written in the comments  
in default.conf

<pre>
internally MM/DD/YYYY is used
</pre>

and in
verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh

<pre>
LogPrint "Restoring all filespaces from backup before ... (MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss)"
</pre>

versus what the code  
in
verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
actually does

<pre>
TSM_RESTORE_PIT_DATE=$( date -d "$REPLY" +%Y.%m.%d 2>/dev/null ) ...
</pre>

Furthermore is seems the dsmc option `-date=5` is set twice first in

<pre>
TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS=( "${TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS[@]}" -date=5 -pitd="$TSM_RESTORE_PIT_DATE" )
</pre>

and then again in

<pre>
TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS=( "${TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS[@]}" -date=5 -pitt="$TSM_RESTORE_PIT_TIME" )
</pre>

Perhaps it is really needed two times or perhaps it does not matter?

Ok ok I better leave here.

FWIW:  
I think the usual way are pull requests (at least all others seem to do
it this way)?

Yes, PR is great. That's why I put my code into an issue branch here in
our common repo so that everybody in our team can work on it or suggest
changes. I was just surprised why you made a PR to master and not to the
issue repo.
