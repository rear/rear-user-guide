In the upcoming SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (SLE15)  
'net-tools' will move to the so called 'legacy' module.

In SLE15 a so called 'module' is some kind of  
software repository for a particular purpose.

The 'legacy' module is for outdated/deprecated software  
that still can be installed and used (for some time)  
but in the end it will fade out of support in SLE15.

This means we have to check all ReaR scripts  
to use the equivalence provided by iproute2.

The list of binaries we have to check:

<pre>
# rpm -qvl net-tools | grep 'bin/' | cut -d '/' -f3 | sort

arp
dnsdomainname -> hostname
domainname -> hostname
ether-wake
hostname
ifconfig
ipmaddr
iptunnel
nameif
netstat
plipconfig
rarp
route
slattach
</pre>

Maybe you have some inside info on how to install SLE15 to fit better
with ReaR ;-).

I went for following module selection (on SLE-SAP) and end up with
system without *bc* and *route*

![sle15-modules](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12116358/49645519-8c9e1a00-fa1c-11e8-9a1f-544bed9f335d.png)

    sle15:~ # bc; route
    If 'bc' is not a typo you can use command-not-found to lookup the package that contains it, like this:
        cnf bc
    If 'route' is not a typo you can use command-not-found to lookup the package that contains it, like this:
        cnf route

Btw. I'm not complaining, just saying ;-)

Feel free to complain about that SLE15 modules stuff ...  
I had selected two of them (that were "just selectable" for me)  
and in the next step the installer complained at me about conflicts ;-)

I found the reason why my ReaR did not complain:  
I used the SUSE rear23a RPM package for SLE15 which does not yet
contain  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961)

I have no `route` installed (things work for me with DHCP  
but missing `route` may cause unexpected failures otherwise).

I have `bc` (RPM package 'bc') installed because

<pre>
# rpm -e --test bc
error: Failed dependencies:
        bc is needed by (installed) rear23a-2.3.a-7.3.x86_64
</pre>

cf. "I use my own rear.spec for the official rear RPM in openSUSE" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855\#issuecomment-404100990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855#issuecomment-404100990)

I think as log as we did not fix this issue here it is o.k.  
that ReaR insists on the tools that current ReaR needs  
even if some of those tools are considered "outdated".

I'm not complaining about SLE15 modules stuff now, (but you should
listen to me yesterday evening as I was installing SLE15 for first time
in my life :-D), it is innovative (despite a bit nonstandard :-))
approach.

I'm not used to install ReaR from RPM, that's why I need to install all
the related progs separately, so now it is clear why you did not met
this problem ...

Please note that this problem also affects openSUSE Leap 15. Testing a
dev branch rebased to rear-2.5 on a Leap 15 VM, I get this error:

pc-pan:/home/philipa/projets/rear \# ./usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup

Running rear mkbackup (PID 27773)  
Using log file:

ERROR: Cannot find required programs: route

And as @jsmeix pointed out above:

pc-pan:/home/philipa/projets/rear \# cnf route

The program 'route' can be found in the following packages:

-   net-tools-deprecated \[ path: /bin/route, repository: zypp
    (repo-oss) \]
-   net-tools-deprecated \[ path: /usr/bin/route, repository: zypp
    (repo-oss) \]

The requirements in ReaR is expressed in
./usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf

What in the unholy hell??

Did you pick a package to replace the functionality of net-tools before
you decided to deprecate basic command line network tools that have
existed since the dawn of time? Sorry for sounding catty, but it sounds
absolutely ridiculous to deprecate net-tools.

Seriously. I installed the root package because it's still available
(thankfully), and now I can't locate netstat in the default sources. (I
haven't looked for the other packages yet.) Could you kindly point me to
a semi-reputable source where I can pick up the other packages needed to
complete the functionality for net-tools?

Also, if you don't have an alternative that replicates the
functionality, I highly recommend you at least put the packages in to
some sort of alt-repository where people can find it. Are Pac-man and
those guys still around? It's been about 5 years since I installed a
SUSE desktop, so I'm a bit out of touch.

Thanks so much!

Why? It's old, not maintained and the current tools are just **plain
better**. Why stick to old shit if you can use something newer, that is
actually better? Yeah, you have to learn and use it as a new thing, but
guess what, `ifconfig` was new at some point, as well.

Well, that's why I started off asking what is replacing it. What are you
guys using to replace the functionality of it?

@crogonint @theAkito you guys are barking up the wrong tree ...  
We in [ReaR](https://github.com/rear/rear) are neither maintaining nor
deciding about obsolescence of *net-tools* package. Unfortunately we are
just "victims" of software development, just as your (and many other
users) are.

I think *iproute2* package (at least on Debian) should sufficiently well
replace *net-tools*.

I'm fully aware of it. In fact I am not even a ReaR user, I just found
this discussion regarding `ifconfig`, etc. as it is being deprecated in
general.

> Why?

Sorry I missed this earlier, @theAkito

I can't recall the exact pakcages, but something I considered critical
was dependent on it. Probably some sort of network administration
tracking tool I used for virtual machines or some such.

As a best practice, they shouldn't deprecate these things until some
level of functionality has been patched over upstream. I actually
abandoned my SLED 15 administration install over it. It's a sad sad day
when I have to relegate network administration to a Windoze machine
because Linux can't hack it any more.

IMHO, the entire foundation of the Linux movement is falling apart
because of this stagnation and finger pointing. Windows is poised to
fall on it's face, dead of old age, and Linux can't muster a single user
ready desktop to present to the masses.. let alone something to keep
advanced users and corporate administrators happy for a few generations.
