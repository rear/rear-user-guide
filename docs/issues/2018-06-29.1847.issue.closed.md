Using current master code.

When there are two disks /dev/sda and /dev/sdb with same size  
"rear recover" goes into MIGRATION\_MODE  
(which is right to be on the safe side):

<pre>
Comparing disks
Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)
Switching to manual disk layout configuration
Using /dev/sda (same name and same size) for recreating /dev/sda
Current disk mapping table (source -> target):
    /dev/sda /dev/sda
</pre>

But when that identical mapping "/dev/sda =&gt; /dev/sda" is used  
then files like disklayout.conf and during finalize stage even restored
files  
get needlessly modified (hopefully usually with actually identical
modification  
but that lots of needlessly done `sed` magic might result unwanted
changes):

<pre>
Applying disk layout mappings in /var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings to certain restored files...
The original restored files get saved in var/lib/rear/saved_original_files/ (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'boot/grub2/grub.cfg' (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'boot/grub2/device.map' (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'etc/sysconfig/bootloader' (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'etc/fstab' (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'etc/mtools.conf' (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'etc/smartd.conf' (in /mnt/local)
Applied disk layout mappings to restored 'etc/sysconfig/smartmontools' (in /mnt/local)
</pre>

One can see that since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843)
is merged  
but it happened all the time (only silently and without saving original
files).

I will try to detect a completely identical mapping  
i.e. all entries in /var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings must be an
identity map like

<pre>
/dev/sda /dev/sda
/dev/sdb /dev/sdb
/dev/sdc /dev/sdc
</pre>

and in this case all what belongs to
/var/lib/rear/layout/disk\_mappings  
can be skipped.
