-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    "rear mkrescue" itselfs dont get any error messages back. But on
    some systems we are tracking also the SIGSEGV and there we get email
    notification (I will attach an email).  
    The command that is killed is this one:

<!-- -->

    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 --verify /usr/lib/modules/3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64/vdso/vdso32-int80.so

When I execute the command manually I get a "Segmentation fault (core
dumped)" error.  
If I change the library to the 64bit directory I dont get any error:

-   Workaround, if any:

@babadem13  
when I unzip your attached  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2909092/abrt.ld-2.17.so.killed.by.SIGSEGV.msg.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2909092/abrt.ld-2.17.so.killed.by.SIGSEGV.msg.zip)  
I get a `abrt  ld-2.17.so killed by SIGSEGV.msg` file - yes, with
spaces!  
cf. "Use whitespace characters in file names to fool others" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)  
and it seems it contains only some proprietary stuff that I cannot read:

    # file 'abrt  ld-2.17.so killed by SIGSEGV.msg'
    CDFV2 Microsoft Outlook Message

Please do not waste my time with such proprietary stuff.

Provide a "rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup" debug log file  
that is plain ASCII text that everybody can read directly.

I think I know that kind of issue and in my case it was `ldd` that  
got aborted by SIGSEGV ( 139 - 128 = 11 = SIGSEGV):

    ++ chroot /tmp/rear.G1lIYVh7t7wdjbH/rootfs /bin/bash --login -c 'cd /usr/lib/modules/3.10.0-957.5.1.el7.x86_64/vdso && ldd /usr/lib/modules/3.10.0-957.5.1.el7.x86_64/vdso/vdso.so'
    ldd: exited with unknown exit code (139)

In any case it is not a bug inside ReaR when a program that is called  
by ReaR gets aborted by SIGSEGV - that is a bug inside that program.

@babadem13  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2177](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2177)  
which is about the same issue.  
Therein is an analysis what happens in this particular case and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2177\#issuecomment-509500782](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2177#issuecomment-509500782)  
is a possible "quick and dirty workaround" in the script  
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
to avoid this particular issue.

The solution in the next ReaR version to avoid this kind of issues  
is to exclude kernel modules from the `ldd` test in  
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
because running `ldd` on kernel modules does not make sense.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2179](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2179)
merged  
this issue should be avoided.
