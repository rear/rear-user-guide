\#1197  
This PR adds support for Arm Devices (and improves compatibility for all
Architectures). It should work with Raspberry Pis, most TI and Allwinner
Devices.  
Currently only OUTPUT=PXE is supported and you'll need to manually craft
an bootable Disk with the Kernel and Initrd. Also Automatic Bootloader
detection is not implemented and you'll need to set BOOTLOADER to either
"ARM", which is just an Dummy and does nothing, or "ARM-ALLWINNER" which
will backup and restore the Allwinner Bootloader. For Raspberry and most
TI Devices it should be enough to include the first fat partition
(containing the MLO or bootcode.bin) in the Backup to Backup the
Bootloader.  
This has been tested on an Allwinner pcduino. Testing for other Devices
welcome!

Thanks a lot @Lukey3332 for starting to work on ARM support. It seems to
me that there are actually 3 topics included in your PR:

1.  add support for MMCBLK (great idea!)
2.  clean up and consolidate the kernel guessing code (another great
    idea!)
3.  add support for ARM ALLWINNER (nice!)

IMHO 1) and 3) look fine, 2) looks to me like it could benefit from a
little bit more work, as now the kernel guessing happens twice: once in
one of the `300_copy_kernel.sh` scripts and then once more in
`400_guess_kernel.sh` I am wondering if you can simplify the code even
more and if those `300_copy_kernel.sh` scripts are actually still
necessary, especially since none of them actually \**copies* \* the
kernel. @rear/contributors what do you think?

About 3) the allwinner scripts, could you kindly move them to a suitable
architecture dependant sub-folder? `rear dump` will show you which ones
you can use.

Finally, could you kindly provide us a `rear dump` here for reference so
that we can see how ReaR reads your system? Thanks a lot!

Hi,  
The `400_guess_kernel.sh` was intended as fallback, if the current
Architecture has no Kernel selection/guessing Code. I already thought
about moving the Allwinner Bootloader Code to an architecture folder,
but on arm the output of `uname -m` is inconsistent, so far I've seen
`armv[45678][lb]`, `aarch64` and `aarch64_be`.  
The output of `rear dump` is below.

@ArnoutVerbeken  
Did you see this already? It would be cool to have this Tested on an
Raspberry Pi.

Would be nice to merge.

From a quick look, the separate Kernel-Selection Scripts seem to have
their purpose. I think cleaning them up should be done by someone who
can test it on all Architectures.

@schlomo @jsmeix @schabrolles If you could have a peek at the code and
approve or give comments for improvements that would be fine.

@gdha  
I know - I know ... it is on my todo list,  
but I know nothing about ARM architecture  
so that I could at most have a basically  
blind look (oxymoron intended ;-)  
at the plain code...

@Lukey3332  
FYI in general regarding Schlomo's finding

<pre>
LogPrint "Warning: BOOTLOADER = ARM is just an Dummy!"
</pre>

see  
[http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

I fully agree with Schlomo and furthermore I even recommend to never
shout  
at the (poor) user i.e. neither use ALL-CAPS nor exclamation marks.

As far as I understand your description about BOOTLOADER="ARM" in
default.conf  
it is perfectly valid when the user specifies BOOTLOADER="ARM" in his
local.conf  
and the user must manually explicity specify BOOTLOADER for ARM  
which means the user knows about what BOOTLOADER="ARM" means  
so that there is no need to warn the user about his setting.

Strictly speaking there is no need to tell the user anything about
settings  
that he must do manually and explicitly so that at most there could be  
a plain information message, e.g. something like

<pre>
LogPrint "Skipping bootloader setup (BOOTLOADER=ARM)"
</pre>

@Lukey3332  
in your initial  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662\#issue-160052060](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1662#issue-160052060)  
you wrote that "Currently only OUTPUT=PXE is supported"  
but I fail to find "PXE" in your code - perhaps I overlooked
something?  
I wonder if there should be a test somewhere  
that lets "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" error out  
when not OUTPUT=PXE is used?  
For my general reasoning behind such tests have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718\#issuecomment-361871332](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718#issuecomment-361871332)

@Lukey3332  
many thanks for your latest adaptions.

If there are no further objections I would like to merge it today
afternoon.

@Lukey3332  
many thanks for your valuable contribution to ReaR!

Now since you implemented the basics for ARM support  
it should be relatively easy for other ARM users to  
enhance and adapt that to support more ARM devices.
