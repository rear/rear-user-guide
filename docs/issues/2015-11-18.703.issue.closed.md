Hello,

my first rear restore... i boot relax-and-recover from GRUB and it asks
for a Username and Password...

wonderful.... i never set one... never read about this in the docs

Which credentials are they asking for?

i have tried rearadmin/REAR;REAR/REAR; root/REAR; admin/REAR;
root/recovery; root/

no option is correct...

regards

hi, if it is grub that asks you for password, default one is "SECRET"

default user/password seems to be rearadmin/REAR but its not working...

i already tried to change them in local.conf..

...without success can not pass the passwort protection in GRUB...

my config:  
BACKUP=NETFS  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
OUTPUT=USB  
GRUB\_RESCUE=y  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD="REAR"  
GRUB\_SUPERUSER="root"

ok, it took me a while to figure it out.  
Problem is that **GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD** needs to be set hashed. (as
password\_pbkdf2 option is in use)  
Means that you should use should create hash from password:

grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
====================

Enter password:  
Reenter password:  
Your PBKDF2 is
grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.F876269F3E0A87C3F8820643C210C4A090CA1E57E013A089EF69101B211940B3EBDA67B3850BA74C95A05FD44C3C5D19F0614AAF64659D4609B8E7F2D755D32C.1B8F56B392C7381CED82B46AB79E5F6A2F6F86ADD7B3D9B6034522DDF8B46913F70C45AA64ED3AE66F54760673D1CF36049660265ACC220F2B5C48487784ED5A

And use this output as feed for GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD, so the final
output would look something like this:

> GRUB\_RESCUE=y  
> GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD="grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.26A20D64CFF7668AC6D6A8E98F2EB960E1F7CBE4E7E128C1A2C77801860FB1377020CD3109FBE3CC841FAC8BB7D09B5B51FDE9DDD39507DE741716E97D77C6FC.352F331A65F1665315F8639A94E994248A3EA5D618671DBD6C44787C6217249675F5E6AB3A80F95914A1AF046645C6E5811D73EC5D34D3D2FAFFEA55B9E40DD4"  
> GRUB\_SUPERUSER="root"\`

Hope it helps ...

Hi,  
i am opening this issue again, because i think it is not solved.

Today i wrote a config file like this /etc/rear/site.conf:

> OUTPUT=USB  
> BACKUP\_PROG=rsync  
> BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( '/dev/*' '/proc/*' '/sys/*' '/tmp/*' '/run/*'
> '/mnt/*' '/media/\*' '/lost+found' )  
> BACKUP=NETFS  
> BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( '/' )  
> MANUAL\_INCLUDE=YES  
> BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
> GRUB\_RESCUE=1

When the backup finished i found a modified /boot/grub/grub.cfg and a
new entry /etc/grub.d/01\_users.

When i booted my computer **ALL** menu entries in the grub menu were
protected with "username" and "password". When i tried to access an
entry with username "rearadmin" and password "REAR" i get the message

> Failed to boot both default and fallback entries.

Therefore i cannot acces any of the different os entries in my system!

Booting with a rescue CD and removing /etc/grub.d/01\_users and
restoring the backup copy /boot/grub/grub.cfg.old to grub.cfg didn't
help. (Because of a different os on the CD i couldn't chroot and run
grub-config).

When i read
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords)
i get the impression that something is wrong with the line

> password\_pbkdf2 rearadmin REAR

in /etc/grub.d/01\_users (it should be an encrypted passwod).

What can I do to get access to my computer again??

@firsttris  
can you tell us why you need that GRUB\_RESCUE functionality?

In short:  
Currently we are thinking about if we perhaps better

@gozora  
did you ever successfully use the GRUB\_RESCUE functionality

I ask because for me it did not at all work on SLE12.

@jsmeix well, some time has passed, so I don't really remember, but I
guess that it worked fine for me...  
I can do tests again if you want...  
@shoodle can you share information like, what OS and ReaR version are
you using? Is the only problem here that you can't boot rescue image
because it is protected by password?

As far as I understand

therein the items

<pre>
Recovery from USB
Rescue system

are all separated "Usage scenarios".

In particular as far as I understand it  
for "Recovery from USB" you do not need  
that locally installed "Rescue system" via GRUB\_RESCUE.

Quite strange, when I setup similar config:

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    EXCLUDE_MD=( $(grep -o -E '^md[0-9]+' /proc/mdstat) ) # exclude all md devices
    GRUB_RESCUE=1
    COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /sbin/sysctl /etc/sysctl.conf /sbin/vconfig /sbin/if* /etc/sysconfig/network /sbin/shutdown.wrap )

I was stopped by following piece of
[code](https://github.com/rear/rear/blame/fa2e33dd49b6bc2fe17a7f34a99d23b5b71389e0/usr/share/rear/output/default/94_grub2_rescue.sh#L68),
telling me:

`Message: GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD needs to be set. Run grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 to generate pbkdf2 hash`

Here I start to have problems with logic. because couple of lines above
this code I read condition like this:

`if is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER ; then ...`

What is the purpose to check if GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD is set ONLY when
using UEFI? Or do I read it wrong?

BTW when I set **GRUB\_RESCUE=1** and used **GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD**
hence allow ReaR to modify my grub.cfg, only grub entry protected with
password was that created by rear.

Unfortunately (most probably) systemd started to play tricks on me and
for some reason avoided me to create another backup :-/ (most probably
some race condition when discovering USB devices), so I have to solve
this first before I continue to investigate this further...

This looks to be bigger than I've expected so I need to get a beer or
two and think about it a bit.  
I'll report back with findings soon.

P.S. all tests have been done on **CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511
(Core)** with UEFI enabled

Yes, Vladimir you read it wrong! The condition was closed couple of
lines before ;-), You should read code more carefully next time ...

@gozora  
The "GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD needs to be set ..." message  
is from older code where I also had issues with,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/938\#issuecomment-234899163](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/938#issuecomment-234899163)

My current code for 94\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
works much better for me (on SLES12-SP1).

Now it supports to set GRUB2 password only optionally  
and additionally one can (also optionally) use an existing  
GRUB2 user via GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER without the need  
to let rear create a GRUB2 superuser.

I would very much appreciate if if you test it with my  
current code in

I've made my life easier and switched (after long time) to legacy boot
as well. I've done testing on **CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511
(Core)**.  
First and only problem I've encounter was that *grub2 menuentry
"Relax-and-Recover"* did not boot because wrong path to initrd and
kernel.

ReaR created:

    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid  --set=root c3e2e7b1-2849-4797-a4ee-b2923c157e7c
    linux  /boot/rear-kernel  selinux=0
    initrd /boot/rear-initrd.cgz

but only following worked:

    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid  --set=root c3e2e7b1-2849-4797-a4ee-b2923c157e7c
    linux  /rear-kernel  selinux=0
    initrd /rear-initrd.cgz

I was thinking how to determine correct boot entries/paths for all
possible distros and come to conclusion that maybe we could copy it from
existing grug.cfg. Something like

`grep -E initrd|kernel /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | sed awk parse hell whatever we need to know ...`

What do you think?

To my opinion more severe thing is that once user sets
**GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD** and **GRUB\_SUPERUSER** it will never change
in actual grub.cfg configuration until */etc/grub.d/01\_users* exists.
(hope I've understood code right this time ;-) ).  
This can be quite confusing.

Didn't you think about removing condition (on line 106 of
94\_grub2\_rescue.sh)  
`if [[ ! -f $grub_users_file ]] ; then`  
so that grub use and password is changed every time?

Seems to be again a nice mess how GRUB 2 works  
on different Linux distributions.

On my SLES12-SP1 "linux /rear-kernel" and "initrd /rear-initrd.cgz"  
just failed to boot so that I changed it to the absolute path  
where the files actually are in the system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942\#issuecomment-234944705](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#issuecomment-234944705)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/938\#issuecomment-234929757](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/938#issuecomment-234929757)

In contrast this does not work on CentOS.

Currently I don't know how to fix such Linux distribution mess  
so that it works in a generic way on all Linux distributions.

Regarding the GRUB 2 password protection,  
see my comments in default.conf and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942\#issuecomment-235262557](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#issuecomment-235262557)

My general problem with the GRUB 2 password protection stuff  
is that I do not want that rear behaves as if it was the ultimate  
master of the whole GRUB 2 configuration.

The whole GRUB 2 password protection setup in rear is  
already scaring enough because it can change how other  
GRUB 2 boot entries behave (at least on SLE12)  
because it does general changes of the whole GRUB 2  
configuration - in particular with GRUB\_SUPERUSER  
rear creates a new GRUB 2 superuser which is a general  
change of the whole GRUB 2 configuration.

The more I think about the GRUB 2 password protection setup  
in rear the less I like it at all.

Perhaps I should completely remove that scaring part of the  
GRUB\_RESCUE setup.  
This would keep things simple and straightforward (KISS)  
because such a simplified GRUB\_RESCUE setup  
would only add the one more GRUB 2 menue entry and  
leaves the rest of the GRUB 2 configuration unchanged.

If a user wants GRUB 2 password protection  
he can do that on his own as he likes and needs it.  
I think there is no real need that rear does that.  
I think GRUB 2 password protection setup in the  
currently running system is really not at all an  
expected native functionality of rear.

I was thinking of a function that would discover correct values from
current boot loader setting, as that looks to be most precise way how to
get correct boot data.  
I'll start to work on it hopefully today.

I share your opinion here. however this could be applied to ReaR grub
entry it self. "if a user wants GRUB 2 ReaR entry, he can do that on his
own as he likes and needs it" ;-)  
But I agree that **GRUB\_RESCUE** option might be convenient in some
cases.

I think what actually causes pain with the current  
GRUB 2 password protection setup in rear  
is the GRUB\_SUPERUSER setup because that  
changes how GRUB 2 as a whole behaves.

I think what is o.k. is my new GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER  
setup because that (plus a GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD) only  
adds a password\_pbkdf2 line to the 'Relax-and-Recover' entry  
but it does not change the general GRUB 2 configuration  
(in particular it does not change what GRUB 2 users  
or superuser exists).

I think I will remove GRUB\_SUPERUSER setup  
from rear and keep GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER plus  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD setup support in rear  
so that the user can have GRUB 2 password protection  
for the 'Relax-and-Recover' entry provided he already  
has a GRUB 2 user or superuser.

@gozora  
regarding correct values for boot loader setting,  
see what @gdha asked in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942\#discussion-diff-72051269](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942#discussion-diff-72051269)

<pre>
are you sure /boot is required?
Does the --set=root not fulfil this?
Just want to double check (I could be wrong).
</pre>

I am not a sufficient GRUB 2 setup expert to know  
what the best way is so that it works generically  
on all Linux distributions.

I guess the less special GRUB 2 automatisms are used  
the more reliable it could (hopefully) work everywhere?

@jsmeix I'm not grub expert neither, but I think that this is the only
prerequisite you need to become one :-).  
Like I said, I'll try to put something together and then we can discuss
whether is can be useful for the future or not.

Guess what - I use fixing the GRUB\_RESCUE stuff  
as an opportunity to learn a bit how to deal  
with GRUB 2 issues in rear ;-)

With the now merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
I consider this issue here as sufficiently solved.

Note that with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/942)  
the whole GRUB\_RESCUE feature for GRUB2  
was completely overhauled.

I made GRUB\_RESCUE work for GRUB2  
on SUSE and Red Hat based Linux distributions.

The former GRUB2 superuser setup support in rear  
via GRUB\_SUPERUSER is dropped and also  
the former GRUB2 password setup support  
in rear via GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD is dropped.  
Both kind of setup can change the behaviour  
of the GRUB2 bootloader as a whole in unexpected  
ways but rear is not meant to change the general  
GRUB2 configuration of the currently running system.  
It should work by default reasonably backward compatible  
when formerly a GRUB\_SUPERUSER was used.

Now the optional GRUB2 password protection  
only works via the new GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER setting.  
It must specify an already configured GRUB2 user  
except the special value 'unrestricted' is set  
via GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER="unrestricted"  
which creates the 'Relax-and-Recover' GRUB2  
menue entry so that it can be booted by anyone.

For more details see the description in default.conf

@gozora  
regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703\#issuecomment-235515034](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-235515034)  
"discover correct values from current boot loader setting":

At least for now this is not needed because in  
output/default/94\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
I use now different values for 'linux' and 'initrd'  
depending on the Linux distribution.

This is of course not the preferred generic solution  
but probably it is "good enough for now".

@jsmeix The above was not yet added to any kind of documentation except
for the default.conf file, right?

@gdha  
I assume with "The above" you mean  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703\#issuecomment-235887700](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/703#issuecomment-235887700)

Don't worry about documentation regarding "GRUB\_RESCUE" ;-)  
It never was documented except in default.conf.  
Accordingly I documented my changes only in default.conf.

And for GRUB2 my code informs the user about the changes,  
see output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh

<pre>
    # Report no longer supported GRUB 2 superuser setup if GRUB_SUPERUSER is non-empty
    # (be prepared for 'set -u' by specifying an empty fallback value if GRUB_SUPERUSER is not set):
    test ${GRUB_SUPERUSER:-} && LogPrint "Skipping GRUB 2 superuser setup: GRUB_SUPERUSER is no longer supported (see default.conf)."
    # Report no longer supported GRUB 2 password setup if GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is non-empty
    # (be prepared for 'set -u' by specifying an empty fallback value if GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is not set):
    test ${GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD:-} && LogPrint "Skipping GRUB 2 password setup: GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD is no longer supported (see default.conf)."
</pre>

I did not change anything regarding "GRUB\_RESCUE"  
for GRUB Legacy because I never tested it with GRUB Legacy.
