-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Fedora 30

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    `REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" /home/test/Downloads/borg-linux64 )`

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): UEFI

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

If `rear mkrescue` has been run, `rear checklayout ; echo $?` is
non-zero indicating a layout change if a USB external drive is mounted
which was not present at the prior run of `rear mkrescue`.

After the USB drive is unmounted, `rear checklayout ; echo $?` is zero
again.

This is bad especially when `rear checklayout || rear mkrescue` is
scheduled to run automatically (cron or systemd timer), or even if it's
just run manually while a USB drive happens to be mounted.

This creates concern and confusion when `rear recover` notes that the
device corresponding to the USB drive, `/dev/sdb` in this case, does not
have a suitable target.

It works as designed.

ReaR takes all mounted normal filesystems into account  
so when there are changes in what is mounted, the disk layout has
changed.

In that case, is it possible to specify to ReaR not to monitor certain
directories, eg. common mount points?

Actually, does it even have to be mounted or does anything in `fdisk -l`
get considered by ReaR?

The use case must be common enough, yes? Does it make sense to create a
new (incorrect) disk layout if a USB key/drive is plugged in? The result
becomes unpredictable, especially if `rear mkrescue` is run on a
schedule.
