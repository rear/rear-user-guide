@gdha many thanks that you had a look at it.

I will ehnace it a bit and then I self-accept it.

I really need and gratefully appreciate it when I get feedback from
other rear authors and/or users whether or not my addons or changes at
least make sense in general.

I have tested the enhanced move away functionality so that also a whole
directory tee can be moved away by using in /etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /var/tmp /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )
</pre>

and for me everything "just works".
