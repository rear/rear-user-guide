-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Now build/GNU/Linux/630\_verify\_resolv\_conf\_file.sh does no
    longer error out  
    when etc/resolv.conf has no nameserver or only loopback addresses  
    and USE\_DHCLIENT has a true value  
    (and USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING does not have a true value)  
    because then etc/resolv.conf in the recovery system  
    is generated anew by /bin/dhclient-script  
    so that its content before does not matter.

@OliverO2 @rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to "just merge" it today
afternoon.

@jsmeix As noted here
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2018\#issuecomment-471499805](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2018#issuecomment-471499805),
this change would still require configuration change to resolve the
issue. With this change, I would have the option of setting

-   `USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"`, or
-   `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"`

while ReaR was working without any network-related configuration before.

@OliverO2  
do you perhaps use DHCP on your original system  
and that gets detected by "rear mkrescue" so that  
you also get networking setup via DHCP in the recovery system?

Could you run `rear -D mkrescue` without `USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"`  
and `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` and attach the debug log file?  
I would like to see what goes on in your particular case.

@jsmeix Yes, as I've written elsewhere, I use DHCP, and I've briefly
checked that this is what happens:

    2019-03-11 13:30:43.525267622 Including prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh
    2019-03-11 13:30:43.536177518 Running DHCP client found, enabling USE_DHCLIENT

I'm sorry, it was my understanding that this PR would only work if
`USE_DHCLIENT` were set in the local configuration. As it now looks like
that it would work with the above auto-setting of `USE_DHCLIENT`, it
would resolve the case. I'll test that and report. (I'm a bit reluctant
about posting debug logs because of sensitive information and I'm a bit
short on available time this month.)

As far as I could find out  
prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh  
is the only place where ReaR automatically determines  
to use DHCP for networking setup in the recovery system  
and if DHCP should be used it sets `USE_DHCLIENT=y`  
via its dhcp\_interfaces\_active() function.

As far as I understand networking setup in the recovery system  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
is the only recovery system setup script that dals with DHCP  
and that script tests for USE\_DHCLIENT being non-empty.

Accordingly I can currently not see how DHCP could be used  
for networking setup in the recovery system without `USE_DHCLIENT=y`  
so that I can currently not see how this pull request that does no
longer  
error out if `is_true "$USE_DHCLIENT"` could still error out when  
DHCP is used on the original system...

@OliverO2  
ah! - right now I noticed your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2076\#issuecomment-471538771](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2076#issuecomment-471538771)  
which matches my investigation result in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2076\#issuecomment-471540880](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2076#issuecomment-471540880)  
so that I also think this pull request should make it "just work"
again  
when DHCP is used on the original system.

For the "fun" of it:  
On my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system I also use DHCP  
but SUSE uses it's own kind of networking setup tool:

    # ps -e | grep -Es 'dhc'
    ... wickedd-dhcp4
    ... wickedd-dhcp6

that is rightfully not detected by define\_dhclients\_variable() in  
prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh - rightfully because  
we do not have Wicked support in ReaR, cf.

@jsmeix I have just tested it and can confirm that the rescue system
generated from an auto-detected DHCP configuration on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
now works out of the box (i.e. no additional configuration required).
Thank you, well done!

@OliverO2  
I have to thank you because your testing and your information  
made me better understand how nameserver setup works in  
the recovery system so that I could improve things.  
Now we have (hopefully) a better behaviour in this area  
where things work by explicit code (and not in a somehow  
vague and obscure looking way which at least looked to me  
as if things had worked before more by luck than by intention).
