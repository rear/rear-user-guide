-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hi, I'm new here.  
It's about SLES 12.3 with security patches. I'd like to know if rescue
would work with "tar" (for the beginning) system backup. It's only
system on it - no APP/DB.

    > rear -v -d mkbackup
     echo $? -0

    > rear -D recover
    Results with:

So, it is not booting now.  
Is it restorable in any way or the only thing I can do is reinstall the
system?

-   Workaround, if any:  
    No.

    hope file isn't broken)

Reading log file I found sth crucial:

My question is still current. Is it possible to restore?

@asamapsa  
your /etc/rear/local.conf does not look as if you had used  
one of our example config files for the special SLES12 btrfs structure  
as template for your /etc/rear/local.conf:

    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf
    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf
    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf

e.g. those files online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)

Cf. the "Disaster Recovery with Relax-and-Recover" chapter  
in our "High Availability Administration Guide" for  
SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 12  
that is also online available at  
[https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-12/book\_sleha/data/cha\_ha\_rear.html](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-12/book_sleha/data/cha_ha_rear.html)

In general see

FWIW:

    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=2

may not work as you might guess - you need to read the documentation  
how each config variable actually works:

In general see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
or in this particular case read the section  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Relax-and-Recover\_versus\_backup\_and\_restore](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore)
