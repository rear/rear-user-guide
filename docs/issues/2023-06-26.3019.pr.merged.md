Those `'Code scanning / Shellcheck (reported by Codacy)`  
are from Codacy, cf.

    ... it seems that Codacy simply calls plain 'shellcheck' ...

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it today afternoon  
unless objections appear.

FYI regarding ShellCheck:  
Our own "Differential ShellCheck" (which is deliberately set up  
exactly as currently needed in ReaR) does not report issues.

Yes, please merge. Can we disable those extra shellcheck errors from
Codacy?
