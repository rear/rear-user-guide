-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

after cloned and moved to ReaR folder, i did a format to my usb stick
(128gb, usb 3.1) using `sudo usr/sbin/rear format /dev/sde1`, the
terminal stuck after i typed **Yes** then press **Enter**. I use
`watch -n 0.1 iostat` to check if ReaR formatting my usb or not, yes it
is formatting to ext3 but the speed is very low, only ~170 kb/s, is
there anyway to speed up the speed of formatting? Currently i don't have
any spare usb stick so i used 128gb which to stored data but with this
rate must take days for it to complete, and i don't want to interupt the
formatting process cause could break my usb.

-   Workaround, if any: no

ReaR calls the usual tools to set up partitioning (with 'parted')  
and filesystems setup (with 'mkfs...') on the USB disk, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300_format_usb_disk.sh)

So things work as fast or slow as those tools do  
or more precisely as the USB disk and its USB connection hardware  
and the associated kernel drivers do.

In general regarding USB speed:

Nowadays there are basically three different kind of USB connectors:

-   USB 1.0 and USB 1.1 with so called "Low Speed" and "Full Speed" (USB
    kernel driver uhci\_hcd or ohci\_hcd)
-   USB 2.0 with so called "Hi-Speed" (USB kernel driver ehci\_hcd)
-   USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 with so called "SuperSpeed" and "SuperSpeed+"
    (USB kernel driver xhci\_hcd)

Neither the color of the USB connector nor what it is labeled on the
computer  
is reliable regarding what kernel driver is used for a USB port.  
Only the "lsusb -t" output shows what kernel driver is used.  
What USB kernel driver is used depends on what USB hardware there is in
the computer.

This is what i got from **lsusb -t**  
`/:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/8p, 5000M`  
`|__ Port 1: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Mass Storage, Driver=usb-storage, 5000M`  
That mean my usb port support either 3.0 and 3.1 right? But my usb stick
's kernel driver is usb-storage so i'm kinda confusing

Hello,

I have the same issue as @XXLC

I am also using v2.6 of rear

OS is Ubuntu 22.04

lusb - t  
produces no output?

I would like to identify a way to improve the speed of the formatting.

Is there a quickformat option for instance?

With Windows you can select quickformat, which does not scan the target
disk for bad sectors and is many times quicker than a "standard" format.

Same issue here.

Formatting a 6 TB USB 3.0 HDD with  
`$ sudo rear -v -d -D format -- -f -y /dev/sdd`  
it takes 3 days without finalization in the line  
**Creating ext3 filesystem with label 'REAR-000' on ReaR data partition
/dev/sdd3**

Adding '-v' to the 3 related lines in '300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh' does
not bring any more information.

It also seems, that ReaR does not handle a fresh HDD correctly.
Partitioning only works, if I create a GPT partition table manually
first.

PS: Update: Formatting the disk with "gparted" takes 30 minutes. But I
did not manage to create a functional and bootable layout like the CLI
command above.

So probably these options could be set with the

It's an specific entry for a dedicated USB device '152d:0578' wich works
better without UAS.  
Unfortunatelly, most SATA2USB adapters from JMicron have this problem.  
It's not device capacity specific and works with small and big HDD/SSDs,
because it depends on the USB controller chip.
