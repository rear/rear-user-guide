##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): closes \#2781

-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   recovery using `OUTPUT=USB` `BACKUP=RSYNC` with a
        `rsync://...:/...` (rsync over ssh) and `rsync://...::/...`
        (rsyncd) `BACKUP_URL`
    -   recovery using `OUTPUT=ISO` `BACKUP=RSYNC` with a
        `rsync://...:/...` (rsync over ssh) `BACKUP_URL` and three
        values of `OUTPUT_URL`: `rsync://...:/...` (rsync over ssh) but
        different from `BACKUP_URL`, `rsync://...::/...` (rsyncd), and
        undefined (to inherit `BACKUP_URL`). Verified that the output
        ISO is found at the right places on the rsync server.
    -   mkrescue and mkbackuponly to localhost with a `rsync://...:/...`
        (rsync over ssh) `BACKUP_URL` and `OUTPUT_URL`, the latter
        pointing to a different directory than the former. Verified that
        after `mkrescue` the ISO is under `OUTPUT_URL` and not
        `BACKUP_URL`.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The code to parse `rsync://` URLs was `BACKUP_URL` specific.  
If one specified `BACKUP=RSYNC` and an `OUTPUT_URL` different from
`BACKUP_URL`,  
the `OUTPUT_URL` was ignored and the output files went to `BACKUP_URL`.

Fix by introducing generic functions for rsync URL parsing and  
use them for both `BACKUP_URL` and `OUTPUT_URL`, as appropriate.  
Replace all uses of global RSYNC\_\* variables derived  
from `BACKUP_URL` by those functions.

@pcahyna  
thank you very much for that major cleanup!

Could you please provide me a summary of the advantages  
but also the possibly backward incompatible changes  
that could happen because of this cleanup?

I would like to add that summary to the  
"New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible
changes"  
section in the ReaR 2.7 release notes which are currently at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/jsmeix-release-notes-2-7/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/jsmeix-release-notes-2-7/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md)

During the work on this PR I have found many other anomalies in the
rsync code, most of them are left untouched.

-   the handling of `rsync` output URL scheme is under RSYNC
    ([https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default)),
    which is a backup method, despite the output URL being in principle
    independent from backup method. This leads to different code being
    executed for `OUTPUT_URL=rsync://` depending on whether
    `BACKUP=RSYNC` or not. (If not, the output is handled in
    `950_copy_result_files.sh`, which seems to handle the URL
    differently:
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh\#L131](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh#L131)
    )
    -   as a consequence, if `BACKUP=RSYNC`, the structure of the output
        files at a `rsync://` location is different. In other cases,
        `RSYNC_PREFIX` is not respected, but in case of `BACKUP=RSYNC`,
        `RSYNC_PREFIX` is respected. See
        [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781\#issuecomment-1160172273](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781#issuecomment-1160172273)
        for details.
-   Creation of the `backup` prefix directory happens in the `output`
    stage
    ([https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh\#L6](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/200_make_prefix_dir.sh#L6)).
    If `backup` is executed without `output` (by running
    `rear mkbackuponly`), it crashes, because the prefix directory does
    not exist. (This one is fixed in the PR.)
-   `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS` inconsistencies between rsync-over-ssh and
    rsyncd cases. For rsyncd, they are always added to rsync options,
    for ssh only when creating the backup. The former actually leads to
    a bug, where `--relative` gets added to `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS` and
    then `.autorelabel` becomes a directory (in
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/GNU/Linux/620\_force\_autorelabel.sh\#L25](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/GNU/Linux/620_force_autorelabel.sh#L25)),
    leading to selinux relabeling not working (I had to fix SELinux
    manually in my tests).
-   Some places seem to assume ssh access unconditionally, especially
    500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh (see the `check_remote_df`,
    `check_remote_du` functions). One instance of similar code got
    removed in \#2797.
-   There is detection of xattr support on the remote server (using ssh
    access)
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/default/150\_check\_rsync\_protocol\_version.sh\#L43](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/8b8ad86c71eaea0ad03d64f5892e3f37d797a5e0/usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/default/150_check_rsync_protocol_version.sh#L43),
    but this does not seem to work: in
    `cd ${path} && touch .is_xattr_supported && setfattr -n user.comment -v 'File created by ReaR to test if this filesystems suppor extended attributes.' .is_xattr_supported && getfattr -n user.comment .is_xattr_supported 1>/dev/null; find .is_xattr_supported -empty -delete`,
    the last `find` clobbers the exit status.

I suppose you are interested in changes since 2.6, that is this change
and the change that triggered \#2781 combined. Ok, I will provide a
summary.

@jsmeix "Rsync OUTPUT\_URLs are now properly supported with
`BACKUP=RSYNC`. Previously the output went to the location specified by
`BACKUP_URL` and `OUTPUT_URL` was ignored. One exception was
`OUTPUT=PXE`, where the output was uploaded to `OUTPUT_URL` in addition
to `BACKUP_URL`, but `RSYNC_PREFIX` was not respected and the
interpretation of the URL was different - an URL of the form
`rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH` was interpreted as using the rsync
protocol, while in all other cases such URL would be interpreted as
using rsync over ssh. This special handling is now removed - a rsync
`OUTPUT_URL` with `OUTPUT=PXE` now creates the `RSYNC_PREFIX` directory
at the destination and the URL is interpreted as in all other cases. "

Does it make sense? I know it is complicated. Too many special cases,
fortunately it is about removing some of them...

@didacog  
I will act for now here for @pcahyna  
until he has again time to look here  
but I am neither a PXE user nor a rsync user  
so I can not at all imagine what you have  
in your etc/rear/local.conf

Therefore please provide here sufficient information  
that I have at least a chance to understand your issue  
in particular your complete etc/rear/local.conf  
and your complete etc/rear/site.conf if you use one.  
I need the actual ReaR config files because  
I am not a DRLM user so DRLM config files are "foreign" for me.  
Additionally I need a complete ReaR debugscript log file  
to have a chance to deduce what happens on your system.

Only FYI:  
I want to release ReaR 2.7 on the date specified on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones)  
because I already postponed it rather often and  
I can't wait endlessly until every issue is solved  
because I am under increasing pressure to release  
a new ReaR version (regardless if it is perfect or not).  
For SUSE I could fix missing things relatively easy  
by SUSE maintenance updates for our SLE-HA customers  
and I assume it is same for Red Hat for RHEL customers.  
Other users could use our latest master code.

Regarding OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE I see no difference between  
the changed code here and the master code:

    Files /tmp/OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE.rear.github.master and /tmp/OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE.pcahyna.rsync-url-fix-refactor are identical

@jsmeix  
I just figured it out because of this comment:

    This special handling is now removed - a rsync OUTPUT_URL with OUTPUT=PXE now creates the RSYNC_PREFIX directory at the destination and the URL is interpreted as in all other cases. "

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@jsmeix  
I understand, but I think this regression should be fixed before
releasing, or at least an agreement on how to solve it. Before any
change ReaR always created the PXE subfolder in the URL path, and is
important for security reasons. I'm sure nobody wants to share data over
tftp because backup and pxe outputs are in the same place ...  
Hopefully we can solve this before July 12th.

Regards,  
Didac

@jsmeix still here... I don't think that `OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE` is the
problem (it had no special handling in the old code indeed, so it should
not need one now), but there is something else going on.

I have a plan how to proceed with this issue:

I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections from @pcahyna or @rear/contributors

My reasoning:  
In its current state it is another good step forward  
towards cleaned up rsync code in ReaR.  
And when it is merged it is simpler and easier to get tested  
by all users who use our current GitHub master code.

Remaining issues because of our rsync code cleanup in ReaR  
can and will be fixed via separated pull requests.

In general regarding BACKUP=... versus OUTPUT=... :

The final goal should be that consistently and in general  
for all combinations of internal BACKUP methods and OUTPUT methods  
that are specified in etc/rear/local.conf like

    OUTPUT=output_method
    OUTPUT_URL=output_scheme://output/destination
    BACKUP=backup_method
    BACKUP_URL=backup_scheme://backup/destination

the RESULT\_FILES (i.e. the ReaR recovery system files)  
get sent to the output/destination  
via the output\_scheme protocol  
and  
the backup files (e.g. backup.tar.gz and backup.log)  
get sent to the backup/destination  
via the backup\_scheme protocol.

Optionally (but not strictly required)  
at most one of OUTPUT\_URL or BACKUP\_URL could be left out  
and then the one that is specified determines both.

For example the usual way like

    OUTPUT=output_method
    BACKUP=backup_method
    BACKUP_URL=backup_scheme://backup/destination

the RESULT\_FILES (i.e. the ReaR recovery system files)  
get sent to the backup/destination  
via the backup\_scheme protocol  
and  
the backup files (e.g. backup.tar.gz and backup.log)  
get sent to the backup/destination  
via the backup\_scheme protocol.

But also the other way round should work like

    OUTPUT=output_method
    OUTPUT_URL=output_scheme://output/destination
    BACKUP=backup_method

the RESULT\_FILES (i.e. the ReaR recovery system files)  
get sent to the output/destination  
via the output\_scheme protocol  
and  
the backup files (e.g. backup.tar.gz and backup.log)  
get sent to the output/destination  
via the output\_scheme protocol.

External BACKUP methods can behave as they like  
(i.e. whatever is reasonable for each particular external BACKUP
method).

@jsmeix yes, I agree, the problem is that the current code has special
output URL handling for `BACKUP=RSYNC`, which is inconsistent, since
output should be independent on backup. See

[https://github.com/pcahyna/rear/blob/5cb10407d08e0d923219c9b013d420a4b632843f/usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh\#L132](https://github.com/pcahyna/rear/blob/5cb10407d08e0d923219c9b013d420a4b632843f/usr/share/rear/output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh#L132)

This pull request makes the code respect `OUTPUT_URL` if it is not
identical to `BACKUP_URL`, but does not remove this special handling.
Should it be removed entirely before 2.7 ? Would be good for
consistency, but it would mean more changes and more testing (and also
behavior changes).

@pcahyna  
I would prefer to not add new bigger changes for ReaR 2.7  
so we could finally release it "as is" - even when 'rsync'  
is currently not yet well cleaned up - but we also have some  
more areas where current things in ReaR are not yet clean  
(e.g. OUTPUT=USB and ReaR recovery system bootloader setup)  
but nevertheless the current state should be sufficiently OK  
to be released.

By the way only as a side note FYI see my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2577\#issuecomment-789696867](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2577#issuecomment-789696867)  
and the subsequent comment there  
which looks like an inconsistency to me.

I think there should not be two subtle different methods  
in ReaR to do the backup via rsync and I still do not understand  
the reason behind why there are two different implementations  
in ReaR to do the backup via rsync - this all is too confusing.

@jsmeix I understand, the only advantage would be to make all related
behavior changes at the same time, so that users would not have to adapt
their workflows/configs multiple times.

Normally users would not have to adapt their workflows/configs multiple
times  
because when a user has a working disaster recovery procedure with
ReaR,  
then he should not update ReaR ("never change a working system").  
In contrast when things do not work sufficiently with an older ReaR
version,  
then the user should try out if a newer ReaR version works better.  
Cf. the section "Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

So we can move forward little step by little step  
together with users who test each little step  
which is the only way we can move forward  
with our manpower at ReaR upstream.

Indeed, that has been very confusing to me as well, but it is yet a
different kind of confusion than the one here. (And I have thought that
the `BACKUP=NETFS` and `BACKUP_PROG=rsync` does not use rsync over ssh,
but local rsync to a mounted filesystem, which makes more sense: the
rsync invocation reads

    $BACKUP_PROG --verbose "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" --one-file-system --delete \
                --exclude-from=$TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt --delete-excluded \
                $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) "$backuparchive" >&2

and `$backuparchive` does not contain anything ssh-transport-related. )

@pcahyna  
for the fun of it:  
It's a great relief to me to see that also you and @gdha seem to be
confused  
what BACKUP=NETFS with BACKUP\_PROG=rsync versus BACKUP=RSYNC actually
does  
so I feel less lonely with my own confusion :-)

@didacog  
thank you for debugging and for your fix!

Of course I will wait now until @pcahyna had a look.

So I will not merge it this week.  
Perhaps next week if all goes well  
(I am not in the office tomorrow).

@pcahyna  
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I think I can feel the "URI/URL parsing hell" a bit ;-)  
I was in there when I cleaned up the url\_\* functions :-)  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/856](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/856)

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781\#issuecomment-1180233302](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781#issuecomment-1180233302)  
the issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781)  
is fixed with the latest commit here

By the way, I tested the code after the last commit again by backing
up/recovering to/from a `rsync://` BACKUP\_URL (only rsync over ssh was
tested though) and several possibilities for OUTPUT\_URL. All the tests
pass.
