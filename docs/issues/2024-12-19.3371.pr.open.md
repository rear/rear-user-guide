-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Do not remove dotfiles from the release archive. Avoids dropping
    .vimrc from /root of the rescue ramdisk. This also adds
    .shellcheckrc to the release tarballs, so package builds using
    static analyzers (OpenScanHub) will know what ShellCheck warnings to
    ignore.
