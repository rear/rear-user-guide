Treat missing additional config files (almost) same  
as other missing config files which means that  
missing additional config files do not let ReaR  
abort with an Error but in contrast to other missing  
config files missing additional config files are reported  
to the user via 'LogPrint' so that the user is at least informed  
if what he requested via the '-C' command line option cannot  
be fulfilled.

An intended positive side-effect when missing additional  
config files are no Error is that then it also works  
(not relly cleanly but it works) for DRLM\_MANAGED=y  
which requires that missing local config files must  
not let ReaR abort with an Error because the needed  
config files get later downloaded from the DRLM server  
and applied  
(cf. the drlm\_import\_runtime\_config function in
lib/drlm-functions.sh)
