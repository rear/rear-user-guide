I am trying to setup a PXE server that install iso images. I am able to
boot from the rear iso image but when I run "rear -recover' I get the
following error

ERROR: Mount command ' mount /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
/tmp/rear.3VfUk3o4SRmKTE/outputfs' failed.

The /dev/disk/by-label directory is empty.

Any help would be appreciated.

could you post the `local.conf` file please? I don't understand the
meaning a PXE server that install ISO images? If you're using PXE to
boot from then you don't need ISO images.

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs:/172.16.10.10/srv/tftpboot

We are setting up a disaster recovery site. So we will have many
customers restoring their linux servers to our servers. We are trying to
setup a Ubuntu PXE server that we can copy the iso images created by
rear at our customers site onto our DR server and then clone our server
to look like theres. If I burn the ISO image to a dvd, I can load the
image and everything is fine. If I copy the ISO image to our ubuntu
server I can boot from the image but get the error when we try to run
rear -recover from the Rescue prompt.

Not sure if this will work but we thought we would work on it in the lab

Well, if you boot ReaR over PXE but set the backup to come from a
locally  
inserted ISO media then obviously the recovery won't work.

Why not use a network-based backup method? iso:// really means "I want
to  
insert the backup media into my server" and nothing else.

I am imaging a HP Proliant server with Red Hat 5.8. I mount the rear iso
image that I created on another server using the virtual media on the
iLo interface. I am able to boot from the ISO but when it tries to mount
the netfs backup it fails. I think it is trying to use the internal dvd
rather than the virtual media. Any ideas?

That might be the case. You'll need to provide logs, configs and cat  
/proc/scsi/scsi /proc/partitions and ls -lR /dev/disk

I found the issue. When I boot a RedHat 5.8 iso that I created, it does
not create the logical link in /dev/disk/by-label/ RELAXRECOVER to
/dev/sr0. If I create it manually the imaging works correctly.

When I boot a Red Hat 6.4 iso that I created, it does create the logical
link.

@gmoy could this be udevd related?
