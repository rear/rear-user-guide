New ReaR variables for controlling Borg behaviour:

-   BORGBACKUP\_CACHE\_DIR
-   BORGBACKUP\_RELOCATED\_REPO\_ACCESS\_IS\_OK
-   BORGBACKUP\_UNKNOWN\_UNENCRYPTED\_REPO\_ACCESS\_IS\_OK

I really appreciate variable names that actually explain  
what they do, even if it makes them very long.  
In case of doubt better (even annoyingly) long and explanatory  
than a bit too short and user issues when they misunderstand it.

@gozora  
many thanks for your continuous Borg Backup integration work!

@jsmeix  
Pleasure ;-)

Regarding
[comment](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702#issuecomment-255441289),
did you though about linking ReaR with borgbackup/community repo?

@gozora  
I wonder if in ReaR really separated variable names  
must be used when all what actually happens is

<pre>
export BORG_name=$BORGBACKUP_name
</pre>

Woudn't it be simpler and more straightforward to specify  
in ReaR the value for BORG\_name directly in such cases?

What I was aiming for was possibility for user to use BORG\_\* variables
from shell (for whatever reason) like
`BORG_REMOTE_PATH=/tmp/borg rear mkbackup` and not collide with ReaR
configuration.  
Such configuration looks more straightforward to me.

@jsmeix  
Ah printing interesting topic ;-)

I've created [this](https://github.com/gozora/community).

I can create pull request if you want ...

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-10-27 10:36](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1052#issuecomment-256606883):

I meant when rear (the running program) sets BORG\_\* variables  
directly then this should not collide with user's settings  
because BORG\_\* variables settings "inside" rear are  
independent from "outside" user's settings.

What not works with your approach is

<pre>
BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="n" rear mkbackup
</pre>

because you overwrite that with what is specified in default.conf

<pre>
BORGBACKUP_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="y"
</pre>

and the subsequent

<pre>
if [ ! -z $BORGBACKUP_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK ]; then
    export BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK=$BORGBACKUP_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK
    fi
</pre>

When what is specified in default.conf has precedence over  
existing user environment settings, then I think you can set  
BORG\_RELOCATED\_REPO\_ACCESS\_IS\_OK directly  
in default.conf.

From my current point of view using BORGBACKUP\_name  
for BORG\_name variables could be only a useless level  
of indirection (cf. RFC 1925 item 6a).

But I am not a Borg Backup user, so that I could be plain wrong.

Typo correction:  
I meant what not works with your approach is

<pre>
BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="n" rear mkbackup
</pre>

when there is in default.conf

<pre>
BORGBACKUP_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="y"

@jsmeix  
Variables you've took as an example are kind of special.  
They purpose is to give automatic reply to Borg during confirmation
dialog, hence they prevent your backup/restore to be temporarily
suspended. That was the reason why I've set defaults to accept ("y").  
(User can override then from shell if
`BORGBACKUP_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK=""` is set in *local.conf*, yes
agree that is stupid, but possible RFC 1925 point 3 :-)).

One more reason we have this indirection is
[discussion](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037/files/73b7be25b770cc762dce602e8178b837d9a4757b#r8387546).

In my opinion, this gives us more maneuvering space for mapping Borg
variables to ReaR and also have bigger control over certain aspects of
Borg behavior.

I would be grateful if you do the pull request  
for borgbackup/community

Regarding BORGBACKUP\_name versus BORG\_name:  
Feel free to implement it as it works best for you.  
Only a note FYI:  
I thought ReaR uses BORGBACKUP\_\* to keep ReaR's own  
stuff related to Borg Backup separated from Borg's own stuff.  
But in the above mentioned case BORGBACKUP\_name is only  
another name for BORG\_name and then I was thinking about  
why not using BORG\_name directly.

There are actually two types of Borg variables used in implementation:

1.  Variables passed to `borg` as parameter e.g.:  
    *BORGBACKUP\_REMOTE\_PATH*, *BORGBACKUP\_ENC\_TYPE* ...  
    These are used to build argument list for `borg`, and can't be
    passed as environment variables.  
    We had discussion about this group and changed prefix from
    BORG\_name -&gt; BORGBACKUP\_name
2.  Environment variables: e.g.:  
    BORGBACKUP\_CACHE\_DIR, BORGBACKUP\_KEYS\_DIR ..., which are read by
    `borg` as env variables.  
    This group was introduced later and I thought that it could be
    better to align naming conventions with first group, to avoid having
    both (BORG\_name and BORGBACKUP\_name) in default.conf.

This difference is what I mean.

Those under (1.) are from my point of view ReaR's  
own stuff that is only related to Borg Backup while  
those under (2.) are from my point of view Borg's own stuff.

My personal thinking is that Borg's own environment variables  
should be used directly like all other environment variables.

From my point of view it is correct to set and use in ReaR  
(e.g in default.conf, local.conf or in whatever ReaR script)  
environment variables directly with their original name, e.g.  
TMPDIR in default.conf (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968))  
or things like LC\_ALL and LANG in usr/sbin/rear and so on.

Ah, maybe I got your point now (what a looong wiring I have :-)).  
You think it would be better to drop everything starting with line
[49](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh#L49)
until line
[71](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh#L71)
in *lib/borg-functions.sh* and let user define Borg native variables in
*local.conf* like:

    BORGBACKUP_REMOTE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/borg"
    BORGBACKUP_ENC_TYPE="keyfile"

    # Borg env vars
    export BORG_PASSPHRASE="S3cr37_P455w0rD"
    export BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK="y"
    ...

Is that correct?

@gozora  
first and foremost an important note:

Since I merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053)  
basically ALL scripts got a changed name  
from NM\_name.sh to NM0\_name.sh  
(except 00\_name.sh that is now 005\_name.sh)

This means you must update your working copy  
to the current master state otherwise I assume  
you will get big conflicts with further pull requests.

Yes that is what I have in mind.

And no - you do not have a long wiring - it is complicated  
to get all those various stuff done sufficiently well.  
I do appreciate it that you listen to my comments and  
always respond usefully - I am also learning a lot - and  
it does not at all matter whether you are right or I am right,  
what matters is that in the end the result is sufficiently o.k.

I was working "undertimes" the other days

I did not expect that

@jsmeix so I've created \#1055 which (except some documentation updates)
pretty much cancels this pull request :-D.
