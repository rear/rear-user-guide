Hi guys,

I've created first draft as discussed in \#831. Currently works only
with elilo and manual intervention in EFI shell is needed to boot rear
rescue (this will of course change in the future).  
Please comment about possible changes and improvements.

From plain looking at your code  
(without really understanding UEFI stuff)  
I see nothing what could cause a regression.

Therefore I simply accept it as a good starting point  
towards USB UEFI boot support
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/831](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/831)

In particular I like it because that all the actual work  
for USB UEFI boot support happens in one single  
separated script output/USB/Linux-i386/10\_create\_efiboot.sh

In that script regarding

<pre>
# Should we crash if umount fails?
umount ${EFI_MPT}
</pre>

I checked what the rear \*.sh scripts do in general  
when umounting via

<pre>
$ find . -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -A3 'umount ' | less
</pre>

and in almost all cases the exit code of  
a plain "umount" command is ignored  
except in lib/global-functions.sh

Interestingly the umount\_mountpoint function  
in lib/global-functions.sh is nowhere used ;-)

Thanks for the feedback, It was important for me to know that the
starting point is right. Now I can continue to work on it.
