-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    This enables to run "rear recover" with automated LVM LVs shrinking
    as needed  
    on a bit smaller replacement disk (e.g. when a nominally same sized
    replacement disk  
    is actually a bit smaller than the original disk).  
    The automated LVs shrinking is not intended when replacement disk(s)
    are substantially smaller.  
    To migrate onto a substantially smaller replacement disk the user
    must in advance  
    manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear
    recover".

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On my SLES 15 SP 3 system with the YaST default LVM setup as in  
    "SLES 15 SP 1 with default LVM and btrfs structure" in  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6)  
    where "rear recover" runs on a 1GiB smaller disk  
    i.e. 19GiB on the replacement VM  
    with those additional entries in etc/rear/local.conf

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110\_include\_lvm\_code.sh  
assume lvcreate had failed because of "Volume group ... has insufficient
free space"  
which usually happens when the replacement disk is a bit smaller than
the original disk  
so that the following fallback attempt to create a LV could work at
least once per VG  
which is sufficient when the replacement disk is a bit smaller than the
original disk  
because then the last LV that is created gets shrinked to the remaining
space in the VG.  
In the lvopts string replace the exact size option of the form
`-L 123456b`  
with an option to use all remaining free space in the VG via
`-l 100%FREE`  
so e.g. `lvcreate -L 123456b -n LV VG`  
becomes `lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n LV VG`

In layout/save/GNU/Linux/220\_lvm\_layout.sh  
sort the 'lvs' output lines by the size of the LVs  
as a precondition to make automated shrinking of LVs  
work reasonably well with a "minimal changes" approach where  
only some biggest LVs may get automatically shrinked (if needed)  
because we assume that the data of the backup can still be restored  
into a big LV after it was shrinked a bit.

@gdha @gozora @rmetrich @pcahyna @OliverO2  
I would much appreciate it if you could have a look here.  
For me it "just works" so far and I would be interested what you think
about it.

I am not a LVM expert so I may have overlooked something.  
What I am wondering about is why it "just works" for me  
regardless that I did not yet also shrink the size of the VG.

Your post is timely and raises a question from me.  
I am looking to replace two 500GB HDD’s (sda/sdb running as md0 with SW
RAID 1)  
with two 512GB SSD’s and use REAR to create the backup before the
replacement  
and then restore onto the new SDD’s.  
Can I expect this to work with the latest version of rear?

@goodale  
recreating on bigger disks should not cause severe problems  
provided you keep the layout of the storage objects.  
See the

    AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS
    AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS
    AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE
    AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE

config variables description in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

If you use LVM this pull request is only about automated shrinking for
smaller disks.  
Currently there is no automated increasing of LVM storage objects.

Regarding how ReaR recreates the VG in my case:

My disklayout.conf contains

    # Format for LVM PVs
    # lvmdev <volume_group> <device> [<uuid>] [<size(bytes)>]
    lvmdev /dev/system /dev/sda2 2SpJI1-1hPC-nqVV-3lXq-Ft7C-qnuh-AReMfY 41924575
    # Format for LVM VGs
    # lvmgrp <volume_group> <extentsize> [<size(extents)>] [<size(bytes)>]
    lvmgrp /dev/system 4096 5117 20959232
    # Format for LVM LVs
    # lvmvol <volume_group> <name> <size(bytes)> <layout> [key:value ...]
    lvmvol /dev/system swap 1262485504b linear 
    lvmvol /dev/system home 6148849664b linear 
    lvmvol /dev/system root 14050918400b linear 

Therein the `size(bytes)` value 20959232 of the lvmgrp is plain wrong  
because 20959232 bytes are only 19.98828125 MiB.  
Also the `size(bytes)` value 41924575 of the lvmdev does not look right.

But it seems that doesn't matter because  
on my recreated system my /var/log/rear/recover/rear-localhost.log shows

    ++ source /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
    ...
    +++ Print 'Creating LVM VG '\''system'\'' (some properties may not be preserved)'
    +++ lvm vgremove --force --force --yes system
      Failed to clear hint file.
      Volume group "system" not found
      Cannot process volume group system
    +++ true
    +++ '[' -e /dev/system ']'
    +++ lvm vgcreate --physicalextentsize 4096k system /dev/sda2
      Failed to clear hint file.
      Volume group "system" successfully created
    +++ lvm vgchange --available y system
      0 logical volume(s) in volume group "system" now active
    +++ component_created /dev/system lvmgrp

So it seems VGs are recreated without specifying its size  
and according to how I understand "man vgcreate"  
one cannot specify the size of a VG and I assume  
there is no such thing as a VG size because  
the size of a VG is the sum of its PVs sizes (minus VG metadata).

On my recreated system I have

    # lsblk -ipbo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
    NAME                        KNAME     PKNAME    TRAN TYPE FSTYPE             SIZE MOUNTPOINT

      |-/dev/mapper/system-swap /dev/dm-1 /dev/sda2      lvm  swap         1262485504 [SWAP]
      `-/dev/mapper/system-home /dev/dm-2 /dev/sda2      lvm  xfs          6148849664 /home
    /dev/sr0                    /dev/sr0            ata  rom  iso9660       121964544

    # vgs --units b

      system   1   3   0 wz--n- 20388511744B    0B

The VG size of 20388511744 bytes = 19444 MiB  
matches the size of its PV /dev/sda2 size = 20390608896 bytes = 19446
MiB  
so the VG is 2 MiB smaller than its PV and that 2 MiB are used for VG
metadata.

In a separated cleanup attempt I may (as time permits)  
have a closer look at those wrong looking size(bytes) values  
for lvmgrp and lvmdev entries in disklayout.conf  
and remove them from disklayout.conf when they are not used  
because I think unused and possibly wrong data in disklayout.conf  
is worse than having no such data at all. Furthermore since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d8946bcc1cc61086b392e5d85ce956fdcd7d69cf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d8946bcc1cc61086b392e5d85ce956fdcd7d69cf)  
we have 'lsblk' output as disklayout.conf header comments  
e.g. in my disklayout.conf

    # Disk layout dated 20210325121244 (YYYYmmddHHMMSS)
    # NAME                        KNAME     PKNAME    TRAN TYPE FSTYPE       SIZE MOUNTPOINT
    # /dev/sda                    /dev/sda            ata  disk               20G 
    # |-/dev/sda1                 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda       part                8M 
    # `-/dev/sda2                 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda       part LVM2_member   20G 
    #   |-/dev/mapper/system-swap /dev/dm-0 /dev/sda2      lvm  swap         1.2G [SWAP]
    #   |-/dev/mapper/system-root /dev/dm-1 /dev/sda2      lvm  btrfs       13.1G /
    #   `-/dev/mapper/system-home /dev/dm-2 /dev/sda2      lvm  xfs          5.7G /home
    # /dev/sr0                    /dev/sr0            ata  rom              1024M 

so human readable (but not exact) size values are there.  
Perhaps I may change that lsblk output to show sizes as bytes via '
-b'  
to have exact (but less human readable) size values in disklayout.conf?

Regarding how ReaR recreates the PV in my case:

On my recreated system my /var/log/rear/recover/rear-localhost.log shows

    ++ source /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
    ...
    +++ Print 'Creating LVM PV /dev/sda2'
    +++ lvm vgchange -a n system

      Physical volume "/dev/sda2" successfully created.
    +++ component_created pv:/dev/sda2 lvmdev

so also no size is specified when creating the PV  
and `setphysicalvolumesize` appears nowhere in the ReaR scripts

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -i setphysicalvolumesize
    [no output]
