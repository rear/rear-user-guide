Hello Everyone,  
I have an small Problem related to the latest Changes in the Disk Layout
Code.

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / Git
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    If I restore to an smaller Disk, rear recover aborts after the
    disk-layout Promt without any Error message:

<!-- -->

    Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-luklap.log
    Running workflow recover within the ReaR rescue/recovery system
    Will do driver migration (recreating initramfs/initrd)
    Comparing disks
    Device sda has size 250059350016 but 256060514304 is expected (needs manual configuration)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration
    Original disk /dev/sda does not exist (with same size) in the target system
    Using /dev/sda (the only appropriate) for recreating /dev/sda
    Current disk mapping table (source -> target):
        /dev/sda /dev/sda
    Confirm or edit the disk mapping
    1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    4) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
    1
    User confirmed disk mapping
    Exiting rear recover (PID 993) and its descendant processes

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Adding the following to the Config file makes the restore work

<!-- -->

    AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS=true

I think the user should be warned or asked in this case instead of
silently aborting.

@Lukey3332  
I need debug logging information to be able to work on it,  
i.e. the ReaR log file in the recovery system after "rear -D recover",  
see "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I guess this "sudden death" is a bash error exit in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
because of

<pre>
set -e -u -o pipefail
</pre>

therein.

@Lukey3332  
try out if it works when you comment the `set -e -u -o pipefail` line
in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh

I noticed such a "sudden death" once while implementing  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
regardless that the intended behaviour should be an error message  
according to my code in  
usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

<pre>
# Verbose exit in case of errors which is in particular needed when 'set -e' is active because
# otherwise a 'set -e' error exit would happen silently which could look as if all was o.k.
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700#issuecomment-327755633
# The separated EXIT_FAIL_MESSAGE variable is used to denote a failure exit.
# One cannot use EXIT_CODE for that because there are cases where a non-zero exit code
# is the intended outcome (e.g. in the 'checklayout' workflow, cf. usr/sbin/rear):
QuietAddExitTask "(( EXIT_FAIL_MESSAGE )) && echo '${MESSAGE_PREFIX}$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW failed, check $RUNTIME_LOGFILE for details' 1>&8"
</pre>

which had worked at the time when I had implemented that  
but somehow it seems this does no longer work.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1748](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1748)  
fixes only that no longer any error message was shown  
when ReaR did a "sudden death" bash error exit  
when "set -e -u -o pipefail" was set in a script.

@Lukey3332  
I still need your "rear -D recover" debug logging information to be able
to find out  
what the actual root cause was why ReaR did a "sudden death" bash error
exit  
from
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
in your particular case - for a possible reasoning behind have a look

Ok, with `set -e -u -o pipefail ` Commented out it Errors out with:

    User confirmed disk mapping
    Last partition /dev/sda2 must be shrinked by 1236992 bytes to still fit on disk
    ERROR: Last partition /dev/sda2 cannot be shrinked (new disk more than 2% smaller)
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-luklap.log for details

    Running exit tasks

I'm using LVM on an luks-Encrypted Partition (sda2) btw.

The

<pre>
/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 104: COLUMNS: unbound variable
</pre>

issue is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1748](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1748)
and fixed thereby.

The

<pre>
ERROR: Last partition /dev/sda2 cannot be shrinked (new disk more than 2% smaller)
</pre>

works as intended, see in default.conf the section about  
`Resizing partitions in MIGRATION_MODE during "rear recover"`  
therein in particular the AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
config variable that reads in particular:

<pre>
# When the new disk is smaller than AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE percent it errors out.
...
AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE=2
</pre>

In your case the new sda has a size of 250059350016 bytes  
but the old sda was 256060514304 bytes  
and 2% of 256060514304 bytes is 5121210286 bytes  
but 256060514304 - 250059350016 = 6001164288  
which is bigger than 5121210286 so that it errors out.

If you want automated shrinking in your case you could set  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE=3  
but read in default.conf the whole section about  
`Resizing partitions in MIGRATION_MODE during "rear recover"`  
in particular because you use higher-level strorage objects  
on top of the plain partitions but automated shrinking  
by ReaR only shrinks plain partitions but not any higher-level  
strorage objects like LVM stuff on top of the plain partitions:

<pre>
# When AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is true, all active partitions on all active disks
# get resized by the 430_autoresize_all_partitions.sh script
# (except boot and swap partitions via some special hardcoded rules in that script)
# if the disk size had changed (i.e. only in migration mode).
# This does not resize volumes on top of the affected partitions.
...
# When the first value in AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is neither true nor false
# only the last active partition on each active disk gets resized
# by the 420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh script.
...
# In particular this does not resize volumes on top of the affected partitions.
# To migrate volumes on disk where the disk size had changed the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
</pre>

When you use `AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS=true`  
you will be affected by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)  
and the related issue

Your

contains (excerpts):

<pre>

</pre>

so it seems you have a last partition /dev/sda2  
but there is no `fs /dev/sda2` entry for it in your disklayout.conf  
which causes this code in 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh

<pre>
        # Example filesystem 'fs' entry in disklayout.conf (excerpt):
        #  # Format: fs <device> <mountpoint> <fstype> ...
        #  fs /dev/sda3 /boot/efi vfat ...
        last_part_filesystem_entry=( $( grep "^fs $last_part_dev " "$LAYOUT_FILE" ) )
</pre>

to fail (the `grep` therein results non-zero exit code).

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/32eafc491f793e5b8a510ff8f4219ff9be2a7edf](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/32eafc491f793e5b8a510ff8f4219ff9be2a7edf)  
I removed "set -e -u -o pipefail" from
420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
because currently there are too many places in its code that work
right  
but are not implemented to work even with "set -e -u -o pipefail"  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700\#issuecomment-297944196](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700#issuecomment-297944196)  
and the subsequent comments therein.

I assume with that commit this issue here should be fixed.

For me 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh without "set -e -u -o
pipefail"  
works with a last partition that does not have a matching `fs` entry  
in disklayout.conf.

@Lukey3332  
many thanks for testing our newest GitHub master code and for your issue
report.  
It helped me a lot to make 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh working
as intended.

@Lukey3332  
regardless that I already closed this issue please provide feedback  
whether or not the latest GitHub master code also works for you  
with appropriate settings for your particular case like  
`AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE=3`
