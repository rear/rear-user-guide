-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.18
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): SLES12 SP1

by default on SLES12 sshd daemon does not start during recovery because

/var/lib/empty

is missing (/sbin/sshd will complain)  
Simply creating the directory fixes this problem. Probably directory
should be included during  
mkrescue run.

It never happened for me.

On all my test systems (in particular on SLE12-SP1)  
I have in /etc/rear/local.conf something like

<pre>
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
</pre>

and ssh access to the rear recovery system  
always "just worked" for me.

@abbbi

Do you have a non-default ssh configuration?

Does in /etc/rear/local.conf something like

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /var/lib/empty )
</pre>

also fix it for you?

we have set a custom password in local.conf:

SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="recover"

besides that i used:

COPY\_AS\_IS=( "${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]}" /var/lib/empty )

to fix the problem!

@abbbi I've checked our skel tree and `skel/default/var/lib/empty` does
exist, therefore, it should always be present in a rescue environment. I
just check a rescue image and `/var/lib/empty` directory was there. Are
you really sure this directory was the issue?

@jsmeix If you could verify on a rescue environment (any SLES I guess)
that directoru `/var/lib/empty` is there by default?

Verified it several times and /var/lib/empty is always present in the
rescue image. No need to add it to the COPY\_AS\_IS array

Regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/864\#issuecomment-231135110](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/864#issuecomment-231135110)  
see my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/864\#issuecomment-223944174](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/864#issuecomment-223944174)  
i.e. it never happened for me and on all my test systems I had  
a /var/lib/empty/ directory in the recovery system e.g right now  
on SLES12-SP2:

<pre>
RESCUE d245:~ # ls -ld /var/lib/empty/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Aug 17 13:49 /var/lib/empty/
</pre>
