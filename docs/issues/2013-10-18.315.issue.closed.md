Hello  
we want to recover only a selektion of Filesystems. But rear format the
whole HD.

Hi,

ReaR is a bare-metal disaster recovery tool, hence it wipes and
partitions  
and formats your HD.

You can always modify the /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf before  
starting the recovery.

Why do you need to use ReaR to recover a single file system? Why not
just  
use your backup software to restore it?

Regards,  
Schlomo

Because it could be there are some System FS delete. To recover the
whole Disk takes a lot of time . It would be enough to recover /etc or
something else

I would see this as a "special use" which ATM is covered by manually  
editing disklayout.conf before recovering.

The above mentioned filesystem selection is meant for a completely  
different use case:

Imagine you have a large server. For bare metal DR it could be enough
to  
recover the OS parts of the server, get it back up running and then  
continue to recovery the server contents while the server itself is
already  
running. For this you can select the filesystems to restore, but all  
filesystems are recreated.

In your use case you might be better off to boot into ReaR and start
the  
backup software client and manually mount the wiped filesystems and
restore  
it manually. If you feel that this is something that you want to
automate  
please create a new workflow in ReaR that would do this.

Hi  
thank you for your help.But we are a litle bit confused because about
possibility to make a FS selcetion.  
Now i will try to configure local.conf to do only OS parts

Sure. Just keep in mind that ReaR will wipe all hard disks that it
would  
recover. You will have to completely exclude everything from other
hard  
disks to leave them in peace.

@nmidc I think rear is not the right tool for this (or at least
`rear recover` not). Booting the rescue image and repair the file
systems is doable, and then using an external (or internal) backup
program to restore selectively. Manual work that is...  
Of course, everything is possible, but what you're looking for is not
(yet) written and should be a GUI/TUI based to avoid mistakes. Perhaps
someone is willing the write this (sponsoring)?

@nmidc is there anything else unclear before we close this issue?

everything ist fine. Now we boot the rescue Image and recover individual
FS with dsmc.
