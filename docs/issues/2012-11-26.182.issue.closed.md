As requested by Gratien, I open this issue to say that I have problems
with SLES 11 SP2. I tested it with different physical and virtual
servers.

Grub is never able to boot. I dont really know where the problem is, but
a simple call of grub-install in a chroot environment is able to fix the
problem.

Mail from Kai-Olaf Pieth (22 Oct 2012):

On my *SLES11 SP2* install i had to edit `/etc/grub.conf` because it was
simply wrong.  
`/etc/grub.conf` looked like this after regular SLES11 setup:

    setup --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 --force-lba (hd0,0) (hd0,0)
    quit

grub then says:  
`Running "embed /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd0,0)"... failed (this is not fatal)`

But yes, it is fatal because the system won't boot

I had to edit it like this:

    setup --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 --force-lba (hd0) (hd0,0)
    quit

grub then says:  
`Running "embed /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd0)"...  17 sectors are embedded.`

I've seen a lot of different `/etc/grub.conf`'s on *SLES10* Systems that
are not working, or not working with rear, another example:

    root (hd0,0)
    install --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 /grub/stage1 (hd0,0) /grub/stage2 0x8000
    (hd0,0)/grub/menu.lst
    quit

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Kai-Olaf Pieth

**other problematic examples are welcome : the more info we have the
better to troubleshoot**

I have a similar problem actually on SLES11SP2 G7 and SLES11SP1 G8..  
After recovery, I have to manually setup grub again before I reboot.

on G8:  
grub  
grub&gt; device (hd0) /dev/sda  
grub&gt; root (hd0,0)  
grub&gt; setup (hd0)  
quit

on G7:  
grub  
grub&gt; device (hd0) /dev/cciss/c0d0  
grub&gt; root (hd0,0)  
grub&gt; setup (hd0)  
quit

Rear is on USB, which is after the HD in the boot order.

The special scripts for SLES have been removed in the source tree of
rear. Perhaps, it is better now? Feedback would be welcome (pls use the
latest checkout from github).

@dragon299 @holgermai is this still an issue with rear-1.15?
