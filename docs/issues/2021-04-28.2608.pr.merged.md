##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2595

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Backup & restore on a RHEL 8 host with UEFI but without RAID and on
    a CentOS 7 host with UEFI and RAID (ESP on RAID). Examination of
    logs to check that correct efibootmgr commands were executed.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Use dependencies when determining partitions for UEFI

The ESP may be located on a RAID device. In this case, we need to
determine the physical RAID components and call efibootmgr on them
(after restoring - during the finalize step), because efibootmgr does
not know how to tell the firmware to boot from RAID. Moreover, the
current code tries to parse a device like `/dev/md125` into a disk
called `/dev/md` and partition `125`.

Fix by using storage dependencies: RAID components (the actual ESP
copies) can be found as dependencies of the ESP block device. For
consistency, use dependencies also to locate the ESP block device itself
(the old method is preserved as a fallback). Similar strategy is used by
the GRUB2 installation code
(finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh), which is able to install
GRUB2 on the RAID components correctly.

In addition, clean up
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh a bit and add
more logging to ease analysis when something goes wrong in this area.

TODO: finalize/Linux-i386/610\_EFISTUB\_run\_efibootmgr.sh needs a
similar fix.

Fixes \#2595

I agree that ReaR is expected to restore a software RAID also on UEFI
systems  
so the issue is a missing expected functionality a.k.a. "bug".

On the other hand there are zillions of other "reasonably expected"
functionalitries  
that are currently missing in ReaR so such issues are also
enhancements  
in particular when "reasonably expected" code for that is just not
there.

For me a plain "bug" is only when code that is there does not work as
intended.

I.e. it is also not a plain "bug" when code that is there does work as
intended  
but the current intention is not what others "reasonably expect" so such
code  
is "buggy" and needs some enhancement to behave as "reasonably
expected".

I do very much appreciate it!  
It helps so much to get ReaR's code step by step into a better state  
where others can easily understand WHY and WHAT and HOW things are done
in ReaR  
so that others can easily adapt and enhance ReaR in the future.

    The race for quality has no finish line- so technically,
    it's more like a death march.

Yes, we all will be dead at some time.

But if we made code as intended by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
our code can evolve (it may not evolve but it can evolve)  
so from our code future code can be derived (this may not happen but it
can happen)  
in contrast to code that (amost) nobody understands which will be
completely removed  
and replaced by other completely new code from scratch  
so code that is hard to understand dies out  
while code that is easy to understand can have descendants.

It seems there is a dilemma where in the code  
the `Creating EFI Boot Manager entries...` info  
should be done.

Current finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh code in this pull
request is (excerpts)

    LogPrint "Creating EFI Boot Manager entries..."
    ...
    if [ "$esp_mountpoint" = "/" ] ; then
        esp_mountpoint="$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi"
        Log "Mountpoint of $TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER not found, trying $esp_mountpoint"
    fi
    ...
    test -d "$esp_mountpoint" || return 0

so it could tell the user `Creating EFI Boot Manager entries...`  
but then it exits silently and does nothing.

I think when `test -d "$esp_mountpoint"` fails is must no longer exit
silently  
so a matching message should be added like

    if ! test -d "$esp_mountpoint" ; then
        LogPrint "Skip creating EFI Boot Manager entries (no ESP mountpoint found)"
    fi

Or my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608/files\#r622957244](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608/files#r622957244)  
was wrong and nothing should be shown to the user about  
`Mountpoint of /mnt/local/UEFI_BOOTLOADER not found, trying /mnt/local/boot/efi`  
and the `LogPrint "Creating EFI Boot Manager entries..."`  
should be moved after the `test -d "$esp_mountpoint" || return 0`.

This part caught my attention as well. Is it even wise to return 0 in
this case? At this point we know that a UEFI bootloader should be used,
so skipping the rest of the file is almost certainly a serious error.  
(Not so much related to the subject of the PR anymore though. For now, I
can add the other LogPrint as you suggest.)

    At this point we know that a UEFI bootloader should be used,
    so skipping the rest of the file is almost certainly a serious error.

Then show it as an error to the user so he is informed something went
wrong  
(e.g. use wording like `failed to ...` or `cannot ...` that tells
something went wrong)  
and the user knows he may have to fix something manually after "rear
recover"  
and leave the script with `return 1` (the `Source` function doesn't
abort)  
but do not error out of "rear recover", cf.

I can do that, but I feel this deviates a lot from the subject of this
PR (the questionable return 0 is inherited from the original code).

@pcahyna  
the `return 0` when there is
`no ESP mountpoint directory $esp_mountpoint` is from me via

I am sure I could not think about if `return 1` could be better for this
particular case

@jsmeix are there any guidelines for return codes from scripts? ReaR
does not seem to care that much, actually. There is just
`Debug "Source function: 'source $source_file' returns $source_return_code"`
in the `Source()` function. So it looks like returning 1 when problems
are discovered is not enough to get them noticed by the user and one
should complain very loudly (`LogPrintError`, probably).

@pcahyna  
yes, what you describe in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608\#issuecomment-831916709](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2608#issuecomment-831916709)  
is exactly the current state in ReaR's code.

See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1970](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1970)

So currently there is no difference in user experience between  
leaving a script with `return 0` versus `return 1`.

But for those who read the code of the script it makes clear  
if things were expected and all is well with leaving the script at that
place  
versus an error-like issue happened why the script cannot be continued  
(which is not a fatal error to `Error` out of the whole
`rear <workflow>`).

It would take some longer time until all scripts are fixed that
currently  
exit with non-zero exit code by accident when the last command  
in the script exits with non-zero exit code which is the reason why  
there is no user alert when a script exits with non-zero exit code.

Currently it is intentionally only a `Debug` message because  
some users inspect the ReaR log and raise issues here  
for all what looks like an error to them ;-)

@pcahyna  
no need to rebase and force-push the branch to squash related commits
together.  
Just keep the individual development commits as is.

The merge commit will automatically be the one that has all of them in
one commit.

I even prefer when all the individual development commits are kept as
is.  
It preserves the development history in the master branch  
i.e. I perfer to not remove information unless there is a serious reason
to do so.

In my local `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git` I often use

    git log --format="%ae %H %ad%n%s :%n%b%n" --graph | fmt -w 120 -u -t | less

to show the whole git history in the master branch and there  
all the individual development commits often help me  
to better understand in retrospect why things were changed  
without the need to dig out the GitHub issue and pull request  
and read through all the details there.

Having all the individual development commits in the master branch
history  
is often even crucial to understand in retrospect what was actually
changed  
because the merge commit message is often only rather meaningless, e.g.:

There are commits marked as squash! and fixup! and those were intended
to be squashed with others. My intent was to preserve the history, but
not all of the commits, there were commits that merely amend earlier
commits and the history would IMO look better with them squashed into
earlier commits. The squash! and fixup! log messages will look
particularly ugly in the history because they were not intended to be
part of the final history.

@pcahyna  
feel free to squash your commits as you like  
provided the commit messages of the commits you finally keep  
still show sufficient information so that others can understand in
retrospect  
what was changed without the need to dig out the GitHub issue  
and pull request and read through all the details there.

In particular we need that understanding in retrospect  
when we make the doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
cf. "compile the information for the release notes" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

Oops. I accidentally made the file executable in
27de4cd95dabe86f531f132108744459b2dbcfd0 @jsmeix can you please revert
the mode change, or should I submit a new PR reverting it?

@pcahyna regarding executable
finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
you could simply submit it with mode `-rw-r--r--` as "by the way"
addon  
via your next PR without mentioning it in a commit message  
(but you can mention it in a separated PR comment).
