##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2785

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On RHEL 8.5: `rear mkbackuponly`, change of UUID of `/boot` and
    remount, `rear mkrescue` and recovery.  
    After recovery, the system does not boot, as it can not mount
    `/boot`. After manual fixing of `/etc/fstab`, checked the recovery
    log - it contains

    2022-04-26 10:17:49.082885638 Some configuration files in the restored system do not match the saved layout!

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Configuration files can get out-of-sync with the recreated layout. This
leads to inconsistent configuration, e.g. filesystem not mountable at
boot, if they are mounted by UUIDs, and failures to migrate UUIDs in
files (if needed).

To detect this problem, use the saved md5sums of configuration files
(originally used for "checklayout") to verify the restored files and
inform the user in the case of a mismatch.

No attempt is made to repair the problem; the user is informed, but they
must fix the problem manually.

If a file may need a migration of UUIDs, then it is very likely prone to
get out-of-sync with the layout if it gets modified. Add all such files
to the list of files whose hashes are recorded in the saved layout to
detect such problems.

Introduce a variable called `FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS` to hold the list
of these files (shell glob patterns, actually), as it is now needed in
multiple places.

Change `finalize/GNU/Linux/250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh` to use
`FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS` as well.

Supersedes \#2788 , \#2786

TODO: the log says that files have changed, but it does not say which
files. The md5sum output contains this information, but it does not
appear in the log. What is the best way to show the output in the log?

Suggestions for alternative wording of the message (should it be made
more prominent, e.g. by prefixing it with "WARNING!"?) and an
alternative name for `FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS` are welcome.

In general regarding non fatal errors and LogPrintError usage:

In case of non fatal errors they should be prefixed with "Error: "  
in the LogPrintError message, e.g. see the commit message in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2788/commits/cf96b605420a24514a96bf543977a1ba70f56343](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2788/commits/cf96b605420a24514a96bf543977a1ba70f56343)

    decide for the user that ... is an error so show it as "Error" to the user, cf.
    https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html

By the way:  
LogPrintError does not automatically add an "Error: " prefix  
because LogPrintError is intended to be also used for  
"error-like" messages when the user must decide if that means  
a real error in his case, see the comment at the LogPrintError
function  
in rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh which is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L492](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L492)

In general how to show command stdout and stderr output  
on the users's terminal and also have it in the log file,  
see backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
where the general form is  
(including stdin redirection from the users's keyboard)

    COMMAND 0<&6 1>> >( tee -a "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" 1>&7 ) 2>> >( tee -a "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" 1>&8 )

For the reason why this is used as general form  
see the lengthy comments at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#pullrequestreview-403320309](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#pullrequestreview-403320309)

Perhaps this could be done in a simpler and more straightforward way  
but I don't have the needed expert knowledge in this area  
to fully understand what actually goes on with such redirections.

I agree with displaying it as `Error: ` because while not fatal, the
condition is likely serious and and often needs manual intervention.

In general regarding what to do in case of a FAILED md5sum  
cf. skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup

    # In case of a FAILED md5sum inform the user:
    echo "Possibly corrupted Relax-and-Recover rescue system"

Here plain `echo` is used because during recovery system startup  
we do not have ReaR functions (rear is not running).

When something went wrong during "rear recover" we at least  
show the issue to the user (which is done in this pull request)  
and sometimes we let the user confirm it via an appropriate UserInput
call  
or we may force the user to make decisions via an appropriate user
dialog.

When restored config files are inconsistent with the recreated system  
I think we should not continue "rear recover" but instead force  
the user to make decisions via an appropriate user dialog.  
Usually one user dialog option is to  
"Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here"  
so the user could manually fix things before proceeding.

This is not needed in this pull request here.  
Better enhance it step by step with separated pull requests.

What I don't understand:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#what-to-do-with-stdin-stdout-and-stderr](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#what-to-do-with-stdin-stdout-and-stderr)
says "Because stdout and stderr are redirected into ReaR's log file
(...)", but I don't see the output from md5sum in the log file anywhere
(with my current code).

And according to the linked discussion, one should be able to use `2>`
instead of `2>>`, am I right?

In general regarding `1>` and `2>` versus `1>>` and `2>>`:

See usr/sbin/rear

    # To be on the safe side append to the log file '>>' instead of plain writing to it '>'
    # because when a program (bash in this case) is plain writing to the log file it can overwrite
    # output of a possibly simultaneously running process that likes to append to the log file
    # (e.g. when a background process runs that also uses the ReaR log file for logging).

In general all log messages must be always appended  
because previous log messages must never be overwritten  
(it is the whole point of a log that existing entries are sacrosanct).

For better readability here a quotation what I had written in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#pullrequestreview-403320309](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#pullrequestreview-403320309)  
(excerpts):

    I think when using process substitution we must ensure
    to append to the filename that is the result of the process substitution
    because when we do not append we overwrite existing things in that file.
    So I think we must append via
    2>> >( COMMAND )
    instead of plain writing via
    2> >( COMMAND )
    ...
    Meanwhile I think when using process substitution >( COMMAND )
    we could use both 2>> >( COMMAND ) and 2> >( COMMAND )
    because >( COMMAND ) evaluates to a file name where to the
    current bash writes and where from COMMAND gets its stdin.
    Usually that intermediate file is a named pipe (FIFO).
    I think it does not matter if the current bash writes or appends to
    that intermediate file because the current bash is a single process
    so that both methods result that all is written sequentially and
    nothing is overwritten by another process (i.e. the current bash is
    the only writer to that intermediate file).
    But what matters is that COMMAND appends to the ReaR log file
    because when using process substitution COMMAND is run
    asynchronously as another process beside the current bash.
    Because the current bash has stdout redirected to the log file
    now the process substitution 2> >( COMMAND ) also writes
    asynchronously to the ReaR log file at the same time while
    the current bash stdout appends to the ReaR log file.
    With
    COMMAND = tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE
    I am sure it appends to the ReaR log file.

So

    2>> >( tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE )

is simple (just use append mode everywhere in case of log messages)  
while in contrast

    2> >( tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE )

has a complicated reasoning behind why that could also work.

Because I don't see a reason why `2>` is better here than `2>>`  
I would prefer to  
"just use append mode everywhere in case of log messages".

Or is there a reason why `2>` is better here than `2>>` ?

@pcahyna  
regarding your "I don't see the output from md5sum in the log file":

See usr/sbin/rear

    # In debug modes stdout and stderr are redirected to the log
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416
    # In non-debug modes (in particular also in verbose mode)
    # stdout and stderr are redirected to a temporary file if possible
    # i.e. when TMP_DIR exists - it does not exist for the 'help' workflow
    ...
    # In non-debug modes the log cannot contain possibly false alarm messages
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416
    # but in non-debug modes stdout and stderr of all programs is still available
    # for the Error function to extract some latest messages
    # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2623

I repeated the test with the updated code. The log now has:

    2022-04-28 11:26:08.986818408 Including finalize/default/060_compare_files.sh
    /etc/rear/local.conf: FAILED

    2022-04-28 11:26:09.002365987 Error: configuration files shown above in the restored system do not match the saved layout!

In the test I changed local.conf between `mkbackuponly` and `mkrescue`.
It is a question if the check should fail because of this mismatch, but
if not, probably `/etc/rear/` should not be in `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` at
all.  
The `mtab` error is more serious, I am afraid it will appear every time,
making the check practically useless - do we really want to patch UUIDs
in `mtab` ? ( On this system, `/etc/mtab` is a symlink to
../proc/self/mounts\`. )

    /etc/mtab: symbolic link to ../proc/self/mounts

In curent ReaR master code

    # find usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'mtab'

shows several scripts where we have special mtab handling  
in particular the finalize scripts

    finalize/GNU/Linux/250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh
    finalize/GNU/Linux/250_migrate_lun_wwid.sh
    finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh
    finalize/GNU/Linux/260_rename_diskbyid.sh
    finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh

mention `the symlink target of etc/mtab is /mnt/local/proc/12345/mounts`

We have special symlink handling in those finalize scripts  
that originated in particular for mtab at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2048](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2048)  
"Do not patch $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/etc/mtab if symbolic link"  
which means on the other hand that  
we do patch $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/etc/mtab if it is not a symbolic link.

Because current ReaR master code supports when etc/mtab is not a
symbolic link  
I think we should not abandon this support now with this pull request.

So I think special symlink handling is needed for the files  
where FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS evaluates to.

Offhandedly I think special handling of symlinks and  
other special files (e.g. files in /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ or /run/)  
is needed in `layout/save/default/600_snapshot_files.sh`  
that matches the special handling of symlink and other special files  
in the above mentioned finalize scripts (perhaps not an exact copy  
of what is done in those finalize scripts but something similar).

Simply put:  
Offhandedly I think usually (i.e. except possible exceptions)  
files that will be skipped when patching in the finalize stage  
should also be skipped by this md5sum test here  
because this md5sum test here is not and  
cannot be meant to verify if all restored config files are OK,  
instead this test is only meant to check if certain restored files  
of specific interest for "rear recover" are OK.

CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES=( ... '/etc/rear/' ... )

`# git log --follow -p usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`  
shows that this originated at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/929279d9cc8a19e683680b900ee2b21f14177808](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/929279d9cc8a19e683680b900ee2b21f14177808)

As usual the old commits do not have any explanatory comment  
or a link to an issue that explanains things or something like that  
so we cannot know WHY /etc/rear/ was added to CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES  
which gives us the freedom to do what we like from our current point of
view.

Currently I don't know whether or not  
/etc/rear/ should be in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES.

Offhandedly my gut feeling is that a changed local.conf  
between mkbackuponly and mkrescue calls for possible  
problems later during "rear recover" so it should be shown  
to the user during "rear recover" so that the user is made aware  
that there could be problems because of his changed local.conf

Cf. my meanwhile enhanced part  
"It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent"  
in the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads in particular:

    ... after each change of the basic system
    ... "rear mkbackup" needs to be run to create
    a new ReaR recovery system together
    with a matching new backup of the files

A changed local.conf indicates a change of the basic system  
or the changed local.conf could be itself considered as such a change  
of the basic system because ReaR belongs to the basic system  
when one considers disaster recovery as a basic system thing.

I believe all the comments are addressed now and I consider the branch
ready to be merged (with squashing of commits marked as `fixup!` in
order to not overcomplicate history).

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for all your work here!  
It became really complicated to get it done correctly.  
Feel free to merge it when you like.

@jsmeix yes, it is complicated. When thinking about the symlink support,
I realized that there is still a gap in the present approach: what if
another file that matches `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` or
`FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS` gets added (when it was missing previously)?
This won't be detected by `md5sum -c`, but may represent a change
relevant to layout. This may explain why `md5sum -c` is not used but the
complete list of checksums is regenerated and compared in
`layout/compare/default/510_compare_files.sh` :

@pcahyna  
yes, you are right - thank you for your sharp and thorough analysis!

The simple high level goal is to detect all changes in files where  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES and FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS  
evaluate to.

When CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES and FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS  
evaluate to different files this is a change that must be detected.

This means `md5sum -c` cannot be used here but instead the complete  
list of files must be regenerated and their checksums must be
regenerated  
and compared with the previous list of files and checksums.

This means the same checksum generating code as currently in your  
layout/save/default/600\_snapshot\_files.sh here in this pull request  
must be also run to regenerate those checksums in your new  
finalize/default/060\_compare\_files.sh here in this pull request  
and also in  
layout/compare/default/510\_compare\_files.sh in master code

@pcahyna  
I did a quick
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796)  
which is only meant as a proposal so you could have a look  
how things might be done according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795\#issuecomment-1116010676](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795#issuecomment-1116010676)

I did not plain copy the your checksum generating code in  
layout/save/default/600\_snapshot\_files.sh here in this pull request  
but I modified it somewhat - in particular I do not add things  
to the user config variable CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES  
but instead I use a local files\_for\_md5sum array  
because I feel uncertain changing user config variables.

I don't think that any modification of
`layout/compare/default/510_compare_files.sh` (except for replacing the
`diff -u` by a better comparison like `cmp` and using `sort` to avoid
false warnings when the set of files is unchanged, but the order is
changed) is needed. `layout/save/default/600_snapshot_files.sh` appends
to the variable `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES`, so
`layout/compare/default/510_compare_files.sh` will inherit it (
`layout/save` is executed before `layout/compare` ). I now see that it
is highly non-obvious, so I should add a comment explaining it.  
You are right that if I move to something else than `md5sum -c` in
`finalize`, the same code needs to be run there
(`finalize/default/060_compare_files.sh`) to regenerate
`CHECK_CONFIG_FILES`.

I understand your feeling, but if we are to use an internal variable for
this, I think it should be global, not local (do we have a standard
prefix for global variables not exposed to the user?) and set only once
in `layout/save/default/600_snapshot_files.sh` to avoid duplication.

Meanwhile I think I am overcautious because  
we often modify config variables when needed  
(e.g. there are many `COPY_AS_IS+=` in the scripts)  
so it is OK to append to CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES.

We do not have a special syntax for global nopn-config variables.  
In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
there is only

    All variables that are used in more than a single script must be all-caps

Ah ok, that's good. I propose to do one adjustment here: split
`layout/save/default/600_snapshot_files.sh` into two files: one would
adjust `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` according to `FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS` (my
new code) and the other would actually perform the hash calculation (the
original code). This would enable us to symlink the former from other
places and thus share the code, without having to always execute the
latter. Then I would merge it and do other improvements (like the issue
I found above, and \#2796) separately.

@jsmeix thanks a lot for all your helpful review - I now added

retested, so if you are fine with the name, I am going to squash the

these issues remain.

The approach to solve the first one is discussed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796\#issuecomment-1118387393](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796#issuecomment-1118387393)
.  
But since it likely is a rare issue, I believe that properly solving
\#2787 will bring more benefit to users, if we want to continue
improving this stuff and need to choose what we will dedicate our time
to.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/58ddf3e094456df3c41f0b2089ee962d34836da6](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/58ddf3e094456df3c41f0b2089ee962d34836da6)  
I dared to "just add right now" `[e]tc/crypttab`  
to FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS in default.conf  
because I cannot imagine a reason why it should not be checked  
and patched if a UUID changed therein - i.e. I cannot imagine  
what could go wrong or could be worse when it is checked  
(and patched if needed) compared to ignoring it (as it was before).
