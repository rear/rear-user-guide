lib/network-functions.sh should be split into functions  
for DHCP setup during recovery system startup  
and general functions used in usual ReaR scripts.

This issue emerged from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1510](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1510)  
therein see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1510\#issuecomment-331423317](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1510#issuecomment-331423317)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1510\#issuecomment-332140203](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1510#issuecomment-332140203)  
where the latter reads (excerpts):

<pre>
network-functions.sh is collection ... grabbed from an
old RHEL system to get the job done as easy as possible
...
we better split it apart (network piece required
for DHCP in skel and network functions which
are required by main rear script).
</pre>

For "ReaR future" because currently nothing goes wrong  
so that there is no need to do such this cleanup right now.

In which normal ReaR scripts the old functions of  
usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh  
are called:

<pre>
prefix2netmask is found in
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh

get_device_by_hwaddr is found in
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh
</pre>

Normal ReaR scripts are usr/sbin/rear and the scripts in  
usr/share/rear except the recovery system startup scripts in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default

The old functions are

<pre>
exit_with_hooks
logmessage
save_previous
eventually_add_hostnames_domain_to_search
make_resolv_conf
change_resolv_conf
my_ipcalc
quad2num
ip2num
num2ip
get_network_address
prefix2netmask
get_prefix
class_bits
is_router_reachable
add_default_gateway
flush_dev
dhconfig
add_ipv6_addr_with_DAD
dh6config
get_hwaddr
get_device_by_hwaddr
need_hostname
set_hostname
check_device_down
check_link_down
check_default_route
find_gateway_dev
add_default_route
is_wireless_device
install_bonding_driver
is_bonding_device
</pre>

which are all functions in  
usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh  
except the

<pre>
function is_ip()
function get_ip_from_fqdn()
function linearize_interfaces_file()
function rebuild_interfaces_file_from_linearized()
</pre>

that were recently addeb by @schabrolles

prefix2netmask calls  
num2ip and needs  
MASKS

num2ip does not need other functions or variables

get\_device\_by\_hwaddr does not need other functions or variables

so that normal ReaR scripts only need those  
old functions and variables of  
usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh

<pre>
MASKS
num2ip
prefix2netmask
get_device_by_hwaddr 
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1526](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1526)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.
