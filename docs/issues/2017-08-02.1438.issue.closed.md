Can you please try again with our current release 2.2? There where some
changes in this area that might solve your issue.

@rlrichmo Please try the latest release and return feedback.

First, I want to thank everyone for the quick responses. I apologize for
the slow reply on my part, as I am getting back to this issue. We are
just getting started on implementing rear in our environment. In the
mean time I have discovered that rear 2.00 is now available through the
standard Oracle Linux repositories. I want to give version 2.00 a try
first as we prefer to use packages supported by our Linux vendors. I
upgraded rear on our Oracle Linux servers today and ran mkbackup without
any issues. I will monitor these for the next few days and let you know
if any errors should occur.

@rlrichmo And, does it work better with rear-2.00?

Again, I apologize for the slow replies. I have not received any errors
since upgrading to Rear version 2.00 on our Oracle Linux hosts. I am
inclined to stay with version 2.00 since it is available in standard
update channels for our Linux hosts and I did not see anything in the
2.1 and 2,2 release notes to compel me to upgrade further. Thanks to
everyone who assisted in resolving this issue.

Because "no \[further\] news is good news" I assume that since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1438\#issuecomment-327818779](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1438#issuecomment-327818779)  
it works with ReaR 2.0 so that I can close this issue.  
If the same issue persists this issue report can be reopened but  
new and different issues need new and separated issue reports.
