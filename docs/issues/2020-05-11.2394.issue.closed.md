I am afraid this won't work, because ReaR uses GRUB2 on UEFI, but RHEL 6
did not have GRUB2 AFAIK. (In recent development version of ReaR it will
be `grub-mkstandalone` instead of `grub-mkimage`, but the underlying
issue is the same.)

@dcz01  
only some untested ideas off the top of my head what you might try out:

A generic workaround to boot the ReaR recovery system  
is what I described in the section  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I mean:  
On your replacement hardware boot an arbitrary small and simple system  
in UEFI mode and `kexec` the ReaR recovery system kernel and initrd  
from that already running system.

I would hope that this way it is possible to install an UEFI
bootloader  
for the recreated target system.  
As far as I know it is in general not possible to boot an installation
system  
in BIOS mode (the ReaR recovery system is an installation system)  
and then install an UEFI bootloader for the target system.  
I think the reason behind is that for a system that was booted in BIOS
mode  
UEFI related stuff (e.g. EFI variables and things like that) is not
accessible.

I don't know if it then works at the end of "rear recover" during  
its "finalize" stage to let ReaR install the UEFI bootloader  
for the recreated target system.

If the target system UEFI bootloader installation fails for you  
it might work to `chroot /mnt/local` into the recreated target system  
and manually install its UEFI bootloader from within the target system.

@jsmeix @pcahyna  
My only problem now is only that i can't let create an bootable image
from ReaR with an UEFI bootloader.  
Is there any package or something that i haven't installed yet for GRUB
0.97?  
I just want to have an bootable image from ReaR for an bare metal
machine without the classic BIOS support (only UEFI boot possible).

@dcz01 I think the `OUTPUT=USB` method could work, if you can use it
instead of ISO, it seems that it supports UEFI with legacy GRUB (from a
quick look at sources).  
@jsmeix would it work to use the `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` method as an
alternative? It seems that it does not require GRUB2 for UEFI, but I
never understood what it actually does. (One is supposed to dd the
resulting image onto a disk?)  
Anyway, to me it seems that `OUTPUT=ISO` won't work (requires GRUB2 and
CentOS 6 uses GRUB 0.97).

The OUTPUT=RAWDISK method was implemented by @OliverO2  
so he is the authoritative source of information about this area.  
See his initial
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659)  
and the related
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578)  
where
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578\#issuecomment-345254340](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578#issuecomment-345254340)  
mentiones the `isohybrid` tool that reminds me on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)
which reads (excerpt)

    isohybrid [ISO] converts it to a hybrid ISO.
    Option flag -u or --uefi makes it UEFI bootable.

so perhaps using `isohybrid` with its `--uefi` option could  
make a "normal" non-UEFI-bootable OUTPUT=ISO image  
even UEFI bootable?

Unfortunately I never tested the OUTPUT=RAWDISK method myself  
nor did I try out using isohybrid.

According to the OUTPUT=RAWDISK section in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L858](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L858)  
it seems the OUTPUT=RAWDISK method could be a generic alternative  
for UEFI booting the ReaR recovery system from any disk device.  
Such a disk device would be usually a USB stick or a real USB disk.

Let's hope that modern bare metal machine without BIOS boot support  
supports at least to boot from a USB disk (e.g. I think some  
blade "machines" won't have a way to connect a USB disk).  
In that case it is perhaps somehow possible to provide the  
RAWDISK image on whatever other bootable disk for that  
bare metal machine?

Regarding `isohybrid` UEFI booting  
[https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid\#UEFI](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid#UEFI)  
reads (excerpt)

    If the ISO 9660 image includes a UEFI bootloader
    capable of booting optical media in UEFI mode,
    then the isohybrid command can also achieve
    an equivalent result for UEFI systems 

so `isohybrid` cannot be used to make a "normal"  
non-UEFI-bootable ISO image even UEFI bootable  
because `isohybrid` does not (or cannot) add a whole  
UEFI boot infrastructure (EFI system partition plus EFI bootloader).

@pcahyna Yes, you're supposed to dd the resulting image onto some boot
medium (like an entire raw disk or a USB stick). No previous
formatting/partitioning required.

@dcz01 If there is a suitable `syslinux/EFI` package available (and
installed) on RHEL 6, RAWDISK would be an option to try.

@chlupnoha this is possibly a viable alternative for your project

I now used the `OUTPUT=USB` method which worked fine with an normal usb
stick on the server.  
Now i have an UEFI-Boot-Stick to use in an catastrophic case.  
Thanks for the code looking and checking.

@dcz01 try to recover from your boot stick on a spare hardware before
the catastrophic case occurs! There may be other surprises during the
recovery process.

@dcz01  
I fully agree with @pcahyna  
You must verify that your recovery procedure actually works for you.
