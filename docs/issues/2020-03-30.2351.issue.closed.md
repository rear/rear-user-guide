-   Note: `usr/share/rear/lib/mkopalpba-workflow.sh` contains:

<!-- -->

        # Change workflow components before SourceStage jumps into action:
        # This makes the 'mkopalpba' workflow work with the configuration for the 'mkrescue' workflow,
        # yet produce a different outcome (the PBA instead of the rescue image) with it own set of
        # component scripts.
        BACKUP=OPALPBA  # There is no backup inside the PBA, so abuse the BACKUP component to create the PBA
