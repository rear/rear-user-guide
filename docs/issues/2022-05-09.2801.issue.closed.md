@tpatel80  
your

    ++ read keyword dummy part_size part_start part_name part_flags part_dev junk

    ++ broken_part_errors+=("$part_dev is not a block device")

The matching code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
is (excerpts):

        while read keyword dummy part_size part_start part_name part_flags part_dev junk ; do
            test -b "$part_dev" || broken_part_errors+=( "$part_dev is not a block device" )

This shows that

    read keyword dummy part_size part_start part_name part_flags part_dev junk

does not get any value for `part_dev` from the

    grep '^part /dev/sda ' /usr/local/src/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

output.

So the error is right because according to the 'lsblk' output  
in your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801\#issue-1230116754](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801#issue-1230116754)  
there should be

    part /dev/sda <size> <start> <type|name> <flags> /dev/sda1
    part /dev/sda <size> <start> <type|name> <flags> /dev/sda2
    part /dev/sda <size> <start> <type|name> <flags> /dev/sda3

entries in your  
/usr/local/src/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

Next step is to find out why `read` does not get `part_dev` values:

    ++ echo 'part /dev/sda 959127224320 529530880 none  /dev/sda3'

show what is wrong:  
A 'part' entry in disklayout.conf has the syntax

    part <device> <size> <start> <type|name> <flags> /dev/<partition>

see the section  
"Disk layout file syntax" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

For example on my homeoffice laptop I have

    part /dev/sda 8388608 1048576 rear-noname bios_grub /dev/sda1
    part /dev/sda 4294967296 9437184 rear-noname swap /dev/sda2
    part /dev/sda 214748364800 4304404480 rear-noname legacy_boot /dev/sda3
    part /dev/sda 107374182400 219052769280 rear-noname none /dev/sda4

In contrast you have

    part /dev/sda 4194304 1048576 none  /dev/sda1
    part /dev/sda 524288000 5242880 none  /dev/sda2
    part /dev/sda 959127224320 529530880 none  /dev/sda3

so one of `<type|name>` or `<flags>` is missing.

Next step is why `<type|name>` or `<flags>` is missing:  
Your

    ++ [[ unknown = \d\a\s\d ]]
    ++ declare flags flaglist

The matching code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
is (excerpts)

            parted -m -s $device print > $TMP_DIR/parted
            disk_label=$(grep ^/ $TMP_DIR/parted | cut -d ":" -f "6")
    ...
        if [[ "$disk_label" = "msdos" ]] ; then
    ...
        if [[ "$disk_label" = "gpt" || "$disk_label" = "gpt_sync_mbr" || "$disk_label" = "dasd" ]] ; then

Your `disk_label=unknown` which does not match  
any of "msdos" "gpt" "gpt\_sync\_mbr" or "dasd"  
so the partition `type` is not set  
which leads to it be empty in disklayout.conf

I guess your disk label is actually one of  
"msdos" "gpt" "gpt\_sync\_mbr" or "dasd"  
but the current code in 200\_partition\_layout.sh  
does not work because it does not sufficiently  
"Try hard to care about possible errors", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
because it blindly proceeds in case of errors like

    ++ parted -m -s /dev/sda print
    Error: Can't have a partition outside the disk!

and I assume in your case the

    parted -m -s /dev/sda print

output is not what the current code in 200\_partition\_layout.sh  
normally needs and then things arbitrarily fail in ReaR.

@tpatel80  
you should fix your partitioning so that `parted`  
does not show errors.

I will have a look at  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
how to make it behave more reliably and failsafe,  
in particular error out directly therein when things failed  
instead of error out later in 950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
(at least I had added 950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
as generic safety net against our many old code places  
that blindly proceed instead of caring about errors).

I believe it is needed to know how to reproduce the issue before merging
any fix (like \#2804). @tpatel80 how is the disk partitioned? I suppose
your machine is PowerNV (BareMetal)?

@tpatel80 I will try (I have used ReaR on POWER bare metal and I have
not seen this kind of issue, but it was the version shipped with RHEL,
not the development version from Git)

Neither
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803)  
nor
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804)  
intend to fix the initially reported issue here  
i.e. none makes correct entries in disklayout.conf.

Both are only meant to detect early i.e. directly  
in the code where the entries are genereated in  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
when invalid entries would be generated  
(regardless what the actual reason is).

I.e.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804)  
are only meant to better care about possible errors  
and exit directly where the error happened  
instead of blindly proceeding and let things fail  
at some later place (950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh).

@tpatel80 I am not able to reproduce the issue on RHEL 8.2 / POWER bare
metal. What does

    parted -m -s /dev/sda print

and

    parted -s /dev/sda print

print for you?

The message
`WARNING: Device /dev/sda3 has size of 1873295360 sectors which is smaller than corresponding PV size of 1874350080 sectors. Was device resized?`
indicates that there is something wrong with partitioning on your
machine.

Only a side note FYI:  
When `rear` is run in debug mode KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR is true  
so that \[/var\]/tmp/rear.XXXXXX/tmp/parted should be kept  
that contains the `parted -m -s` output.

Updating END value of sda3 seems to have done the trick. Running
mkbackup now.

@tpatel80 I believe you still have a problem with LVM, it thinks that
the PV is longer than the partition that it sits on. Not sure how
serious it is or how to correct it...

@tpatel80  
only out of curiosity (I am not a Red Hat user) regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801\#issuecomment-1122369017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801#issuecomment-1122369017)

    the machine is a baremetal IBM Power System IC922 (9183-22X)
    factory installed with Redhat 8.2.

Because you have parted errors and LVM warnings  
about partion sizes and PV sizes on your original system  
(so it cannot be ReaR that recreated something wrong)  
I wonder if your original system is really  
"factory installed with Redhat 8.2"?

I assume a Red Hat installation does not result  
wrong partitioning and/or wrong LVM PV setup  
(I think otherwise Red Hat would have already noticed)  
so I guess smoeone or something had somehow changed  
the pristine partitioning on your original system.

Alternatively a Red Hat installation may do  
something wrong only on special hardware like  
your baremetal IBM Power System IC922 (9183-22X).

FYI:  
This would not be the first case we had here at ReaR  
where disaster recovery setup with ReaR reveals  
a broken setup on the original system.  
In particular we had "fun" with certain special  
third-party software that a bit messed up things  
in the original system.

@jsmeix I suspect the image used to clone these systems had different
disk size. We've contacted IBM for details.

@tpatel80  
so the installation on this particular machine  
was not an actual Red Hat installation  
but an imaged clone of a Red Hat installation  
and ReaR revealed that the likely 100% clone  
(e.g. like a simple 'dd' whole disk clone)  
does not 100% match the clone's target machine hardware  
(e.g. the disk image is a bit bigger than the target disk).

In general regarding a bit different hardware disk sizes  
(in contrast virtual disk sizes can be made 100% same)  
you may have a look at the description about  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
what ReaR would do during "rear recover" to deal with  
a bit different disk sizes on replacement hardware.

To keep issues because of a bit different disk sizes  
out of the way I would recommend to not use a disk  
up to its very end but leave some reasonable amount of  
disk space unused at the end so that the a bit smaller  
actually used disk space fits within the smallest existing  
hardware disk size among one kind of disks that one uses  
(e.g. among all 1TB disks that one uses).

This belongs to the general topic  
"Prepare for disaster recovery from the very beginning" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think I add a subsection there about recommended disk usage.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804)  
merged I think this issue is sufficiently solved.
