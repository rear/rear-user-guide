Is there documentation I missed on the following topics?  
If it is missing a short description in wiki or readme files would
provide some help and guidence to stick with the structure.

-   what directroy holds what e.g. lib/output/pack/format
-   sub directory structure e.g. default/...
-   what workflows call to what directories and in which order

Thanks

Off the top of my head I only know about  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc)  
and  
usr/share/rear/restore/readme  
usr/share/rear/restore/OPALPBA/readme  
usr/share/rear/wrapup/readme  
usr/share/rear/finalize/readme  
usr/share/rear/backup/readme  
usr/share/rear/prep/README  
but all that is possibly incomplete and partially outdated, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blame/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blame/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc)

Regarding what workflows call:  
You could run each workflow in simulation mode like

    # usr/sbin/rear -s recover

to see what scripts in which so called 'stage' directories are actually
sourced  
or you inspect the `usr/share/rear/lib/*workflow.sh` sources.

Regarding 'stage' directories:  
See the SourceStage function in lib/framework-functions.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh)

this is mostly what i was looking for. I was somehoe not expecting it to
be in user guide.  
Also it is very brief in some cases and does not explain other workflows
like format.

I think one issue with finding information is where too look for. there
is docs directroy, readme files at some places, wiki and website. All
places provide a different but not defined set of incomplete
information.

> You could run each workflow in simulation mode

yes, I figured that out at some point. thats helpfull but there should
be no need to look at that in the first place I think. How about a print
for every new time a new directory gets sourced e.g. Starting pack phase

In current master code there is a print when a new stage directory gets
sourced  
which is shown in debug modes to not clutter the user's terminal in
normal modes, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh\#L99](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh#L99)

@jsmeix Wouldn't it be better to move the ReaR documentation to one
place -
[https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide](https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide)
(site:
[https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/index.html](https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/index.html))?
The documentation is currently spread over internal documents without a
real good overview towards the end-user. One find examples in the config
tree, examples in the docs, examples in the mailing list. It would be
better to merge the best examples at one place. However, alone it is too
much work for me. I need help from the community.

@gdha  
same for me regarding available time:  
As long as I have real issues to solve in the code  
I won't have time to improve the documentation (outside of the code).  
What I would do - as time permits - is fixing specific bugs in existing
documentation  
(but neither reorganizing the documentation nor adding new bigger
documentation)  
provided someone tells me where a bug is in the documentation.  
I don't have time for proofreading all existing documentation.

If there is a clear gideline what kind of documentation is wanted and
where to put it someone may do a PR or edit documentation at some point.
There should be a plan and some guidance in any case.

@DEvil0000 You could create an issue at
[https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide/issues)
to express your ideas/wishes.  
We will try to create a frame-work and migrate the current documentation
to its new place.

@rear/wiki-contributors @rear/contributors  
**If every ReaR contributor or expert user contributes a little bit then
the documentation will grow gradually to a nice collection of documents.
If I have to do it alone (what the current situation is) then it will
take many years to complete, if it ever completes.**

Does "user-guide" only include user facing documentation? where do you
want to put dev facing information about inner workings or coding
guidelines? So - what kind of information is where? Or should both go
into one place?  
Why not keep it in this repo?

What is the preferred format? markdown?

Should it be rendered as web help in some way (in the future)? how about
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (so markdown is still the input source)? Also
what should go on the website and should the current one change
(documentation wise)?

Do you want me to open issues there for those points? At least the first
point would make sense to clarify first right?

The ReaR User Guides uses mkDocs and is written in MarkDown already. The
rendering to web-pages is done automatically after each PR via GitHub
Actions.  
My first thought was to make the User Guide as complete as possible
including a developers section (why not?). On longer term I would remove
the documenation from the ReaR main sources and keep it at one place as
it doesn't make sense to duplicate the documentation.  
Personnally I use a docker image to write on the documentation as such
it is a bit more portable ;-) (at least for me). And, it is easier to
test updates on the underlying software.

Sure open issues so we can have a dicsussion on each point seperate. The
more people involved the better I would say.
