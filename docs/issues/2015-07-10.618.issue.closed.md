I'm testing Rear on OracleLinux 6 (a fully compatible respin of RHEL6),
using Bareos as the backup device.

Restore image built successfully and was used to boot, partition, and
restore the machine.

However, it failed installing grub - it appeared to be trying to install
into /boot/grub ,not /mnt/local/boot/grub. The error was:-

Installing GRUB boot loader  
ERROR: Could not find directory /boot/grub

Any suggestions/ideas for a solution to this please?

Been checking further, and it appears nothing in /boot/grub had been
restored? I've checked the backups and the files are present in there.

If Bareos did not restore all the files into /mnt/local then it won't
work.  
Maybe there is a bug in the Bareos restore part?

Apologies for this... It was entirely user error..

Have now successfully restored & booted my test machine.
