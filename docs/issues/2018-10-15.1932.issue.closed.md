#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    all template values from issue \#1930

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    It would be nice to include zfs binaries and optionally restore zfs
    pool layout  
    essential binaries would be zfs zpool zdb zstreamdump mount.zfs  
    pool layout and zfs datasets with properties save/restore should
    be  
    similar to how save/restore partitions layout works  
    user should be responsible for restoring the rest of zfs contents
    (files, volumes)  
    at minimum looking for zfs binaries would be a good start

-   Work-around, if any:

To get only plain ZFS setup binaries and whatever ZFS related helper
files  
into the ReaR recovery system you can use generic ReaR config
variables  
like COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, and LIBS,  
see the comments in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

When you have your basic operating system on ZFS  
things get somewhat complicated because then you would have to  
manually do your ZFS setup and mount it appropriately (under
/mnt/local)  
in the running recovery system before you can restore the backup  
of your basic operating system.

I think (but I did not test it) you could do such a missing ZFS setup  
before the backup gets restored by enforcing ReaR's so called  
"migration mode" via `export MIGRATION_MODE='true'` before  
you run `rear -D recover`.

In migration mode there are several user dialogs that let you  
interrupt and change the ReaR recovery procedure as you need it.

For example you may manually enhance the diskrestore.sh script  
with your needed ZFS setup commands or alternatively you may interrupt  
the ReaR recovery procedure after the disk layout was recreated  
as far as ReaR could do it (i.e. without ZFS setup) but just before
the  
backup gets restored and at that point change into the ReaR shell  
and do your missing ZFS setup manually there.

You may also have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1912\#issuecomment-423475172](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1912#issuecomment-423475172)  
and for a different example how ReaR's migration mode is used  
for some special task have a look at  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html)

In contrast when you do not have your basic operating system on ZFS  
(but e.g. only some particular application data like a database
system)  
then I would thoroughly recommend as far as possible  
to keep separated things separated, cf.

@mailinglists35 Feel free to prepare a pull request so you help other
with ZFS integration issues as well. Thanks.
