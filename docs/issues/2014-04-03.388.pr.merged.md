Wrong fs list used during restore process. Current code uses
'/tmp/list\_of\_fs\_objects' which contains all fs of all backuped
servers in the DP environment. This is wrong.  
Must use the "filtered" list '/tmp/dp\_list\_of\_fs\_objects' which
contains only the fs for the specific server.  
File is beeing generated in prior script
(verify/../50\_select\_dp\_restore.sh).
