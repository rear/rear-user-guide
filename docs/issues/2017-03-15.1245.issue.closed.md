During  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241)  
I noticed that for "rear -D ..."  
there is no 'set -x' output in the log file  
which makes it nedlessly hard to debug  
issues in usr/sbin/rear itself.

Therefore I like to suggest that for '-D'  
the 'set -x' is also done in usr/sbin/rear itself.

Or is there a good reason why for '-D'  
no 'set -x' is done in usr/sbin/rear itself?
