Fixed, simplified and enhanced GRUB2 installation  
plus fixed typos 'whereto' -&gt; 'where to'

-   Type: **Bug Fix** and **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Currently tested only on SLES12 to keep backward compatibility  
    (as far as I can test it with reasonable effort for me).  
    I need to also test it on SLES15 (tomorrow).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Fixed finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_grub2.sh according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828\#issuecomment-398717889](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-398717889)

Enhanced GRUB2 installation by the new config variable  
GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES so that now the user can specify  
what he wants if needed.

Cleaned up finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_grub2.sh  
from old inconsistent and even contradictory looking code.

With the current state things do "just work" for me also on SLES15.

With the current state things work much safer for me on SLES12.  
SLES15 will be tested tomorrow.

I am still not fully satisfied how
finalize/GNU/Linux/250\_migrate\_disk\_devices\_layout.sh  
behaves (e.g. it replaces disks like `sda => sdb` also in comments) but
for now  
its changes are no longer possibly fatal for the user because since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/632bc2dee4d5b82cfe91416c81254f0bc9919a70](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/632bc2dee4d5b82cfe91416c81254f0bc9919a70)  
it behaves safer because the original restored files get saved before
they get modified.

In finalize/GNU/Linux/250\_migrate\_disk\_devices\_layout.sh  
I will add the inexplicably missing `popd` at the end  
which is missing since the beginning of that script according to

<pre>
# git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh
</pre>

I cannot see a reason why it is not there in this particular script  
but all other `finalize` scripts have paired `pushd` and `popd`:

<pre>
# for f in $( usr/sbin/rear -s recover | grep -o 'finalize/.*' ) ; do f=usr/share/rear/$f ; echo $f ; egrep '^pushd|^popd' $f ; done

usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh
pushd $TARGET_FS_ROOT >/dev/null

usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/250_migrate_lun_wwid.sh
pushd $TARGET_FS_ROOT >&2
popd >&2 

usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh
pushd $TARGET_FS_ROOT >/dev/null
popd >/dev/null
</pre>

I found another lonely `pushd` in
output/ISO/Linux-ia64/800\_create\_isofs.sh  
by inspecting the output of

<pre>
# for f in $( find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ ) ; do test -f $f || continue ; echo $f ; egrep 'pushd|popd|return' $f 2>/dev/null ; echo =================================== ; done
</pre>

With the current state things do "just work" for me  
on SLES12 and also on SLES15.

SLES11 is not affected because SLES11 uses GRUB Legacy.

I will merge it soon today unless there are objections  
because I like to have those changes tested by users  
who use our latest GitHub master code.

Next week I like to clean up the GRUB2 installation  
in the same way for the PPC64LE architecture, i.e.  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/620\_install\_grub2.sh

A recent test (
[https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/65](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues/65)
) revealed that the new code fails on centos/7
