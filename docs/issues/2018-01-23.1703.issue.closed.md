    BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When i booting with iso image i get the original ip-address instead
    of an dhcp address. The original server ip-adress is not in the dhcp
    address range. I can run on the rescue prompt dhclient -r and
    dhclient to get an dhcp address.
-   Work-around, if any:

@RolfWeilen What is the content of `/etc/rear/rescue.conf` when booted
in rescue mode?

Hi

<pre>
RESCUE res9901:~ # cat /etc/rear/rescue.conf 
# initialize our /etc/rear/rescue.conf file sourced by the rear command in recover mode
# also the configuration is sourced by system-setup script during booting our recovery image

SHARE_DIR="/usr/share/rear"
CONFIG_DIR="/etc/rear"
VAR_DIR="/var/lib/rear"
LOG_DIR="/var/log/rear"

# The following 3 lines were added through 210_include_dhclient.sh
USE_DHCLIENT=y
DHCLIENT_BIN=dhclient
DHCLIENT6_BIN=

# TMPDIR variable may be defined in local.conf file as prefix dir for mktemp command
# e.g. by defining TMPDIR=/var we would get our BUILD_DIR=/var/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXX
# However, in rescue we want our BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rear.XXXXXXX as we are not sure that
# the user defined TMPDIR would exist in our rescue image
# by 'unset TMPDIR' we achieve above goal (as rescue.conf is read after local.conf)!
unset TMPDIR
</pre>

Best reagards

@RolfWeilen

I see several of your config variables set as

<pre>
VARIABLE=n
</pre>

which may or may not work as expected  
depending on each particular case.

Often config variables that have a boolean meaning  
must be set as described in default.conf

<pre>
# Boolean variables can be set to anything as we only check whether the variable
# is not empty so that both VAR=yes and VAR=no evaluate to boolean 'true'.
# To set a boolean variable to 'false' set it to an empty value.
</pre>

In particular regarding

<pre>
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=n
</pre>

there is in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

<pre>
# with USE_STATIC_NETWORKING no networking setup via DHCP must happen
# see default.conf: USE_STATIC_NETWORKING overrules USE_DHCLIENT
test "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" && return
</pre>

Accordingly I think DHCP will work with

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT=y
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=
</pre>

or even better without any setting of USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING in
local.conf  
because in default.conf it is

<pre>
# Say "y", "Yes" (or any not empty string) to enable static networking (overrules USE_DHCLIENT):
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=
</pre>

In general regarding debugging issues with the start up scripts  
that are run initially in the ReaR recovery system:

The basic idea behind is to not let those start up scripts  
run automatically and mostly silently but manually  
one after the other with 'set -x' bash debugging mode.

Add 'debug' to the ReaR kernel command line  
when booting the ReaR recovery/rescue system.

In the ReaR recovery/rescue system boot menue select  
the topmost enty of the form "Recover HOSTNAME"  
and press the \[Tab\] key to edit the boot command line  
and append the word ' debug' at its end and boot that.

You may found yourself stopped at a blank screen.  
In this case press \[Enter\] which runs the very first of the  
start up scripts (/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00functions.sh).  
There is some bug that the initial message is not always  
printed so you may need to type the very first \[Enter\] blindly.

The further start up scripts are run one by one  
each one after pressing \[Enter\].

In 'debug' mode the start up scripts are run with 'set -x'  
so that this way you can better see what actually goes on  
in each of the start up scripts.

Hi  
This config works  
USE\_DHCLIENT=y  
USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=

Thanks a lot.

@RolfWeilen  
thank you for the confirmation that it works.

Check also your other `VAR=n` settings in your local.conf  
whether or not each one actually works as you expect.

@jsmeix perhaps we should add an additional check for some variables if
they are set to false to define these correctly in the rescue.conf ? Or,
is this too much overhead? Just for those vars we are supposed to be
empty instead of 'n'?

From my point of view additional checks are more a dirty band-aid hack.

I think we should better implement support for user-friendly boolean
variables  
by using the is\_true() and is\_false() functions everywhere.

On the other hand using the is\_true() and is\_false() functions
everywhere  
is perhaps too much work for now so that as a band-aid hack to mitigate
such issues  
we might perhaps implement some
"fix\_falsely\_set\_boolean\_false\_variables.sh"  
that is run very early for all relevant workflows where things could get
fixed like

<pre>
is_false "$VAR" && VAR=""
</pre>

The existing verify/default/040\_validate\_variables.sh  
is not the right script where such things could be implemented  
because the 'verify' stage only runs for the 'recover' workflow.
