#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): No explicit issue.

-   How was this pull request tested? openSUSE Leap 15.1 Baremetal via
    USB rescue medium

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

I worked on several improvements (e.g. error handling, output to logfile
etc. in regard to use Borg with rear).

Since this is my first attempt in contributing to rear, I tried
following
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)
the same as
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style).

Since I could only test my changes for my openSUSE Leap 15.1 setup and
I'm not sure how you test new changes in rear to not break anything, I'm
aware that this PR may not be accepted as is.

Please have a look at my commits nevertheless, and I'm happy to get
feedback.

Hello @flyinggreenfrog,

Many thanks for you work, it looks good for me at least at the first
sight ;-).  
I'd like however to take some time and do some additional testing before
it will be merged.

If I understand it well from plain looking, this patch will enable Borg
to be used with USB ?  
If so, could you please add your use case to
[doc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#rear-with-borg-back-end)
and
[examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)
?

@jsmeix @gdha can you tell me how much time remains before ReaR 2.6 will
be released?

V.

Hello @jsmeix,

Could you please review code responsible for IO redirection
`0<&6 1>&7 2>&8`, `0<&6 1>&7 2> >(tee >(cat 1>&2) >&8)` and friends,
because, frankly, I have only little clue how this works inside ReaR
;-).

Thanks

@gozora  
regarding `0<&6 1>&7 2>&8` see the section  
"What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

The `0<&6 1>&7 2> >(tee >(cat 1>&2) >&8)` is something  
that I am currently trying to decipher...

This patch is not specific to USB, but I was only testing it with
OUTPUT=USB. It should work the same with other outputs.

Generally I want to "copy" stderr from Borg in some cases, that this
output can go to the logfile and to stderr (for the user to see while
create, prune or extract the backup). Does that make sense to you?

I tried to follow
[https://stackoverflow.com/a/45798436](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45798436).

Yes, I challenged myself yesterday to create this PR, that maybe it
still can make it to the new version ;-)

But of course enough testing has to be done before, that it doesn't
break anything.

Please provide such explanations for complicated code parts  
as comments directly in the bash scripts because in practice  
git commit messages are lost (i.e. not easily accessible)  
when someone else (another user) looks at the code in a script  
at any time later because the user may not have a git checkout  
but only the plain script when he is using (not developing) ReaR.

Could you please send me your configuration file(s) (local.conf,
site.conf)? I'd love see config you've tested with.

I'll do my best to finish review as soon as I can ...

@gozora  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones)  
regarding due date for ReaR 2.6

    ReaR v2.6
    Due by May 30, 2020 

so no need to hurry right now.  
Next week is still perfectly fine.

Please ignore this message of mine.  
Despite I actually wrote the code, I've totally forgotten that ReaR (on
Borg back end) works with USB already :-)  
I'm getting old ...

I tried to work on all your comments.

Moreover I added several other commits to this PR especially for working
on code quality checks with shellcheck
([https://www.shellcheck.net](https://www.shellcheck.net)).

Hopefully you can also please review them, thanks.

Since I was sick the last days, I will try to work on the outstanding
remarks in the evening. Sorry for delay.

@flyinggreenfrog  
thank you for your notification.  
No rush - take your time!  
I promise the world will not end at ReaR 2.6 release date ;-)  
I can promise that because if I was wrong nobody could blame me ;-)
