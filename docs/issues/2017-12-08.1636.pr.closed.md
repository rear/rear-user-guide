-   added the "-h" option to tar to follow the symbolic links  
    instead of adding just the symbolic link to the tar archive  
    We run into this issue with /etc/localtime (issue \#1635)
-   commented out in skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
    the localtime copy lines (as the /usr/share/zoneinfo is not  
    present anyway in the rescue environment)

I think this is serious enough to still push it into the release 2.3,
agree?

As far as I see this is a backward incompatible change  
because without '-h' tar copies symbolic links as symbolic links  
so that there can be symbolic links in the recovery system  
while with '-h' tar copies the files symbolic links point to  
so that there can be no longer symbolic links in the recovery system  
which might blow up the recovery system with several copies  
of the same (possibly big) file where several symbolic links  
point to on the original system.

I fear such a backward incompatible change will cause  
unexpected and unwanted bad side effects in this or that  
unforeseen special cases.

Couldn't the actual issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1635](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1635)  
be solved with a specific solution only for that issue e.g. like

<pre>
localtime_link_target="$( readlink -e /etc/localtime )"
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/localtime "$localtime_link_target" )
</pre>

FYI:

On my SLES11 system:

<pre>
# ls -l /etc/localtime
-rw-r--r-- 3 root root 2335 Jun 17  2015 /etc/localtime

# readlink -e /etc/localtime
/etc/localtime
</pre>

On my SLES12 system:

<pre>
# ls -l /etc/localtime
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 Jul 28 10:40 /etc/localtime -> ../usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin

# readlink -e /etc/localtime
/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin
</pre>

I even found some broken symbolic links in the recovery system:

<pre>
# for l in $( find /tmp/rear.n8XNBDuAB0fhlXn/rootfs -xtype l ) ; do file $l ; done
/tmp/rear.n8XNBDuAB0fhlXn/rootfs/etc/localtime: broken symbolic link to `../usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin'
/tmp/rear.n8XNBDuAB0fhlXn/rootfs/dev/device-mapper: broken symbolic link to `mapper/control'
/tmp/rear.n8XNBDuAB0fhlXn/rootfs/dev/char/10:236: broken symbolic link to `../mapper/control'
</pre>

The change

<pre>
--- a/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh
+++ b/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh

-if ! tar -v -X $copy_as_is_exclude_file -P -C / -c "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" 2>$copy_as_is_filelist_file | tar $v -C $ROOTFS_DIR/ -x 1>/dev/null ; then
+if ! tar -v -X $copy_as_is_exclude_file -h -P -C / -c "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" 2>$copy_as_is_filelist_file | tar $v -C $ROOTFS_DIR/ -x 1>/dev/null ; then
</pre>

has horrible consequences on my SLES12 test system:

Now "usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue" takes ages at  
"Copying files and directories" so that I aborted it  
and the recovery system size before was 208M  
but with that change (and aborted "Copying files and directories")  
it became 1.8G

I would like to caution against this change: IMHO symlinks should be
copied as-is into the rescue system and not converted into files or
directories. IMHO the danger to mess up the system is way too big and
especially the danger to bloat up the rescue image (as @jsmeix
observed). I think that in most cases the symlinks were put in place
purposefully so that we should leave them as there were intended.

For the few known cases where this is a problem we should add extra code
to handle it, e.g. `/etc/localtime`.

If you want to help with finding such places then I would suggest to add
code that checks symlinks and reports broken symlinks, especially if
they were not broken in the source system.

With the added '-h' it seems "rear mkrescue" even hangs up at  
"Copying files and directories" because since several minutes  
the ReaR log file stays at

<pre>
# tail /root/rear.master/var/log/rear/rear-f48.log
...
++ tar -v -C /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/ -x
++ tar -v -X /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/tmp/copy-as-is-exclude -h -P -C / -c /root/rear.master/usr/share/rear /root/rear.master/var/lib/rear /dev /etc/inputrc ...
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
</pre>

The recovery system does no longer grow noticeable  
because since several minutes it stays at 1.8G

<pre>
# du -hs /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
1.8G    /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
</pre>

but when counting bytes one can see it still grows slowly:

<pre>
# for i in 1 2 3 ; do date +%T ; du -bs /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/ ; sleep 10 ; done
14:29:17
1739527435      /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
14:29:28
1739533555      /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
14:29:38
1739541339      /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
</pre>

so that something is still creeping on...  
...  
...after more than half an hour I aborted it again  
and got:

<pre>
# date +%T ; du -bs /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
14:56:02
1740243069      /tmp/rear.9h061udK1yV7mTo/rootfs/
</pre>

Good that I asked your opinion! As issue \#1638 has been made to tackle
this I will close this PR without merging. We can solve it differently.

I documented that symbolic links must be copied as symbolic links  
(i.e. why 'tar -h' must not be used for COPY\_AS\_IS).
