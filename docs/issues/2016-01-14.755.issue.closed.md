This issue is primarily intended to document and discuss  
a very special use case.  
This issue is no bug report.  
It might become a valid enhancement request for the future.

Some users strip down their systems to only  
what is really needed to run the system.

On such systems a lot of "usually installed" stuff  
that is needed by rear could be missing.

In particular all what is only needed to install the system  
but not to run it.  
For example what is needed for disk partitioning (e.g. parted)  
and for creating filesystems (e.g. mkfs.\*) could be missing.

Or "usually installed" standard tools that are not needed  
for a particular very specific use case.

E.g. from @mbrookhuis I got a report about a system  
where 'less' is not installed.

To find out what programs rear usually needs,  
inspect the files in /usr/share/rear/conf/  
for the contents of the variables REQUIRED\_PROGS  
and PROGS and for documentation  
see /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Currently a lot of needed programs are defined via PROGS  
where /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf reads:

<pre>
These progs are optional, if they are missing, nothing happens.
</pre>

The "nothing happens" is not exactly true because  
if they are missing they are silently not included  
in the ISO image of the recovery system but  
if they are actually called in the recovery system  
then an error happens during recovery.

As a first step it would be nice to avoid in advance  
such errors during recovery.

My fist idea is moving more of them from PROGS  
to REQUIRED\_PROGS so that the user gets  
an early error during "rear mkbackup".

But in practice this is complicated because e.g.  
on nowadays systems mkfs.btrfs is usually needed  
but on older systems that may not exist.

A better approach would be to replace step by step  
the current static lists of PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
by generated lists during "rear mkbackup" depending  
on what is actually needed to recreate a particular system.

E.g. when a btrfs filesystem is to be recreated  
then mkfs.btrfs is added to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
otherwise it is left as is in PROGS.

This approach would be fully backward compatible.

But this approach would not really help on very minimal systems  
where neither parted nor mkfs.\* is installed.

One way for such very minimal systems is to install them  
as usual (i.e. with all usual tools), then let rear create  
its recovery system ISO image and afterwards remove  
what is not needed to run the system.

For the future an alternative and more generic way  
for very minimal systems could be a prebuilt static  
rear recovery system that is relatively big because  
it contains basically everything that is ever needed  
to recreate any system, cf.  
"generic 'static/fixed' rear installation system" in

I agree with @jsmeix  
The problem is that there is an error and you get an option to read the
file and then get the error.

Some remarks:

-   I suspect that when a progs is in REQUIRED\_PROGS the mkrescue will
    fail. This is OK when some really needed programs are missing. eg
    mkfs.\* in the example.
-   for less, I would suggest that we check if less is there, and if not
    change to the use of: cat <log>|more. These are part of bash and
    should always be present.

Only as a side note - perhaps I detected a bug:  
In /etc/rear/local.conf I have

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" qqq )
</pre>

but I got no error during "rear mkrescue"

<pre>

@gdha  
what is the intended behaviour when someting  
in REQUIRED\_PROGS is missing?

usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf reads

<pre>
# program files (find them in the path). These progs are optional,
# if they are missing, nothing happens
PROGS=( )
# required programs. Same as above, but if they are missing, we abort.
REQUIRED_PROGS=(
</pre>

Under what exact circumstances should rear abort  
if something in REQUIRED\_PROGS is missing?

Perhaps a custom busybox would be a solution.

Careful! Most of our code relies on advanced features of the GNU
utilities. Busybox with its reduced featureset will definitively break a
lot of code.

I think the really actionable item from this issue is cleaning up the
PROGS / REQUIRED\_PROGS relationship. And making it fail if a
REQUIRED\_PROGS entry is missing.

Maybe we can automatically scan rear code during build time to fill
these variables?

We should start by defining *minimal system*?  
When rear detects an executable is missing in array REQUIRED\_PROGS it
will fail with an error.  
OTOH lots of executables listed in PROGS are assumed to be available by
default (part of core GNU/Linux system). This could lead to migrating
lots of executables listed in PROGS to REQUIRED\_PROGS.

@gdha  
see my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755\#issuecomment-171603580](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755#issuecomment-171603580)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755\#issuecomment-171607112](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755#issuecomment-171607112)

For me "rear mkrescue" did not fail with an error.

Under what exact circumstances should rear "fail with an error"  
if something in REQUIRED\_PROGS is missing?

In general regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755\#issuecomment-171603294](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755#issuecomment-171603294)  
"check if a standard tool is there, and if not work around it":

Theoretically it is doable but in practice nobody does it  
i.e. nobody implements that consistently everywhere  
so that one could really rely on it.

Therefore I think leit's Keep It Simple and Straightforward  
(cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS\_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)):

Move everything where usual system admins assume  
it is available from PROGS to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
and let "rear mkrecsue"/"rear mkbackup" fail if something  
in REQUIRED\_PROGS is actually not available.

This way running "rear mkrecsue"/"rear mkbackup" on  
very minimal systems would fail which tells the user/admin  
about the issue.

@schlomo regarding  
"automatically scan rear code for required programs":

I had the same issue some time ago when I liked to specify  
RPM package requirements for what is needed by rear.

As far as I understand it the basic problem is to scan bash scripts  
for what programs are called.

I searched the Internet a lot to find out if that is possible  
(to some reasonable extent) but I failed to find a solution.  
I only found comments why it is not possible.  
At that time I gave up.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892)
is done  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1961)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1962](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1962)  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" should reliably error out when  
a program in REQUIRED\_PROGS is missing in the recovery system.

But this is not sufficient because specific mandatrory programs  
get not added to REQUIRED\_PROGS, see
