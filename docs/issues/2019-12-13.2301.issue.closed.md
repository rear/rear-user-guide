Current ReaR master code:

I did a second "rear recover" on my laptop.

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2300\#issue-536902187](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2300#issue-536902187)  
for the system details of "my laptop".

Now I have in the (two times) recreated system:

    # ls -lhtr /root/rear-*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 41 Dec 11 17:26 /root/rear-2019-12-11T17:26:13+01:00.log -> /var/log/rear/recover/rear-linux-88cr.log
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 41 Dec 12 14:23 /root/rear-2019-12-12T14:23:30+01:00.log -> /var/log/rear/recover/rear-linux-88cr.log

    # ls -l /var/log/rear/recover/rear-linux-88cr.log
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 763855 Dec 12 14:23 /var/log/rear/recover/rear-linux-88cr.log

The old `rear-2019-12-11T17:26:13+01:00.log` symlink  
points to the same latest /var/log/rear/recover/rear-linux-88cr.log  
that actually belongs to the newest
`rear-2019-12-12T14:23:30+01:00.log`.

Outdated /root/rear-DATE-TIMESTAMP.log symlinks should be simply
removed  
in wrapup/default/990\_copy\_logfile.sh just before creating the current
one.

I think it is not needed to keep old
/var/log/rear/recover/rear-linux-88cr.log  
(at least not for now until a user really requests that with a good
reason)  
because "rear recover" means installation (reinstalling from scratch),  
cf.

    Disaster recovery means installation (reinstalling from scratch)

in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
so in a "(re)installed from scratch" system there should be usually  
no need for a log file from a previous (re)installation from scratch.

With

merged  
this issue should be fixed.
