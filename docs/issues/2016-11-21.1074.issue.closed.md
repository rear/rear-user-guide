With BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental or BACKUP\_TYPE=differential  
all backup archives have a date prefix.

Full backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-F.tar.gz  
where the 'F' denotes a full backup.

Incremental backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-I.tar.gz  
where the 'I' denotes an incremental backup.

Differential backups are of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-D.tar.gz  
where the last 'D' denotes a differential backup.

The advantage of the date prefix is that  
there is no longer the need for an explicit  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY  
because all backup archives have different file names  
so that no old one gets overwritten.

In other words, with BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental  
or BACKUP\_TYPE=differential there is implicitly  
a NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY functionality.

Now I wonder if we should also use a date prefix  
for the normal backup (currently "backup.tar.gz")  
and treat that case exactly the same as the "full backup" case  
for BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental/differential.

In short:  
I ask if BACKUP\_TYPE="" should result a backup archive  
of the form YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-F.tar.gz

Of course if during "rear recover"  
there is no YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-F.tar.gz  
it would fall back using backup.tar.gz  
more precisely:  
$BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE$BACKUP\_PROG\_SUFFIX$BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_SUFFIX

@jsmeix The variable NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY is not obsolete as
most users do **not** use the incremental/differential backup types.
They just want a save copy of their weekly tar-ball.

@jsmeix And, to answer your question if `BACKUP_TYPE=""` should we use
the form `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-F.tar.gz` : I am *not* in favour as with lots
of users it could fill up disk space if they do not clean-up in time.
Especially in environments where they have thousands of Linux systems.

I did not mean to obsolete NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY.  
I only meant that with date prefixed backup archive filenames  
one gets a KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP functionality "for free".

I agree that by default we should not use date prefixed backup  
archive filenames because users who like to use that can specify  
it manually in their local.conf as they like, for example via

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="$( date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M' )-F"
</pre>

to get the same full backup file name for BACKUP\_TYPE=""  
as what would be used for BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental  
or BACKUP\_TYPE=differential.

I think I will add a explanatory comment to default.conf  
about that issue.

Excellent idea as even I was doubting ;-)
