Latest rear master on a SLE12-SP1  
x86\_64 kvm/qemu virtual machine with BIOS:

Some Git commit after the Git commit  
bd3d2ac41c7ed04352abd28de16b9493aff40683  
result that the rear recovery system hangs up  
during its startup phase so that it never reaches  
the shell prompt (where one would log in as root  
and run "rear recover").

I.e. it boots but then during (I guess systemd's)  
startup procedure it hangs up.

The Git commit  
bd3d2ac41c7ed04352abd28de16b9493aff40683  
is the last one which I have in my rear118a RPM package on  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/rear118a](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/rear118a)  
which works on my above mentioned SLE12-SP1 machine.

My problem is that I have no clue how I could debug  
such kind of low-level issues when I even cannot log in  
at the rear recovery system.

@gdha  
could you help me how to debug such issues?

@jsmeix Do you have an idea in which stage it hangs? What was the last
line you saw on the screen?  
From which media did you boot (iso or ramdisk)?  
Most changes were on UEFI (not your area of testing), multipath (not
used in your case I think?), BACKUP schemes checks, perhaps the
`skel/default/etc/scripts/run-sshd` modifucation?  
Otherwise, try a dirdiff between the last good base and the master?

I will provide a screenshot soon...

I boot my virtual kvm/qemu machine from  
its virtual CD-ROM drive where I have  
in the host system the rear-<hostnam>.iso  
connected to the virtual CD-ROM drive.

In this case here (not too many commits)  
I can (and will) do a bisecting until I found  
the commit that makes it fail.

@jsmeix perhaps check
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/844](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/844)
commit.

After several futile attemts to find an older commit  
where it works again I come to the conclusion  
that something got somehow messed up  
on my test system.

On a new from scratch installed SLES12-SP1 system  
(same kind of kvm/qemu virtual machine)  
everything "just works" with the current master.

Accordingly I close the issue as "false alarm".

@gdha  
many thanks for your time!

FYI:  
If I remember correctly this is the second time  
where rear failed on a test system after many tests.  
I have the dim feeling it is relatively easily possible  
to somehow mess up rear or even something in  
the system when doing a lot to and fro with rear.  
Of course I cannot reproduce reight now what  
exactly got somehow messed up.
