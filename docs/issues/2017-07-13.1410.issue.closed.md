Hello Guys,

Looks like we are missing something like:

    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://
    Write the ISO image using nfs and the NSF protocol.

in
[03-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc#using-iso-as-output-method)

Would anybody mind if I add this?

V.

Please ignore my last (now deleted) comment, you are of course talking
about documentation. Yes, that would be very kind of you. Thanks a lot.
