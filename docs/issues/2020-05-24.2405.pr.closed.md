##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal** (for me it's **High** otherwise I can't restore
    to LUKS encrypted device)

-   Reference to related issue (URL): No new explicit issue, but
    reoccurrence of \#679 (or \#972)

-   How was this pull request tested? openSUSE Leap 15.1. Baremetal via
    USB rescue medium

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

With a3ce9fe020d0f8b423e01fd0001776198a21ed8e needed cracklib files were
added. In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/679\#issuecomment-192379400](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/679#issuecomment-192379400)
it was stated that this commit was fixing that issue.

However, if I test from current master
ad0f26351860f5ef50a58a3ed7844353c196ab26 I ran into the same problems as
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/679\#issue-114138180](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/679#issue-114138180).

If I change `/usr/share/cracklib/\*` to `/usr/share/cracklib/*` (this
PR) needed cracklib files are present in rescue/restore system and
restore works like expected.

Besides that PR, I'm asking myself:

-   What is the correct way to specify things to `COPY_AS_IS` with glob
    patterns?  
    According to conf/default.conf (line 1358 and following):

        # Usually globbing patterns in COPY_AS_IS are specified without quoting
        # like COPY_AS_IS+=( /my/directory/* /path/to/my/files* )
        # so that the bash pathname expansion works as usually intended

    Why was in a3ce9fe020d0f8b423e01fd0001776198a21ed8e
    `/usr/share/cracklib/\*` added instead of `/usr/share/cracklib/*`
    and it was working, and now in current master it doesn't work again?

-   I don't know, if \#2378 changed some behavior unintentionally?

Just tested with commit aa82834d0ae5415c17d8300f3733d621b0e91b63 (Tag

@flyinggreenfrog  
thank you for your issue report.

Something severe has changed since the ReaR 2.5  
in general what build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
copies.

A lot of other stuff is no longer copied into the recovery system  
because of lots of `tar` arguments that are now quoted.

This affects all places where `tar` arguments are set as

    COPY_AS_IS+=( '/path/to/directory/*' )

but also in the older form

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" '/path/to/directory/*' )

It seems the root cause happens before the script  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
is run because it seems when it is run those `tar` arguments  
appear already quoted so that then `tar` is run as

    tar ... '/path/to/directory/*'

which lets `tar` report

    tar: /path/to/directory/*: Cannot stat: No such file or directory

for example:

    # tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar /usr/share/cracklib/*
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    /usr/share/cracklib/cracklib.magic
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.hwm
    /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwd
    /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwi

    # tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar '/usr/share/cracklib/*'
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    tar: /usr/share/cracklib/*: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

Got it!

I can make things work again when I add

    COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} )

at the beginning of usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh

Ugh!  
What a mess we have in our code!

In ReaR 2.5 we had for example in  
rescue/GNU/Linux/550\_copy\_ldconfig.sh

    COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /etc/ld.so.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/* )

which is the last script that had always re-written COPY\_AS\_IS  
before build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh is run  
but now that was changed to

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/ld.so.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/* )

which does no longer re-write COPY\_AS\_IS  
but keep its already existing entries as is.

The falsely used unquoted `${COPY_AS_IS[@]}`  
had resulted that the COPY\_AS\_IS array members  
got rewritten in a duplicated falsely false way  
so that things had worked by accident for `tar`.

For example

    # tarfiles=( '/usr/share/cracklib/*' )

    # tarfiles=( "${tarfiles[@]}" '/etc/issue' )

    # ( set -x ; echo "${tarfiles[@]}" )
    + echo '/usr/share/cracklib/*' /etc/issue
    /usr/share/cracklib/* /etc/issue

    # ( set -x ; tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar "${tarfiles[@]}" )
    + tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar '/usr/share/cracklib/*' /etc/issue
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    tar: /usr/share/cracklib/*: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
    /etc/issue
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

or the same behaviour with `array+=( additional elements )`

    # tarfiles=( '/usr/share/cracklib/*' )

    # tarfiles+=( '/etc/issue' )

    # ( set -x ; echo "${tarfiles[@]}" )
    + echo '/usr/share/cracklib/*' /etc/issue
    /usr/share/cracklib/* /etc/issue

    # ( set -x ; tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar "${tarfiles[@]}" )
    + tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar '/usr/share/cracklib/*' /etc/issue
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    tar: /usr/share/cracklib/*: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
    /etc/issue
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

versus duplicated falsely false things that work by accident:

    # tarfiles=( '/usr/share/cracklib/*' )

    # tarfiles=( ${tarfiles[@]} '/etc/issue' )

    # ( set -x ; echo "${tarfiles[@]}" )
    + echo /usr/share/cracklib/cracklib.magic /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.hwm /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwd /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwi /etc/issue
    /usr/share/cracklib/cracklib.magic /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.hwm /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwd /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwi /etc/issue

    # ( set -x ; tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar "${tarfiles[@]}" )
    + tar -cvf /tmp/testy.tar /usr/share/cracklib/cracklib.magic /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.hwm /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwd /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwi /etc/issue
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    /usr/share/cracklib/cracklib.magic
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.hwm
    /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwd
    /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict.pwi
    /etc/issue

I will clean that up...

Currently I think a minimal change to make things work again  
and to not cause unexpected regressions for users that use  
in their etc/rear/local.conf any kind of the methods

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" '/path/to/directory/*' )

    COPY_AS_IS+=( '/path/to/directory/*' )
    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/directory/* )

is the following diff in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh

At current master with your commit it's working for me again.

Just tested backup/restore for me.

@jsmeix Thanks for your fast solution of this issue.

I assume I just delete this branch, since finally no new commit was
added? Or will it still be merged with commit and reverting commit to
have this issue shown in the history?

A side note:

Currently we have several places where we specify

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/directory/* )

instead of just the wanted directory

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/directory )

I found out that the `/path/to/directory/*` form is another fragile
way  
how ReaR code works in certain cases because of sublte side-effects.

I tried if in usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
the following diff also works

    -COPY_AS_IS+=( '/etc/ssl/certs/*' '/etc/pki/*' '/usr/lib/ssl/*' '/usr/share/ca-certificates/*' '/etc/ca-certificates/*' )
    +COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/ssl/certs/ /etc/pki/ /usr/lib/ssl/ /usr/share/ca-certificates/ /etc/ca-certificates/ )

That failed because I got only the plain `/etc/ssl/certs/` directory  
without any files therein copied into the recovery system.  
But the other directories were copied with all their contents.

The reason is that (at least on my openSUSE leap 15.1 system)  
`/etc/ssl/certs/` is a symlink with target
`/var/lib/ca-certificates/pem`  
and the `tar` in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh must
intentionally  
not follow symlinks (see the comment in 100\_copy\_as\_is.sh).

So when `/path/to/directory` is a symlink it helps to specify  
`COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/directory/* )` to get all directory contents  
copied into the recovery system (of course except files that start with
`.`)

In particular regarding the `/etc/ssl/certs/*` usage see

@jsmeix in order to perform filename expansion (glob expansion) but not
word splitting (to support filenames with spaces properly), one can
apparently set IFS to an empty string.

@pcahyna  
I would very much appreciate it if you could help to find a good
solution  
for our current fragile way how things cet copied into the recovery
system.

For now - i.e. for the ReaR 2.6 release - I will better explain in
default.conf  
how COPY\_AS\_IS must be used, in particular that symlinks cannot be
followed.

After the ReaR 2.6 release we can think about how to improve things  
in a more relaxed way.

The current `tar ... ${COPY_AS_IS[*]}` works same as things had worked  
all the time before via accidental
`COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} ... )`  
so there are no regressions but now it is described at the right place  
(i.e. in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh) how things work.

@jsmeix I understand and very much appreciate the point about no
regressions. I would like to improve this area, but unfortunately the
amount of time I can spend on ReaR nowadays is limited, so I can't
promise anything.
