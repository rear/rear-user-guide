I have neither a AWS EC2 system nor do I use Amazon Linux 2  
so I canot tell how ReaR behaves with that.

To have at least a chance to imagine  
what goes on on your particular system  
we need at least a "rear -D mkrescue" debug log file, cf.

In contrast to this issue here  
the similar issue there  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3090\#issue-2006425127](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3090#issue-2006425127)  
shows '/dev/nvme0n1p128' in the 'lsblk' output.  
A difference seems to be that  
here it is on a virtual disk '/dev/xvda128'  
while there it is on real hardware '/dev/nvme0n1p128'.

@jsmeix Yes, you are correct, nvme\*\* based VM's are fine but with XVDA
it is not.

@ramzcode  
in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3093\#issuecomment-1827682900](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3093#issuecomment-1827682900)  
your "Debug Log" is only the screen output  
but we need the "rear -D mkrescue" debug log *file*  
i.e. your "log file: /var/log/rear/rear-ip-172-31-5-70.log".

In general:  
Caution with possible secrets in a full debug log file:  
When 'rear' is run via '-D' in debugscript mode  
it logs executed commands via the bash command 'set -x'  
that print commands and their arguments as they are executed  
so in particular when arguments contain secret values  
(e.g. something like a password or whatever else)  
such secret values may appear in the log file.  
Also secrets may be stored in some other files  
like /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
or /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  
cf. `[password=<password>]` in the section  
"Disk layout file syntax" in  
doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc  
online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
So before you attach your full debug log file and other files  
here (GitHub is a public accessible place) inspect your files  
and verify that they do not accidentally cointain secrets.

@jsmeix Sorry for the confusion, my bad mistook the question. Attached
the full log file for your reference. I just want to highlight my
finding that the /dev/xvda128 don't even exist as well. and i don't see
it under the dmesg log as well.

Hi @ramzcode what problem do you actually encounter? Is it the rescue
image not booting? Failing to recover? Recovering but then not being
able to boot the recovered system? Please specify. What does it mean
that "ReaR ignores or fails to record the Boot or Partition that is not
listed under lsblk but available under fdisk or cfdisk" ? How does the
problem manifest?

Please also attach the file `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` if
you believe that ReaR failed to record some partition.

@pcahyna Hi, I have included my query in the first block of this thread.
Backup and Recovery via RAW based disk image boots, but while setting up
the disk layout and installing the boot loader on target VM ReaR
complains that no BIOS type partitions found. This is because from the
source the Disk Layout builder of ReaR failed to identify the BIOS boot
Partition i.e. /dev/xvda128.

Now the prob is recovery works but it won't boot due to improper
partition structure on the target.

NOTE: If you notice LSBLK will not list the 128 Partition that is boot
type. and ReaR relies on lsblk for building Disk layout as of my
understanding.

My understanding is that ReaR uses parted, not lsblk. Please provide the
output of `parted -m -s /dev/xvda print` and also the
`/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file.

It is indeed weird that lsblk does not show `/dev/xvda128`. Does this
device node exist? What does `ls -l /dev/xvda128` show?

As far as I see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/13474729/rear-ip-172-31-5-70.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/13474729/rear-ip-172-31-5-70.log)  
the reason is that /dev/xvda128 is not in /sys/block/\*  
(excerpts)

    + source /usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop0
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop1
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop2
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop3
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop4
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop5
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop6
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=loop7
    ...
    ++ for disk in '/sys/block/*'
    ++ blockd=xvda
    ++ devname=/dev/xvda

so '/sys/block/xvda' is the only one in '/sys/block/\*'  
that has a matching disk device '/dev/xvda'.

From my current point of view it is  
no issue in ReaR when basic system tools (like 'lsblk')  
and basic system files and directories (like '/sys/block/')  
do not show or contain "usually expected" things.

From my current point of view in such cases it means  
the system is somehow not sufficiently normal or  
not sufficiently in compliance with common standards.

See in particular the section "Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@ramzcode  
as far as I currently see  
ReaR won't work with that kind of system  
(and likely lots of other stuff won't work too).  
So I would recommend that you find out how to setup  
a system in AWS that behaves sufficiently in compliance  
with common standards.

By the way:  
I do not understand what the reason for that strange  
partition number 128 for a boot partition could be.  
Normally boot partitions (e.g. bios\_grub, ESP, '/boot')  
are the first partitions on a disk and not the very last one  
that is possible with standard GPT.

If that's the reason, ReaR would not find `/dev/xvda1` either (the
partition with the root filesystem).

Yes /dev/xvda1 is the root XFS filesystem, and it is recorded.

Partitions are not like /sys/block/sda1 but /sys/block/sda/sda1  
so here it is /sys/block/xvda/xvda1 which exists according to

I confused myself with disks and partitions in /sys/block/  
versus disks and partitions in /dev/

Actually it is here that  
/sys/block/xvda/ and /sys/block/xvda/xvda1 exist  
but /sys/block/xvda/xvda128 does not exist according to

@jsmeix Yes, the underlying problem was due to the driver it seems,  
Now after upgrading the kernel to 5.14  
for Amazon Linux 2 on Xen hypervisor typed instance,  
the lsblk is now listing it correctly.  
below is the issue for the same with Amazon Linux Team with more
clarity.

@ramzcode  
thank you for your information what the root cause was!  
From

(excerpts):

    underlying was the /dev/xvda128 itself not created.

    an issue with the xen block driver on earlier kernels

In particular

(excerpt)

    The partitions being in the wrong order is actually intentional.
    For historical reasons, a lot of things out there
    assume root to be partition 1 on Amazon Linux,
    but since it needs to be resized at boot, it has to be at the end.

is interesting for me because it answers my question in
