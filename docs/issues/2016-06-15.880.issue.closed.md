-   rear version: rear-1.16-1.el6.noarch
-   OS version: Oracle Linux Server release 6.6 (RHEL 6.6)
-   rear configuration:  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=TSM
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    We use ReaR backup across our VMware environment, but we are unable
    to boot ReaR ISO on our OVM Guests (PVM - paravirtualized).  
    We followed Oracle documentation to boot from ISO on OVM, mounted
    the ISO on our PXE server and then booted from PXE but nothing comes
    up on console / ISO is not bootable.

Obviously this could be more of an issue with OVM, but I would like to
ask if any of you guys use Rear on OVM paravirtualized guests?

Thanks a million,  
Peter

You should make the ISO file available in your VMware storage pool
somehow and then use the vm console and attach the ISO to your virtual
DVD drive

This is not VMware, but Oracle VM (OVM).  
OVM doesn't support attaching the ISO from console, but instead we have
to boot the ISO from PXE server, it's the only option with
paravirtualized OVM guests (PVM).  
We did that, same way as we boot installation ISOs from PXE and it
doesn't boot.

You could try this::

1.  Copy iso file to pxe server

2.  Install syslinux if you don't already have it installed

3.  Copy memdisk from /usr/lib/syslinux to your pxe folder

4.  Edit pxelinux.cfg/default

And add this:

    LABEL <your iso>
    kernel memdisk
    append iso initrd=<path to iso> raw

    Example:
    LABEL Win PE
    kernel memdisk
    append iso initrd=images/winpe/winpe.iso raw

Paravirtualized guests in OVM do not support traditional boot from PXE,
but only boot from http server (basically not a PXE boot anymore, only
only named as such in OVM).  
There is just is single column called "Network Boot Path", used for
booting from NFS/HTTP.

Normally for installing new servers from golden image, we would use
something like this in Network Boot Path field:  
`--kernel images/pxeboot/vmlinuz --ramdisk images/pxeboot/initrd.img --args="ksdevice=eth0 network bootproto=static ip=<IP_ADDRESS> netmask=<NETMASK> gateway=<GATEWAY>" http://webserver.example.com/examplerepo/OL6/disttree/ol66/`

/examplerepo/OL6/disttree/ol66/ is basically mounted installation CD and
contains files which are used for initial boot:

    images/pxeboot/vmlinuz
    images/pxeboot/initrd.img

Rear ISO only contains isolinux directory and nothing else.  
How can we craft our HTTP style boot path for Rear ISO please?

Thanks a million,  
Peter

To be honest I've never booted from http, so this will be a blind
shot...  
From what you are describing you only need to extract **initrd.cgz** and
**kernel** (I'm not sure now but kernel is called vmlinux in ISO?) from
ISO created by `rear mkrescue/mkbackup` and put put them as parameters
for `--kernel` and `--ramdisk`. Mentioned files should be located in
isolinux directory.

Directly putting the kernel and initrd as they are in ISO worked fine:  
`--kernel isolinux/kernel --ramdisk isolinux/initrd.cgz`

We can now boot from HTTP.  
Thanks very much for help!

Hi pdanek,

Where you have added these parameter --kernel isolinux/kernel --ramdisk
isolinux/initrd.cgz. in OVM Environment

We have option in PVM based VM's to enter the URL in Network Boot Path
only like /examplerepo/OL6/disttree/ol66/
