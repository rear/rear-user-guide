-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**

From some SUSE customer support issues I learned  
that there is confusion what those messages mean,  
both for the user (i.e. for SUSE's customer) and  
also for our (i.e. SUSE's) customer support pepole,  
in particular when someone is not sufficiently  
experienced with ReaR to imagine what actually  
goes on behind the surface regardless of the  
misleading file names in those messages.

    strip the ReaR build including .../rootfs from the found library

-   How was this pull request tested?

See below.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh enhanced  
how files from within the ReaR recovery system  
(i.e. files from within ROOTFS\_DIR)  
are shown to the user:  
In user messages it is misleading to show  
the full path from within the recovery system  
without leading ROOTFS\_DIR e.g. show  
/bin/parted for what actually is  
/var/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/bin/parted  
because for the user /bin/parted means  
the full path on his original system  
but there is no /bin/parted on the original  
system because there it is /usr/sbin/parted  
so to show files inside the recovery system to  
the user even without (the long) leading ROOTFS\_DIR  
we can show them to the user as relative path  
i.e. without leading slashes e.g. as bin/parted  
when from the context it should be clear enough  
that a file inside the recovery system is meant.

Therein in particular this (and same for bin/partprobe)

    bin/parted requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found' (fatal by default)
    bin/parted requires libparted.so.2 which exists as usr/lib64/libparted.so.2

shows that it is not sufficient when something  
that is reported as 'not found' by 'ldd'  
actually exists within the recovery system  
to assume that then the associated program(s)  
will actually work within the recovery system.

In this case only the symlink  
/usr/lib64/libparted.so.2 exists  
but its link target (i.e. the actual library)  
does not exist so parted (and partprobe)  
cannot run within the recovery system.

Regarding using $PRODUCT for the ReaR name (in long),  
i.e. via

    ... PRODUCT="Relax-and-Recover"

in usr/sbin/rear e.g. for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/sbin/rear\#L56](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/sbin/rear#L56)

Because one point of this pull request is  
to get the user messages shorter  
I don't think it is actually helpful for readability  
for the user to use `Relax-and-Recover`  
instead of `ReaR` in user messages.

I think using everywhere the long form `Relax-and-Recover`  
could even make our user messages look a bit  
like "marketing bullshit" - in particular because  
our users are often rather experienced (e.g. admins)  
who may feel rather annoyed to read in user messages  
again and again the long form `Relax-and-Recover`  
instead of the established and well known  
abbreviation `ReaR`.

According to

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f \
     | xargs grep -w 'ReaR' | grep -v ': *#' | wc -l

    82

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f \
     | xargs grep -w 'ReaR' | grep -v ': *#' \
     | cut -s -d ':' -f1 | sort -u | wc -l

    39

we have currently about 82 code places  
in about 39 code files where we use `ReaR`  
(probably some of them are "false positives").

In contrast according to

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f \
     | xargs grep '$PRODUCT' | grep -v ': *#' | wc -l

    39

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f \
     | xargs grep '$PRODUCT' | grep -v ': *#' \
     | cut -s -d ':' -f1 | sort -u | wc -l

    11

we have currently about 39 code places in about 11 files  
where `$PRODUCT` is used.

So currently it is common practice to use `ReaR`.

I think a proper solution could be  
to add another variable to usr/sbin/rear like

    ... PRODUCT_ABBR="ReaR"

for the cases where the abbreviated form `ReaR`  
should be used and then fix all the code places  
where currently `ReaR` is used literally.

I don't want to delay this PR, so feel free to ignore.

About the product name variables, I guess we could also change
`PRODUCT=ReaR` and introduce `PRODUCT_LONG=Relax-and-Recover` as I
assume that we want to use more often the short name than the long name.
