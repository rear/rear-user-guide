Fedora is undergoing a major check of licenses of its packages. @pcahyna
has noticed that
[doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)
file is distributed under the `CC BY-ND 3.0` license which is not
allowed for documentation in Fedora, RHEL, Debian and possibly other
distros.

Please, relicense this file under a more permissive license.

At the moment, we have created a custom release archive in Fedora and
RHEL with this file omitted but it would be nice to switch back to the
official upstream release archives.

According to what

shows this special license for this particular file  
was already there when this file was introduced via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b91baf682fd9f4e1b72884f574a8a726a86300fd](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b91baf682fd9f4e1b72884f574a8a726a86300fd)

But this commit also shows that rear-release-notes.txt  
was based on the former Rear-release-notes.txt file  
which contained

Because in general ReaR is under GPL v3 license  
I suggest to also have rear-release-notes.txt under GPL v3.

Hereby I (as one of the by git listed authors) I agree and

from its current license to GPL v3.

@lzaoral  
did Fedora's major check of licenses perhaps find  
also other files in ReaR that are not under GPL v3  
but have a different license explicitly specified?  
If yes, could you please report them as a separated issue.  
Ideally I would prefer to have all ReaR files under GPL v3  
as far as possible legally and with reasonable effort.

@jsmeix My check was not very thorough. I basically looked ad what
Debian is doing - they had stopped shipping `doc/rear-release-notes.txt`
already. I also looked at usr/sbin/rear and noted that ReaR is GPL v3 or
later (not just GPL v3):

@jsmeix I have no problems to convert the license to GPL v3.

I am not at all a software lincenses expert.  
I also think I vaguely remember that to change a license  
one needs to get agreements from all authors  
which is my reason behind why I posted  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302\#issuecomment-2304184020](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302#issuecomment-2304184020)

I think in practice it could be an impossible task  
(i.e. impossible with reasonable effort in reasonable time)  
to get agreements from all authors.

A possible way out could be to keep the current  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt as is but renamed  
e.g. to doc/rear-release-notes-until-2.7.txt  
and for ReaR 3.0 start from scratch with a new  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
keeping the unversioned name for the current one  
to not break links and references at arbitrary places  
that point to doc/rear-release-notes.txt

This way we could ( by-the-way and hooray! ;-)  
mecilessly clean up our release notes  
from any old and possibly outdated stuff,  
cf.

Keeping the current release notes in the repo does not solve the problem
of one file having a different license (and above all a non-free one)
than the rest of the repo, so it is not a way out at all.

@pcahyna @lzaoral  
I (perhaps falsely assumed) you could then  
(relatively easily) drop the old and outdated  
doc/rear-release-notes-until-2.7.txt  
from your RPM (or perhaps replace it with your own  
that contains only a reference to our upstream one)  
so that you could provide (at least) the current  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
in your RPM.

If this is insufficient for what you need,  
please help with getting agreements from all authors.

@jsmeix The main issue for us (at least in my POW) is not the lack of
release notes in the package, but the inability to use the upstream
source tarball at all and the resulting need of producing a cleaned-up
tarball as the package source. Note that it is not just about the RPM,
it is also about the SRPM, because the SRPM needs to be provided as well
(distributions provide all their sources), and a file with such a
license can not be shipped at all. It is also very confusing for anyone
using the sources (they see that ReaR is GPL and they thus may assume
that all the sources are GPL and then accidentally violate the license
terms).

sure, but we need a plan B here in case we don't get it. What about
doing what you proposed and then moving
doc/rear-release-notes-until-2.7.txt to another repo (perhaps to the web
pages)?

@pcahyna @jsmeix Why not reaching out to them to inform the license
change and mention explicitly if no reply is given an approval is
assumed.

Ah!  
I didn't have the SRPM in mind.

But wouldn't it help to remove that file  
in the RPM spec file section '%prep'  
because I think I vaguely remember somehow  
that the SRMP gets built after the '%prep' section  
i.e. using possibly modified original sources  
which is why one should normally not modify  
the original sources but apply patches instead  
but in this case modifying the original sources  
is perhaps a valid exception?

@jsmeix @pcahyna Why not remove the release-notes and documentation from
our ReaR master branch and move it to a ReaR documentation source

What about this simple and straightforward way:

Remove the old one in ReaR 3.0 - i.e.:  
For ReaR 3.0 start from scratch with a new  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt

Reasons:

The old one is still there in older git branches  
and in older source tar balls and so on.

IANAL, but I think we are allowed to remove  
all existing content in doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
and create its content anew from scratch  
where our new content is under a new license.

No, that's not how `%prep` works. The SRPM contains the original source
tarball and patches and `%prep` unpacks the tarball and applies the
patches during the build of binary RPMs. If the original source tarball
can't be included in the SRPM, one must build a new "original" that can
be included, every time one wants to update the package.

yes, or just move the old release notes there and keep the new file that
@jsmeix proposed in the sources (my preference).

    "One of the design goals of rpm is to cleanly separate upstream
    source from vendor modifications. For the Fedora packager, this
    means that sources used to build a package should be the vanilla

I am curious whether SUSE has different guidelines, but I doubt it,
AFAIK this is the main principle of RPM in general.

@gdha  
are you perhaps still in contact with Dag Wieers?  
If yes, could you ask Dag if he agrees  
to a license change of rear-release-notes.txt  
from its current license `CC BY-ND 3.0`  
to `GPL v3 or later`?

I think ideally Dag may agree to this license change  
directly here in this GitHub issue (provided he can).

@dagwieers Are you okay with above mentioned proposal of Johannes  
change the license of the release notes to GPLv3?

@rear/contributors  
I am wondering why we have a single and rather long  
"all-in-one" rear-release-notes.txt file?  
Wouldn't it be simpler to have in the unversioned  
rear-release-notes.txt file only the release notes  
of the current version (static unversioned file name  
so links pointing to it do not need to be adapted, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302\#issuecomment-2333778619](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3302#issuecomment-2333778619))  
and have release notes of older versions in separated  
versioned files like rear-release-notes-2-7.txt  
and rear-release-notes-2-6.txt and so on?  
I.e. have here in "rear/rear" files as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation)  
but there each newer contains all of the older  
while I suggest here separation.

This way we would have the history of the generic parts  
(e.g. "Product Features" or "Supported and Unsupported ...")  
also here in "rear/rear".  
Currently we change the generic parts as needed  
but then one cannot easily (i.e. without "git checkout")  
directly compare with a generic part in a former release.

@jsmeix I'm totally happy with any change you plan to do around the
release notes. I've been asking myself the same question. I was also
wondering how much we can automate the process of creating release notes
and of creating the release itself.

I'd be most happy if the manual effort required for a new release can be
reduced so that we can easily create releases more often than in the
past.

@jsmeix @schlomo  
See also issue \#3264 which was about this topic of automating the
creation of release notes. The PR \#3318 was closed for another reason,
but can be revived again.

FYI,
[https://rfc.archlinux.page/0040-license-package-sources/](https://rfc.archlinux.page/0040-license-package-sources/)
shows that Linux distros are closing the remaining gaps of unlicensed
content. We are therefore just in time with this topic and could check
also other files for missing license coverage, defaulting to GPL3+
