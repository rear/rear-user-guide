Flash memory, especially SD Cards and USB flash drives, often comes
without decent (NAND memory IC) specifications. As a result you have to
figure the optimal partition alignment value a.k.a. Allocation Unit,
a.k.a erase block size. That value is the smallest unit that a NAND
flash can erase. The values range from 128KB to 64MB, typically 2MB.
More info at
[https://wiki.linaro.org/WorkingGroups/KernelArchived/Projects/FlashCardSurvey](https://wiki.linaro.org/WorkingGroups/KernelArchived/Projects/FlashCardSurvey)
The `flashbench` tool helps to identify the real world Allocation Unit
size for flash memory.

@ProBackup-nl  
I think there is a misunderstanding about what  
the PROGS (and also the REQUIRED\_PROGS) arrays  
contain:  
They contain the programs for the ReaR recovery system  
(i.e. where "rear recover" is run).  
I assume the flashbench tool is not needed during "rear recover".

@ProBackup-nl is this `flasbench` tool meant for cloning purposes to a
different system using another type of SD card then the source? I have
no clue what I can do with it (as such)?  
I found
[https://github.com/bradfa/flashbench](https://github.com/bradfa/flashbench)
as reference to the tool, I believe this is the one you are referring
to? Is this meant for all type of architectures?

@gdha Indeed, I mean
[https://github.com/bradfa/flashbench](https://github.com/bradfa/flashbench).
`Flashbench` is not only for SD cards, or USB sticks, it is also
functional for SSD. I must admit that at NVMe interface speeds,
`flashbench` does no longer give usable output.

`Flashbench` helps you determine erase block size and page size. These
values help with more optimal partition alignment and more optimal file
system formatting.

Note: only necessary as long as the kernel is not able to determine
these values from the drive, and manufacturers do not specify or even
don't supply a datasheet (example IntelÂ® SSD 600p Series, where I can
[only
find](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/solid-state-drives/000005884.html)
a "[Product
Brief](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/ssd-600p-brief.html)".

I understand that flashbench helps with more optimal partition  
alignment and more optimal file system formatting but those  
tasks do usually not happen during "rear recover".

During "rear recover" the partitions and filesystems  
should be re-created as much as possible exactly  
as they had been on the original system.

Only in the so called "migration mode" when disks are  
different on the replacement hardware during "rear recover"  
optimal partition alignment should be done but even then  
the filesystems should be still re-created as much as possible  
exactly as they had been on the original system.

Because flashbench is menat for "flash memory devices"  
according to
[https://github.com/bradfa/flashbench](https://github.com/bradfa/flashbench)  
I think its usefulness during "rear recover" is rather limited,  
namely only in the so called "migration mode" and  
only for flash memory based disks (i.e. solid-state-drives).

I wonder if flashbench provides useful results for  
professional solid-state-drives with a good controller  
plus sufficient cache inside the solid-state-drive  
so that a tool that runs outside of the solid-state-drive  
may be basically unable to determine the physical block  
size of the flash memory in the solid-state-drive.

Accordingly I assume flashbench is only useful  
for cheap flash memory storage devices  
a.k.a. cheap USB memory sticks.

Summary:  
From my current point of view I think flashbench in  
the ReaR recovery system is not really useful.  
In the future this might change (i.e. when cheap flash  
memory storage devices get usually used in computers).

Note the difference:  
I think flashbench could be really useful for the "rear format"  
workflow which is intended to be used to prepare a cheap  
USB memory stick to be used as ReaR recovery medium.

I would like to suggest a compromise: Let's include `flashbench`
together with code that actually uses it during recovery. Till then you
can always add it yourself in your configuration with
`PROGS+=(flashbench)`. In any case I expect most installations to have a
`site.conf` with their own stuff in it.

+1 for using it in `rear format`, again please submit code and not just
the tool include.

About `flashbench` itself: IMHO this is a good idea as more and more
disks are flash based. If I had a server with an old hard disk I would
actually consider replacing it with an SSD if it breaks down.

@schlomo  
regarding replacing a traditional spinning disk with an SSD  
and then appropriate partitioning alignments:

I think doing by default parted partition alignments  
simply at 8 MiB block size in "migration mode"  
would be "the right thing" in almost all cases, cf.  
the new USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1201](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1201)

Accordingly I think a new issue would make sense  
to enhance the "migration mode" to support a general  
PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE variable that is  
by default set to 8 MiB.

@ProBackup-nl Will you add some additional code or documentation around
the usage of `flashbench`?  
You can always write some document for the doc section. It would be very
interesting read for lots of people? Thank you for bringing this new
tool to my attention.
