-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    I'm using a remote borg server with limited borg access (no deletion
    in repository), limited by the authorized\_keys.  
    `command="borg serve --append-only --restrict-to-path /backup/rear_test" ssh-ed25519 <CLIENT KEY>`  
    the borg server process is launch when the user connect on the
    server.
