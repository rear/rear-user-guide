-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Full backup restore on Arch Linux with:

1.  mtab as regular file
2.  mtab as symbolic link

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    In the past when */etc/mtab* was a regular file it was desirable to
    update disk UUIDs inside file (along with */etc/fstab*)  
    When */etc/mtab* become symbolic link pointing to */proc/mtab* resp
    */proc/self/mtab*, we don't want to perform any replacements with
    `sed -i` (nor any other editor) because data are already up to date.

@gozora  
I think this is obsoleted by my attempts to improve  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047/commits/6b1889cbf7bed297a5a695fd01f52865c4527827](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047/commits/6b1889cbf7bed297a5a695fd01f52865c4527827)  
but I need to test it...
