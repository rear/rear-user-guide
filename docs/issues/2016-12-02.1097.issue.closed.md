I would like to skip remounting with sync option  
when systemd is used.

When multiple "rear mkbackuponly" or "rear restoreonly"  
run in parallel the remounting with sync option  
of all what is mounted below /mnt/local  
gets annoyingly in the way, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088\#issuecomment-264176438](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088#issuecomment-264176438)

Of course I could implement sophisticated stuff  
as workaround but I think this is not needed because:

1.)  
I think remounting with sync option is no longer needed  
when systemd is used because when systemd is used  
reboot, halt, poweroff, and shutdown are replaced by  
simple and fail-safe scripts that do a careful umount  
plus sync to safely shut down the recovery system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011)

2.)  
I think remounting with sync option is in practice  
mainly an annoyance because it makes writing  
anything below /mnt/local basically unusable slow  
so that in practice the admin cannot do much  
in the recovery system after "rear recover" had finished:

/dev/sda2 on /mnt/local type ext4 (rw,relatime,sync,data=ordered)

</pre>

It is about 16 times slower for writing one single MB with 'sync'  
and about 29 times slower for writing 10 MB with 'sync'  
and about 34 times slower for writing 100 MB with 'sync'  
i.e. it gets slower and slower the more there is to write  
and to write one GB is in practice impossible because  
the admin thinks it has hung up (at least I thought that  
several times when I was hit by 'sync' ;-)
