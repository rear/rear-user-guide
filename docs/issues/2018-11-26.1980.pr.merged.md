##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** + **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#1974

-   How was this pull request tested? **Tested by a Red Hat customer on
    rear-2.4.2**

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

With ReaR 2.4, a verification of the binaries included in the ISO is  
performed. When using `COPY_AS_IS` with **NetBackup**, too many binaries
were  
included, causing the verification to fail or print error messages.

This fix defines a new `NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable used during  
verification and also excludes unused **NetBackup** binaries from the
ISO.

Additionally, the `RequiredSharedObjects()` function has been fixed to
not  
list the left part of the ldd mapping when there is a right part: some  
NetBackup libraries (e.g. `/usr/openv/lib/libbpfsmap.so`) were having
a  
mapping such as `/lib/ld64.so => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, causing  
the `RequiredSharedObjects()` function to print `/lib/ld64.so` which  
doesn't resolve at all.

@rmetrich  
thank you for finding and fixing such special cases where  
the RequiredSharedObjects() function did not yet work properly.

Do you perhaps know a standard executable as an example where 'ldd'
reports  
`        /path/to/lib1 => /path/to/lib2 ...`  
so that I could add it to the comment of the RequiredSharedObjects()
function?

@jsmeix Sorry, no idea for such standard library. It's probably a broken
way of building NetBackup. Will try to find out how this can happen.

@gdha please note the code has been fixed on RHEL's rear which is a bit
older. I saw there were fixes in Verification now so that COPY\_AS\_IS
issues only appear as non fatal errors now and RHEL 7.6 doesn't has that
code.

@rmetrich Now I'm confused - is the PR for the master branch OK to merge
or not?

@gdha It should be ready to merge, but this was not effectively tested
by my customer, only the rear-2.4-2 from RHEL7.6, where verification
failed due to broken binaries.
