-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

`rear mkrescue` is failing:

I know that REAR cannot backup or restore ZFS partitions. That's fine, I
use syncoid to backup and restore ZFS but here it seems `rear mkrescue`
is failing because `/dev/nvme0n1p9` (and /dev/nvme1n1p9 ) have an
unknown partition table. It is just an empty placeholder partition that
I definitely don't want to backup because I couldn't anyway.

My understanding of rear is that EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS is used to exclude
certain devices from being backed up but nothing that I've tried so far
stops `mkrescue` from analysing the nmve devices, which are formatted
with ZFS, and then aborting `mkrescue` because of the unknown
partitions.

-   Workaround, if any:

Under rear 2.5 I was successful in getting this machine to backup (and
hence mkrescue worked too) by using `ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg1" )` in my
`/etc/rear/local.conf` because it uses LVM but that doesn't work any
more under 2.7. rear 2.5 also didn't produce bootable USB drives under
Ubuntu 20.04.

Thanks

@danboid  
in general for an analysis we need a full debug ReaR log file,  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

    Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files)

Caution with possible secrets in a full debug log file:  
When 'rear' is run via '-D' in debugscript mode  
it logs executed commands via the bash command 'set -x'  
that print commands and their arguments as they are executed  
so in particular when arguments contain secret values  
(e.g. something like a password or whatever else)  
such secret values may appear in the log file.  
Also secrets may be stored in some other files  
like /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
or /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  
cf. `[password=<password>]` in the section  
"Disk layout file syntax" in  
doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc  
online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
So before you attach your full debug log file and other files  
here (GitHub is a public accessible place) inspect your files  
and verify that they do not accidentally cointain secrets.

@danboid  
as far as I see in your

the problematic disk where the

    /dev/sda

which is according to your 'lsblk' output

a USB device.

So I wonder if you could (at least as a workaround for now)  
disconnect this USB device while you run "rear mkrescue"?

By the way:  
I did right now  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a)  
to make that "Unsupported partition table" error message meaningful  
in particular for systems with more than a single disk ;-)

I can't physically remove that disk now but if it is that causing the
error then I would've expected changing to:

    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=( "${EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS[@]}" "/dev/nvme0n1" "/dev/nvme1n1" "/dev/nvme0n1p1" "/dev/nvme0n1p9" "/dev/nvme1n1p1" "/dev/nvme1n1p9" "/dev/sda" )

Should fix my problem but I still get:

My amateur, not knowing rear well guess is that the $device array as fed
into 200\_partition\_layout.sh doesn't exclude the devices listed in the
$EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS array so it tries to fetch the label/ partition
type of ALL partitions regardless.

Yes, this is how it currently behaves.  
The exclusion happens afterwards.  
Basically for normal disks  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
does

        for disk in /sys/block/* ; do
    ...
                    extract_partitions "$devname"
    ...
        done

I removed the Ubuntu install USB disk, rebooted and that did fix
`mkrescue` and `mkbackup` as rear is backing it up now but why did
adding "/dev/sda" to the $EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS array not fix that error
if that was the disk causing trouble?

As far as I see  
adding "/dev/sda" to any EXCLUDE variable  
cannot help here because of

I downloaded the "Ubuntu-Server 20.04.2 LTS amd64" image and set it up
as a disk (should be equivalent to dd-ing it to a empty disk):

    losetup -P -f ~pcahyna/Downloads/ubuntu-20.04-beta-live-server-amd64.iso

and I examined how it behaves:

    # lsblk

so, the root problem seems to be that parted does not recognize the
partition table that is recognized both by the kernel and fdisk.

Thanks for explaining the root of this error. I had no intention of
backing up that disk/iso but I was unable to get rear to exclude
(examining) the disk. I had to physically remove the disk to get
`mkrecover` to work and I don't think that should've been necessary.

I opened a separate ticket regarding the "exclude from backup" section
of the docs, which I regard as a key and lacking section of the docs so
I will eventually read the source and document it if no-one else does it
before me.
