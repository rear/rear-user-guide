In general Relax-and-Recover version 1.17.2  
is "simply too old" to have proper PPC support.

@schabrolles  
made tons of fixes and enhancements  
for POWER architecture in current ReaR.

@spacfonseca  
please try the current ReaR GitHub master code.

To test the current ReaR GitHub master code  
basically "git clone" it into a directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

(note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/").

@spacfonseca  
because "no news is good news" I assume  
it works with current ReaR GitHub master code  
so that I can close this issue.

Hello!  
Thanks for your support.  
I did update the rear to version 2.2 but still was not able to perform
restore tests. Please close this subject. I will get back to it once I
do all testing needed.

Regards

Hello,  
We encountered the same issue on Power8 ppc64 le RHEL 7.4 and we
downloaded the git rear as directed above to get it to
"Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / Git". The backup works fine for both the iso
and the tar file. The restore of the iso, however, boots and runs for a
little bit but then stops at "Relax-and-Recover rescue system is ready",
followed by "\[OK\] Found device /dev/hvc0\]" and finally followed by
"\[OK\] Started Initialize Rescue System." where it hangs forever.
Please let us know if there is another fix for this or some other
website to download the working release from. Thank you.
