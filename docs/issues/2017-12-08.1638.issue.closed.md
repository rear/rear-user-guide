that reads (excerpts)

<pre>
symlinks should be copied as-is into the rescue system
...
in most cases the symlinks were put in place purposefully
so that we should leave them as there were intended
...
For the few known cases where this is a problem we should
add extra code to handle it, e.g. /etc/localtime.

... to help with finding such places ... add code
that checks symlinks and reports broken symlinks,
especially if they were not broken in the source system.
</pre>
