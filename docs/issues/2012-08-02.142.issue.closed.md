On OpenSUSE build a rpm (from the latest git snapshot) and installed it:

    # rpm -ivh ./rear-1.13.0-1.git201208021044.noarch.rpm
    linux-1il4:/etc/rear # cat os.conf
    OS_VENDOR=SUSE_LINUX
    OS_VERSION=0

As, you see the `OS_VERSION=0` is wrong, and, it shouldn't be installed
during a rpm installtion as it is created for the rescue environment. We
must get rid of it in our rpm build.  
You better just delete the `/etc/rear/os.conf` after the rpm
installation.

Rather than removing the /etc/rear/os.conf from the RPM, can't we first
look why the value is 0 ?

I don't mind requiring LSB for the SuSE packages (I don't use SuSE
myself) but I can imagine that for the same reason we don't want these
dependencies on RHEL, the SuSE users may not want them on SuSE...

BTW Is this an OBS build, or a manual build on an OpenSUSE system ?

The RPM package was build manually on an OpenSUSE 12.1 system . However,
once the file has been removed the recreated `os.conf` file contains
correct values. Very bizarre phenomenon.

I can confirm there's a bug in the OBS OpenSUSE packaging, but not in
the SLES packaging. So there must be something wrong with the
suse\_version macro. The sles\_version macro does work correctly. See:
[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build\_Service\_cross\_distribution\_howto](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto)
for the details...

I think I understand the problem. OpenSUSE ships with %suse\_version set
to the correct number, and %sles\_version set to 0 (instead of
undefined) and because of the order of the entries the %sles\_version
overwrites the %suse\_version.

I think it was a very unwise decision from SuSE to implement it like
this because now you have to use the harder %ifdef constructs...I'll
implement a work-around :-(
