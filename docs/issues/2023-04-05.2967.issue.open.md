-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

current GitHub master code

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

excerpt:

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"

    BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED="yes"
    { BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY='my_secret_passphrase' ; } 2>/dev/null

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b83059a72d2ea8735719cf415c6cafd5f43312f0](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b83059a72d2ea8735719cf415c6cafd5f43312f0)  
there is - by the way - a new  
init/default/998\_dump\_variables.sh  
which is unrelated to what the commit message describes.

The new script does currently only

    Debug "Runtime Configuration:$LF$(declare -p)"

which outputs in debug modes also confidential  
variable values into the ReaR log file like

    # usr/sbin/rear -d help
    Running 'init' stage ======================
    Running workflow help on the normal/original system
    ...

    # egrep -i 'password|key' var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log.lockless
    ...
    declare -- BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="my_secret_passphrase"
    declare -- GALAXY11_PASSWORD=""
    declare -- OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD=""
    declare -- SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    declare -- TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD=""
    declare -- YUM_ROOT_PASSWORD="root"
    declare -- ZYPPER_ROOT_PASSWORD="root"

In particular BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY is critical  
because that new script foils my security/privacy  
code enhancements that I did for BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY

I have two conflicting thoughts about this:

1.  in debug mode we should dump all variables and also give a hint that
    the dump can contain secrets - this helps with debugging
2.  in debug mode we should mask/hide secrets (as your suggestion does)
    and give a hint that secrets are skipped - and debug mode won't help
    with secrets related problems

Personally, I'd prefer option 1) (full dump) and expect users to check
the output they send us. We could also add another warning to our GitHub
issue template to remind users to scrape secrets from the debug log, if
they set any.

For reference, other tools like for example the `aws` CLI also dump all
secrets in debug mode and expect the user to be circumspect.

@rear/contributors other opinions?

1.  

maintain a list of variables that contain confidential values  
(e.g. a new array in default.conf that contains such variable names)  
and hide/skip/suppress the values of those variables in the output  
(we at ReaR usptream should never need secret values from a user  
to debug an issue).

Sleeping on it made it even more critical at least for me:

Now I have legal liability worries about it, at least  
as far as I understand general principles of German law:

I think in general when someone does something  
one has generally some reasonable amount of  
legal liability for what one does.

I think in particular when making software this means  
that one's program must not knowingly do something bad  
except the user had explicity requested to do it.

In this case init/default/998\_dump\_variables.sh  
leaks user's confidential values into the log file  
without the user's explicit request to do exactly this.  
Running a program in debug mode is no explicit request  
to get (arbitrary) confidential values shown.

Furthermore - and this is the crucial point for me  
why I have now legal liability worries:  
It is now know to all of us ReaR upstream developers  
that init/default/998\_dump\_variables.sh  
does bad things for the user without explicit request.

I think - at least as far as I understand general principles  
of German law - when one knows about something bad,  
then one becomes to some reasonable extent responsible  
to (try to) do something against that bad  
as far as possible within reason.

@rear/contributors  
I think there is no longer urgency / time pressure here  
so we can take our time to develop step by step  
how to solve the generic problem properly.

The generic problem is that debug information may in general  
reveal data that is confidential for the user, not only  
obviously confidential data like secrets (e.g. passwords or keys)  
but also non-obvious confidential data that could be misused  
by others e.g. for spear phishing attacks or things like that.

@jsmeix I strongly disagree with this approach.

At some level ReaR debugging must be "complete", that is normal for
every software. `DEBUGSCRIPTS` is actually our "strongest" debug mode so
for me this is where full variable disclosure belongs. I'm happy to add
extra warnings to it and also to the help message or manpage, but in the
end full debug-level variable disclosure must be possible.

In any case, we won't be able to find a 100% "safe" solution here, as
users can add additional variables with potential secrets.

About your worries under German law: That is why ReaR is shipped under
the GPL where we explicitly shed responsiilities for what ReaR does
after a user installs and uses it, like any other Open Source software.
As long as there is no obvious malicious intent we are safe. Malicious
intent could be a piece of code that uploads all users' secrets to a
website while obfuscating what it does.

If it helps I'm happy to expand the variable dump feature to mask out
all `KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD` type variables unless the user explicitly
disables this behaviour.

BTW, your check for variable naming should probably be expanded to only
match on the variable names and not content.

For inspiration, I checked what Ansible does - there are similar
concerns, because it is easy to show all Ansible module call parameters
(including values) during playbook execution (merely by requesting
verbose output), and secrets are passed to modules using parameters, so
they would leak quite often. Ansible allows marking some module
parameters as `no_log` and they are then omitted from the log output. If
a parameter name seems to indicate that it is a secret and is not marked
as `no_log`, Ansible shows the value, but emits a warning. This allows
the module developer to catch the problem before the module gets to
production.  
I think we could reuse the heuristic that determines whether the
parameter is a secret (apply it to shell variables). The regular
expression used in Ansible is

    ^(.+[-_\s])?pass([-_\s]?(word|phrase|wrd|wd)?)([-_\s].+)?

We would use upper case of course, and we should add `KEY` to the
possibilities (not sure about `SECRET`). I already see one false
positive : `BACKUP_DUPLICITY_ASK_PASSPHRASE`.  
The regex would be used to mask variables in variable dump (not just for
warning, unlike in Ansible).

The question about debugscript/-D/set -x is a more difficult one: I see
@jsmeix changed code to protect against that in \#2156, but doing it for
all such variables will be difficult.  
By the way, is assigning such variables in local.conf dangerous ? I see
the comment in default.conf:

    # ... insert it between the single quotes of the following line:
    #        { TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD=''; } 2>/dev/null
    #    NOTE: stderr is redirected in the above line to avoid exposing the password hash
    #          in the log file when ReaR runs in debugscript mode.

but there is also this comment

    # In debugscript mode only scripts sourced by the Source function in lib/framework-functions.sh
    # are run with 'set -x' but default.conf is sourced by usr/sbin/rear directly.
    # See the comment of the UserInput function in lib/_input-output-functions.sh
    # how to keep things confidential when usr/sbin/rear is run in debugscript mode

which seem contradictory.

this makes some sense, as an example Ansible also shows all values when
you debug it itself by setting `ANSIBLE_DEBUG=1` (even the `no_log`
variables). But note that our issue template asks the user to submit
logs generated using `-D`. So it would actually encourage users who
report issues to leak confidential data, if this logging is "complete"
in this sense, and I see why this is not desirable. Not sure what to do
here - perhaps another debug level that would show really everything,
but we would normally not request its output?

OK, how about we add a new option `--debug-complete` or
`--expose-secrets` that enables the full variable dump?

In general individual agreements (like GPL)  
do not take precedence over general law.

In a specific case one needs to get a legal judgement  
to find out how general law and individual agreements  
apply (i.e. one has to actually take a court action).

Without a court decision about this particular case  
there is the risk of legal issues.

@schlomo  
I strongly disagree with your approach.

In the past I never needed all variables values  
to find the root cause of an issue in ReaR.

In the past the 'set -x' debugscript mode output  
was sufficient for me to find the root cause.

If I needed even more details I could easily add  
a script like yours or add commands for debugging  
to existing scripts as needed in the specific case.  
I vaguely remember there was one single case where  
the latter was needed (i.e. I told the user to add some  
specific commands for debugging into an existing script).

If I'm the only one who would like to see all variables in debug logs
then I'm fine with removing that script altogether and relying on
on-demand hacks if needed.

I have felt a need for such a script myself some time ago (and not for
debugging, so I would even introduce a separate workflow), so I would
keep it, if the secrets issue can be addressed sufficiently.

@jsmeix @pcahyna how about we extract the script from the current place
into a dedicated `show-all-variables` workflow that will then, as
advertised, dump all variables, including secrets - of course with a
suitable warning?

I asked colleagues about their general thoughts regarding  
"show also secrets in debug mode":

A colleague told me about this

    # wpa_supplicant -h
    ...
     -K = include keys (passwords, etc.) in debug output

which matches what @schlomo suggests in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1508418115](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1508418115)

Currently I think a command line option is the best way  
to solve the conflict that @schlomo described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1497372237](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1497372237)

My reasoning:

My reasoning is primarily about legal things and usability:

A command line option must be explicitly typed in by the user.  
When the command line option name tells what it means for the user  
typing in that command line option name is an explicit request  
by the user to let ReaR do exactly this.  
Because running a program in whatever debug mode  
is no explicit request to (also) get secret values shown  
(if at all debug mode might be an implicit request),  
the command line option name '--debug-complete'  
is no explicit request to get secret values shown.  
But the command line option name '--expose-secrets'  
is an explicit request to get secret values shown.

A command line option provides better usability  
(compared to a separated new workflow)  
because it works for any workflow so that the user  
can easily increase debug info step by step  
for the workflow that fails for him like

    # rear WORKFLOW
    [fails]

    # rear -d WORKFLOW
    [insufficient info why it fails]

    # rear -d --expose-secrets WORKFLOW
    [indicates a possible reason of the failure]

    # rear -D WORKFLOW
    [not clear how exactly it fails]

    # rear -D --expose-secrets WORKFLOW
    [now it is clear how exactly it fails]

Finally with a generic command line option  
we can implement what is right in each specific code place.  
For example there might be very specific use cases where

    # rear --expose-secrets WORKFLOW

could make sense even in normal (non-debug) node  
e.g. to show some specific secrets on the user's terminal.

A side note FYI:

As shown by @pcahyna in his above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1507557009](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1507557009)  
leaking confidential values can also happen  
in verbose mode of certain commands.

But - as far as I see - since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2416)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2633)  
ReaR is no longer affected by this when ReaR is run in verbose mode  
because we call commands in verbose mode via '-v' or '--verbose'  
only when ReaR is run in debug mode, see usr/sbin/rear at

Mainly for my own information:

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982\#issuecomment-1540097471](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982#issuecomment-1540097471)  
I wrote (excerpt):

    Perhaps I can solve the whole thing reasonably well via
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967
    by using 'source' for config files
    to get things more secure for the user
    plus
    a sufficiently proper implementation that shows
    all (non-secret) config variable values
    in debug or debugscript mode.
    My current offhanded idea is to maintain a list of
    config variable names that can contain a secret value
    (e.g. an array of variable names in default.conf
    so the user can specify confidential config variable names
    as needed to provide "final power to the user")
    where it is only reported whether or not such variables have
    a non-empty value but the actual secret value is not shown
    unless usr/sbin/rear is run with the new command line option
    '--expose-secrets'.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2982)  
those are the config variables that could have secret values:

    # grep '{ .* ; } 2>/dev/null' usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  | grep -v '^#'

    { OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { OPAL_PBA_TKNKEY='tpm:opalauthtoken:7' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="${BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY:-}" ; } 2>/dev/null
    { TTY_ROOT_PASSWORD='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { GALAXY11_PASSWORD=${GALAXY11_PASSWORD:-} ; } 2>/dev/null
    { ZYPPER_ROOT_PASSWORD='root' ; } 2>/dev/null
    { YUM_ROOT_PASSWORD='root' ; } 2>/dev/null

For each of them I will check our code that  
we do not leak their values into the log file.

For BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY this was already done via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156)

and  
usr/share/rear/prep/default/340\_include\_password\_tools.sh  
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539/commits/8bc2b1cccccbd4806feb0bfa5fdcc41d0ca47942](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539/commits/8bc2b1cccccbd4806feb0bfa5fdcc41d0ca47942)

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539)  
I found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539\#discussion\_r540783195](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2539#discussion_r540783195)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2540](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2540)  
which got lost at that time (between Dec. 2020 and Feb. 2021)

Regarding  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/login  
I noticed no comment that tells that also all is OK in this case.  
I guess all is OK in this case because I assume this script  
is never run with 'set -x' (in the ReaR recovery system).

OPAL\_PBA\_DEBUG\_PASSWORD:

    usr/share/rear/prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001_configure_workflow.sh:[[ -n "$OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD" ]] && REQUIRED_PROGS+=( openssl )

As far as I see it seems  
usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/820\_store\_settings.sh  
is OK because

    cat > FILE << EOF
    secret value
    EOF

does not show 'secret value' when that is run with 'set -x'  
because in this case 'set -x' only shows '+ cat'  
at least for me with GNU bash version 4.4.23

    # OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD=mypassword

    # set -x

    # cat > OPAL_PBA_SETTINGS.sh << -EOF-
    > OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD='$OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD'
    > -EOF-
    + cat

    # set +x

    # cat OPAL_PBA_SETTINGS.sh
    OPAL_PBA_DEBUG_PASSWORD='mypassword'

As far as I see it seems also  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks  
is OK because it seems this is run via

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'unlock-opal-disks' | grep -v ': *#'

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit-opalpba.service:ExecStart=/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks

    usr/share/rear/skel/OPALPBA/etc/inittab:ss::bootwait:/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks

and I assume what is run this way  
is never run with 'set -x' (in the ReaR recovery system).

So the only remaining part is  
usr/share/rear/prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001\_configure\_workflow.sh  
which should be fixed via

@jsmeix  
How about moving something like that into functions like
`LogSecret "$secret_string"` or `SecretCommand "$cmd"` which is only
displayed when the `--expose-secrets` is activated?  
Especially in development and debugging can this be very useful.  
To test \#2991, I had to remove `2>/dev/null` to see if the right
parameters were passed to lftp.

@codefritzel  
I assume you mean something like

    if { COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT ; } 2>/dev/null ; then
        Log "COMMAND succeeded"
    else
        { LogSecret "'COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT' failed with exit code $?" ; } 2>/dev/null
        Error "COMMAND failed"
    fi

I like the idea and as far as I see I think it can be implemented.  
The LogSecret command itself must be within '{ ... ; } 2&gt;/dev/null'  
because otherwise $SECRET\_ARGUMENT in the LogSecret command  
would leak into the log file in debuscript mode via 'set -x'.

Only an offhanded idea:

Alternatively we may introduce in usr/sbin/rear by default

    SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV="null"

and set it to

    SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV="stderr"

only if '--expose-secrets' is set  
in a similar way as we currently use  
DEBUG\_OUTPUT\_DEV and DISPENSABLE\_OUTPUT\_DEV

For example like

    if { COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV ; then
        Log "COMMAND succeeded"
    else
        { Log "'COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT' failed with exit code $?" ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV
        Error "COMMAND failed"
    fi

No special LogSecret function is needed and now  
also the command call itself can appear in the  
log file in debuscript mode via 'set -x'  
when additionally --expose-secrets is set.

Additionally the

    { ... ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

syntax makes it clear which redirections are  
explicitly meant to hide secrets to distinguish them  
from usual unwanted output discard via '2&gt;/dev/null'

By the way:  
The

    Log "COMMAND succeeded"

is needed to have something in the log because  
the command call itself is normally invisible.

I think the idea is very good. For debugging purposes, the user or
developer can see the executed command, if activated.

@jsmeix  
Do you want to implement this and create a WIP RP?

@codefritzel  
I will try it out - likely next week (as time permits)  
and if it works OK for me I will make a pull request.

Ouch!  
One must be super careful to not leak secrets by accident:

    if { COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV ; then
        Log "COMMAND succeeded"
    else
        { Log "'COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT' failed with exit code $?" ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV
        Error "COMMAND failed"
    fi

leaks $SCRET\_ARGUMENT when COMMAND failed because

    { Log "'COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT' ... " ; } 2>>/dev/null

outputs into the log file in any case because  
in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh there is

    function Log () {
        ...
        echo "$log_message" >>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" || true
    }

So we also need the 'LogSecret' function.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006)  
I implemented the basics of the new

-   -e / --expose-secrets option for sbin/rear
-   SECRET\_OUTPUT\_DEV
-   LogSecret function

Nothing is documented yet in "rear help" or "man rear"  
until I did some more tests and until I got some feedback  
what others think about it and how it behaves for them.
