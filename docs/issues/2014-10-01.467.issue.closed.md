@gdha After changing the global-functions.sh file ,backup got worked .

From my understanding it was trying to mount USB at the time of taking
backup with options:

mount -v -o rw,noatime,nolock /disk/by-label/REAR-000
/tmp/rear.Zom0FaUNpAVJuS2/outputfs'

(same thing i tried by manually but USB was not able to mount )

& i changed it to

mount /disk/by-label/REAR-000 /tmp/rear.Zom0FaUNpAVJuS2/outputfs

it got worked.

Also After taking backup successfully by doing above changes ,At the
time of recovery it is throwing error saying "missing operating system "
on Debian 6.0\_64 OS and only " \_\_ " symablo on CentOs 6.4.

Please find the /usr/share/rear/lib/ global-functions.sh file

[https://gist.github.com/pramodbiradar89/fd31c304fa58c70a0266](https://gist.github.com/pramodbiradar89/fd31c304fa58c70a0266)

So i am little confused whatever the changes i made to take backup
successfully is corretc or not ?

If it is correct then why at the time of restoration through USB it is
giving error ?

Thanks,  
Pramod

@gdha yes. i have followed same steps.

for other OS flavours such as RHEL 6 , UBUNTU 12.04 backup & recovery
using USB stick is working as per expectation.

But only for Debian6.0 and CentOs 6.4 i am getting above mentioned
issue.

@pramodbiradar89 You could define your own `BACKUP_OPTIONS=` variable in
the `local.conf` which should take care of the rest

@gdha

Can you please give me one example for this as i am new to rear .

I was using this local.conf file:

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

Request you to explain how local.conf should get looked using
BACKUP\_OPTIONS= .

Thanks,

E.g. `BACKUP_OPTIONS=rw` would be enough in your case (`OUTPUT=USB`)

@gdha

Please correct me if i am wrong .

My final local .conf should look like this:

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS=rw

correct ?

And after this i have to take backup through USB & recover ?

Thanks,

@pramodbiradar89 did you check rear.log file before recovery - is there
a better error description available? It means that your USB disk is not
bootable;

@pramodbiradar89 According your logs the syslinux/extlinux config went
well. Just saw a message about UEFI - do you need UEFI somehow? If yes,
then that might be the issue that your system does not allow USB
booting?

@gdha

For my work, i need UEFI support.  
So to work UEFI with REAR is there any additional changes do i need to
do ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also ,to make it work without UEFI for same machine, what kind of
changes i need to do ?

Thanks,

@pramodbiradar89 To be honest I have never tested UEFI on Debian. On
RHEL, Fedora it should work for ISO images (and of course recreating the
HD). There are some known issues with OpenSuSe (which are not fixed yet
within the OpenSuSe distro). Debian is a big question mark.  
But, whatever, you may think USB is currently not a supported boot
method for UEFI. I do not have time to work on it. If you know how to
get it working please be my guest and prepare a pull request.  
For what I can see the following error is a strong indication something
serious is wrong:

    2014-10-08 17:19:08.422170530 Including prep/default/31_include_uefi_tools.sh
    FATAL: Error inserting efivars (/lib/modules/2.6.32-5-amd64/kernel/drivers/firmware/efivars.ko): No such device
    2014-10-08 17:19:08.520704796 Including prep/USB/Linux-i386/33_find_isolinux.sh

As said, cannot help you with UEFI on Debian.  
If you disable UEFI on your system then a normal boot should work.

@gdha

Please find the screenshot of the recover window:

This mentioned screenshot is for machine which is having legacy as
booting method not UEFI  
but still i am getting error as shown in screenshot.

Please take a look in to it.

@pramodbiradar89 could you run `/usr/sbin/rear -v -D mkrescue` - would
like to see what happens during the
`output/USB/Linux-i386/85_make_USB_bootable.sh` steps. I think
`extlinux` did never run (to make USB disk bootable)?
