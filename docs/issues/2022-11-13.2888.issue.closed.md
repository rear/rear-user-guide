-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Recovery environment is not booting.

I'm wondering if the issue is due to the fact that I have two USB
devices connected. But of course they do have different labels

-   Workaround, if any:

My hunch about this was right.

mkrescue was acting on the other USB disk that was attached

So, the work-around (and possibly the solution) is to only have one USB
disk attached when performing mkrescue.

Somehow the label is being ignored.

@ZENAdmin-Ops

your ReaR config is somewhat inconsistent because  
when you use 'REAR-002' instead of the default 'REAR-000' in

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-002

you must also specify the matching

    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL='REAR-002'

in your etc/rear/local.conf file.  
Otherwise scripts that use USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_LABEL  
will use the value from usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
which results in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9996315/rear-Ubuntu-DR6.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9996315/rear-Ubuntu-DR6.log)

    ... Processing filesystem 'ext3' on '/dev/sdc2' mounted at '/media/zen/REAR-000'
    ...
    ... Automatically excluding filesystem /media/zen/REAR-000.

But those two messages do not explain why  
your 'REAR-002' recovery medium fails to boot.

What exactly do you mean with  
"Recovery environment is not booting" ?

What exactly fails when booting your 'REAR-002' USB disk?  
What exact (error) messages do you see on your screen?

In general I recommend to be extra careful with  
using ReaR USB disks during "rear recover".

In particular don't have USB disks connected  
that you do not actually need during "rear recover".

Or more in general don't have any disk connected  
that you do not actually need during "rear recover".

> Boots into GRUB. Rather into Rear.

What exact (error) messages do you see on your screen?

> No error messages.

But it was apparent that mkrescue was updating the other USB disk.

I will try adding the statement below into local.conf  
USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_LABEL='REAR-002'

Thanks
