-   Brief description of the issue: Processor fails to acquire DHCP IP
    address
-   Work-around, if any: mods to "58-start-dhclient.sh"

On occasion our HP Proliant ML30 Gen9 reorders the interfaces as shown
by "ip addr show" and the NFS mount fails with "network unreachable". In
that case no network interfaces are configured which prompted a closer
look. In "58-start-dhclient.sh" the following behavior was noted:

Press ENTER to run 58-start-dhclient.sh

-   source /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
    ++ dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf
    /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1  
    ++ dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf
    /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1  
    dhclient(519) is already running - exiting.  
    ++ dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf
    /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1  
    dhclient(519) is already running - exiting.  
    ++ dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf
    /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1  
    dhclient(519) is already running - exiting.  
    ++ dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf
    /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1  
    dhclient(519) is already running - exiting.  
    ++ dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.eno1 -pf
    /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf eno1  
    dhclient(519) is already running - exiting.

This actually is the functioning case since eno1 did in fact acquire an
IP address and that interface is up. In the failure case ens2f0 is
listed first and so replaces all instances of "eno1" above but there is
no server available there and no cable attached. It appears that perhaps
this code was intended to start dhclient on each interface which likely
would work if the device changed for each invocation and also the '-pf'
parameter was changed to avoid the "already running" complaint. As coded
'$DEVICE' never changes.

A simple work around was to replace all this with a simple "dhclient"
invocation which without parameters tries to acquire IPs on all
interfaces. Perhaps we should specify "USE\_DHCIENT=y" but the existing
configuration was working for us most of the time.

@styerd  
only a hint what you can use in newer ReaR versions,  
see NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
in the current usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

There have been some adaptions and enhancements  
regarding network devices setup in the rescue/recovery system  
since Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 see the current release notes  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

Regarding specifically ReaR 1.17.2 on RHEL 7.2  
you may better ask the Red Hat support people.

We had briefly tried with "USE\_DHCLIENT" but that didn't work either
and we haven't debugged in that path. In this path we find that clearing
"DEVICE, DEVICETYPE, and REALDEVICE inside the "for dev in
`get_device_by_hwaddr`" and making the pid file parameter unique in
58-start-dhclient.sh results in starting dhclient on each interface
which seems to be the intention of this code. Timeouts on the uncabled
ports costs about 5 minutes so our simplest/fastest solution is to
simply replace the "58-start-dhclient.sh" code with a single "dhclient"
command with no device parameter which at least on RHEL7 tries DHCP on
each network interface and works equally as well as starting "dhclient"
on each interface.

@styerd Could you explain a bit more in detail what you mean with
clearing "DEVICE, DEVICETYPE, and REALDEVICE inside the "for dev in
get\_device\_by\_hwaddr" and making the pid file parameter unique in
58-start-dhclient.sh results in starting dhclient on each interface
which seems to be the intention of this code. I see what you mean with
the pid file...  
The time-outs on the un-cabled interface - we could introduce a timeout
call to reduce the amount of time

@gdha  
I believe the code snippet that @styerd is referring to is:

/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

        # IPv4 DHCP clients
        case $DHCLIENT_BIN in
                (dhclient)
                        dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.${DEVICE} -pf /var/run/dhclient.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf ${DEVICE}
                ;;
                (dhcpcd)
                        dhcpcd ${DEVICE}
                ;;
        esac

The needed change to keep dhclient from failing is:

        # IPv4 DHCP clients
        case $DHCLIENT_BIN in
                (dhclient)
                        dhclient -lf /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases.${DEVICE} -pf /var/run/dhclient.${DEVICE}.pid -cf /etc/dhclient.conf ${DEVICE}
                ;;
                (dhcpcd)
                        dhcpcd ${DEVICE}
                ;;
        esac

@styerd Is that correct?

This is only part of the problem. As coded “$DEVICE” never changes in
the loop.  
I wonder if invoking “dhclient” with no DEVICE parameter wouldn’t do
what is intended which seems to be to initiate DHCP on every
interface.  
That in fact is our current work around, to remove the loop.

Probably nothing that needs to be done for ReaR 2.3  
so that I set the milestone to ReaR 2.4.

Changed label 'minor bug' to 'enhancement' as it is not really a bug (it
doesn't break the rescue system). Not urgent to fix so change milestone
'2.4' to 'future'

Having the same issue when trying to perform a restore from a from a
machine with multiple interfaces (all dhcp). The first call to
"dhclient" seems to work and the interface is receiving an IP. All
following calls to dlclient fail. I believe the missing "${DEVICE}" in
the pid-file name is causing the dhclient to exit with the "already
running" error.

Ensuring a seperat pid-file for each dhclinet instance should fix this
issue.
