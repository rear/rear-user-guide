I'm using the latest git master and have followed the quickstart guide.
The USB media is created, but I am not able to boot from it. I would
like to this working and happy to try things out as directed.

@SupraJames We are currently busy trying to fix the issue you're having
- see PR \#2763 or read historical information wriitten down in issue
\#2500.

Thanks! Look forward to it working. I will try the RAWDISK method for
now.

@SupraJames You could try out
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/xUbuntu\_20.04/amd64/rear\_2.6-0git.4698.a16e840.master\_amd64.deb](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/xUbuntu_20.04/amd64/rear_2.6-0git.4698.a16e840.master_amd64.deb)
and define:

    GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND="search --no-floppy --set=root --file /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi"

in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file. If possible, provide us with some
feedback - positive or negative. Thanks.

I was able to try this just now - it does boot into the rescue shell so
would seem to be successful! however the networking isn't quite right.
which I suspect is an unrelated issue. Thanks!

@SupraJames  
I assume with "it does boot into the rescue shell" you mean the ReaR
recovery system  
which is a normal (non graphical) Linux system where you can log in as
'root'  
but not some kind of EFI or GRUB or systemd "rescue shell".  
So I assume this specific issue is now solved, see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500\#issuecomment-1062951489](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500#issuecomment-1062951489)

In general regarding networking in the ReaR recovery system  
see what there is described related to "networking" in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
and have a look what you may pick out of our examples in  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/

For example for my test VMs I use

    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"

where `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` lets the ReaR recovery system  
startup with a new IP address that is different than the one of the  
original system so I can keep both running without IP conflicts.  
And `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"` provides remote access  
to the ReaR recovery system, cf. the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how to access the ReaR recovery system from remote via ssh  
which is in particular useful for debugging issues that happen  
inside the ReaR recovery system (i.e. during "rear recover").
