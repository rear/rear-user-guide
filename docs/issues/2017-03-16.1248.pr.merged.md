Only added plain 'curl' to PROGS in conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
but currently no special code for the https support libs.  
Additionally enhanced init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
to error out if 'curl' is required but not there.

@gdha  
can you review it.

If acceptable as a first step in the right direction  
I would like to get it merged.

For me plain 'curl' with plain HTTP works.

I know nothing at all about whatever special  
https support libs for curl so that I cannot help  
in any way to get that properly implemented.

With the follow up
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267)
merged  
curl works also with HTTPS by default.
