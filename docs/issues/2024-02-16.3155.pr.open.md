-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Works well for me with SLES15-SP5

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Overhauled finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

Now it uses dracut by default and mkinitrd as fallback  
which fixes
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152)  
at least for me with SLES15-SP5.

Additionally improved the user messages  
(in particular the warning messages)  
to make it more clear that the point is  
to decide if the recreated system will boot  
with the initrd 'as is' from the backup restore.

Furthermore removed the whole INITRD\_MODULES code  
because INITRD\_MODULES is not used and  
/etc/sysconfig/kernel does no longer exist since SLES12 so the
INITRD\_MODULES code is dead code.
