In your rear-localhost.log there is

<pre>

...
+++ parted -s /dev/sda mkpart 'EFI System Partition' 786432B 209977343B
parted: invalid token: System
Error: Expecting a file system type.
</pre>

which makes this issue a duplicate of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1770)  
therein see in particular

Regarding "downloading latest ReaR upstream code".

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in older ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.

@gozora  
o.k. o.k. you won but it's not a fair race

Have a nice weekend!
