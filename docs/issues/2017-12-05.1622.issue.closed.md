@N3WWN  
removing all manipulations of /etc/inittab for systemd-based systems  
would cause regressions in particular for sshd, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1612](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1612)  
therein in particular

@jsmeix  
Thanks for pointing that out!

For now, I'm going to rename the issue to reflect that this was intended
for the time sync portion of the code so that the regression problems do
not crop up.

@N3WWN any chance to get this further?

Yes, this is also being tested as part of the changes to
430\_prepare\_timesync.sh that will include chronyd support. Hopefully
submitting the PR early next week.
