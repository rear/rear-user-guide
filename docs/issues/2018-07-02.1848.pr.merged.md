Fixed, simplified and enhanced GRUB2 installation for PPC64/PPC64LE

-   Type: **Bug Fix** and **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843)  
    and  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not at all by me because I have no PPC64/PPC64LE system.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Fixed finalize/Linux-ppc64le/620\_install\_grub2.sh according to  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828\#issuecomment-398717889](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-398717889)

Enhanced GRUB2 installation by the new config variable  
GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES so that now the user can specify  
what he wants if needed.

Aligned code in finalize/Linux-ppc64le/620\_install\_grub2.sh  
with the code in finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_grub2.sh  
as far as I could from plain looking at the code  
without actual knowledge about PPC64/PPC64LE.

@schabrolles  
I made this pull request somewhat 'blindly' only by plain looking at the
code  
without actual knowledge about PPC64/PPC64LE specific things  
because I have no PPC64/PPC64LE systems for testing.

Therefore I ask you for a very careful review of my changes here.

Please also test if it works to specify GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES  
on PPC64/PPC64LE systems as described in default.conf.

In particular I run now in any case

<pre>
# Generate GRUB configuration file anew to be on the safe side (this could be even mandatory in MIGRATION_MODE):
if ! chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "$grub_name-mkconfig -o /boot/$grub_name/grub.cfg" ; then
    LogPrintError "Failed to generate boot/$grub_name/grub.cfg in $TARGET_FS_ROOT - trying to install GRUB2 nevertheless"
fi
</pre>

I don't know if GRUB2 setup also is done in this way on PPC64/PPC64LE.  
Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828\#issuecomment-398717889](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-398717889)  
how the SUSE GRUB2 maintainer told me how to set up GRUB2 in general  
but perhaps his instructions are only meant for x86 compatible
architecture?

The last commit here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1848/commits/f23c601857a9b8e6cb08892b1e3b67257ad5314a](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1848/commits/f23c601857a9b8e6cb08892b1e3b67257ad5314a)  
is intended to fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1847](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1847)  
via the new `is_completely_identical_layout_mapping` function  
that detects a completely identical mapping and is used  
to not run the apply\_layout\_mappings function  
when there is a completely identical mapping.  
This particular commit functionality was tested by me on SLES15.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828\#issuecomment-404449224](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-404449224)  
my changes in this pull request should be o.k. - at least in theory -  
"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are
not."

@schabrolles  
if you don't find time to review and test it  
I think I could merge it nevertheless because  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828\#issuecomment-404449224](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-404449224)  
indicates I didn't do things totally wrong  
so that I would dare to merge it and see  
how things behave in the real world "out there".

I will merge it soon today...

@jsmeix, Ok for me ... I did not find the time to have a look to your
code, but I tested it on my system with rhel7.4 and sles12sp3 =&gt;
looks OK.

@schabrolles  
thank you so much for your test on a real POWER system.  
It shows at least that I didn't introduce a generic regression.
