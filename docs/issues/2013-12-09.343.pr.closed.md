hi,

$SHARE\_DIR is not set while startup scripts are executed (dhclient for
example hardcodes the directory), this  
makes the sesam client fail during startup. Simple fix attached which
hardodes the directory here.

Perhaps, it would be better that we write our main variables into
`/etc/rear/rescue.conf` so that we can have a consistent behavior
throughout our `system-setup` scripts

If we all agree then I'll add the following variables always to the
`rescue.conf` file (this conf is sourced by `setup-setup`)

    SHARE_DIR
    CONFIG_DIR
    VAR_DIR
    LOG_DIR

@abbbi if you use the latest github sources then your pull request is no
longer necessary. It was good to bring this to our attention
