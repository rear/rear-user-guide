-   How was this pull request tested?

I tested it same (on same VMs) as I did in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1643774477](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1643774477)  
but now with the changes here  
Secure Boot with OUTPUT=USB works for me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
add Secure Boot support for OUTPUT=USB by using  
SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER as first stage Secure Boot bootloader
BOOTX64.efi  
and using grub\*.efi as second stage Secure Boot bootloader files  
in the same way as already done for OUTPUT=ISO  
in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh

My current implementation here is just a first step.  
The whole code looks somewhat convoluted  
and needs at least some more generic cleanup  
to make it easier to further develop things in this area.

First things first:  
I will not clean up the whole UEFI and Secure Boot code  
via this pull request.  
Via this pull request only what is needed  
to get Secure Boot support with OUTPUT=USB  
in the current code environment  
should be implemented.

Later - as needed and as time permits - I would like  
to clean up step by step the whole UEFI and Secure Boot code.

In particular currently I do not like that  
via SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is overwritten  
because that makes it needlessly hard (at least for me)  
to understand the UEFI and Secure Boot code  
because it is not clear if in a particular piece of code  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER means a non-Secure-Boot bootloader  
OR  
if UEFI\_BOOTLOADER means a Secure Boot first stage bootloader  
AND  
in the latter case the user cannot configure  
the Secure Boot second stage bootloader.  
I would like to Keep Separated Items Separated - "KSIS" ;-)

@pcahyna @rear/contributors  
I have a question regarding the  
Secure Boot second stage bootloader files:

Currently those are (hardcoded) all files  
that match the bash globbing `grub*.efi`  
in the directory where SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is.

I wonder if it is more fail-safe to use all `*.efi` files  
in the directory where SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is,  
probably even all `*.efi` files with ignore case matching?

@pcahyna  
as far as I understand it (which I described in my comments)

    # Shim is a signed EFI binary that is a first stage bootloader
    # that loads and executes another (signed) EFI binary
    # which normally is a second stage bootloader
    # which normally is a GRUB EFI binary
    # which normally is available as a file named grub*.efi
    # so when SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER is used as UEFI_BOOTLOADER
    # (cf. rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh)
    # then Shim (usually shim.efi) must be copied as EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi
    # and Shim's second stage bootloader must be also copied where Shim already is.

the crucial point for Secure Boot is that  
the Shim first stage bootloader 'shim.efi' is a signed EFI binary  
and Shim's second stage bootloader (usually named 'grub\*.efi')  
is also a signed EFI binary  
which means  
both signed EFI binaries from the Linux distribution  
must be used unchanged for Secure Boot  
instead of using an unsigned EFI binary  
that gets created by build\_bootx86\_efi()

please, first things first:  
Does it work for you on RHEL (and/or Fedora) or not?  
If yes, on which RHEL (and/or Fedora) versions does it work?  
If no, where and how does it fail?

@rear/contributors  
it would be nice if someone could test it on Ubuntu or Debian.  
But as we do not have an active Ubuntu or Debian maintainer  
those distributions are of rather low interest for me.

I have not tried it yet - I merely looked at the code. I can schedule a
test on non-secureboot hardware to make sure that the change does not
break the case that was working before. I am interested to test with
Secure Boot as well, but this will have to wait a bit as I don't have a
test environment set up (I will probably be able to do it over the
weekend).

Regarding versions: Fedora 37 and later probably won't work because of
\#2971 (same problem with RHEL 9), although I could probably work around
this by configuring ReaR to use Secure Boot shim even if the firmware is
not actually set up for Secure Boot.

On non-secureboot hardware  
SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER must not be specified and  
then there should be no change in what gets done  
(because of the `if ... $SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER`).

Why is that the case?  
The shim bootloader is installed even on non-secureboot hardware,  
shouldn't it just work even without secureboot enabled?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2023-08-04 12:50](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1665558165):

Because SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is nowhere set to a non-empty value.  
Currently there is no Secure Boot autodetection code in ReaR  
as far as I understand things in this code area  
where I am not yet familiar with.

The UEFI\_BOOTLOADER autodetection code in  
rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
happens only for non-secureboot cases  
as far as I understand things  
because 'shim' (ignore case) does not appear in  
rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh

Currently 'shim' (ignore case) does only appear in  
finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/675\_install\_shim.sh  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh

Right, one has to set `SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER` manually in order to test
it.  
But, I would expect it to work even if the firmware is not configured
for Secure Boot.  
Wouldn't you?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2023-08-04 13:10](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1665586896):

Of course Secure Boot autodetection in ReaR  
would be an "expected" feature.

But this is nothing that belongs to this pull request  
and it is even nothing that belongs to the subsequent  
cleanup of the whole UEFI booting setup code in ReaR  
(because 'cleanup' != 'new features').

So I think Secure Boot autodetection in ReaR  
should not be impemented as long as we still  
have some mess of UEFI booting setup code  
but after we properly cleaned up our current code  
to make further development more fail-safe.

General improvements of UEFI related things in ReaR  
are on my longer term TODO list.

What I am currently doing here is trying to move  
step by step and carefully into this direction.

By the way:  
Didn't I somewhere already mention "first things first"?  
;-))

@jsmeix maybe you misunderstood what I meant. It is fine at this point
that Secure Boot is not autodetected and has to be configured manually
(which has been always the case with ISO boot, as far as I understand).
What I meant is that if the hardware is not configured for secure
booting, configuring Secure Boot in ReaR (by setting
`SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER`) should result in a medium that boots fine.
While Secure Boot requires a signed UEFI shim, non-secureboot UEFI
firmware does not mind using this shim as well, it just does not enforce
it.

I tested this on RHEL 8: my UEFI hardware is not configured for secure
booting and ReaR has been booting fine on it from disk (OUTPUT=USB).
With your change, I can now set  
`SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi`  
(RHEL is using this shim always, even if secure boot is not used) and
ReaR rescue disk boots again correctly. At the end of recovery, the boot
entry is restored to something like
`HD(1,GPT,ca381585-f4e2-418e-b583-13d02fba640b,0x800,0x12c000)/File(\EFI\redhat\shimx64.efi)`
which is correct.

I see only one minor problem: during boot I get

    error: ../../grub-core/fs/fshelp.c:258:file `/EFI/redhat/x86_64-efi/xzio.mod'
     not found.
     Loading kernel /EFI/BOOT/kernel ...
     Loading initial ramdisk /EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz ...
     
     Press any key to continue...

because the menu contains

        insmod xzio

and xzio is apparently not present in our default GRUB image. This does
not seem to cause any harm and if I don't press any key, the boot
continues in about 10 seconds. I wonder whether the `insmod xzio` part
can be safely removed (it won't work in any case when Secure Boot is
turned on, AIUI).

Regarding future plans: instead of Secure Boot autodetection, I would
prefer to use the Secure Boot code path always (even if Secure Boot is
not used) and get entirely rid of our own GRUB image generation for the
UEFI case (`build_bootx86_efi`). It would simplify the code and more
importantly, the GRUB image is broken anyway

No. I would do what `OUTPUT=ISO` is doing, unless there are known
problems with it. If you copy all `*.efi` files, you may also copy
`fbx64.efi`
([https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/fallback.html](https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/fallback.html)),
and that's probably not what one wants.

@pcahyna  
many thanks for your review and your explanatory comments!  
It is much appeciated!

I think I also experienced the same as you wrote in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1668061462](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1668061462)  
As it "somehow works" we should leave it "as is" for now  
and focus more on the general cleanup of UEFI booting.

Regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1668096663](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1668096663)

I think also SUSE always boots via Shim on UEFI systems  
(i.e. Shim = fist stage, GRUB2 = second stage) and  
I was also wondering if ReaR should for UEFI booting  
always "just copy" the (signed) EFI binaries of the  
Linux distribution (i.e. shim\*.efi and grub\*.efi)  
instead of making its own ReaR specific EFI binaries.

My current offhanded reasoning:

When the EFI binaries of the Linux distribution  
make the original system boot,  
then exactly those EFI binaries  
should also make the ReaR recovery system boot  
on replacement hardware  
because replacement hardware must be sufficiently  
compatible with the original system hardware.

Another (hopefully reasonable) assumption is that  
the (signed) EFI binaries of the Linux distribution  
should be sufficiently feature complete  
to boot the original system on various hardware  
from various kind of boot media (disk, CDROM, ISO).  
I assume Linux distribution use exactly the same  
(signed) EFI binaries on their installation media  
to boot their installation systems and  
also later on the disk of the installed system  
to boot the installed system.  
So I think exactly those (signed) EFI binaries  
should also make the ReaR recovery system boot  
on sufficiently compatible replacement hardware  
from various kind of boot media.  
Again there is the requirement that the replacement hardware  
is sufficiently compatible with the original system hardware  
which means in particular that the ReaR recovery system  
must be booted from a medium that is a supported medium  
to install the original system.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1668103656](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1668103656)

My "secret final plan" is to have  
some reasonable UEFI boot autodetection  
so UEFI\_BOOTLOADER and SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER  
do not need to be specified by the user  
but the user can use them if needed to specify  
the first stage Secure Boot bootloader EFI binary  
via SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER and  
the second stage Secure Boot bootloader EFI binary  
via UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
or - when only UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is specified  
the single stage UEFI bootloader EFI binary.

@rear/contributors  
I will merge it today afternoon unless objections appear.

@jsmeix thanks a lot for this improvement, in the meantime I tried it on
a Secure Boot enabled hardware with RHEL 8 (it works - both the rescue
image an the recovered system) and on Secure Boot disabled (but with
configured Secure Boot in ReaR via
`SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi`) with RHEL 9
(I don't test Secure Boot this way, but it confirms that using the shim
+ the default GRUB avoids
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2971](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2971)).

I believe that with Secure Boot, you are not allowed to insmod any GRUB
modules, so this should be a reasonable assumption - the GRUB image
should be indeed feature complete, avoiding the need for
grub2-mkstandalone (it also does not need to have the path to the
configuration file hardcoded, unlike on PC BIOS, because EFI passes to
GRUB the directory it was loaded from and GRUB locates and loads
grub.cfg in the same directory).

It is not only the recovery (rescue) system (where some deviations may
be necessary), it is also the recovered system. In my experience, when
recovering without `SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER` set, the recovered system
has a UEFI entry of this type

    Boot0016* RedHatEnterpriseServer 8      HD(1,GPT,f18ee8ed-2fdd-4984-8e71-95a82f99318d,0x800,0x12c000)/File(\EFI\redhat\grubx64.efi)

so, GRUB is directly booted, in contrast with the original system, which
has

    Boot000E* Red Hat Enterprise Linux      HD(1,GPT,a1d3cffa-2eb7-4a8a-b559-7f2241cba776,0x800,0x12c000)/File(\EFI\redhat\shimx64.efi)

(as it uses the shim always) - so the recovered system is different in
this respect from the original system. This will be a problem if the
user decides to turn Secure Boot on after the system was backed up and
recovered.

regarding autodetection, I believe it is needed to examine the current
boot entry (BootCurrent in efibootmgr output) during mkrescue and use it
to set the variables - something that is AFAIK not being done now.
