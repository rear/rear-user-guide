Accumulative issue for anything that we should do  
in preparation to release ReaR 2.2  
like documentation updates etc...

Some fixes for release-notes-2-2:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/037bda46bf87e2b9e834ee02f7a205f22f6f8551](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/037bda46bf87e2b9e834ee02f7a205f22f6f8551)

I decided to drop official support for openSUSE &lt;= 13  
(regardless that it should still work because SLE11 is supported)  
to match official support for only openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed.  
And I do no longer like to care about possible special differences  
on openSUSE &lt;= 13 compared to SLE11 (the latter is much more
stable)  
that could lead to special ReaR issues on openSUSE &lt;= 13.

@jsmeix thank you Johannes. I appreciated a lot that you took the time
to read the release notes.

@gdha

I corrected an entry for 2.1 (about REBUILD\_INITRAMFS).

Should I also correct that in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-1.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-1.md)  
?

@jsmeix sure then it is consistent. Thanks.

Release 2.2 just went out of the door.
