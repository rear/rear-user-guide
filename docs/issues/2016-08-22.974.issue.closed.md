I found a little bug in the incremental solution of rear.  
rear is actual working with differential backups based on the last full
backup. so it needs only to restore the last full and the newest
differential.  
this is not the right incremental backup and restore because rear is so
backing up every day a lot more than needed.  
is this so intended?

because we are backing up every day an postgres database (which does an
self full backup every day) so that the backup every day gets to large
to transmit it from the client to the data center.

here i found some info about that if needed:

@gdha @jsmeix Or maybe you could change the comparison in the file
`/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/07_set_backup_archive.sh` from

    if [ -f "${BUILD_DIR}/outputfs/${NETFS_PREFIX}/timestamp.txt" ]; then
    backuparchive="${BUILD_DIR}/outputfs/${NETFS_PREFIX}/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")-I${BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX}${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX}"
    BACKUP_PROG_X_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_X_OPTIONS --newer=$(cat ${BUILD_DIR}/outputfs/${NETFS_PREFIX}/timestamp.txt)"
    BACKUP_PROG_X_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_X_OPTIONS -V $(cat ${BUILD_DIR}/outputfs/${NETFS_PREFIX}/basebackup.txt)"
    Log "Performing Incremental-Backup $backuparchive"

to something of that to backup only files newer than the last backup
`date +%Y-%m-%d -d yesterday` `--newer-mtime '1 days ago'`

@dcz01 The code is now made that it only needs to restore one **full
backup** and **one incremental** backup (an incremental since last full
backup - it would perhaps be better if we called it *differential*
instead of incremental).  
We have no intention to change this in the near future.

@dcz01  
in your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974\#issue-172388615](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974#issue-172388615)  
I noticed "we are backing up every day an postgres database".

FYI regarding huge backup because it contains huge files  
like databases you may have a look at my personal opinion in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1006\#issuecomment-248862040](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1006#issuecomment-248862040)

@gdha  
regarding your "it would perhaps be better if we called  
it differential instead of incremental)":  
Do you intend to enhance the documentation?

If not I could try to to it.

If I do it I would not change any code  
(e.g. I would keep things like "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental")  
but I would try to make it clear in the documentation  
that "incremental" actually is "differential".

Or should I even try to also adapt the code e.g.  
change "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental"  
to "BACKUP\_TYPE=differential"  
or - if needed - keep it backward compatible  
that BACKUP\_TYPE could be "incremental" or "differential"  
and both lead to the same result?

I have a plan:

I will only enhance the documentation to make it clear  
that currently "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" functionality  
actually implements differential backup behaviour.

This way the "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental" functionality  
can be enhanced at a later time by a contributor to actually  
implement real incremental backup behaviour.

Have a look at my pull request
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1007](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1007)  
whether or not it is o.k. for you this way.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1007](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1007)  
I close this issue as "fixed".

@dcz01  
That "we have no intention to change this in the near future"  
does of course not mean that another contributor (e.g. you)  
could not enhance the current "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental"  
functionality to actually implement real incremental backup.

FYI:  
In general regarding contributing to Relax-and-Recover see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and the section  
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in

Typo correction in my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974\#issuecomment-249126761](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974#issuecomment-249126761)  
I meant:

That "we have no intention to change this in the near future"  
does of course not mean that another contributor (e.g. you)  
could *not* enhance the current "BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental"  
functionality to actually implement real incremental backup.

I.e. of course we do appreciate GitHub pull requests  
that enhance Relax-and-Recover functionality.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071)  
merged, there is now support for multiple restore archives  
which is a precondition to support real incremental backups  
so that there is now support for real incremantal backups  
and still support for differential backups.

There is a small behavioural change:  
Now BACKUP\_TYPE=incremental means real incremental backup  
and the new BACKUP\_TYPE=differential means what it tells.  
This is all described in default.conf

With that above pull request merged  
I consider this issue to be really fixed now.
