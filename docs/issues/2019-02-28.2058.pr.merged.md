-   How was this pull request tested? On a HP DL360 G9 / RHEL7.4

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    During the time working with the EMC Networker recovery I determined
    it is of additional use to not skip the retrieval of the filesystems
    in NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE I introduced with f09c3d3. It does not harm to
    do so since gathering this information is "read-only" for the
    client.  
    Due to saving the save sets filesystem information in
    $VAR\_DIR/recovery/nsr\_paths within the recovery image one is able
    to retrieve/read this stored information during a recovery process
    i.e. for advising the EMC networker server team to recover the
    appropriate filesystem(-structure) from the backups beeing made.

@gdha  
because you had approved
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1584](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1584)  
you may also like to have a look here.

If you (or otheres) do not object I would "just merge" it tomorrow.

@hpannenb  
thank you for your continuous contributions to ReaR  
that make ReaR work better with EMC Networker.

It is much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have third-party backup tools so that  
we at ReaR upstream depend on contributions to ReaR  
from users who actually use third-party backup tools.
