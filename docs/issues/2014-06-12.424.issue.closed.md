TSM Client uses LC\_CTYPE for Restoring files.  
With LC\_CTYPE=C tsm is unable to restore öäüß,..... ( Mashine on
LC\_CTYPE="en\_US.UTF-8" for example)

Would it be Possible to make an Setting for TSM.  
So it is possible to set only for TSM another Environment, so Restoring
special Character gets possible?  
Error:  
ANS1154E Object name '/data/Neugeschï¿¤ft' contains an i nvalid
multibyte sequence for the current locale.  
\*\* Unsuccessful \*\*

Maybe we should somehow clone these variables from the source system?

We have had some Problems on some server so we used because user using
öä via samba, even if the system doesn't have the right Enviroment  
So we used:

/etc/inittab  
TSM:2345:respawn:env LC\_ALL=de\_DE@euro /usr/bin/dsmc sched
&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1

for backup. And i think also common is using an init Script to Start
Sheduler for backup. So it isnt always the same of the server, so it
would be useful when it can be overwritten manually via
/etc/rear/local.conf

@tyl0re @schlomo We could foresee a `LANG=${LANG_RECOVER} dsmc ...` and
when `$LANG_RECOVER` is empty make it by default C?

Yes, but i think it should be LC\_ALL for all Variables  
LC\_ALL=${LANG\_RECOVER} dsmc.... ; LC\_ALL=C

@tyl0re \[master d33cc9c\] define a new variable LANG\_RECOVER in
default.conf file which is used via LC\_ALL=$LANG\_RECOVER dsmc in the
different scripts used by TSM workflow;  
forgot to mention the issue nr in the commit
