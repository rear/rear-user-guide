because somebody follows symlinks into the rescue system. I suppose that
we should look into doing all sorts of file-based operations in the
restored file space under `chroot` so that absolute symlinks will
actually refer to the matching files **in** the restores file systems.

@schlomo  
I do not fully understand what exactly you mean but  
I guess you are talking about the section

<pre>
        # sed -i bails on symlinks, so we follow the symlink and patch the result
        # on dead links we warn and skip them
        # TODO: maybe we must put this into a chroot so that absolute symlinks will work correctly
        if test -L "$file" ; then
                if linkdest="$(readlink -f "$file")" ; then
                        # if link destination is residing on /proc we skip it silently
                        echo $linkdest | grep -q "^/proc" && continue
                        LogPrint "Patching '$linkdest' instead of '$file'"
                        file="$linkdest"
                else
                        LogPrint "Not patching dead link '$file'"
                        continue
                fi
        fi
</pre>

in each of the  
finalize/GNU/Linux/250\_migrate\_disk\_devices\_layout.sh  
finalize/GNU/Linux/250\_migrate\_lun\_wwid.sh  
finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
scripts?

Interestingly there is another 'finalize' script  
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
that also runs 'sed -i' but does not care about symlinks:

<pre>
        for network_file in $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/sysconfig/*/ifcfg-*${new_mac}* $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/sysconfig/*/ifcfg-*${dev}*; do
        ...
            sed -i -e "$SED_SCRIPT" "$network_file"
</pre>

On my SLES11 and SLES12 systems (I will not look at SLES10 ;-)  
"man sed" shows:

<pre>
       --follow-symlinks
              follow symlinks when processing in place

       -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]
              edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)
</pre>

so that "sed --follow-symlinks -i file\_or\_symlink" should "just
work"  
which it does on my SLES12 system:

<pre>
# echo old >foo

# ln -s foo slfoo

# ls -l *foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4 May 16 11:12 foo
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 May 16 11:12 slfoo -> foo

# sed --follow-symlinks -i -e 's/old/new/' slfoo

# echo $?
0

e205:~ # cat foo
new
</pre>

BUT hooray!:-( the same "just fails" on my SLES11 system with

<pre>
# ls -l *foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4 May 16 11:15 foo
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 May 16 11:09 slfoo -> foo

# sed --follow-symlinks -i -e 's/old/new/' slfoo
sed: ck_follow_symlink: couldn't lstat s/foo: No such file or directory

# echo $?
4
</pre>

WTH blabbers it about 's/foo'?  
It is left as an exercise to the reader to find some  
matching bug reports about 'sed' on the Internet ;-)

When we implement request from issue \#1638 this may fix this?

@jsmeix As you are owner of issue \#1638 I dare to assign this issue to
you as well - if you think this is not appropriate then un-assign
yourself

I will have a look - as time permits.

Offhandedly I think
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1638](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1638)  
is different but somehow related (also about symlink weirdness).

@jsmeix any update on this topic. It wouldn't hurt to move the milestone
in my opinion as well if you do not have the time for it. It is not
urgent at all. Thanks

@gdha  
unfortunately I found no time to have a closer look at this issue  
but because we got no actualy issue reports in this area  
I think we can move it to the next ReaR 2.5.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055)  
I tried to improve symlink handling in finalize scripts a bit  
(avoid to patch wrong files as a first step)  
but to me the finalize scripts look somewhat obscure  
(it seems they "just do" some stuff without much care)  
so that basically I feel somewhat overstrained with that task...

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2055)  
a first step towards actually fixing this issue is done.

Fixing this issue is not doable in the currently planned time until
the  
ReaR 2.5 release so that I postpone it for the next ReaR 2.6 release,
cf.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/78d7a519b4700c828544df00763a90886e0847a6](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/78d7a519b4700c828544df00763a90886e0847a6)  
I introduced the `valid_restored_file_for_patching` function for now
only in  
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh\#L47](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh#L47)  
to see if and how it works there.

If things work o.k. there I think the `valid_restored_file_for_patching`
function  
is the right generic way to determine the actualy right target system
files.
