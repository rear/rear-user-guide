Do no longer specify '-o fat=16' when loop mounting efiboot.img file  
but rely on the automatic FAT type detection when mounting

@gdha @gozora  
could you have a look here if that change looks OK to you?

I wonder if `-F 16` is actually needed for `mkfs.vfat` ?

output/ISO/Linux-ia64/200\_mount\_bootimg.sh  
indicates `-F 16` was specified because 'size &gt;30MB'

    # make sure we select FAT16 instead of FAT12 as size >30MB
    mkfs.vfat $v -F 16 $TMP_DIR/boot.img

but on my openSUSE Leap 15.2 "man mkfs.vfat" reads (excerpt)

    -F FAT-SIZE
      Specifies the type of file allocation tables used (12, 16 or 32 bit).
      If nothing is specified, mkfs.fat will automatically select between
      12, 16 and 32 bit, whatever fits better for the filesystem size.

so also for `mkfs.vfat` it seems to be better to  
rely on what "mkfs.fat will automatically select".

@rmetrich  
could you have a look here if that should be OK for Red Hat  
in particular for older Red Hat versions, see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2575\#issuecomment-785901507](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2575#issuecomment-785901507)  
how things look on SLES11 according to what the man pages tell there.

@gozora  
thank you for having a look!  
I did not expect that you test it.  
But perhaps you had known a reason why FAT16 was enforced with `-F 16`  
(there was no comment that could have explained why that `-F 16` was
there).

What do you think about

Hello @jsmeix,

> What do you think about

I think that changing defaults to 512MB is OK. 400MB is not a nice
number and I'm not surprised that some UEFI versions might have problems
with.

From my point of view this pull request is now sufficiently complete  
so I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections.

@OliverO2 @gozora  
thank you for your help with this issue!  
It is much appreciated because I am really not an expert in that area.
