-   Brief description of the issue

    When running `rear -v mkbackuponly` with BACKUP=NETFS and specified
    BACKUP\_URL in local.conf it fails with ERROR: Making backup on / is
    forbidden.

-   Actual results:  
    ERROR: Making backup on / is forbidden. Use an external device!  
    Terminated

-   Expected results:  
    Data backup is created in specified directory.

@tcerna  
the "Making backup on / is forbidden" error message comes from  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/40\_automatic\_exclude\_recreate.sh

You need to run it in debug mode:

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

and then inspect the rear log file what leads to that error  
in your particular case.

Inspect your rear log file what happens after the line

<pre>
+ source /root/rear/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default
</pre>

Something smells here...

Sometimes it also fails for me, sometimes it works for me.

I tested different BACKUP\_URL=file://  
but that does not matter whether or not it work.

Below it worked with BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup

When it works for me I have in the rear log file:

<pre>
+ source /root/rear/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/40_automatic_exclude_recreate.sh
+++ url_scheme file:///rearbackup
+++ local url=file:///rearbackup
+++ local scheme=file
+++ echo file
+++ grep -q :
+++ echo file
++ local scheme=file
+++ url_path file:///rearbackup
+++ local url=file:///rearbackup
+++ local url_without_scheme=/rearbackup
+++ echo /rearbackup
++ local path=/rearbackup
++ case $scheme in
+++ df -P /rearbackup
+++ tail -1
+++ awk '{print $6}'
++ _mntpt=
++ [[ '' = \/ ]]
</pre>

I.e. when it works for me the command

<pre>
_mntpt=$(df -P ${path} 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | awk '{print $6}')
</pre>

results an empty \_mntpt variable  
regardless that on command line I get

<pre>
f121:~ # df -P /rearbackup                                         
Filesystem     1024-blocks    Used Available Capacity Mounted on

f121:~ # df -P /rearbackup 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | awk '{print $6}'
/
</pre>

Something is wrong here =&gt; somewhere there is a bug.

@gdha  
can you provide background information about the  
reason why "Making backup on / is forbidden"?

Is perhaps meant that for a locally stored backup  
the backup directory must be on a different filesystem  
than what the '/' directory is to avoid a loop where  
the backup directory content gets also backed up?

Do you perhaps even have an idea why sometimes

<pre>
_mntpt=$(df -P ${path} 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | awk '{print $6}')
</pre>

results an empty \_mntpt variable?

As a side note:  
I also do not understand what you meant with  
the comment in the line

<pre>
     (file) # if user added path manually then there is no need to do it again
</pre>

-   Brief description of the issue

When I run `rear mkbackup -v` for the first time with above settings it
creates backup with image successfully.  
If I wants to make backup again (with same settings, but without
deleting previously created files), it fails with this error (bellow) -
no matter what backup... it fails with all "subcommands": mkbackup,
mkbackuponly, mkrescue!!!

    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-rearserver.log
    ERROR: Making backup on / is forbidden. Use an external device!
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-rearserver.log for details

-   Questions & suggestions:

Is there a problem with overwriting files ? (if yes, it could print
proper message)  
Is storing backup on the same filesystem forbidden ?  
I think it shouldn't block to make a rescue image even if there is any
problem with BACKUP\* variables/settings.

I think by default "rear mkbackup" does not care about old files  
(i.e. it just overwrites them).  
Regarding avoiding overwriting files see  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover (rear) versus backup and restore"  
at
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think "rear mkbackup" should error out whenever there  
is an error, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I think it must error out whenever a specified thing  
cannot be done, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913\#issuecomment-232661112](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913#issuecomment-232661112)

I assume the root cause here is that rear does not care  
sufficiently about possible errors at the actually right place  
and blindly proceeds until it errors out somewhere later  
at an unrelated place with a weird error message which leads  
to false assumptions about the root cause of the issue and then  
to false fixes that cure only a symptom but not the root cause.

I will do a deeper analysis what actually goes on here.

I would very much appreciate any help from others with that  
analysis so that finally we can fix it properly.

One must avoid a BACKUP\_URL=file:///dir  
where /dir is included in the backup.

For me "rear mkbackup" with BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup  
(where /rearbackup did not already exist before) worked  
but results the backup in the backup:

<pre>

Restoring that backup results a /rearbackup/$HOSTNAME  
directory that contains invalid files (in particular an invalid  
backup.tar.gz).

I think "rear recover" that restores /rearbackup/$HOSTNAME  
directory that contains invalid files only looks not nice  
but it does not lead to an actually broken system  
because the other files should be o.k.

What matters more is that having the backup in the backup  
increases needlessly the backup size to basically double size  
at least in my case where /rearbackup/$HOSTNAME/backup.tar.gz  
was added last to the backup as reported in  
/rearbackup/$HOSTNAME/backup.log

</pre>

But again a needlessly increased backup size  
is not a fatal error.

I wonder if rear should try to be smarter than the user  
and implement sophisticated test to avoid such kind  
of user faults.

I think it belongs to the user to think about in advance  
how to set up rear correctly.

From my current point of view I would close that issue  
as an example of improper usage of rear.

The only bug that is see is the misleading error message

<pre>
ERROR: Making backup on / is forbidden. Use an external device!
</pre>

when one does a second "rear mkbackup"  
with BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup  
where /rearbackup did already exists.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-07-21 10:32](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926#issuecomment-234217021):

With BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup  
where /rearbackup is a mountpoint of a separated filesystem  
(ex2 on /dev/sdb1in my case) the backup is o.k.:

<pre>
# ls -l /rearbackup/f121/backup.tar.gz
-rw------- 1 root root 1266451979 Jul 21 12:20 /rearbackup/f121/backup.tar.gz
# tar -tzvf /rearbackup/f121/backup.tar.gz | grep rearbackup
drwxr-xr-x root/root            0 2016-07-21 12:18 rearbackup/
[no further output]
# mount | grep sdb
/dev/sdb1 on /rearbackup type ext2 (rw,relatime)
</pre>

Now even a second "rear mkbackup" works as intended  
regardless that /rearbackup already exists.  
I have NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=yes  
and accordingly I have after the second "rear mkbackup"

<pre>
# find /rearbackup

And a third "rear mkbackup" now  
without NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY  
just overwrites the files in /rearbackup/f121/  
in particular I have now

<pre>
# ls -l /rearbackup/*/backup.tar.gz

</pre>

Conclusion from my point of view:

With a proper set up everything works fine for me with  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///...

The only thing left is to find out how the "\_mntpt" test  
in prep/NETFS/default/40\_automatic\_exclude\_recreate.sh  
is meant:

@gdha  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926\#issuecomment-233304673](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926#issuecomment-233304673)  
can you explain how the "\_mntpt" test  
in prep/NETFS/default/40\_automatic\_exclude\_recreate.sh  
is meant to work - i.e. what is the idea behind that test.

Stupid me!

The "\_mntpt" test  
in prep/NETFS/default/40\_automatic\_exclude\_recreate.sh  
results an empty \_mntpt when the directory in  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///directory  
does not yet exist because

<pre>
# df -P qqq 2>/dev/null
# df -P qqq
df: 'qqq': No such file or directory
</pre>

and it correctly finds out that the director is mounted at '/'  
when it already exists.

I will enhace the test to be more fail-safe...

ERROR: URL 'file:///etc/rear/local.conf' specifies '/etc/rear/local.conf' which is not a directory.
</pre>

With BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup (as above)  
where /rearbackup is a mountpoint of a separated filesystem  
it still works for me:

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f121.log
Creating disk layout
Excluding component fs:/rearbackup
...
</pre>

But with BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup/subdir  
where /rearbackup is a mountpoint of a separated filesystem  
but /rearbackup/subdir does not yet exist  
it did not work correctly:

<pre>
ERROR: URL 'file:///rearbackup/subdir' would result the backup directory '/rearbackup/subdir' in the '/' filesystem which is forbidden.
</pre>

I fixed handling when backup directory does not yet exist in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/936](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/936)  
so that now BACKUP\_URL=file:///rearbackup/subdir  
also works as intended

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f121.log
Creating disk layout
Excluding component fs:/rearbackup
...
</pre>

and in rear-f121.log I get now

<pre>
+ source /root/rear/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/40_automatic_exclude_recreate.sh
+++ url_scheme file:///rearbackup/subdir
+++ local url=file:///rearbackup/subdir
+++ local scheme=file
+++ grep -q :
+++ echo file
+++ echo file
++ local scheme=file
+++ url_path file:///rearbackup/subdir
+++ local url=file:///rearbackup/subdir
+++ local url_without_scheme=/rearbackup/subdir
+++ echo /rearbackup/subdir
++ local backup_directory=/rearbackup/subdir
++ local backup_directory_mountpoint=
++ case $scheme in
++ test -e /rearbackup/subdir
++ mkdir -v -p /rearbackup/subdir
mkdir: created directory '/rearbackup/subdir'
++ test -d /rearbackup/subdir
+++ tail -1
+++ awk '{print $6}'
+++ df -P /rearbackup/subdir
++ backup_directory_mountpoint=/rearbackup
++ test / = /rearbackup
...
</pre>

and this is result

<pre>
# ls -l /rearbackup/*/*/backup.tar.gz
-rw------- 1 root root 1266459574 Jul 21 15:34 /rearbackup/subdir/f121/backup.tar.gz
</pre>

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926\#issuecomment-234255678](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926#issuecomment-234255678)  
it looks hood to me and I like to have it tested by @tcerna  
so that I simply merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/936](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/936)
now.

@tcerna  
does it now work better for you with current GitHub master code?

Of course I also like to have it tested by  
@scr4bble  
does it now work better for you with current GitHub master code?

Closing it.
