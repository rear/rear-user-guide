-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

There seems to be something wrong with the ISO image.  
The virtual machine cannot be booted with it.  
Attached you will find three screenshots with the screen messages.  
The numbering corresponds to the order in which the screen messages
appear.  
After "Press any key to continue..." nothing happens.  
What else do I have to do to make the machine bootable?

I also noticed that the two files xzio and fshelp,  
which were not found during the boot process,  
are entered in the backup log file:  
block 7609484: /usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/xzio.mod  
block 7600337: /usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/fshelp.mod

Only kernel.exec is entered in the ISO log file:  
/usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/kernel.exec

The two files xzio and fshelp were not entered into the ISO log file.  
The initrd.cgz file is included in the ISO log file:  
2024-09-04 11:35:00.755448505 Created initrd.cgz with gzip default
compression (778 MiB) in 56 seconds

-   Workaround, if any:  
    No

First analysis was performed by jsmeix for issue \#3230:

according to your  
\#3230 (comment)  
(excerpt)

    There are no more problems with the multipath devices.

    However, there seems to be something wrong with the ISO image.
    The virtual machine cannot be booted with it.

this issue has now changed its topic / subject  
from something about

    NVMe multipathing devices

to something about

    UEFI booting from ReaR's ISO image

which is somewhat problematic for us because  
we at ReaR upstream (and in particular I)  
prefer separated issues for separated topics  
so that the right people who know best about  
a certain area could focus on a particular issue.

So ideally I wished you could re-report your  
"UEFI booting from ReaR's ISO image" issue  
as a new separated issue here at GitHub.

I am not at all an expert in UEFI booting and  
I am also in general not an expert in booting stuff  
so personally I cannot help much with booting issues.

In particular am not a Red Hat / Fedora / Oracle Linux user  
so I cannot reproduce issues which are specific for  
those Linux distributions (and in particular booting issues  
are often specific for a particular Linux distribution).

For my personal experience with UEFI booting  
from ReaR's ISO image you may read through  
\#3084  
in particular therein see  
\#3084 (comment)  
(and follow the links therein as needed)  
and see  
\#3084 (comment)  
and finally see  
\#3084 (comment)

By the way:  
I think both

    UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi
    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi

are currently not supported in ReaR because  
setting SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER overwrites UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
and when SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is set it specifies the  
first-stage bootloader (which is shim) and then shim  
runs as second-stage bootloader something that is  
basically hardcoded inside shim so that what ReaR does  
is to copy all possible second-stage bootloaders  
(basicaly all GRUB EFI binaries as far as I remember)  
into the ISO to make shim's second-stage bootloader  
available via the ISO, cf. the comments in  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
starting at

    # Copy UEFI bootloader:
    if test -f "$SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER" ; then

currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh\#L65](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh#L65)  
This is for OUTPUT=USB but since  
\#3031  
it is similar as what is done for OUTPUT=ISO.  
For background information what I had done in the past  
you may have a look at  
\#3031  
(and follow the links therein as needed).

@jsmeix

Thank you for the detailed initial analysis.  
The Red Hat Customer Portal recommends the following entries in the
local.conf configuration file:

    UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi
    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi

The recommendation is marked as SOLUTION VERIFIED and dated August 2,
2024. The recommendation has the following link:  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051)

Based on this recommendation, should I keep the two entries in the
configuration file or delete the entries and then try to create a
bootable ISO image again?

@StefanFromMunich  
I am not a Oracle Linux user so I cannot actually help  
with issues that seem to be specific for Oracle Linux.

In general support here at ReaR upstream  
is on a voluntary base as time permits  
as best-effort without guarantee/warranty/liability  
(in particular when people work on other things  
that have higher priority by their employer ;-)

Whoops!  
I falsely thought it is about Red Hat  
but actually it is Oracle Linux Server.

So @StefanFromMunich  
when you have an Oracle Linux Server support contract  
you may better contact them directly for further help.

@pcahyna  
I am sorry for causing confusion.  
I edited my above comment accordingly.

@pcahyna  
I do not have an Oracle Linux Server support contract or a Red Hat Linux
support contract.  
Therefore, I need the solution from ReaR support.

I have chosen the Oracle Linux Server with the following operating
system option:  
**Red Hat Compatible Kernel**

This means that the kernel of the Oracle Linux Server is identical to
the kernel that is supplied with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  
I am working with an x86\_64 client. Red Hat Enterprise Linux equips
these clients with the **Fedora Linux distribution**.  
The development of the Fedora Linux distribution is controlled by the
Fedora project.  
The manufacturer Red Hat is the leader of the Fedora project.

Since you are the expert on Red Hat Linux distributions, it is also
right that you are dealing with the topic.  
So please tell me what steps I have to take to get a bootable ISO image?

@pcahyna  
The Red Hat Customer Portal recommends the following entries in the
local.conf configuration file:

    UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi
    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi

The recommendation is marked as SOLUTION VERIFIED and dated August 2,
2024. The recommendation has the following link:  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051)

Now I checked the availability of the two files on the server in the
path /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/:

    $ sudo ls -al /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/
    drwx------. 3 root root    4096  4. Sep 09:26 .
    drwx------. 5 root root    4096 12. Apr 2021  ..
    -rwx------. 1 root root     134 23. Apr 19:37 BOOTX64.CSV
    drwx------. 2 root root    4096  7. Jun 08:34 fonts
    -rwx------. 1 root root    6511 11. Dez 2023  grub.cfg
    -rwx------. 1 root root    1024  4. Sep 09:26 grubenv
    -rwx------. 1 root root 2367664  7. Jun 08:34 grubx64.efi
    -rwx------. 1 root root  861512 23. Apr 19:37 mmx64.efi
    -rwx------. 1 root root  960272 23. Apr 19:37 shimx64.efi
    -rwx------. 1 root root  963088 23. Apr 19:37 shimx64-oracle.efi

Both files are located in the path that needs to be referenced in the
configuration file.  
What do you suggest next?

@StefanFromMunich Perhaps you could add the 2 missing modules:

    block 7609484: /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/xzio.mod
    block 7600337: /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/fshelp.mod

in the /etc/rear/local.conf file with the variable:

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi )

Unfortunately, the computer cannot be booted with the new COPY\_AS\_IS
configuration parameter.  
I have now found out that it is due to ReaR version 2.7.  
The virtual machine can be booted with ReaR version 2.6.  
There is no alternative to using ReaR version 2.6.  
We have also now found that it is difficult to perform a disaster
recovery with a virtual machine.  
You have to configure a lot with ReaR and even if it works, we think the
test is not very meaningful.  
We are therefore planning to replace the two SATA disks from the
original computer with two new SATA disks.  
We then want to perform a disaster recovery on the new disks in the
original computer. After that, the original computer should work
perfectly again.  
We will then test that.  
If there are any problems with this test, I will let you know.  
In any case, this incident can be closed due to the available
workaround.

@StefanFromMunich

FYI regarding

    We are therefore planning to replace the two SATA disks
    from the original computer with two new SATA disks.
    We then want to perform a disaster recovery on the new disks
    in the original computer.

When the new disks do not have exact same size and type  
as the old ones, you do a migration onto different  
(physical or virtual) hardware.  
See in conf/default.conf the description about  
MIGRATION\_MODE  
and see also in conf/default.conf the description about  
DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED  
and the sections  
"Prepare replacement hardware for disaster recovery"  
and  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In particular when you use virtual disks  
I would recommend to make the new ones with  
exact same size and same type as the old ones  
(usually one can set up various kind of virtual disks)  
to avoid "migration onto different hardware" issues,  
i.e. so that when the old one was e.g. a  
123456.0 MiB /dev/sda virtual disk, then the new one  
should be also a 123456.0 MiB /dev/sda virtual disk.

Regarding migration to a system with a bit smaller or a bit bigger
disk  
see in conf/default.conf the description of the config variables  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE

I recommend to not use AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS="yes"  
with layout/prepare/default/430\_autoresize\_all\_partitions.sh  
because that may result bad aligned partitions in particular  
bad aligned for what flash memory based disks (i.e. SSDs) need  
that usually need a 4MiB or 8MiB alignment (a too small value  
will result lower speed and less lifetime of flash memory devices),  
see the comment at USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE  
in default.conf

In general regarding system migration with ReaR  
(e.g. to a system with substantially different disk size):

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also a virtual machine)  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
to automatically do the annoying legwork for you.

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before.

Additionally ReaR supports to migrate a system  
but here "supports" means that ReaR provides a lot  
that should help you to get such a task done  
but it does not mean that it would "just work" without  
possibly laborious manual settings and adaptions  
with trial and error legwork until you made things work  
for you in your particular case.
