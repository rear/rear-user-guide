In backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh

Now do first backup the mounted filesystems  
to backup '/' first so the basic system files  
get stored first in the backup and  
then backup what is specified in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3177\#issuecomment-1985926458](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3177#issuecomment-1985926458)

Report suspicious cases as LogPrintError  
to have the user at least informed.

Remove duplicates but keep the ordering (via unique\_unsorted)  
to avoid possibly unwanted and unexpected subtle consequences,

Verify that at least '/' is in backup-include.txt  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3217](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3217)

Redirect stdout into files exactly at the command where needed  
instead of more global redirections, cf. "horrible coding style"

In backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
unique\_unsorted is no longer needed because  
backup-include.txt is already without duplicates  
because unique\_unsorted is now called in  
backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
so replaced unique\_unsorted calls back to 'cat', cf.

@rear/contributors  
I intend to merge it later today  
because this is needed as a precondition for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175)  
on SUSE with its default btrfs structure with snapshots

I ignore the CI failures

    Build Packages / build (push) Failing after 8m 
    testing-farm:fedora-40-x86_64 — Error ... 
    testing-farm:fedora-rawhide-x86_64 — Tests failed ...

in particular because other 'testing-farm' checks succeed  
so I assume the failing 'testing-farm' checks have reasons  
that are not in my code changes.

The added verification that at least '/' is in backup-include.txt leads
to problems in our setup with borg backup. We have multiple rear conf
files to backup data into different borg repositories (basic\_system,
home, var, ...)

'/' is therefore included in basic\_system.conf only. Running
`rear -C /etc/rear/home.conf mkbackuponly` exits with the 'Error "At
least the root filesystem must be backed up"' error accordingly.

It would be great if there was an option to disable this check (at least
when using borg backup).

@fishgit  
thank you so much for your regression report!  
It is much appreciated.

I am sorry - I had totally forgotten about the

    # rear -C something_else_backup mkbackuponly

possibility - how embarrasing :-(

I (hopefully) fixed that regression right now  
via a direct commit to our master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37a81e168fe20a183f8230a1b9b8a89a0b043db8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37a81e168fe20a183f8230a1b9b8a89a0b043db8)

@fishgit  
please test our current GitHub master code if my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37a81e168fe20a183f8230a1b9b8a89a0b043db8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37a81e168fe20a183f8230a1b9b8a89a0b043db8)  
is actually a proper fix for your use case  
and report here how it behaves for you.

@rear/contributors  
as time permits - please have a look at my  
direct commit to our master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37a81e168fe20a183f8230a1b9b8a89a0b043db8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/37a81e168fe20a183f8230a1b9b8a89a0b043db8)  
and review if it looks OK to you.  
In this particular case I dared to fix the regression  
via a direct commit to our master code because  
in this case "a proper fix" looked sufficiently simple  
and straightforward to me and I wanted to get my regression  
fixed myself as fast as reasonably possible.

@jsmeix  
thank you for this instant fix!

I can confirm that your commit solves the problem we had.

@fishgit  
thank you for your prompt and positive feedback!

@fishgit @rear/contributors  
I wish you all a relaxed and recovering weekend!

At least my weekend is now much more relaxed  
with having this regression fixed :-)
