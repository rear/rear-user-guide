I wonder if the Source function shouldn't bail out with BugError  
when it is called with an argument that cannot be sourced.

Reason: I think any "Source unsourceable\_file" in the code  
is a programming error.

Or do I misunderstand it and there is a reason why  
"Source unsourceable\_file" is just ignored/skipped?

Here the story behind
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/738](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/738)

I made a programming error by calling

<pre>
Source "wrapup/default/99_copy_logfile.sh"
</pre>

Instead of a direct error the Source function ignored/skipped  
it and I had to find out later the hard way why I got no log file  
copied into the target system.

Personally I prefer an immediate error exit directly at the place  
where something is wrong that cannot be automatically corrected  
over proceeding until a failure happens later - possibly in a very  
unexpected way at a totally different place (see below).

See also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700)
that has the same goal (immediate error exit when something is wrong).

Note the above "that cannot be automatically corrected":

I still like to implement that the Source function uses  
"$SHARE\_DIR/$source\_file" if "$source\_file" is not an  
absolute path (i.e. when it has no leading '/') as described  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/738](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/738)

But I would also like to implement that the Source function  
does a BugError exit when it cannot source "$source\_file"  
or "$SHARE\_DIR/$source\_file".

FYI:  
Such a late failure in an unexpected way at a totally different place  
had happened in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544)
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544\#issuecomment-151133875](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544#issuecomment-151133875)
how it proceeded with wrong data until it failed in the
get\_partition\_number function with the strange "More than 128
partitions is not supported" error message.

This code in `usr/sbin/rear` relies on this feature:

    SetOSVendorAndVersion
    # Distribution configuration files:
    for config in "$ARCH" "$OS" \
            "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR" "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR_ARCH" "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION" "$OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH" \
            "$OS_VENDOR" "$OS_VENDOR_ARCH" "$OS_VENDOR_VERSION" "$OS_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH" ; do
        test -r "$SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf" && Source "$SHARE_DIR/conf/$config.conf" || true
    done
    # User configuration files, last thing is to overwrite variables if we are in the rescue system:
    for config in site local rescue ; do
        test -r "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" && Source "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" || true
    done

All these config files are optional.

I will have a closer look - but at first glance doesn't the

<pre>
test -r "$file" && Source "$file"
</pre>

ensure that the Source function is not called with unsourceable files?

Perhaps to better match the test in the Source function

<pre>
    if ! test -s "$source_file" ; then
        Debug "Skipping Source() because source file '$source_file' not found or empty"
        return
    fi
</pre>

it should be the same test used in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
test -s "$file" && Source "$file"
</pre>

I think - strictly speaking - the real correct test  
to find out if $file is sourceable is

<pre>
bash -n "$file" && Source "$file"
</pre>

Of course "bash -n" is only limited useful

<pre>
bash -n /etc/rear/local.conf && echo y || echo n
y
# bash -n /etc/fstab && echo y || echo n
y
</pre>

but at least a little bit better than "test -s":

<pre>
# bash -n /boot/vmlinuz && echo y || echo n
/boot/vmlinuz: /boot/vmlinuz: cannot execute binary file
n
# test -s /boot/vmlinuz && echo y || echo n
y
</pre>

;-)

@jsmeix looking again at the code that *I* quoted makes me think that
you are right. We should remember separation of concerns and decide what
is the responsibility of the `Source` function.

**Idea:**  
Add a `--skipmissing` command line parameter to the `Source` function
and use that for reading the configs and not use it in the `SourceStage`
code. Without this parameter `Source` will exit with `BugError` on
missing scripts.

This should make the code in `usr/sbin/rear` simpler.

With regard to `bash -n`, maybe for reading configs this is a good idea.
For code scripts I would prefer to do this during build and not during
runtime.

In general, we should also make sure that we bail out with meaningful
stack traces if users provide broken config.

I fully agree to move the testing responsibility into the Source
function  
because then it is implemented once at one place plus a parameter  
for the Source function to specify how it should do its tests.

I suggest to keep in the Source function

<pre>
local source_file="$1"
</pre>

so that all existsing "Source $file" works as before and  
have an optional

<pre>
local error_behaviour="$2"
</pre>

to optionally specify what to do in case of errors.

For example things like:

<pre>
Source "$file" "skip_if_missing"
Source "$file" "skip_if_syntax_error"
Source "$file" "skip_if_any_error"
Source "$file" "exit_if_missing"
Source "$file" "exit_if_syntax_error"
Source "$file" "exit_if_any_error""
</pre>

where

<pre>
Source "$file"
</pre>

implements the current (default) behaviour.

@jsmeix sounds good to me - back-worth compatibility is important

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2015-12-15 15:41](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/741#issuecomment-164801983):

Backward compatibility is mandatory!  
Except for severe bugs and security issues where an  
incompatible change is sometimes the only way to fix it.

Interestingly the Source function is only called in usr/sbin/rear  
(as shown above in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/741\#issuecomment-164780547](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/741#issuecomment-164780547))  
and  
by the SourceStage function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh

Therefore it is easy to change as we like and even  
backward compatibility is actually no real issue here  
because we could change that few places as we like.

Nevertheless I keep it backward compatible.

I will make a pull request...

Ah, I would really prefer to stick to the Unix command line standards.

What is wrong with something like this:

    local skip_if_missing=""
    if [[ "$1" == "--skipmissing" ]] ; then
        skip_if_missing=yes
        shift
    fi
    ... previous code ...

And if we need to add more arguments then we can also employ `getopts`
and friends.

I would initially also implement *only* the parts that we actually need
for one change and not put there any features that we don't need ATM.

All that is actually backwards compatible because I don't think that we
have any use case where we `Source` files that start from `--`.

@schlomo  
also o.k. for me.

I will change my current

and then do a pull request.

Also I implemented only what is actually needed right now  
(I like to avoid possible bugs with too much at once).

I found out that I cannot keep the default error behaviour  
backward compatible when I like to get it safer against  
programming errors.

Assume there is /usr/share/rear/myscript.sh and

<pre>
Source "myscirpt.sh"
</pre>

then I like to have it directly bail out with BugError  
"source file /usr/share/rear/myscirpt.sh not found or empty"  
to be safer against such programming errors.

But I can implement the new default error behaviour  
in a backward compatible way when I also change  
all existing calls of the Source function to use explicitly  
the old error behaviour:

<pre>
Source --skipmissing "$file"
</pre>

@jsmeix I am not sure I understand the problem you try to solve.

Do we really need to care so much about backwards compatibility if
`Source` is just in just 2 files?

In how many places do you plan to `Source myscript.sh`? What is the
specific use case you have in mind?

Again, let's try to keep the scope of this change as narrow as possible
and fix potential problems when they actually show up.

I have to postpone implementation until next year  
because I will not have time for it during Christmas time  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/744](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/744))

@schlomo  
I was a bit wondering about your questions because  
I assumed I had already answered them above.

Perhaps my "Backward compatibility is mandatory!"  
had lead to misunderstanding?

With "backward compatibility" I do not mean that old behaviour  
can never be changed. I only mean when bahaviour is  
changed, then in a way that existing usage does not break.

This means that behaviour of internal functions can be changed  
provided all exixting calls of that functions are adapted so that  
they do not fail with the new behaviour.

compatibility if Source is just in just 2 files?":

where I only implemented "skip\_if\_missing".  
I also implemented its logical counterpart "exit\_if\_missing"  
only to keep its default behaviour the same as before.  
But since

"immediate error exit when something is wrong"

In my relatively short personal experience with rear  
I have had already too many issues where  
it was relatively hard to find the root cause  
because rear proceeded regardless of errors  
until it later failed in an unexpected way  
far off the place where the root cause happened.

Example:

From my point of view things like

<pre>
# ( foo=$( cat qqq | grep something ) ; echo "foo='$foo'" ) ; echo $?
cat: qqq: No such file or directory
foo=''
0
</pre>

are just bad.

From my point of view this behaves correctly:

<pre>
# ( set -ue -o pipefail ; foo=$( cat qqq | grep something ) ; echo "foo='$foo'" ) ; echo $?
cat: qqq: No such file or directory
1
</pre>

From my point of view if an error does not matter  
there must be explicit code to ignore that specific error  
or explicit code that deals with that specific error:

<pre>
# ( set -ue -o pipefail ; foo=$( cat qqq | grep something || echo '' ) ; echo "foo='$foo'" ) ; echo $?
cat: qqq: No such file or directory
foo=''
0
</pre>

Regardless that here the result is the same as  
in my "just bad" example from my point of view there is  
a major difference here because the explicit || echo ''  
makes it explicit what the intended result is  
if cat qqq | grep something did not succeed.

Hi Johannes,

I am all in favour to make error behaviour more explicit.

My comment was really mostly about using Unix-style command line
options  
also for the Source function and not to rely on positional arguments.
