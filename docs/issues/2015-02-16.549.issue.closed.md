This is an enhancement proposal for better syntax check of the scripts.

Currently only "bash -n" is run for the \*.sh scripts which cannot
detect many problems like misspelled variables, functions, commands and
many more.

My personal reason is that I did misspell a variable (that was never
commited to rear upstream) and I found it only by debugging a failure
during my own testing.

I don't know a good bash syntax checker.

In particular for rear we would neeed a bash syntax checker that can
check the overall syntax of all \*.sh scripts.

Therefore as a first attempt to do a little better syntax check I like
to propse hereby to check for words that exist only once in all \*.sh
scripts.

What I did right now as a very first proof of concept in a rear source
directory:

<pre>
$ rm /tmp/rear_all_scripts.sh

$ find . -name '*.sh' | xargs cat >>/tmp/rear_all_scripts.sh

$ cat /tmp/rear_all_scripts.sh | grep -v '^[[:space:]]*#' | tr -c -s '[:space:][:alnum:]_-' ' ' | tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | grep '^[[:space:]]*1 [[:alpha:]]' | cut -b9- >/tmp/rear_all_scripts.lonely_words

$ for w in $( cat /tmp/rear_all_scripts.lonely_words ) ; do echo $w ; find . -name '*.sh' | xargs egrep -h "[^[:alpha:]]$w[^[:alpha:]]|^$w[^[:alpha:]]" ; echo ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ; done | grep -v '^[[:space:]]*#' | less
</pre>

This way I found 1159 lonely words in all \*.sh scripts.

Now I use my own brain and imagination to view that long "less" output
for suspicious cases of lonely words that could be real bugs...

I found for example:

The functions:

add\_default\_route ()

add\_module () {

seem to be lonely functions (seems to be nowhere called).

The variable alias\_prefix in

ip -4 addr add ${alias\_ip\_address}/${alias\_prefix} dev ${interface}:0

seems to be used but nowhere defined.

I do not understand hwo disk\_used-old\_disk\_used is used in

let disk\_used="$(get\_disk\_used "$backuparchive")"
size=disk\_used-old\_disk\_used

it seems disk\_used-old\_disk\_used is used but nowhere defined.

It seems ${fragmentsize} in
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh
is used but nowhere defined.

It seems $grub\_name-mkconfig in
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/22\_install\_grub2.sh is used but
nowhere defined.

It seems "$HPACUCLI\_BIN\_INSTALLATION\_DIR" in
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/27\_hpraid\_layout.sh is used but
nowhere documented (I guess it should be added to
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf).

It seems "${PEERDNS}" in usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh is used
but nowhere defined and/or documented (I guess it should be added to
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf).

It seems "${PROGS\_DP\[@\]}" in
usr/share/rear/prep/DP/default/40\_prep\_dp.sh is used but nowhere
defined and/or documented (I guess it should be added to
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf).

It seems "${PROGS\_SESAM\[@\]}" in
usr/share/rear/prep/SESAM/default/40\_prep\_sesam.sh is used but nowhere
defined and/or documented (I guess it should be added to
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf).

It seems "$SKIP\_CFG2HTML" in
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/95\_cfg2html.sh is used but nowhere
defined and/or documented (I guess it should be added to
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf).

It seems $SYSLINX\_DIR in usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh is
a misspelled variable name and should be $SYSLINUX\_DIR

I do not undrstand how $VAR\_LIB is used in
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/30\_include\_grub\_tools.sh I think

\[ ! -d $VAR\_LIB/recovery \] && mkdir -p $VAR\_DIR/recovery

should be

\[ ! -d $VAR\_DIR/recovery \] && mkdir -p $VAR\_DIR/recovery

I'll add my comments piece per piece to keep the overview readable for
me (and the rest of our community):

-   disk\_used-old\_disk\_used is used as follow:

<!-- -->

            (rsync)
                    let old_disk_used="$(get_disk_used "$backuparchive")"
                    while sleep 1 ; kill -0 $BackupPID 2>&8; do
                            let disk_used="$(get_disk_used "$backuparchive")" size=disk_used-old_disk_used
                            #echo -en "\e[2K\rArchived $((size/1024/1024)) MiB [avg $((size/1024/(SECONDS-starttime))) KiB/sec]"
                            ProgressInfo "Archived $((size/1024/1024)) MiB [avg $((size/1024/(SECONDS-starttime))) KiB/sec]"

First we initialize the variable `old_disk_used` and in a while loop we
recalculate the `disk_used` and `size` (so the `disk_used-old_disk_used`
is a calculation executed by the `let` statement)

    =&gt;  
    it seems you are right (it was forgotten unfortunately) - I fixed it
    in the meantime

Script `./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh`
defines  
`grub_name="grub2"` so `$grub_name-mkconfig` becomes `grub2-mkconfig`

I agree `${grub_name}-mkconfig` would make it more readable

is automatic filled by the `eval` call in the script (ugly hack I agree)

@gdha  
my actual itent of this issue is to find out whether or not checking
rear \*.sh scripts for lonely words makes sense for better syntax check
of the scripts.

Therefore I would like to know if you (and also the other rear upstream
authors) think that such a check was actually helpful to find hidden
actual issues or did it in the end result too many false positives so
that it was not really worth the effort?

My question is:  
Should I continue with it and further develop my above "very first proof
of concept" into a (hopefully) more and more useful check or is it not
worth the effort?

@jsmeix I think that what you do is very valuable and improves our
software quality. Some day I would really like to enforce that with a
`set -e -E -u` (and maybe others). The reason why I am not doing that
right away is that ReaR will stop to work and that we don't have
automated testing to help us get it back to work.

So what you do is actually the soft approach and much appreciated, at
least by me.

@gdha  
you can close this issue.

When I enhance my current generic basic btrfs support (see \#556) I will
also enhance my above "very first proof of concept" and if I find
suspicious items I will open a new issue.

I found out that I can close the issue myself which I did.
