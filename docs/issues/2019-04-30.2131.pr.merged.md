##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2129, \#2130

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS: Compared
    `$ROOTFS_DIR` contents before and after code changes, verified
    everything works as intended.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    1.  Relative symbolic links are now properly resolved before
        checking the link's target.
    2.  Directories, which are link targets, no longer fail when trying
        to copy them. Instead, a meaningful hint is printed for the user
        to decide.

**Note:** On the test system, there is a relative symbolic link
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` -&gt; `sshd_config.company`, which points to a
customized configuration.

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your improvement!

On first glance by plain looking at the code it looks good to me  
but I like to test it a bit on Thursday before I approve it...

@gdha @rmetrich  
could you also have a look here and review it?

Do you think we can add it to ReaR 2.5?

Because of the reasoning in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2129\#issuecomment-487938670](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2129#issuecomment-487938670)  
I think this could be good to have in ReaR 2.5.

@jsmeix I think it would be good to add it to the 2.5 release.

@jsmeix Thanks again for trying!

Given the current situation, it seems to be best to leave out code which
would solve one problem and might introduce others.

In my view, the GNU coreutils documentation style really sucks: We have
two sets of non-synchronized documentation, one of them (the html site)
missing version information, the other one (manual page) being vague by
failing to define terms. Seems to be the same with `dirname`: Could you
find any definitive statement saying that `dirname` does a specific sort
of canonicalization (as you have observed)?

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your patient laborious work.  
It helps so much to make the ReaR code better.

Regarding my `dirname` usage in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2131\#discussion\_r280711680](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2131#discussion_r280711680)

    if [[ "$link_target" != /* ]]; then
        # convert a relative link target into an absolute one
        broken_symlink_dir=$( dirname $broken_symlink )
        link_target="$broken_symlink_dir/$link_target"
    fi

I used `dirname` not for any kind of canonicalization.  
I used it to split away the last part (i.e. the symlink name)  
from $broken\_symlink because $broken\_symlink/$link\_target is not
valid like

    /path/to/symlink_dir/relative_symlink_name/../../rel_path/to/target_file_or_dir

but $broken\_symlink\_dir/$link\_target is valid like

    /path/to/symlink_dir/../../rel_path/to/target_file_or_dir

Canonicalization of the latter would result

    /path/rel_path/to/target_file_or_dir

By the way:  
Do you still like symlinks?

Again thank you for your valuable contributions to ReaR  
and enjoy the weekend!

@jsmeix Ah, now I see. Thanks so much for your work. Although the
commits were mine, your contribution was certainly the more laborious
one!

And yes, I'm still fine with symbolic links. What I have really missed
in this case is

-   proper tooling (debugger, code coverage analysis, automated testing)
    and
-   proper documentation of functions used.

Have an excellent weekend, too! Well deserved! :1st\_place\_medal:

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b4e70e067dbb90f080d725cc991536f852f62000](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b4e70e067dbb90f080d725cc991536f852f62000)  
I added comments with examples how broken symlinks and their targets
look like  
so it is hopefully easier to imagine what goes on here when someone
else  
may have to look at that code at any later time.
