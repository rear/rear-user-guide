NBU support in the current package appears to be targeting NBU v6.5
because it references xinetd.  
NBU 7+ no longer uses xinetd and the bplist command in the NBU-prep
returns "EXIT STATUS 227: no entity was found"

thanks, a small enhancement has to be added into script
`rescue/NBU/default/45_prepare_xinetd.sh` to skip the xinetd entries if
NBU version &gt;7+

Now, my question, how can we check with which version of NBU we're
dealing with? is there a small command for it?

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/version

On the box in question, that file contains:  
NetBackup-RedHat2.6 7.0.1  
(space, not tab, separating kernel reference from NBU version)

On older servers, the file says:

NetBackup-RedHat2.4 6.5

or

NetBackup-RedHat2.6 6.5

Now if I can just figure out why the bplist command barfs .....

Verified the script a bit more in depth and noticed that `xinetd` will
get started and when there are no `vnetd` or `bpcd` startup files found
under `/etc/xinetd.d` then these two will start up as standalone.

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" xinetd )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /etc/xinetd.conf /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd /etc/xinetd.d/vnetd /etc/xinetd.d/vopied )
    cat >$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/90-xinetd.sh <<-EOF
    echo "Starting a minimal xinetd daemon ..."
    xinetd
    if [ ! -f /etc/xinetd.d/vnetd ]; then
            /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/vnetd -standalone
    fi
    if [ ! -f /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd ]; then
            /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd -standalone
    fi
    EOF
    chmod $v +x $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/90-xinetd.sh >&2

In your case you should see 2 daemons running (even before you start up
the recover process).  
Can you verify this? Please carefully check your rear.log file to see
what it complains about...

NBU 7+ does not use xinetd. bpcd and vnetd and nbftclnt (NetBackup SAN
Client Fibre Transport daemon)

I am kinda new to GitHub and this issue interface. I'd like to upload
the /etc/init.d/netbackup script for you rather than pasting it in here.
600+ lines :(

If there is no built-in for that, I will use PasteBin

FYI Github uses Gist for this (see link at the very top of every page).

I know the startup script of netbackup, but what I was trying to say was
that the `rescue/NBU/default/45_prepare_xinetd.sh` has a double
function.  
1/ when it finds NBU controlled by xinetd then it will use that  
2/ when there are no xinetd startup files then it will start these
daemons in standalone mode. In your case this will be the case.

I believe that the NBU startup script does exactly the same as what I
described in step 2.

The only daemon that is not started is `nbftclnt` (NetBackup SAN Client
Fibre Transport daemon) and I'm not sure it gets copied. This might be
your problem.

@linuxdan is it possible to try out with the latest git repository? All
feedback is welcome
