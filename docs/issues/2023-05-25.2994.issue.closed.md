Should we activate security bug reports for ReaR?

Right now I noticed

[https://openprinting.github.io/OpenPrinting-News-May-2023/\#handling-reported-security-bugs-with-github](https://openprinting.github.io/OpenPrinting-News-May-2023/#handling-reported-security-bugs-with-github)

which describes the reasoning behind and details  
how to activate security bug reports at GitHub.

IMHO we should do this only if we can also offer or even guarantee some
kind of SLA in dealing with it.

As long as nobody can commit resources to follow up on such reports I'd
rather not offer this, as it would lead to false expectations.

Also, we could advise people who would like to report a security issue
to write to one of the maintainers via email instead.

Finally, how many security bugs did we have over the last 10 years?
Without discounting the possibility of security issues in ReaR, maybe we
are not yet at the forefront of this problem.

@schlomo  
I fully agree with you.

I did this issue primarily as a request for comments.

But right now while I write this I have the idea that  
the underlying GitHub functionality is actually  
a generic method for non-public bug reporting  
which could be something that could be actually useful  
so that ReaR users could report issues where they do not  
like to just publish all information out into the wild.

Of course GitHub's non-public bug reporting functionality  
cannot and must not be used to submit real secrets  
(like passwords or access keys) to GitHub  
(and we at ReaR upstream never want to get  
nor do we ever need any real user secret)  
but perhaps some ReaR users may feel better  
if not all and everything would be just public?

I understand your reasoning @jsmeix, however I'm wary of two things:

1.  If the GitHub flow suggests to the end-user that this way of
    submitting issues will get any sort of immediate response - we
    shouldn't offer it without a commitment by maintainers behind it
2.  How would we decide when to turn a secret/private issue to be a
    public issue? I'm a bit worried that we will start to pile up
    private issues which means that only maintainers can see them and
    work on them - again something I'd like to avoid without a strong
    commitment of maintainers.

Bottom line for me is that without a commitment of maintainers to take
care of such issues I'd prefer to not offer it. There are enough
existing options to contact maintainers privately so that there is no
immediate need for a change.

If those of the maintainers who get paid for working on ReaR can commit
to taking care of such issues, then please go ahead and configure
private issues. Please also specify on the website and in the top-level
README who are the maintainers serving in that role.

@schlomo  
again I fully agree with you.

Personally I am not interested to deal with  
non-public GitHub issues at ReaR upstream  
because this would be more (administrative) work  
with less outcome (proper improvements for ReaR),  
cf. "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)

E.g. SUSE customers (who in the end pay my salary)  
can report ReaR issues privately to SUSE  
via their specific customer contacts and  
same or at least similar for Red Hat customers.

Unfortunately Canonical is not (yet?) sufficiently  
interested in actively supporting upstream ReaR.

@rear/contributors  
provided you do not object  
I would like to close this issue as  
"won't fix / can't fix / obsolete"  
on Friday afternoon.
