Hello guys,  
Yesterday, I've release a small tool called ebiso
([https://github.com/gozora/ebiso](https://github.com/gozora/ebiso)),
which is capable of creating bootable UEFI ISO image (basically just to
cover gap on SLES11).

This patch integrates ebiso to rear, so maybe you can find it useful ...

I've did the testing on SLES11SP3 (with elilo) and Centos 6.7 (with
GRUB).

Hope it helps.

Best regards

Vlado

Hi,

thanks - this is a very interesting thing. Could I kindly ask you to
change a few things to be more ReaR-like?

-   Use `$()` instead of backticks
-   Create a function somewhere in `lib/`that will wrap your check if
    ebiso should be used? That we we need to change only one place in
    order to modify that detection code.
-   Improve the documentation to hint people with UEFI systems that they
    should install ebiso to get better results.
-   Add some info to `default.conf` to point out how to enable ebiso
    support.

Another thought: Maybe the code will be easier to maintain if you have a
variable called for example ISO\_USE\_EBISO or something like that. IMHO
the code would be more explicit that way and you could also fail
properly if the user enables that feature but fails to install ebiso. It
would also make it really simple to auto-enable ebiso if the tool is
installed.

What do you think?

Kind Regards,  
Schlomo

Hello,

No problem adapting backticks ...

For the detection point, my idea was to manually set variable
`ISO_MKISOFS_BIN` in /etc/rear (either `local.conf` or `site.conf`) to
`<path_to_ebiso>/ebiso` to trigger its use. But maybe I've just
misunderstood use of this variable ...  
Separate variable sounds alluring, but I think it might interfere with
existing `ISO_MKISOFS_BIN`.  
However you know much better anatomy of ReaR than I do, so can do the
implementation in whatever way you'd recommend.

I'll add some additional documentation directly to ebisio git site in
couple of days (didn't had much time for it until now) and I can add
information to rear docu as well.  
Is it OK for you if I add information about ebiso to
`05-integration.adoc`?

Best regards

Vlado

I think the man page would be a good place. I did not find any good
place in the adoc files. I think in Configuration it would fit better
but I think that you can put it where you think it best.

About your other question: Looking at the code around UEFI\_BOOTLOADER I
find it very complex (meaning that by reading it I don't understand
exactly what goes on there). That means that in any case I cannot really
judge your change and would kindly ask @gdha to take a look and to take
the final decision. He is much more EFI expert than me.

man CONFIGURATION section looks reasonable , but first we should decide
how to integrate ebiso ;-).

Just to summarize for @gdha, to activate current implementation of patch
user needs manually specify in `/etc/rear/site.conf` or
`/etc/rear/local.conf`:  
`ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=<path_to_ebiso>/ebiso`

I guess you have following section on your mind:

    if [[ $(basename ${UEFI_BOOTLOADER}) = "elilo.efi" ]]; then
          pushd $TMP_DIR/isofs/boot >&8
          $ISO_MKISOFS_BIN -o $ISO_DIR/$ISO_PREFIX.iso -e efiboot.img .
       else
          pushd $TMP_DIR/isofs >&8
          $ISO_MKISOFS_BIN -o $ISO_DIR/$ISO_PREFIX.iso -e boot/efiboot.img .
     fi

The idea behind is quite simple. By contrast to GRUB, elilo is not smart
enough to find kernel and initrd outside ISO virtual volume, so in
`25_polulate_efibootimg.sh`, I've created one more copy of kernel and
initrd inside `$TMP_DIR/mnt/EFI/BOOT/` if elilo is used on system.  
And root directory shift is done just to avoid copy "useless" data which
are not used during ISO boot.

Hope it clarifies ...

That thing with back-ticks was already addressed by @schlomo.  
I've already taken it into account ...

@gozora Thanks for the clarification. If this is just to optimize a few
MB then I personally would rather optimize for code simplicity.

If elilo is "stupid" then I would - for the same reason of code
simplicity - tend to setup the stupid directory structure and use that
for both elilo and grub.

Just my 2ct of "code is written once and read many times" wisdom :-)
Meaning that if that optimization is important for somebody (having a
real-life use case for why those MB are worth to save), then of course
we should save them.

@schlomo actually that shifted ROOT dir save 50% of ISO size, as not
shifting it would cause to have exact copy of initrd and kernel in two
separate places in ISO.  
But maybe I can adapt `80_create_isofs.sh` to avoid coping of
kernel/initrd if ebiso is used?  
That would allow to have non shifted ROOT dir and save space as well.

@gdha OK, man page will stay untouched for now, and I'll add some info
to default.conf instead.  
That fight around mkisofs/genisoimage is something that could be filmed
in the future :-)
