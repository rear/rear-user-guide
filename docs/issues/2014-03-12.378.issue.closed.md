Hi there,

I'm running Rear with the ISO + NBU (Netbackup) restore method, and am
wondering if there is a way to have the restore process allow the
restore engineer to send a selective Netbackup restore operation to the
server, rather than use the automatic system currently in place.

For example: I boot a server from ISO, and run 'rear recover'. I press
Enter twice to confirm I am restoring to the same machine and that I
want to use the latest backup set.

REAR will then (as I understand it) query backups from 5 days ago, and
start restoring from them. HOWEVER, due to the way the backup tapes are
handled, this is unfortunately a bit inflexible for me, as some backup
tapes may not be available. What I would want to do instead is to stop
the automatic netbackup from running, and pause the scripts so I can
send a more specific restore operation to the server.

For example, commenting out / removing lines 66-71 from the relevant
script:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/79f5c64a3e8e12beeb4b924c6e6ccfd9bae70720/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh\#L66-L71](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/79f5c64a3e8e12beeb4b924c6e6ccfd9bae70720/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40_restore_with_nbu.sh#L66-L71)

And having the rear recover operation pause while I restore manually,
then resume its finishing operations after the recovery is complete
(replace the commented-out lines with: read -p "Press Enter to continue"
for example.

Is there a way to do something like this with certain parameters in
local.conf ? Or would I best need to alter the existing scripts on the
machine before running the initial 'rear mkrescue' and generating the
ISO?

I actually ran into some oddities while doing a manual restore - it
looks to be a problem with the Netbackup side rather than Relax and
Recover.

As an aside - The netbackup restore sequence prompts to either use the
current backup (passes the -s parameter to bprestore), or from an
'earlier than' date (passes the -e parameter to bprestore).

Is there an easy way to either be prompted for both, or use both
parameters? For example my test Full backup that I was using to restore
from is dated 03/11/2014 15:50:20 , so if I manually specify -s
03/11/2014 15:50:19 and -e 03/11/2014 15:50:21 , it will force Netbackup
to only use that Full backup set, and ignore any earlier backups, and
any later incremental backups.

@andyeff not sure in which way I can help you as I do not consider
myself a NBU specialist?

@gdha Ah, no problem - I was thinking about this today while doing some
test backup + restores.

The verify script that runs during a Netbackup restore (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/39\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/NBU/default/39_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh)
) only prompts for date to use with the -e parameter. This sets a date
that netbackup won't go later than to restore backups.

What I decided on was altering this script and also the one used during
restore (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40_restore_with_nbu.sh)
) to also be able to prompt and store a date that can be passed to
netbackup as a -s parameter. This let me then specify a date range of
backup sets to restore from, which avoided the problem of older or newer
backups not being present in the tape library of Netbackup.

Admittedly this alteration was mostly just to prove that
Relax-and-Recover works for our requirements (and it does - we had a
mailbox server back up and running in approx 15 minutes!), but it seems
like it might be a useful extra feature for Netbackup users.

I don't have the edits handy at the moment unfortunately, but tomorrow
morning I will upload the changes as gists so I can better explain. It
is really allowing the ability to enter either a "to" date ( -e
parameter with bprestore, which the NBU restore method currently
supports), a "from" date ( -s parameter with bprestore, which the NBU
restore method does by default if no date is entered, it generates a
date 5 days before todays date and passes that as the -s param), and
also a to AND from date (passing both a -s and -e parameter to bprestore
to restrict restoring backups from between the two date/times given).

​I am trying to understand what you say:

Do you want to give NBU a "restore window", e.g. a time span from which
to  
pick the restore?

Can it be that the actual problem with the current code is that if you  
specify a date on which no backup was made then NBU won't simply take
the  
next best thing but fail? Maybe you can tell NBU how to interpret this  
single date to mean "last backup at or before DATE" instead of "backup
from  
DATE or fail"?

Hi @schlomo , my understanding is that there are two options that can be
used for the NBU restore.

1.  Do not specify a date/time - and just press Enter when prompted. In
    40\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh, this will cause REAR to set -s (the start
    date/time of restore window) to be 5 days ago. If there are any
    backups dated from up to 5 days ago, they will be restored in
    sequence, up until the latest backup. I think in general this is
    probably appropriate behaviour for most cases.
2.  Specify a date/time. This will pass the date/time to NBU as the end
    date to restore to, so for example if you wanted to restore from
    backups to a moment in time 3 days ago, but no later, this would be
    useful. But it does not include a start time this way, so NBU will
    attempt to restore from the very first available backup, which could
    be several weeks or maybe even months ago depending on how long
    backup sets are retained for.

My desire would be for a third option so two sets of dates could be
specified, which would pass both the -e and -s times to NBU, restricting
the restores to a range, to avoid either trying to restore from very old
and unnecessary backups, or to also skip all but the most recent backups
(For example, if backups are taken every day, perhaps you only want to
restore the previous days' backup and not all 5 days prior).

I see. Basically we need to work around NBUs lack of a consolidated
backup  
like TSM has. There you set a point in time and it will simply take
each  
file from whatever backup set it needs to do what you meant.

Not beeing an NBU expert I might ask something silly. Would it be
possible  
to ask NBU for the backup scheme in use and then make a smarter
automatic  
choice?

Hmm unfortunately I am not that familiar with Netbackup myself - I have
only really been using it in the last few weeks after I was tasked with
creating a process to allow my team to be able to do full bare-metal
restores for servers that weren't being backed up through a vmware
method.

I will take a closer look tomorrow at the schemes in use and whether any
of the other binaries in the Netbackup client can help with this and
reply back as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience so far!

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you both.  
@schlomo Regarding NBU's backup scheme, we're using a very standard
'normal' backup, where we take one Full backup a week, and then daily
incrementals. After considering how to best deal with this, I believe
the only change I would request is changing the default '5 day lookback'
to be a 7 day lookback, so that a Full backup set can still be found if
a restore is needed on the same day that a new Full backup set would
otherwise be taken. (e.g. the server has a fatal crash in the morning,
before the evening backup has a chance to run, and the most recent
backup set to recover from is 7 days old)

This would I think involve changing the "-s" parameter on Line 21:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh\#L21](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40_restore_with_nbu.sh#L21)  
from:

    Recent_Month_Hour=`LANG=C /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bplist -C ${NBU_CLIENT_SOURCE} -l -s \`date -d "-5 days" "+%m/%d/%Y"\` $1 2>&8 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $5,$6,$7}'`

to:

    Recent_Month_Hour=`LANG=C /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bplist -C ${NBU_CLIENT_SOURCE} -l -s \`date -d "-7 days" "+%m/%d/%Y"\` $1 2>&8 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $5,$6,$7}'`

    I'm also happy to change the script on my deployed servers after installing, if you'd prefer to keep the 5 day setting instead.

I can live with the 7 day setting. Please post to the mailing list and
if  
nobody disagrees then we will just change it.

Why not adding a new variable to local.conf, defaulting to 7 days, so  
everybody can change it if need, without touching the sources?

Maybe this can be done more generic so other backup solutions can use  
this setting(s) too?

Sounds like a good idea. Who will do the patch? I can't test it.

If this variable is specific to NBU it **must** start with NBU\_ because
only then will `rear dump` actually show it.
