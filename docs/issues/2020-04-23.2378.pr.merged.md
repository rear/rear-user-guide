-   How was this pull request tested?

With

    # cp -vp /usr/sbin/parted /usr/local/bin
    # cp -vp /usr/sbin/partprobe /usr/local/bin

and in etc/rear/local.conf

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/share/man/man8/partprobe.8.gz /usr/share/man/man8/partprobe.8.gz )

I get same files in /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs  
with and without deduplication.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Filter out duplicate entries in COPY\_AS\_IS  
but keep the ordering of the elements  
i.e. only the first occurrence of an element is kept.

Also remove duplicates in the copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file  
with 'sort -u' because here the ordering does not matter.

Duplicates in the copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file can happen  
even if there are no duplicates in COPY\_AS\_IS  
e.g. when COPY\_AS\_IS contains

    /path/to/somedir ... /path/to/somedir/subdir

then `tar` copies things in `/path/to/somedir/subdir` two times  
and reports them twice in the copy\_as\_is\_filelist\_file
