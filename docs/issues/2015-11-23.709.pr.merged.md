Hereby during "rear recover" the following from the recovery system

<pre>
/var/log/rear/rear-&lt;hostname&gt;.log
/var/lib/rear/layout/*
/var/lib/rear/recovery/*
</pre>

gets copied into the recovered system to a restricted directory

<pre>
drwx------ /var/log/rear/recover/
</pre>

plus a backward compatible symbolic link

<pre>
/root/rear-&lt;date&gt;.log -&gt; /var/log/rear/recover/rear-&lt;hostname&gt;.log
</pre>

is created.

"rear-.log" seems a hint for a missing hostname during recovery... ?

Actually "rear-.log" is a hint for a missing usage of '&lt;' and '&gt;'
for '&lt;' and '&gt;' in comments here.

I fixed my comment.

@jsmeix Personally, I would prefer to see a name like
`rear-$(hostname)-$WORKFLOW-<date>.log` as a simple `rear help` could
overwrite an existing log file.

No "rear &lt;whatever&gt;" run overwrite files in the  
separated directory /var/log/rear/recover/

Only a second "rear recover" run in the recovery system  
would overwrite files in var/log/rear/recover/ in the  
target system.  
Currently that is intentionally because I think that the files  
from a previous "rear recover" are no longer of interest  
and if really needed the admin could save them manually.

But if you like I could keep the files of a previous "rear recover"  
in another separated directory /var/log/rear/recover.old/  
perhaps configurable via /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
# Keep "rear recover" log et alii of a previous "rear recover" in /var/log/rear/recover.old/
KEEP_RECOVERY_LOG=""
</pre>

Mainly to have it documented I filed
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/712](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/712)
because I think there is nothing to do regarding better log file naming.
