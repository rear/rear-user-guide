    Not at all, (yet?).

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Rear tries to auto detect whether the current system is booted via
    an EFI partition. For that it checks whether `/boot/efi` or `/boot`
    is a EFI-system-partition. The Arch Wiki says using `/boot/efi` is
    discouraged and `/efi` should be used, refering to the
    [UAPI-Group](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/#mount-points)
    and [Lennart
    Poettering](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/3757#issuecomment-234290236).
    I assume many more people will have `/efi` in the future, so rear
    could check that too.

I believe there is nothing else to change, but I haven't looked to deep
into this. I don't know whether the rescue system has to do something
extra for the ESP to recreate the system. If it does, one would need to
adjust that.
