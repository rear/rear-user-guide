In the attached log file I saw:

    2018-01-25 16:51:08.926899529 Mounting with 'mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime NFSSERVER:/relaxnrecover /tmp/rear.Mu0KWvWMvMj7wy2/outputfs'

What is the task of the nfs timeout command? Something you defined?  
And later in the process we got the error:

    cp: will not overwrite just-created '/tmp/rear.Mu0KWvWMvMj7wy2/outputfs/HOSTNAME/rear-HOSTNAME.log' with '/tmp/rear.Mu0KWvWMvMj7wy2/tmp/rear-HOSTNAME.log'

Was this maybe the result of the nfs timeout? I have the feeling the
issue is at the NFS layer and has nothing to do with ReaR

FYI:  
On my SLES11-SP4 system I also have such

<pre>
mount.nfs: timeout set for ...
</pre>

messages but that do not cause an issue for me.

To verify that I added a longer possible delay at the beginning of  
usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
via

<pre>
read -p "press enter to continue" 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

so that the actual copy can happen after the "mount.nfs: timeout set"  
is long over but for me everything still "just works".

FWIW:  
I always use in my etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
# BACKUP_OPTIONS variable contains the NFS mount options and
# with 'mount -o nolock' no rpc.statd (plus rpcbind) are needed:
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
</pre>

and my mount.nfs messages lok like this

<pre>

I understand your point, but I have other 75 backups via NFS working
fine (same NFS), so let me check if there is something about the nfs
client timeout.  
I didn't defined something like that, but I'm not the only one
administrator.  
However, NFS is being mounted and some files are being copied like .ISO,
logs, version etc.. I guess that's the only data that could be copied in
a 3 minutes timeout...

Let me try this BACKUP\_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

I will keep you posted.  
Thank you both!

Hello! I have tried both options, still the same.  
I tried mounting NFS manually it shows the timeout, but it never reaches
the timeout.  
So maybe it's not the NFS timeout.

I have tried a configuration to backup on a local file.  
\[root@HOSTNAME HOSTNAME\]\# cat /etc/rear/local.conf  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///tmp \# location to copy ISO image to  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup \# this could be a mounted USB disk on
/backup  
ISO\_MAX\_SIZE=4400  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "rhel" )

As you can see there is no tar.gz file, an the ISO filesize is just a
few MB...

My guess is, the process that backups file system data is not running
properly...

@turboexcess @jsmeix In the log I noticed that:

The **include** list is empty and that is the reason why the backup is
empty!  
Could you show us the content of
`cat /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`?

Good grief!  
I think an empty backup include list is a good reason  
to let "rear mkbackup" error out - I will do a pull request for that.  
Or is there perhaps a valid special use case to run "rear mkbackup"  
sucessfully even with an empty backup include list?

@turboexcess As you are using SAN based disks you need to add the
following to the local.conf file:

    BOOT_OVER_SAN=y
    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n

I think you need to comment the paths in
`/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` of disks, file systems you do not
want to get recreated. **BE VERY CAREFUL** here.

That was the solution.  
Also found out that RESULT\_FILES=($LOGFILE) is making the backup fail
on this system, in others systems I get the logfile without issues.  
Is that supported?

Does BOOT\_OVER\_SAN=y AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=n affect something if the
server is not booting from SAN? Cuz Im sending the same config to 90
hosts

Is this supported?: '/u\[0-9\]*'  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/home/ctm*'
'/u\[0-9\]\*' )

Tar file empty was not a bug, just a configuration issue.  
Thank you for your awesome support.

What kind of error did you see? If it is not clear use the debug option
(-D)

> Does BOOT\_OVER\_SAN=y AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=n affect something if
> the server is not booting from SAN?

If will include SAN based disks in your `disklayout.conf` file, so
always be careful here if you do not want these disks to be reformatted
by rear.

> Is this supported?: '/u\[0-9\]'

Good question - try it out and let us know ;-)

@turboexcess  
only a side note FYI in general regarding things like  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE

In addition to what you specify in those config variables  
there is some automatism in ReaR that also deals with  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE

If you want to keep that automatism off, see  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Perhaps in your ReaR 2.0  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
are not yet implemented but in current ReaR 2.3 they are,  
have a look at the current ReaR GitHub master code default.conf  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
where also BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE  
are probably better documented than in your ReaR 2.0.  
Basically their syntax is what your particular 'tar' version supports.

I fear there could be a crucial difference  
of the syntax of BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE array members  
versus the syntax of BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE array members, cf.

@jsmeix yeah that's why im doing ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "vg00" "rhel" ),
everything else is on san, I'm just backing up the SO.

@turboexcess The error you encounter is:

    cp: will not overwrite just-created '/tmp/rear.s9I4FN5pU67J25H/outputfs/HOSTNAME/rear-HOSTNAME.log' with '/tmp/rear.s9I4FN5pU67J25H/tmp/rear-HOSTNAME.log'

Perhaps, you could try the following to edit script
`/usr/share/rear/output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh` and change
line:

    cp $v "${RESULT_FILES[@]}" "${opath}/" >&2 || Error "Could not copy result files to $opath at $scheme location"

into

    cp -f $v "${RESULT_FILES[@]}" "${opath}/" >&2 || Error "Could not copy result files to $opath at $scheme location"

Add the **-f** (force) option to the copy command. If you could respond
with the result it would be nice.  
Thanks

With `RESULT_FILES=($LOGFILE)` in local.conf I get in

Simply put:  
Adding things to the RESULT\_FILES array that will be there anyway does
not work  
so that `RESULT_FILES=($LOGFILE)` in local.conf is useless and
therefore  
this should not be used to avoid this issue.

@turboexcess  
Still the message:

    cp: will not overwrite just-created '/tmp/rear.RR4v9OdtbvdZCYi/outputfs/HOSTNAME/rear-HOSTNAME.log' with '/tmp/rear.RR4v9OdtbvdZCYi/tmp/rear-HOSTNAME.log'

What is there special on your NFSSERVER that it cannot overwrite files?
Perhaps you will find the answer in
[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/286516/permission-problem-with-cp-mv-and-nfs](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/286516/permission-problem-with-cp-mv-and-nfs)

@gdha  
the best explanation (including why even `cp -f` does not help here) I
found at  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4669420/have-you-ever-got-this-message-when-moving-a-file-mv-will-not-overwrite-just-c](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4669420/have-you-ever-got-this-message-when-moving-a-file-mv-will-not-overwrite-just-c)

I think there is no need in this case that ReaR works around  
this unexpected behaviour of `cp` in this exceptional case.

I think it is sufficient in this case that the user must not manually
add things  
to the RESULT\_FILES array that will be there anyway automatically.

What makes it work for me even with `RESULT_FILES=($LOGFILE)` in

@turboexcess  
what is your actual reason behind  
why you set `RESULT_FILES=($LOGFILE)`  
in your local.conf?  
It is useless and makes `cp` fail, cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1711\#issuecomment-380009044](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1711#issuecomment-380009044)  
so what do you really want to achieve with that?

Well, I just wanted to get the log by email, to know that the backup
completed successfully.

Your answer is enough to me, there is no problem I’m not reading that
log anyways (:
