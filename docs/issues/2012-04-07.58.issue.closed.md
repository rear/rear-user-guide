Currently you get the following output when running `rear -d mkrescue`
on a RHEL6 system:


     2012-04-08 00:35:56.101711593 Collecting modules for kernel version 2.6.32-220.7.1.el6.x86_64

This looks like there is an error, but in reality there is not. We stuff
some modules by default that simply do not exist on the target system
(either because it is already compiled into the kernel, or because it
simply is no longer included in newer kernels). We should handle this
smarter and not complain when any of these modules do not exist.
