with a fedora 23 rescue image noticed the following line in the messages
file:  
`agetty: cannot open os-release file`

The /etc/os-release seems to be linked to ../usr/lib/os-release on
Fedora 23 and therefore, the copy probably did not succeed.

Yeah, that's correct.

    $ ls -la /etc/os-release 
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 21 Oct 20 00:35 /etc/os-release -> ../usr/lib/os-release
    $
