Instead, let the user choose from a list of drives with model and size.

Lets assume the following situation:

Drive sda is broken and get a new disk with a different size.

sda: 4G -&gt; 5G  
sdb: 4G -&gt; 4G

Without this patch the data on sdb will be destroyed.

This pull request was originally on the master branch but is not there
anymore. I moved it to the "choose-for-disk" branch.
