-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2501](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2501)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested with `OUTPUT=iso` versus `OUTPUT=ISO` on my homeoffice
    laptop.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    For "rear mkbackup/mkrescue/mkbackuponly/mkopalpba"  
    (i.e. for all workflows that run the 'prep' stage)  
    check that the OUTPUT method is actually implemented  
    i.e. check that a usr/share/rear/output/$OUTPUT directory exists  
    and error out when an OUTPUT method seems to be not supported  
    to ensure that the user cannot specify a non-working OUTPUT in
    /etc/rear/local.conf  
    cf. usr/share/rear/prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh

@OliverO2  
please have a look here.  
This new script might affect you because it does basically the same  
as usr/share/rear/prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
and I remember
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353)  
where you used a special backup method `BACKUP=INTERNAL`  
so perhaps you also use a special OUTPUT method that triggers now  
an error exit by
usr/share/rear/prep/default/036\_valid\_output\_methods.sh

Regarding exceptional OUTPUT methods that are not documented in "man
rear":

The OUTPUT methods that are not documented in "man rear" are

           OUTPUT=RAMDISK
           OUTPUT=ISO
           OUTPUT=PXE
           OUTPUT=OBDR
           OUTPUT=USB
           OUTPUT=RAWDISK

This are output methods where "something is implemented"

    # ls usr/share/rear/output/
    DP  IPL  ISO  NSR  OBDR  PXE  RAMDISK  RAWDISK  RSYNC  TSM  USB  default

so for DP IPL NSR RSYNC TSM something is implemented  
but I found nothing documented what it is.

I only know about preliminary basic support for `OUTPUT=IPL`  
via usr/share/rear/output/IPL/Linux-s390/800\_create\_ipl.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)

For the remaining DP NSR RSYNC TSM  
it seems the main intent is to "save result files"

    usr/share/rear/output/DP/default/950_dp_save_result_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/NSR/default/950_nsr_save_result_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/200_make_prefix_dir.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/900_copy_result_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/TSM/default/950_dsmc_save_result_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/TSM/default/960_dsmc_verify_isofile.sh

but I don't use any of those backup methods so I don't know exactly what
that is  
nor can I test myself how that works.  
I guess one cannot use DP NSR RSYNC TSM  
as OUTPUT method but I don't know.  
My current prep/default/036\_valid\_output\_methods.sh would accept  
when DP NSR RSYNC TSM is used as OUTPUT method.

@jsmeix Thanks for caring (as always)! I did a quick check and found
that am not using any internal OUTPUT method. From reviewing your change
it looks good to me in any case: If someone came up with a new OUTPUT
method, it would show up below `$SHARE_DIR/output` and everything would
still be fine.

Have a pleasant weekend!
