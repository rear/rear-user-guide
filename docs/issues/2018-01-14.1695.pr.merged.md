This will stop the Duplicity restore from Erroring out if the Temporary
Directory is on an Ramdisk. Also I've cleaned some things up and Fixed
an Issue with the librsync library on Debian.

This approach to Library finding is simpler, but has the disadvantage
that there won't be Warnings if none is found. However the difference
shouldn't be big, because before it always warns that there is a Library
missing, which doesn't help either.
