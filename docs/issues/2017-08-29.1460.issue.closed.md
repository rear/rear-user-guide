I have RAID 1 on my environment and I detect one issue in script:  
`rear/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh`

Output of `mdadm` is:

    mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md127
    /dev/md127:
            Version : imsm
         Raid Level : container
      Total Devices : 2

    Working Devices : 2


               UUID : fe5173d0:dfb8783b:b19d7a81:c0715868
      Member Arrays : /dev/md/raid01

        Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice

           0       8       16        -        /dev/sdb
           1       8        0        -        /dev/sda

As you can see, here we do not have `Raid Devices` in output and
`210_raid_layout.sh` break in line 44  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2c12a52b3322f833c81cae2a8bc5baa799c3187d/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210\_raid\_layout.sh\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2c12a52b3322f833c81cae2a8bc5baa799c3187d/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/210_raid_layout.sh#L44)  
because variable `ndevices` is empty.

Easy workaround is adding one if statement before line 44, like:

                if [ -z "$ndevices" ] ; then
                    ndevices=0
                fi

But, I guess that command for `Raid Level: container` should be
different.

Note: Command for another block device is OK

    mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md126
    /dev/md126:
          Container : /dev/md/imsm0, member 0

@Kolesar  
I have no personal experience with RAID setup  
so that I cannot really help here.

In general for issues where you already have a fix  
I suggest that you submit a GitHub pull request  
with your proposed fix, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

That code in 210\_raid\_layout.sh was mainly made in 2011 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8125ec3b0aef92dedfeb25e330644119fac40f64](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8125ec3b0aef92dedfeb25e330644119fac40f64)  
at that time in 21\_raid\_layout.sh so that this code  
might need some general adaptions to keep it up-to-date  
plus enhancements for things like "Raid Level: container".

@Kolesar  
I assume you also have the special Intel Matrix RAID hardware, cf.
