Intent:  
Improve readability of the ReaR log file by suppressing  
particular `set -x` debug output that is usually of no interest  
so that it gets easier for our users and for us to analyze an issue  
by inspecting the log file when rear was called in debugscripts mode.

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

I think a noticeable part of the `set -x` debugscripts output  
(that part is about 25% for my initial test, see below)  
is usually of no interest and therefore dispensable by default.

This pull request is a proposal how we could suppress dispensable  
debug output by default (in particular when rear is called with '-D')  
unless rear is called with '--debugscripts x' where the full
debugscripts  
output is still there as it was before.

The basic idea is to suppress uninteresting output that goes to stderr  
(in particular where `set -x` debugscripts output is usually of no
interest)  
by default via setting in usr/sbin/rear (i.e. this is no user config
variable)

    DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV="null"

and by using where applicable in the scripts code of the form

    { command_1
      command_2
      ...
      command_N
    } 2>>/dev/$DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV

provided none of the commands outputs intentionally to stderr  
(i.e. there is only `set -x` debugscripts output for the commands)  
unless rear is called with '--debugscripts x' where in usr/sbin/rear

    DISPENSABLE_OUTPUT_DEV="stderr"

is set which results in the above code

    ...
    } 2>>/dev/stderr

and /dev/stderr is fd2 which is redirected to append to
RUNTIME\_LOGFILE  
so that 2&gt;&gt;/dev/stderr does not change things and fd2 output is
still  
appended to RUNTIME\_LOGFILE.

What happens in compacted form is with `2>>/dev/null`

    # ( cat /dev/null >/tmp/mystderr ; exec 2>>/tmp/mystderr ; exec 1>&2 ; echo foo ; cat qqq ; echo bar ; cat QQQ 2>>/dev/null ; echo baz ) ; cat -n /tmp/mystderr
         1  foo
         2  cat: qqq: No such file or directory
         3  bar
         4  baz

versus with `2>>/dev/stderr`

    # ( cat /dev/null >/tmp/mystderr ; exec 2>>/tmp/mystderr ; exec 1>&2 ; echo foo ; cat qqq ; echo bar ; cat QQQ 2>>/dev/stderr ; echo baz ) ; cat -n /tmp/mystderr
         1  foo
         2  cat: qqq: No such file or directory
         3  bar
         4  cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
         5  baz

FYI how things go wrong when `2>/dev/stderr` is used:

    # ( cat /dev/null >/tmp/mystderr ; exec 2>>/tmp/mystderr ; exec 1>&2 ; echo foo ; cat qqq ; echo bar ; cat QQQ 2>/dev/stderr ; echo baz ) ; cat -n /tmp/mystderr
         1  cat: QQQ: No such file or directory
         2  baz

because `2>/file` truncates the file to zero size.

I tested `rear -D mkrescue` versus `rear --debugscripts x mkrescue`  
and got 53807 `set -x` lines in the log file with suppressed dispensable
debug output  
versus 68862 `set -x` lines in the log file with full debugscripts
output as it was before.

My initial suppressed dispensable debug output is primarily  
the `set -x` debugscripts output for some outupt functions and  
the `set -x` debugscripts output for IsInArray() and RmInArray().

@rear/contributors  
if you agree to the general idea behind and  
if my implementation is not somehow broken by design  
we could likely find more functions (or other code parts)  
where the full `set -x` debug output is usually of no interest.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

For the future some offhanded ideas for some more places  
where debug or verbose output is usually of no interest:

In simple helper functions therein somewhat 'dumb' loops  
the `set -x` debug output of such loops is usually of no interest  
for example

-   the `for` loop in the 'percent\_encode' function
-   the `while` loop in the 'FindStorageDrivers' function
-   the `while (( $# > 1 ))` loop in the 'copy\_binaries' function

Also for somewhat 'dumb' loops in scripts the `set -x`  
debug output of such loops is usually of no interest  
for example

-   the `for` loop in rescue/GNU/Linux/390\_check\_usb\_modules.sh
-   the `while read -r copy_as_is_file` loop in
    build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh
-   the `for required_library in $( RequiredSharedObjects ...` loop in
    build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh
-   the `for bin in "${PROGS[@]}" "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"` loop in
    build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh
-   the `for lib in "${all_libs[@]}"` loop in
    build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh
-   the `for prog in "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"` loop in
    build/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh
-   the `for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable` loop in
    build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh
-   the `for program in "${PROGS[@]}"` loop in
    build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh
-   the `for required_program in "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"` loop in
    build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh

A similar but somewhat different case are verbose command messages  
(via `$v` or `$verbose`) that could be too much by default in certain
cases  
for example

-   the
    `cp $verbose -t $ROOTFS_DIR -a --parents /lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION`
    in build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh when "Copying all kernel
    modules" that results in my case 4850 lines of verbose `cp` command
    messages in the ReaR log file
-   the `$gmkimage $v -O x86_64-efi` in the build\_bootx86\_efi function
    that results in my case 3449 lines of verbose `grub2-mkimage`
    command messages in the ReaR log file
