Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)  
the old 400\_autoresize\_disks code with its issues  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102)  
was moved "as is" to 430\_autoresize\_all\_partitions.

Hereby I propose to replace that old code by a new script  
layout/prepare/default/410\_autoresize\_all\_partitions.sh  
that implements the basic idea of the old code properly  
in particular with support for a new config variable  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE  
with same meaning as USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE.

The reason why 410\_autoresize\_all\_partitions will be run  
directly before 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions is that this way  
the code in 410\_autoresize\_all\_partitions could be much simpler  
because it could "just resize" the partitions and "just align" them  
without the need for sophisticated checks that the last partition  
does not exceed the end of the new disk by a single byte.

When 410\_autoresize\_all\_partitions "just resizes" and "just aligns"
the partitions  
with AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE the last partition may  
exceed the end of the new disk at most by something about  
`number_of_partitions * AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS_ALIGN_BLOCK_SIZE`  
which is usually at most some MiBs.

After 410\_autoresize\_all\_partitions was run the last partition may
exceed  
the end of the new disk but the subsequent
420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions  
would safely shrink the last partition up to the end of the new disk  
where 'safely' means with all its limits and error checking that
should  
avoid that a last partition gets automatically shrinked too much.

In particular for users with many GPT partitions and a small last
partition  
(or with many logical partitions and a small last partition)  
the automated resizing and re-alingment of all partitions  
may not "just work" so that "rear recover" would error out  
when the (small) last partition would have to be shrinked too much.

Because there is zero user request for such a functionality  
I won't implement it.
