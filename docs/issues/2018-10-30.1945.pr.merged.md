-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not at all because currently I do not use UEFI on my test systems

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    A blind cleanup attempt by plain looking at the code  
    which is intended as a proposal how I think
    630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
    could be enhanced and cleaned up in general:

Determine the ESP mountpoint from the UEFI\_BOOTLOADER value  
and use `$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi` as fallback so that there is  
(hopefully) no longer the need to error out.

Corrected the logic at the end whether or not NOBOOTLOADER is set empty.

Skip what it does when UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is empty or not a regular file.

A bit more verbose messages what is going on.

Cloning this right ahead and use it for my upcoming tests.  
I'll keep you posted.
