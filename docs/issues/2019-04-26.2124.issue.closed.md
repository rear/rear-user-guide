For background information see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1282\#issuecomment-486988867](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1282#issuecomment-486988867)

The scripts in the `usr/share/rear/skel` directory are those  
that are run during ReaR recovery system startup phase.

In our current GitHub master code in those scripts I found

    # find usr/share/rear/skel -type f | xargs grep 'TERM='

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/profile:
    export TERM=ansi

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service:
    Environment=TERM=vt100

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service:
    Environment=TERM=linux

The different `TERM` values that are set here  
indicate that something at least looks inconsistent  
regarding the `TERM` value in our ReaR recovery system.

@rear/contributors  
does someone of you know if the different `TERM` values  
that are set during ReaR recovery system startup are intentional  
or is that something that should be cleaned up to one same value?

@jsmeix When will this little bug be solved finally?

I cannot do anything here only on my own because I don't know anything  
about the (possibly subtle) differences of TERM values like

    TERM=ansi
    TERM=vt100
    TERM=linux
    TERM=dumb

If someone who is an expert in TERM values can tell what  
"the one and only right TERM value" is that makes "all work
everywhere"  
we could "just set" this right TERM value everywhere in ReaR.

I fear we need a TERM value where ANSI escape sequences are supported  
because we use ANSI escape sequences by default in
lib/progresssubsystem.nosh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/progresssubsystem.nosh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/progresssubsystem.nosh)

FWIW:  
Personally I always use

    PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="3"

in my etc/rear/local.conf because I prefer simple plain ASCII messages
(KISS).

There is no way have a single correct `TERM` value:

-   For a (virtual) console login, which uses the machine's integrated
    graphics unit, the Linux kernel manages text output, interpreting
    escape sequences. In these cases, `TERM=linux` [seems to be
    correct](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-11.html).
-   For a serial login, `TERM` must be set per connection or chosen by
    the user at login time. There is no way of knowing which kind of
    physical terminal or emulator is attached, although `ansi` might be
    the most common one these days.
-   For a GUI, its terminal application determines the correct `TERM`
    setting (typically, something like `xterm*`).
-   For a remote connection (ssh or other), the client side determines
    the terminal type, so it can be any of the above.

So the answer is:

-   For (virtual) console logins, set `TERM=linux`, which is done
    correctly in
    `usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service`.
-   For all other purposes, do not touch the `TERM` value as this would
    break remote connections. If needed, the user could set a `TERM`
    value manually.
-   Otherwise, a wrong `TERM` setting might garble the screen. In the
    worst case it could render the terminal completely unusable: Escape
    sequences might switch fonts, colors (say "black on black"), alter
    the devices settings, ...

The proper solution in this case would probably be:

-   Remove the `TERM` setting in
    `usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service`.
-   Change the fixed setting in `/etc/profile`. For serial logins, a
    prompt might ask the user if she would like a `TERM=ansi` setting
    (possibly the most common now with people using terminal emulators
    over serial lines). So the setting in
    `usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/profile` might become something
    like:
        # Offer a default TERM setting for login shells where TERM is not set
        if [[ $- == *i* && -z "$TERM" ]]; then
            while true; do
                echo ""
                read -r -p "Set 'TERM=ansi' (y/n)? " answer
                echo ""

                if [[ "$answer" == [yY] ]]; then
                    export TERM=ansi
                    break
                elif [[ "$answer" == [nN] ]]; then
                    break
                else
                    echo "Please answer 'y' or 'n'." >&2
                fi
            done
        fi

For a comparison of terminal attributes showing just the differences,
use:

    infocmp -dL ansi vt100 | less

See the `terminfo(5)` manual page for explanations. A single attribute
difference between `ansi` and `vt100` looks like:

        cursor_address: '\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH', '\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH$<5>'.

The difference here is an extra `$<5>` on the `vt100` side. This is just
a delay instruction (5 milliseconds). Since you'd probably have a hard
time getting your hands on a real `VT100` or other terminal hardware
these days, delays no longer matter. On today's emulators, both entries
are actually equivalent.
