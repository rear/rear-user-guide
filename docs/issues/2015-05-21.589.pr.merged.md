[\#589 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/589) `merged`: Adding GRUB2 support
================================================================================

GRUB2 now supported.  
Requires a superuser and a pbkdf2 hash.

Problems found:  
The 21\_install\_grub.sh checked for GRUB2 which is not part of the
first 2048 bytes of a disk - only GRUB was present - thus the check for
grub-probe/grub2-probe.

I couldn't get the 94\_grub2\_rescue.sh to update the
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg correctly without the grub-mkconfig/grub2-mkconfig
before adding the ReaR menuentry.
