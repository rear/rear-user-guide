Did you format your usb device with `rear format <usb disk name>`
command?

Good News, it seems rear-2.2 works on this system.  
Currently busy creating a backup. It is in a remote location so will
have to ask a techie to go there and reboot to test.

Because "no \[further\] news is good news" I just assume that since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1482\#issuecomment-328814771](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1482#issuecomment-328814771)  
ReaR 2.2 works so that I can close this issue.  
If the same issue persists this issue report can be reopened but  
new and different issues need new and separated issue reports.
