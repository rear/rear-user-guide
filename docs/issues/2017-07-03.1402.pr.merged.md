Add SSL cert directories so we can interact with Google Cloud Storage

I was using Duply/Duplicity with Google Cloud Storage and the SSL
connections to Google where failing because the SSL certificates didn't
get copied over into the image.

This fixes that and allows for restores to come straight from Google
Cloud Storage.

Good find. Is there any reason why we shouldn't update
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf\#L253](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L253)
to include those paths? I guess that different distros store their certs
in different paths and we just did not yet catch them all.

No reason to not add them there. I just didn't know about that location
:)

This is my first PR for this project so still learning.

I'll update the PR accordingly.

@rnavarro  
only FYI in general regarding having secret and/or private stuff  
by default and/or automatically in the ReaR recovery system see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267\#issuecomment-291836695](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267#issuecomment-291836695)  
and subsequent comments there that lead to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1279](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1279)

As far as I see here the private keys in /usr/lib/ssl/private  
are excluded so that this pull request looks o.k. to me  
but my knowledge in this area is basically zero  
so that I cannot make a meaningful decision here.

@rnavarro @schlomo Looks good enough for me - nice that rear/duplicity
works with Google Cloud Storage as well. Why not write a short article
for our web pages? See for example
