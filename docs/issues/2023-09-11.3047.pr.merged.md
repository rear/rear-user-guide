    -   `rear savelayout` on Fedora 36 with empty USB SD card reader  
        I show the relevant log excerpt and the corresponding part of
        `disklayout.conf`, if any.
        -   original code:
                No partition label type for 'disk /dev/sdb' (may cause 'rear recover' failure)

                # Disk /dev/sdb
                # Format: disk <devname> <size(bytes)> <partition label type>
                #disk /dev/sdb 0 

        -   new code:
                Ignoring sdb: blockdev: cannot open /dev/sdb: No medium found

            No sdb in disklayout
        -   new code without reverting
            0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545  
            same result
        -   original code only with
            0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545 reverted

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   Introduce function is\_disk\_valid, which performs checks for
        disk usability beyond validating the device name, and use it
        when saving the disk layout. In some cases the device name may
        be valid, but there are no data, typically because it is a drive
        with removable media and there is no medium in the tray. Happens
        typically with card (e.g. SD card) readers with empty slot.  
        This is a normal occurrence, so do not Error out, only display a
        message and skip the device.
    -   Revert commit 0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545 . We now
        skip disks with no data (like when there is no medium), so
        incomplete disk entries (without partition type) should not
        occur anymore. Restore the code that aborted when such disks
        were encountered.  
        Incomplete entries should not be allowed to occur, as they could
        confuse the layout restoration code. Moreover, the layout
        restoration wipes all disks in the layout, so if during layout
        restoration there happens to be a medium in the drive that was
        empty during layout save, the data on the medium would get
        overwritten and lost. And if there is not medium, the layout
        recreation script would fail.

@pcahyna  
thank you for this enhancement and  
the cleanup of the old clumsy code  
and for your explanatory description  
of the various cases (in particular  
things like the special DASD case)!

@jsmeix I believe I addressed all review comments in last 3 commits.

@pcahyna  
thank you for the fine tuning.  
All looks perfect to me.  
Feel free to merge it as you like.
