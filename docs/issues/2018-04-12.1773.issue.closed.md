-   Brief description of the issue:
    -   I format with `rear format /dev/sdb1` -&gt; everything is ok.
    -   I do `rear mkrescue -v` -&gt;

-   I do: `rear format -- --efi /dev/sdb1` and the following strange
    error appears:

<!-- -->

    $ sudo rear format -- --efi /dev/sdb1
    ERROR: Could not label /dev/sdb2 with 'REAR-000'

-   the log has no additional information.
-   Work-around, if any: I have no work-around.

Try `sudo rear format -- --efi /dev/sdb`

@Ronaldho80  
FYI:  
"rear format" does not only "format" a partition like /dev/sdb1  
(i.e. create a filesystem on a partition) but  
"rear format" prepares a whole disk device like /dev/sdb  
by creating partitions and creating filesystems on it, cf.  
the various USB\_DEVICE\_\* config variables in default.conf
