USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING will prevent the detected config from being
ignored when DHCP is also detected. With `USE_DHCLIENT=yes` set, the
behaviour is:

-   Interfaces using DHCP are configured by `dhclient` if
    `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes` is not present.
-   Interfaces using DHCP are configured by `dhclient` if
    `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes` is present.
-   Interfaces not using DHCP are configured by 60-network-devices.sh if
    `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes` is present.
