@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections  
I would like to merge it on Monday afternoon.

Or is this pull request (currently for ReaR 2.8)  
not really needed for the ReaR 2.8 release  
so that we could postpone it to ReaR 3.0?

But it is also labeled "bug" which indicates  
it is needed for the ReaR 2.8 release.

Should we rename `usr/share/rear/lib/validated/Arch`? I have never used
the validation stuff myself.

Yes, good catch!! Users do send new validation records (a couple per
year) and I think that it is a cool feature that also gives us some
personalised feedback

@schlomo `usr/share/rear/lib/validated/Arch/rolling/i386.txt` contains:
`Validation:  Arch/rolling/i386`. Should we change it, or keep it how it
was at the moment of the validation?

I mean change it to `Validation:  Arch_Linux/rolling/i386`

@pcahyna yes please, the idea is that Arch users trying `rear dump` will
see that info, it carries a date so that they can see how old it it.
