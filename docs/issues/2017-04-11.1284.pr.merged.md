Changed NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES  
from a binary variable to an array that contains  
those directories where ReaR should save and  
restore file capabilities, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283)  
and the related issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1175](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1175)  
This change is not backward compatible because now  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES="yes"  
does no longer work as expected.  
I cannot enhance it so that  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES="yes"  
works as before which would mean to  
run 'getcap -r /' as generic fallback  
because that command is the reason for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283)  
which this pull request intends to fix.

@gdha @gozora  
this is currently only a proposal.  
I did not test it in any way - and currently  
I do not have time for such tests.

@dagwieers  
I appreciate also your review!

And of course I appreciate if needed  
further adaptions and enhancements.

@gdha I think we cannot move a script that  
creates $VAR\_DIR/recovery/capabilities  
to the 'backup' stage, see

@jsmeix That is correct, but nothing forbids us to add this file in the
BACKUP\_URL path.

We also cannot use the @gozora hack, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283\#issuecomment-293209833](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283#issuecomment-293209833)

@gdha  
I guess with "add this file in the BACKUP\_URL path"  
you actually meant to include this file in the backup  
so that it gets restored as  
$TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/$VAR\_DIR/recovery/capabilities  
and then use it from there in the ReaR recovery system  
to restore the capabilities?

As usual - trying to implement a workaround so that it  
automatically does things right becomes a pile of more  
and more workarounds on top of the initial workaround  
and this all only to try to make users "happy"  
(will they ever really get happy this way?)  
who actually have a bug in 'tar' ?

Wait!  
Shouldn't /var/lib/rear/recovery/capabilities  
be automatically included in the backup so that  
after backup restore it would be automatically there as  
$TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/var/lib/rear/recovery/capabilities  
so that all what might be needed is to adapt  
restore/NETFS/default/510\_set\_capabilities.sh  
to read its input from  
$TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/var/lib/rear/recovery/capabilities  
?

On my SLES12 test system where I user ReaR  
as GitHub checkout into the /root/rear/ directory  
I have in backup.tar.gz the whole  
root/rear/var/lib/rear/recovery/  
directory with all files.

This means it gets restored as  
$TARGET\_FS\_ROOT/root/rear/var/lib/rear/recovery/

Now it seems to work for me:

In contrast to my initial comment I made it even  
backward compatible so that now  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES="Yes"  
uses as fallback '/' which is sufficiently fast for me  
both during "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover".

On my test system (without tons of mounted stuff)  
I get for "rear -d -D mkbackup" in the log

<pre>
2017-04-11 13:46:39.062951633 Saving file capabilities
...
2017-04-11 13:46:43.153278799 Leaving ...
</pre>

i.e. 4 seconds for 'getcap -r /'  
and during "rear -d -D recover" in the log

<pre>
2017-04-11 11:50:49.177377723 Restoring file capabilities
...
2017-04-11 11:50:49.184422239 Leaving ...
</pre>

i.e. basically nothing for restoring file capabilities.

On systems with tons of mounted stuff where 'getcap -r /'  
is too slow the user can as needed specify on what  
directories 'getcap -r' should be run.

On my test system I have

<pre>
# getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service+ep
/usr/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
</pre>

so that I also tested  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES=( '/usr' '/var' )  
which also works well for me.

FYI:  
Regardless that I use a ReaR GitHub checkout  
in /root/rear on the original system I have in the  
recovery system

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # cat /var/lib/rear/recovery/capabilities 
/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service+ep
/usr/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
</pre>

and after "rear -d -D recover" I get

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # getcap -r /mnt/local 2>/dev/null
/mnt/local/usr/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep
/mnt/local/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
/mnt/local/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service+ep
</pre>

I think if there are no furious objections I will merge it  
because it is an improvement to what it was before  
and then others can further adapt and enhance it  
"to make all and everything just work out of the box"  
;-)

rescue/NETFS/default/600\_store\_NETFS\_variables.sh  
is buggy because with  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES=()  
rescue/NETFS/default/600\_store\_NETFS\_variables.sh  
results in /etc/rear/rescue.conf

<pre>
NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES='()'
</pre>

which is not an empty array but the string "()" so that  
restore/NETFS/default/510\_set\_capabilities.sh  
does not return but tries to restore file capabilities :-(

FYI

<pre>
# NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES=()
# declare -p ${!NETFS*} | sed -e 's/declare .. //'
NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES='()'
</pre>

rescue/NETFS/default/600\_store\_NETFS\_variables.sh  
is broken:  
For  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES=( 'No' )  
it stores in /etc/rear/rescue.conf  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES='(\[0\]="No")'  
i.e. NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES is the string

<pre>
([0]="No")
</pre>

Simple 'set' seems to "just work" for me:

<pre>
# NETFS_BAR=()
# NETFS_FOO="foo bar"
# NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES=( 'no' 'foo bar' )

# declare -p ${!NETFS*}
declare -a NETFS_BAR='()'
declare -- NETFS_FOO="foo bar"
declare -a NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES='([0]="no" [1]="foo bar")'

# set | grep ^NETFS
NETFS_BAR=()
NETFS_FOO='foo bar'
NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES=([0]="no" [1]="foo bar")
</pre>

In contrast to 'declare -p' simple 'set' reports directly usable  
variable assignments without additional single quotes.

O.k. now it seems to work well for me so that I merge it.
