-   Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git (installed via apt)

-   Debian 10

-   BareMetal

-   x86\_64

-   UEFI + GRUB

-   Root on mdadm, NVME disk attached, rear on USB flash drive:

-   BORG\_PASSPHRASE will expand the variable if it contains for example
    $1 inside the passphrase.

-   Workaround: change the passphrase

export BORG\_PASSPHRASE="S3cr37\_P4$1w0rD" will pass a different
password to borg, so the backup can't be opened until you do `rear dump`
to see what it the variable was expanded to.

either warn users against having $ in the passphrase, or use proper
shell escaping so that the variable does not expand.

Hello @gaia,

I'd say that such behavior is somehow expected in `bash`.  
As far as I know, ReaR does not contain any code that deals with
*BORG\_PASSPHRASE* as such, since *BORG\_PASSPHRASE* is environment
variable of Borg, so we really can't do any "proper shell escaping".  
Change in quoting is all that is necessary here, hence
`export BORG_PASSPHRASE='S3cr37_P4$1w0rD'` should do the trick.  
Documentation related to Borg as ReaR back-end indeed contains double
quotes when mentioning *BORG\_PASSPHRASE*, so I'll open PR to fix this,
and maybe include some meaningful comments like for
*SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD* in
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1380).

Thanks for reporting!

V.

In general regarding how to deal with possibly secret values in ReaR  
see \#2155 and \#2156

In the latter see in particular my code comments and added documentation
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156/files)  
regarding how to keep secret values secret in ReaR.
