-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

This patch was originally created in 2021 by @pcahyna in
5d5d1db3ca621eb80b9481924d1fc470571cfc09 and is applied in Fedora and
RHEL 8+. Somehow it has slipped under our radar was never submitted
upstream.

`vgcfgrestore` is not supposed to be able to restore any logical volumes
that use kernel metadata. All volume types except linear and striped use
kernel metadata. Main purpose of `vgcfgrestore` (with mandatory
`--force` option) is to let users fix existing thin-pool, not to
recreate the pool on empty disks. Do not even try `vgcfgrestore` on VGs
that need any kernel metadata, because it might lead to an inconsistent
state (if there are data that the kernel might interpret as LV metadata
present on the disks).

For VGs that have any volume with kernel metadata and are thus
unsupported by `vgcfgrestore`, switch automatically to LV creation using
`lvcreate`, similarly to `MIGRATION_MODE`.

Avoid `vgcfgrestore --force` entirely, since it should not be needed
now.

This mostly reverts changes in commits
311bfb3da1d5e47a2ff144123a2457e634f67893 and
1b779abfbf56693877fe666f56253ec623599674. The former code is preserved
and gets enabled if `FORCE_VGCFGRESTORE=y`. This option is on purpose
undocumented though and may be removed in the future.
