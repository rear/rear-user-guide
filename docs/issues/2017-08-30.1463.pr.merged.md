Recent btrfs version finally add the `--uuid` (or `-U`) option  
to create a btrfs fs with a specifique UUID.  
It avoids changing UUID of btrfs each time we recover a system  
(which is useless and can potentially bring recovery issue  
when using a data backup older than the recovery image  
(point-in-time restore)).

@schabrolles  
many thanks for this enhancement!

I think your current code works  
but I also think it works in a somewhat indirect  
and unexpected way - in other words: I think  
it should be coded more clearly what is intended.

First thing where I stumble when looking at the code is  
that "mkfs -U $uuid" is called even if $uuid is empty  
(i.e. outside of the "if \[ -n "$uuid" \]" test below)  
but "fortunately" it works because of the  
subsequent "|| mkfs" call without "-U $uuid".

Second thing where I stumble when looking at the code is  
that the "\# Set the UUID:" part is callled even if  
the "mkfs -U $uuid" before had worked which looks  
as if the UUID is set twice but "fortunately"  
the "\# Set the UUID:" part does not harm  
because it only does something when "$uuid" != "$new\_uuid"  
but when the "mkfs -U $uuid" before had worked then  
"$uuid" = "$new\_uuid" so that in the end it is o.k.  
(hopefully - if I did not overlook an exceptional case).

We have this try "mkfs -U $uuid" and if that fails  
fall back to the old behaviour already for the ext\*  
and xfs filesystems.

Have a look how it is implemented there.

Personally I like the implementation for ext\* most.

There you can - by the way - also see how one can  
output multiple lines into a file and keep the indentation  
in the code that outputs the multiple lines i.e. via  
a sub-shell that output each line via 'echo'.

In general regarding the generated code in $LAYOUT\_CODE:

The $LAYOUT\_CODE (i.e. diskrestore.sh)  
is run with "set -e" so that one must be extra-careful  
to ensure that every command succeeds  
(except an intended error exit).

For example (on commandline) what does not work

<pre>
# ( set -e ; var=$( grep foo /etc/fstab ) ; echo do something )
[no output]
</pre>

versus how to make that work with 'set -e'

<pre>
# ( set -e ; var=$( grep foo /etc/fstab || true ) ; echo do something )
do something
</pre>

@schlomo The use of `echo` was requested by @jsmeix (except if I
misunderstood).

From my point of view, both have pro and cons.... I decided to apply
what @jsmeix suggested to bring more "unity" or "constancy" in the code
as `ext` filesystem part is using it.

Just let me know which one you prefer.

I see. I'll let you guys decide what to do as I don't have time to work
on that part in any case. This is a typical question where we pay the
price later when we need to visit this code again.

IMHO better indentation is much less worth than having clean code that
can be pasted into another shell to try out. With the double quoting
introduced by the line-by-line echo this becomes impossible. It also
adds a lot of potential sources for errors due to this double quoting. I
personally would therefore resort to double quoting only if no other
option works.

FWIW, I had the idea about dumping functions only yesterday, otherwise I
would have suggested that earlier. I also haven't tried that out in a
bigger context and therefore can't tell you the problems it will cause.
Most likely it works well as long as all variable parameters will be
passed into the function as command line arguments and not via global
shell variables.

@schlomo @schabrolles  
for me the reason for things like

<pre>
    (   echo "    if CONDITION ; then"
        echo "        do_something"
        echo "    fi"
    ) >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
</pre>

is that this way I can reliably keep the indentation  
in the code that outputs the code lines  
plus the indentation in the output code lines  
by using spaces which is "the only right character" ;-)  
for indentations (see below).

In contrast for here documents with &lt;&lt;-EOF  
indentation with tabs can easily get wrong  
as soon as someone or something replaces tabs by spaces  
because he wants to get rich with spaces for indentations  
or a tool does it automatically (see below).

And it is really hard to distinguish by plain looking at the code  
between the tabs indentation in the code that outputs  
the code lines and the indentation with spaces in the  
output code lines itself - for example as in

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if true ; then
    cat >> /tmp/heredoctestout.sh &lt;&lt;-EOF
        #!/bin/bash
        if true ; then
            echo Hello
        fi
        exit 0
        EOF
fi
echo wrote /tmp/heredoctestout.sh
</pre>

Furthermore this way it is harder to distinguish  
between the code that outputs the code lines  
and the output code lines itself because both  
look very similar (one has to carefully recognize  
where the output code lines itself start and the 'EOF')  
otherwise by "just looking" at the code it may look  
as if the 'echo Hello' is run directly.

Note that here it already happened that my tabs  
were automatically replaced by spaces when I  
copy&pasted my original code (with tabs) hereto.

My original code is:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if true ; then
    cat >> /tmp/heredoctestout <<-EOF
__tab__>#!/bin/bash
__tab__>if true ; then
__tab__>    echo Hello
__tab__>fi
__tab__>exit 0
__tab__>EOF
fi
echo wrote /tmp/heredoctestout
</pre>

where '\_\_tab\_\_&gt;' denotes a tab.

So when someone also copy&pastes the above code  
from here he will not get my original code (with tabs)  
but the automatically replaced stuff with all spaces.

Simply put:  
Tabs for indentation just do not work reliably in practice  
which is - from my point of view - the reason behind  
why tabs for indentation are not in compliance with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Furthermore:  
Tabs for indentation prohibit we ever coud get rich:  
[https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/)

Regarding &lt;&lt;'EOF':  
In this case I think &lt;&lt;'EOF' to prevent  
variable replacements in here documents  
cannot be used because we need both:  
Some variables need to be evaluated (e.g. $fstype $uuid $device)  
but others must not be evaluated (e.g. \\$new\_uuid \\$SED\_SCRIPT).

@jsmeix yes, I am actually very upset about Bash only supporting TABs
for `<<-EOF`, I think that this is a very very outdated approach.

However, this still doesn't convince me that indentation is more
important than keeping it simple and avoiding double quoting which I
find extremely error prone.

The need to have some variables replaced now while writing the script
fragment while protecting (quoting) other variables shows to me that
this code doesn't have a good separation of concerns. Hence my
suggestion to use functions and passing all required variables as
arguments to the functions. This approach provides a very good
separation of concerns and makes it very simple to test the code that is
generated.

But again, please you guys decide. I don't have time to rework this code
now so that those who write also decide.

@schlomo  
I agree that the double quoting hell with

<pre>

is ugly and bad but I also find here documents ugly and bad  
so that there is a dilemma.

@schlomo  
"since ever" I have a very general question about  
the generated code in $LAYOUT\_CODE (i.e. diskrestore.sh):

Do you know the reason behind why "rear recover"  
has this "another level of indirection" (cf. RFC 1925 item 6a)  
by doing the disk layout recreation indirectly  
via generating diskrestore.sh that is then run.

That indirection via generating diskrestore.sh  
has often caused some confusion in my mind  
and I always need to think complicated when  
implementing code for disk layout recreation.

Why is the disk layout recreation not done  
as anything else during "rear recover"  
by directly running the commands (e.g. parted, mkfs, mount)  
from ReaR scripts - e.g. in the same way as the bootloader  
is directly reinstalled via a 620\_install\_grub2.sh script ?

I would order the different values like this:

-   readability in the sense of seeing at a glance what is going on.
    This is mostly about using forward logic, self explanatory variable
    names, no complex nested expressions or nested quoting, relative
    indentation
-   testability - it should be easy to copy & paste a piece of code into
    a (ReaR) shell to try it out
-   testability - it should be easy to write a unit test for a piece of
    code, this is mostly about good separation of concerns
-   readability in the sense of beauty

That is why for me a here document is the lesser evil. It creates a
complete block of code that might have a different indentation. If you
want you can also indent the code within the here document as it fits
the surrounding code. The only downside is that the generated code is
more indented than needed. Again, I find both to be the lesser evil as
long as the **relative** indentation within a code block is correct. If
different code blocks (e.g. before here document, the here document,
after the here document) have different indentations then I accept that
as a shortcoming of Bash.

BTW,
[https://stackoverflow.com/a/41154835](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41154835)
shows a nice hack how to pretty-print Bash code. It is similar to my
suggestion to declare functions instead of here documents.

So, can you please let us know why you dislike here documents? Is this
mostly personal taste or do you also have other arguments against here
documents?

@jsmeix 😃 you ask the right question and in the end only @dagwieers and
@jhoekx can answer that. You should know the history: We had a *static*
version of that stuff before (which I wrote) which was becoming more and
more impossible to extend with new feature wishes. It was very obvious
back then that we won't be able to accommodate all required features
with that static approach.

I never particularly liked the code as it is but I am **extremely**
thankful to the authors for bringing ReaR to the next level through this
code. IIRC the main objective of this design was to be **very flexible**
and to give the user a **review** before doing the job.

I'll be very happy if we can evolve the code to be better to read and
better to maintain. Maybe an approach could be to create a function for
every type of line in the `disklayout.conf` and then to reduce the
`diskrestore.sh` to be a list of function calls with arguments.

@schlomo  
no - I do not really know the history of that time - because  
at that time I was not yet involved in upstream ReaR development.  
I only know the old 'dr' workflow was replaced by the new 'layout'  
workflow but I do not know what reasons behind had led to the  
new 'layout' workflow design.

The new layout workflows were introduced to solve the requirements that
@dagwieers and @jhoekx were hired to solve.

What do you think about the idea to introduce functions that encapsulate
a topic instead of generating scripts?

@schlomo  
currently I do not yet know if functions instead of  
directly output code is better:  
On first glance I fear introducing functions to encapsulate  
something could be "another level of indirection".  
On the other hand introducing functions is helpful to avoid  
multiple code places that implement the same thing.  
Furthermore if diskrestore.sh would be a list of function calls  
with arguments it could make its intent that the user can  
directly edit the commands in diskrestore.sh more  
complicated for the user (because of the indirection  
via functions instead of the pure commands).  
I think I have to meditate on it... ;-)

@jsmeix the indirection of functions comes to **replace** the
indirection caused by the script generation (either as here document or
as lots of echo lines with double quoting).

If the functions are properly tested then I would hope that nobody would
have to change the implementation of a function during disaster
recovery. Showing only the abstraction of the function calls will
actually enable much more people to change stuff that seems wrong
without fearing to mess up everything. For example remove a UUID
parameter or something like this.

@schlomo  
but shouldn't the disklayout.conf file already provide  
such an abstraction of the low level details?  
I mean:  
Wouldn't then those functions in diskrestore.sh  
basically contain the values from disklayout.conf  
as function parameters?

If yes, then diskrestore.sh would contain basically  
the same information as disklayout.conf  
so that diskrestore.sh would have no longer  
an actual purpose.

In the end instead of the indirection via functions in diskrestore.sh  
those reliably working functions (where nobody would have  
to change their implementation during a disaster recovery)  
could as well be called directly by scripts that run  
during "rear recover".

Simply put:  
Why an editable diskrestore.sh if all what the user is meant  
to change during a disaster recovery are values like the  
ones that are currently in disklayout.conf?

Or in other words:  
I would much more prefer to enhance the syntax  
of the disklayout.conf entries to make it much more obvious  
and easier for the user to change that instead of the  
low level code in diskrestore.sh.

Then a disaster recovery with issues that need to be solved  
could happen like

<pre>
# rear recover
Error foo

# vi disklayout.conf

# rear recover
Error bar

# vi disklayout.conf

# rear recover
[success]
</pre>

Yes, I agree with you. Maybe it is just a question of improving the
quality to remove the need for manually adjusting the diskrestore.sh.
Seems like a worthwhile goal.

@schlomo  
I think I have a plan how we can move  
towards that goal step by step:

We can keep the diskrestore.sh code generation  
in all its ugliness as is (provided it works).

We only need to to enhance the syntax of disklayout.conf  
to make it much more obvious and easier for the user  
to change that - plus:

We need to ensure that "rear recover" also works  
on an already partially recovered system  
(i.e. after a previous "rear recover" had failed).

For the latter I hope adding an early "cleanupdisk" script  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)  
is all what is needed because when such a "cleanupdisk" script  
completely wipes the disk a second "rear recover" gets again  
the same clean empty disk as the first "rear recover" had.

Yes, that sounds good. In any case, we can start from converting a
single topic to a function and see how that behaves. No need to change
everything at once. Dumped functions and generated bash code are
compatible 😄

@schlomo  
"since ages" I have the plan to enhance the disklayout.conf  
entries for disks and partitions to that not only byte values  
but also MiB or GiB units are supported and perhaps  
even more advanced units like e.g. '8MiB' as currently  
in USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE.  
By the way:  
Because older parted on SLE11 does not support MiB or GiB  
(only MB and GB according to "man parted) I would convert  
any values from disklayout.conf into byte values for the pated calls  
in diskrestore.sh to be on the safe side (which nicely shows  
that the low-level stuff may even have to be kept ugly).
