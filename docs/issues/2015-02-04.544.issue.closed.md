@roseswe what does your customer want? If code has to be written then it
has to be done on-site I guess as we do not have the required setup for
this behavior...

Some background information how that gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type
became created:

It is YaST (more precisely it is libstorage) that creates a
gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type under special conditions.

As far as I see it seems that special conditions are hardcoded in the
libstorage source file storage/Disk.cc as follows:

YaST creates a gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type when a gpt partition type
is requested but the system does not use (U)EFI for booting (i.e. when
it uses BIOS) and the system is x86 compatible (this means both x86 and
x86\_64) or the system is ppc but not ppc64le.

As far as I understand it it seems the basic logic behind is that YaST
creates a gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type when a gpt partition type is
requested but the system actually won't be able to boot from it.

For example a system with traditional BIOS where a gpt partition is
wanted. In this case a gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type must be actually
used (that is basically a gpt partition where the first sector on the
disk is a valid MBR) so that BIOS can boot it.

The problem with gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type is that it is not in
compliance with the EFI GPT standard (cf.
[http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html](http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html)
) and as a consequence it will cause problems here and there (just as an
example rear does not work with it).

If possible I would recommend that on uses  
either traditional BIOS with traditional MBR partition type  
or (U)EFI with GPT partition type  
but not a mix-up of both.

It seems "parted -s /dev/sdX mklabel gpt\_sync\_mbr" is an undocumented
way to use parted - i.e. it seems the gpt\_sync\_mbr partition type is
not officially supported by parted because it is neither documented at
[http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html\#mklabel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html#mklabel)
nor in "man parted" (I have parted version 3.1 on my SLES12 system).

The more I learn about it the more that gpt\_sync\_mbr thingy seems to
"smell" - more and more it looks as if it is not something that should
be officially supported at all - it seems one only gets into trouble
with it...

I found out that "parted -s /dev/sdX mklabel gpt\_sync\_mbr" really is
not supported by upstream parted (there is no 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' in
parted-3.2.tar.xz) - it is a SUSE-specific addon via a
parted-gpt-mbr-sync.patch see

@gdha

(FYI: late reply because I was on vacation.)

Currently there is no need for rear upstream to do something here.

If at all there might be a note added to the rear documentation that
currently it does not work for partitions of type 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' aka.
'hybrid (synced) MBR' .

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2015-10-23 11:31](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544#issuecomment-150548564):

I will implement support for the SUSE-specific 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' hack in
rear because it is requested by a SUSE customer.

As usual I will try to implement it in a way so that it does not cause
regressions eleswhere and finally - after confirmation by SUSE-internal
testing (and ideally also by the SUSE customer) that it works - I will
do a GitHub submitrequest.

Some intermediate feedback what goes on:

I have now a KVM/QEMU machine with gpt\_sync\_mbr  
and I can reproduce the error exit of the initial comment:

<pre>
Disk configuration is identical, proceeding with restore.
ERROR: Partition number '' of partition  is not a valid number.
ERROR: Partition  is numbered ''. More than 128 partitions is not supported.
</pre>

To get a KVM/QEMU machine with gpt\_sync\_mb  
it was simply specifying a 2500GB virtual harddisk  
on a "normal" (i.e. BIOS) KVM/QEMU machine.

Fortunately one can create a KVM/QEMU virtual machine  
with a much bigger virtual harddisk than what is actually  
available as free space on the real harddisk.  
I use virt-manager to set it up.  
There is a popup notification that warns about that the  
virtual harddisk is bigger than the free space on the real harddisk  
but one can acknowledge the warning and proceed.

When YaST detects a system with BIOS  
and with a disk of more than 2TB  
then YaST does the gpt\_sync\_mb partitioning  
automatically.

On my system this gpt\_sync\_mb partitioning looks as follows:

<pre>
# parted /dev/sda unit MiB print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 2560000MiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt_sync_mbr
Disk Flags: 
Number Start    End        Size       File system    Name    Flags
 1     1.00MiB  2.00MiB    1.00MiB                   primary bios_grub
 2     2.00MiB  2063MiB    2061MiB    linux-swap(v1) primary
 3     2063MiB  43026MiB   40963MiB   btrfs          primary legacy_boot
 4     43026MiB 2559999MiB 2516973MiB xfs            primary
</pre>

On that system "rear mkbackup" creates this disklayout.conf  
(excerpt)

<pre>
# egrep '^disk|^part' /tmp/rear.WkRJ6ruTilrLlvE/rootfs/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
disk /dev/sda 2684354560000 gpt_sync_mbr
part /dev/sda 1048576 1048576 bios_grub  /dev/sda1
part /dev/sda 2161115136 2097152 none  /dev/sda2
part /dev/sda 42952818688 2163212288 legacy_boot  /dev/sda3
part /dev/sda 2639237480448 45116030976 none  /dev/sda4
</pre>

In
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10\_include\_partition\_code.sh
there is

<pre>
read part disk size pstart name flags partition junk
</pre>

which reads this line from disklayout.conf

<pre>
part /dev/sda 1048576 1048576 bios_grub  /dev/sda1
</pre>

that results

<pre>
$disk="/dev/sda"
$size="1048576"
$pstart="1048576"
$name="bios_grub"
$flags="/dev/sda1"
$partition=""
</pre>

which is obviously wrong for $name $flags and $partition.

In particular because $partition is empty the line

<pre>
local number=$(get_partition_number "$partition")
</pre>

in
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10\_include\_partition\_code.sh
calls get\_partition\_number with empty $partition and in
usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh get\_partition\_number does an
error exit in this case.

What I need to fix first and foremost is that disklayout.conf is created
correctly.

Currently it seems that "$name" is empty in disklayout.conf is the root
cause.

For comparison how parted and disklayout.conf look  
on a "msdos" labeled partitioning:

<pre>
# parted /dev/sda unit MiB print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 25600MiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 
Number  Start     End       Size      Type     File system     Flags
 1      1.00MiB   1498MiB   1497MiB   primary  linux-swap(v1)  type=82
 2      1498MiB   13790MiB  12292MiB  primary  btrfs           boot, type=83
 3      13790MiB  25600MiB  11810MiB  primary  xfs             type=83
# egrep '^disk|^part' /tmp/rear.dYWXyVLurEQKeha/rootfs/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
disk /dev/sda 26843545600 msdos
part /dev/sda 1569718272 1048576 primary none /dev/sda1
part /dev/sda 12889096192 1570766848 primary boot /dev/sda2
part /dev/sda 12383682560 14459863040 primary none /dev/sda3
</pre>

At least on first glance it also does not look correct because here the
flags are all "none" in contrast to what parted reports.

Currently the whole partitioning looks messy for me...

@jhoekx

I have some general questions regarding the partitioning code in rear.

I like to understand the reasoning behind why the partitioning code  
is as it is because from my current point of view I think I may  
need to change it substantially to make it less "fragile".

Jeroen, I think you are the right one to ask because "git blame
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/20\_partition\_layout.sh" and "git
blame
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10\_include\_partition\_code.sh"
shows mostly you as the one who made them.

Jeroen, is this o.k. for you?

The issue should be fixed with my above pull request
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681)

This minimal changes make it work for me.

Nevertheless the whole partitioning code looks fragile from my point of
view but I think it is better to not do major changes here but to keep
the fix for this particular issue minimal.

Merged pull request \#681 which should fix it.

At least it works for me with this partitioning
