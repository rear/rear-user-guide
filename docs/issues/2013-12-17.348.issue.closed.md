Hi

I'm trying to install rear on RHEL 7 beta 1 with the latest git version,
but the mingetty package no longer exist on the new RHEL... But agetty
is present.  
Have you any idea to get around this problem ?

Thanks

is `mingetty` not available in yum repo's?

Mingetty is not available in yum repo's...  
I downloaded mingetty of Fedora 19 to try to make a backup / restore.

Perhaps open a bugzilla report against RHEL 7.0 beta1 for the missing
mingetty? I'm sure we are not the only project depending on it...

According to RHEL is in beta version, I'll wait a bit before opening a
bugzilla.

Rear restored RHEL7 beta1 succesfully. I just added the f option to mkfs
to force recreation of xfs filesystems (See \#349)

submitted a bugzilla request myself -

@Florent38 did a test on RHEL7 myself - still have some remarks:

1.  `mkfs -f` cannot work as `mkfs` does not know about the parameter
    `-f`. It refers to `mkfs.xfs` I guess. Therefore, the solution
    mentioned in issue \#349 is not working for me.
2.  RHEL7 can work without `mingetty` and can use the built-in `agetty`
    without problems. To accomplish this I needed to remove `mingetty`
    from the list of `REQUIRED_PROGS` (is ok as it is also listed in
    `PROGS`)  
    However, we can still enforce `mingetty` RPM via the `rear.spec`
    file (except for RHEL7 then). I will close the bugzilla report as we
    have a valid work-around.
3.  a warning that needs some attention:

<!-- -->

About 3. Adding support for it wouldn't be hard, but it's not strictly
needed. It's a daemon that manages LVM metadata, so LVM does not have to
scan for that metadata every time there is an LVM operation. It just
improves performance.

Just pull in a view changes (forgot to link to this issue) for pts 1, 2
and 3.
