### Requesting support or just a question

Hello, is there a way to monitoring the backup result to execute some
commands (e.g. send mail) if the backup fails?

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output


### Additional information

As per short info, my REAR installation runs on RHEL7 via crontab every
night. What I would like to do is implement a check of backup status,
and in case something gone wrong execute some commands (e.g. send
email). Is there any native configuration for that? e.g.  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT=/etc/rear/post\_backup\_success.sh  
POST\_FAILURE\_SCRIPT=/etc/rear/post\_backup\_failure.sh

Or maybe I have to change some scripts?  
Thank you.

@LordSpectre  
what backup method do you use?  
I.e. what `BACKUP=...` do you have specified  
in your etc/rear/local.conf?

Yes, using POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT would be the generic way  
to do that inside ReaR.  
There is no such thing as POST\_FAILURE\_SCRIPT in ReaR.  
See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf what config variables  
are supported by ReaR.

But you may also call whatever you need outside of ReaR  
after "rear mkbackup/mkbackuponly" had finished  
to check and verify the results.

@jsmeix

I'm using NETFS as BACKUP type.  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT will be called anyway ONLY when the backup is
finished. If Rear stops with any error (e.g. no space in /boot to write
boot files) the POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT will not be executed.

I notice that for any error in any stage, Rear will write this in its
log:  
`Exit task '(( EXIT_FAIL_MESSAGE )) && echo 'rear mkbackup failed, check /var/log/rear/rear-xxxxxxxxx.log for details' 1>&8'`

So maybe I can just check for "EXIT\_FAIL\_MESSAGE" and/or "rear
mkbackup failed" strings after Rear backup task.

@LordSpectre  
perhaps there is a misunderstanding here?

Because you wrote initially "monitoring the backup result"  
I was thinking you mean the result of only what belongs  
to making a backup of the system's files?

Cf. the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore"  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Relax-and-Recover\_versus\_backup\_and\_restore](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore)

But because now you wrote

    If Rear stops with any error
    (e.g. no space in /boot to write boot files)
    the POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT will not be executed.

I am now wondering if you perhaps actually mean  
"monitoring the whole ReaR result"?

For the latter the exit code of sbin/read should help  
because for "rear mkbackup/mkbackuponly" the exit code  
should be zero only when "rear mkbackup/mkbackuponly"  
finished without error.

But when "rear mkbackup/mkbackuponly" finished without error  
it does not mean all is 100% OK for what you need because  
there could be issues which are an error for your use case  
but which were not (yet?) considered as an error by ReaR.

In contrast to "rear mkbackup/mkbackuponly" exit code  
"rear checklayout" is special because it finishes  
with exit code 1 when the disk layout has changed  
or when configuration files have changed  
but this exit code 1 is no error but meant  
as a signal that things have changed.

@jsmeix

I'm sorry, perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my request. What I need is
to run the backup at night using a script in crontab like this:  
rear mkbackup

Then, I want to check that everything went well without having to
manually check the ReaR log under /var/log/rear every day.

As I mentioned earlier, it seems that for every error where ReaR fails
to complete the backup, it writes the following error:  
(( EXIT\_FAIL\_MESSAGE )) && echo 'rear mkbackup failed'  
Doesn't matter which is the cause, I always notice this

Perhaps I can add a check to the script in crontab and perform a grep on
the latest ReaR log. If this error is present, it means something went
wrong, and I can send an email. Afterward, I could analyze the log to
figure out what went wrong.  
Any other advice are welcome :)

@LordSpectre You could pimp your cron entry as follow:

    /usr/sbin/rear mkbackup >/dev/null 2&>1
    echo exit code $? >> /var/log/rear/rear-$(hostname -s).log

Then you only have the check the last line in the log file. I do it all
the time with the help of `ansible`

@LordSpectre  
if you like to 'grep' for ReaR messages:  
I would recommend to 'grep' for success to be on the safe side  
instead of trying to 'grep' for whatever error messages  
e.g. think about something may send SIGKILL to ReaR  
so no error message of that abort can be shown by ReaR.

See at the end of usr/sbin/rear what the log messages are  
which are sent to "syslog" (via 'logger')  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/sbin/rear\#L876](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/sbin/rear#L876)  
and see the LogToSyslog function implementation  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L544](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L544)

For example on my openSUSE Leap 15.6 workstation:

    # usr/sbin/rear -s mkbackup
    Relax-and-Recover 2.9 / 2025-01-31
    Running rear mkbackup (PID 9409 date 2025-02-17 14:37:44)
    ...

    # usr/sbin/rear -s mkbackuponly
    Relax-and-Recover 2.9 / 2025-01-31
    Running rear mkbackuponly (PID 11450 date 2025-02-17 14:44:05)
    ...

    # usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue & sleep 1 ; kill -9 $!
    [1] 12752
    Relax-and-Recover 2.9 / 2025-01-31
    Running rear mkrescue (PID 12752 date 2025-02-17 14:50:15)
    ...
    [1]+  Killed                  usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue

    2025-02-17T14:44:07.075626+01:00 localhost rear[12328]: rear mkbackuponly finished with zero exit code

i.e. no syslog message about the killed "rear mkrescue".

@gdha  
do you perhaps know the reason why  
we do not send the final LogToSyslog messages  
also to the ReaR logfile?

E.g. at the end of sbin/rear something like

        if test $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ; then
            LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"
            echo "${MESSAGE_PREFIX}$( date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N " )$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code" >>"$LOGFILE"
        else

The `${MESSAGE_PREFIX}$( date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N " )` part is from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L414](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L414)

@jsmeix you will see in the `usr/sbin/rear` code at the end:

    # There should be no syslog message for the help workflow:
    if test "$WORKFLOW" != "help" ; then
        if test $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ; then
            LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"
        else
            if test "checklayout" = "$WORKFLOW" -a $EXIT_CODE -eq 1 ; then
                # The checklayout workflow is special because it sets EXIT_CODE=1
                # when the disk layout has changed or when configuration files have changed
                # but that exit code 1 is no error but meant as a signal that things have changed
                # which require a new ISO image so that users can run "rear checklayout || rear mkrescue"
                # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564
                LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM checklayout finished with exit code 1 (layout or config changed)"
            else
                LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW failed with exit code $EXIT_CODE"
            fi
        fi
    fi

    exit $EXIT_CODE

Something should be logged in `/var/log/messages` after each `rear` run.

@gdha  
yes, I know it, cf. 'git blame usr/sbin/rear' ;-)  
and that's what I wrote in

But I asked about a reason why we do not send those  
final LogToSyslog messages also to the ReaR logfile?

I.e. why only in syslog (e.g. in /var/log/messages)  
but not also in the ReaR logfile?

@gdha  
thank you!

So it seems there is no reason why those messages  
could not be also output to the logfile which means  
(as time permits) I will make an enhancement pull request  
to also output our final LogToSyslog messages to the logfile.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2025-02-17 15:45](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3404#issuecomment-2663484892):

Hmmm...

I think I can simplify LogToSyslog things  
to make LogToSyslog always also output to the log file  
because I don't see a reason why LogToSyslog messages  
should not always also be sent to the log file.

My current reasoning:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'LogToSyslog' | grep -v ': *#'

    usr/sbin/rear:
            LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"
                LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM checklayout finished with exit code 1 (layout or config changed)"
                LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW failed with exit code $EXIT_CODE"

    usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:
    function LogToSyslog () {
        LogToSyslog "ERROR: $*"

So LogToSyslog is only called  
at the end of sbin/rear for our final messages and  
in the Error() function in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh as

    Log "ERROR: $*"
    LogToSyslog "ERROR: $*"

where the message is already also output to the log file.

When I move in sbin/rear the  
"Saving $RUNTIME\_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE"  
part after the final LogToSyslog calls  
then I could call Log in LogToSyslog to make  
LogToSyslog always also output to the log file.

This would avoid needlessly overcomplicated duplicated code like

    LogToSyslog "$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code"
    echo "${MESSAGE_PREFIX}$( date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N " )$PROGRAM $WORKFLOW finished with zero exit code" >>"$LOGFILE"

as in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3404\#issuecomment-2663242237](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3404#issuecomment-2663242237)  
which is needed when the "Saving $RUNTIME\_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE"  
part happens before the final LogToSyslog calls.

Thank you, this is an interesting approach. Here is a test I did:

    # echo exit code $?
    exit code 143

Is there any exit code list? I would base my script basing on that code,
but from what I understand, if files are modified during the backup, the
exit code will be 1.  
So, which codes should I check?  
0 and 1 = OK  
Others = KO

In your case 143 means SIGTERM exit (128+15).

@gdha thank you very much. I tried to simulate several errors, e.g. nfs
only read mount, ctrl-c during backup, full /boot partition on host,
etc. The exit code is always 143. Plus I notice that with below common
WARNING, the exit code is still 0.  
That's good, so it means if REAR complete correctly the backup, I always
get ZERO. So I can just check if the exit code is ZERO, or different
from ZERO and then send mail.

    WARNING: tar ended with return code 1 and below output:

    This means that files have been modified during the archiving
    process. As a result the backup may not be completely consistent
    or may not be a perfect copy of the system. Relax-and-Recover
    will continue, however it is highly advisable to verify the
    backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system.

That "tar ended with return code 1" issue  
is a good example for what I meant with

    when "rear mkbackup/mkbackuponly" finished without error
    it does not mean all is 100% OK for what you need because
    there could be issues which are an error for your use case

in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3404\#issuecomment-2662514125](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3404#issuecomment-2662514125)

For example the following 'tar' output

    WARNING: tar ended with return code 1 and below output:
      ---snip---
      tar: /etc/fstab: file changed as we read it

could mean that the backup is really not good enough  
to restore the system in a clean and usable state.

But it depends on the 'tar' version what its message  
"file changed as we read it" actually means, see  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20318852/tar-file-changed-as-we-read-it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20318852/tar-file-changed-as-we-read-it)  
excerpts

    tar 1.34 or before
    These versions of tar use ... "ctime"
    ...
    tar 1.35+
    In these versions, tar uses "mtime"

@jsmeix This is clear, I don't want to check the backup consistency, but
only the result of the whole operation. But I already know that exit
code = 0 doesn't mean that I'm safe 100% :)
