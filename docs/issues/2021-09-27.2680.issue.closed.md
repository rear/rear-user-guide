#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    `Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git (7c42e2bd3e600d059f24bd0b46526700c1d8bda0)`

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Using `usr/sbin/rear format -v -- --efi /dev/sd...` does not create
    the layout required for EFI.<br>  
    The switch `--efi` is simply ignored, as it sets `FORMAT_EFI=y`,
    which is never used anywhere else in the code.  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7c42e2bd3e600d059f24bd0b46526700c1d8bda0/usr/share/rear/lib/format-workflow.sh\#L32-L33](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7c42e2bd3e600d059f24bd0b46526700c1d8bda0/usr/share/rear/lib/format-workflow.sh#L32-L33)

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Put the line `EFI=$FORMAT_EFI` right before the following line,
    since `$EFI` is never set anywhere.

Shouldn't it be `usr/sbin/rear format -v -- --efi /dev/sd` (with two
dashes in front of `efi`) ?

V.

@gozora you are right, that was a typo in the issue. Sorry about that.  
Unfortunately that is not the problem. I used the correct command and it
only worked after I applied the workaround, i.e. edited the code

The `usr/sbin/rear format -v -- --efi /dev/sd...` command works as
expected using d032145.  
Thanks for the quick fix @jsmeix

I think less than one hour from initial user bug report  
to final user confirmation that the fix actually works  
is probably our fastest case that we had here.  
So - now it's time for my morning coffee and breakfast...
