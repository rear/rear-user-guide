Hi, everyone.

I am rather new to ReaR and try to set it up under RHEL 6.4 on a HP
server. Additionally I installed the hpssacli 2.20-11.0 of HP and
discovered its binaries/the installation directory is not included in
the rescue image.

Debugging the Relax-and-Recover Version 1.17.1-git201507281845 /
2015-07-28 shows what happens within the
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/27\_hpraid\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/27_hpraid_layout.sh)
script,

Extract of the log executing `rear -dDv mkrescue`:

    [...]
    ++++ get_path hpssacli
    ++++ type -p hpssacli
    +++ grep ON_DIR= /usr/sbin/hpssacli
    ++ eval HPSSACLI_BIN_INSTALLATION_DIR=/opt/hp/hpssacli/bld/
    +++ HPSSACLI_BIN_INSTALLATION_DIR=/opt/hp/hpssacli/bld/
    ++ COPY_AS_IS=("${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" "$HPACUCLI_BIN_INSTALLATION_DIR")
    +++ get_version hpssacli version
    +++ TERM=dumb
    [...]

Looking at a previous hpacucli installation shows the variable  
`HPPACUCLI_BIN_INSTALLATION_DIR=/opt/compaq/hpacucli/bld/`  
whereas the "new" hpssacli tool includes the variable  
`HPSSACLI_BIN_INSTALLATION_DIR=/opt/hp/hpssacli/bld/`

P.S.: A current workaround for me is to include a line  
`COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /opt/hp/hpssacli/ )`  
in the `site.conf`.

Questions? Welcome.

Regards,  
Holger.

@hpannenb Before you modified the site.conf file (COPY\_AS\_IS) what did
you exactly miss? The executable or the directory? Or both? I've check
on a older version (HP Array Configuration Utility CLI 9.30.15.0) and
all seemed fine?  
Would like to know for sure what was missing...

Hello, Gratien. With the `hpssacli` tool installed everything under
`/opt/hp/hpssacli/bld/` is missing. The `hpssacli` itself is included
but this is just a shell script which uses binaries under the mentioned
directory `/opt/hp/hpssacli/bld/`.

@hpannenb just fixed the 27\_hpraid\_layout.sh script
