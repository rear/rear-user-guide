This is a follow-up of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1697](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1697)  
in particular see

that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
I think an additional test during "rear mkrescue" to detect
a degraded RAID state would be needed even more
to avoid possible issues during "rear recover" preventively.

My basic idea behind is to let "rear mkrescue" ensure that the contert
in disklayout.conf represents the state of a clean original system
so that things can be expected to "just work" later during "rear recover".
