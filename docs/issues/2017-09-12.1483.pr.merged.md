#### Problem:

Original gpt disk partitions may be unnamed. As *parted* requires a name
for each gpt partition, ReaR currently supplies "rear-noname" for
originally unnamed partitions. This leads to systemd log messages during
`rear recover` and in boot logs:

    Dev dev-disk-by\x2dpartlabel-rear\x2dnoname.device appeared twice with different sysfs paths

#### Solution:

To supply unique names for unnamed partitions, just use the basename of
the partition's device path, e.g. sda1, sda2, ...

The suggested change also strips unnecessary quotes from *parted*
invocations.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (gpt only).

Good catch. Can you tell us why you fix the type name during recovery
and not already during the `mkrescue` phase? In
[usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/55b0157929d52023c51ba8e1eda51a3342ddf923/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh#L117)
this name is initially generated, I think that there you could already
set such a unique name.

Nameless partitions seem fine with the [UEFI
spec](http://www.uefi.org/specifications), so it's actually a *parted*
limitation which might go away in a future version of *parted* or with
some other partitioning tool. Keeping "rear-noname" around as a marker
for an originally unnamed partition has two advantages:

-   As better tools become available we could re-create a
    true-to-original partition table.
-   The user can edit `disklayout.conf` and add partitions without
    having to worry about assigning unique partition names.

Tools background: The [parted manual
page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man8/parted.8.html)
is actually out of date with respect to the `mkpart` command, but the
[user's
manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_node/mkpart.html)
clearly states *A name must be specified for a ‘gpt’ partition table.*
In contrast, *gparted* does not have this restriction.

If there are no strict objections  
I would like to merge it soon...
