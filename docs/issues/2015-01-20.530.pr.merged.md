The changed 31\_network\_devies.sh does two things different than
before:

1.  It doesn't depend on a name based guess for identifing a network
    device as physical.  
    It now gets the list of all network devices from /sys/class/net, and
    'subtracts' the list of virtual network devices from
    /sys/devices/virtual/net.

2.  It supports VLANs ontop of a bonding interface as well as bonding
    over multiple VLAN interfaces.  
    Before it brings up a VLAN, it checks whether its parent device is a
    bonding interface. If yes, the parent is configured first. Same goes
    for bonding interfaces.

I hope I didn't introduce any regressions or broke something... :-/

@schlomo what do you think of this pull request? After reviewing this I
think it can work as delivered (not tested yet).

Wow! Cool thing and absolutely good idea to stop depending on the
interface names. Maybe it would even help \#655 (does it?)

My 2 ct:

-   Use `$()` instead of backticks
-   Maybe put functions into `lib/*.sh`?
-   From a software development perspective: The functions use global
    variables and parameters, that can easily go wrong.

Yes, I am in favour of this code if we can establish that it does not
break a supported OS / OS version.
