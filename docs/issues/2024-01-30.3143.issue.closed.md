Welcome to ReaR!

Just to satisfy my curiosity: Can you share your motivation for creating
your own backup tooling? ReaR already supports a lot of open source
backup tools, e.g. Duplicity, RBME, Borg, Baroes and of course it can
simply create an archive on a file share or on the USB media or even on
a DVD. What feature is missing from those?

What you want to achieve is actually very simple, please take a look at
\#3138 for an example of how I'm adding a new backup method (this one
only restores data because PPDM is a commercial backup tool that does
the backup on its own).

In general, you'll be adding some files under the following directories
under `usr/share/rear/`:

-   `prep` - prepare stuff for the backup or creating the rescue image
-   `backup` - to actually create a backup if you want to run that from
    within ReaR
-   `verify` - preparatins for the restore (runs in rescue system), e.g.
    start services or figure out what to restore
-   `restore` - actually restore the backup

The way ReaR is built allows you to simply drop files into the
appropriate folders, e.g. you could create your own `my-rear` package
that would depend on `rear` and add some more files with your stuff.

Hello,

I just experienced an SSD crash wiping the whole system drive unreadable
and to prepare for similar event in the future, I am determined to
implement an disaster recovery solution. ReaR topped the search results
and I am having the very same question than the OP.

The issue with traditional backup systems is that a disk has awful lot
of files that do not need to be backed up at all:

-   All application files and libraries: I would rather just save the
    list of packages (Ubuntu) installed and "recover" those by
    reinstalling those after the 1st stage system recovery.
-   The order of recovery should be such that the applications are
    installed first and only then settings (`/etc`) and `/home` would be
    recovered from a file backup. And even here I would like to be
    selective what backup (e.g. just container recipes, not containers
    itself)
-   I am a `btrfs` user and I probably would like to customize a bit how
    recovery is done i.e. what directory is a `btrfs` subvolume. But
    this is not that important since it can do these manually later.

@jarppiko  
regarding "I would rather just save the list of packages (Ubuntu)
installed and 'recover' those by reinstalling those":

We have currently the backup methods  
BACKUP=ZYPPER (for SUSE) and BACKUP=YUM (for Red Hat), see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/14-ZYPPER-and-YUM.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/14-ZYPPER-and-YUM.adoc)

We do not have such a backup method for Ubuntu or Debian.

In particular regarding Ubuntu:  
I am not a Ubuntu user  
(and I won't find time to test things on Ubuntu).  
We at ReaR upstream do not have an active maintainer for Ubuntu  
(and it seems Canonical is not sufficiently interested in ReaR)  
so ReaR support for Ubuntu can be only as good as voluntary  
contributors who use Ubuntu contribute - which is much appreciated!

So you would have to implement needed functionality on your own  
by making appropriate GitHub pull requests here, see  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#How\_to\_contribute\_to\_Relax-and-Recover](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#How_to_contribute_to_Relax-and-Recover)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
or alternatively  
you pay one of the ReaR upstream maintainers  
to implement it for you, see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/support/](http://relax-and-recover.org/support/)  
and  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/support/sponsors](http://relax-and-recover.org/support/sponsors)
