**\# However, the question might be: do we still need the DEV branch??**

From my personal point of view we do not need a 'dev' branch.  
Usually development happens on 'master' via pull requests.  
I think ReaR is not (yet?) such a big project that we need  
dedicated development branches.  
I think pull requests are a sufficient "barrier" to avoid  
that bad code can get too easily into master.
