-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2
-   OS version RHEL 7.2
-   I did a backup from a virtual machine. I recovered the backup in a
    different machine (with other mac-address from eth0).
    finalize/GNU/Linux/30\_create\_mac\_mapping.sh seem not to be
    working, because on the rear-ISO no /etc/rear/mappings directory is
    present.

Should be the the last echo line really $CONFIG\_DIR/mappings?

---- code 30\_create\_mac\_mapping.sh ----

    for file in "${PATCH_FILES[@]}"; do
        grep -q HWADDR $file || continue
        dev=$(echo $file | cut -d- -f3)
        old_mac=$(grep HWADDR $file | cut -d= -f2)
        new_mac=$(cat /sys/class/net/$dev/address)
        [[ -z "$new_mac" ]] && continue
        [[ "$(echo $old_mac | sed -e 'y/abcdef/ABCDEF/')" = "$(echo $new_mac | sed -e 'y/abcdef/ABCDEF/')" ]] && continue
        echo "$old_mac $new_mac $dev" >> $CONFIG_DIR/mappings/mac
    done

-   Work-around, if any: create `/etc/rear/mappings` after booting with
    CD before starting "rear recover"

@Wsaibot To answer your first question - during the boot of the rescue
image script `/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh`
should be called which creates the `/etc/rear/mappings/` directory if a
mac mapping should be done.  
For the second question: Also check the rear.log file (on the recovery
side) if there is any notion of SED\_SCRIPT?  
The writing in script `30_create_mac_mapping.sh` to
`$CONFIG_DIR/mappings/mac` is correct as script
`42_migrate_network_configuration_files.sh` is kicked of a bit later
which uses the mac file as input.

@gdha Thanks for the explanation. Maybe I found my problem:

-   The script `55-migrate-network-devices.sh` test for RULE\_FILES that
    aren't present on RHEL. mac-addresses are only in
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethx. Does this mean, that the
    script exits after this line `test "$RULE_FILES" || return 0` ?.
    This would explain, that after boot from revocery-ISO, no
    /etc/rear/mappings are present and not created in the boot-process.
    And the script `30_create_mac_mapping.sh` can't create the file
    /etc/rear/mappings/mac because /etc/rear/mappings are missing.

Thanks!

Well , script `./finalize/GNU/Linux/30_create_mac_mapping.sh` would
replace mac addresses if `/etc/rear/mappings/mac` would exist of course.
The `55-migrate-network-devices.sh` script only deals with udev rules
and therefore, `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethx` and alike are
out of scope (at least in that script). But, perhaps, you are right, the
next time I'll pay close attention (myself) to this behaviour. If
needed, I'll create a new script to deal with it.  
@jsmeix What do you think of it? Experienced this already?

@gdha : Thanks for your answer. Maybe I misunderstood the script. In my
case - restoring a system on a different hardware with different mac -
the script `30_create_map_mapping.sh` recognizes different macs, but
can't write the mapping-output, because the
directory`/etc/rear/mappings` don't exists. Isn't that script written
for this automatic conversion of mac-addresses? When I create this
directory (/etc/rear/mappings) manually before starting "rear recover",
the script `30_create_map_mapping.sh` can write the file
`/etc/rear/mappings/mac` and mac-addresses will be changed in the
`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethx` correctly (in the following
scripts) and everything would be fine. So my intention is creating the
`/etc/rear/mappings` directory before 30\_create..-script is running.

I did not experience any such issue.  
For my tests I always use DHCP  
and in /etc/rear/local.conf I use

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

@Wsaibot If you would be so kind to verify our fix works for you with
the latest snapshot?

@gdha Thanks for this patch :-)

It works for me.
