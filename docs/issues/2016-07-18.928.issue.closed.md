Currently rear does not support ternary config variables  
in general.

With ternary config variables I mean in particular  
boolean config variables that can have a third valid vaule  
which is "undefined".

With ternary boolean config variables  
(intentionally the wording looks self-conradicting ;-)  
it is possible to distinguish a default/fallback setting  
from an explicitly wanted setting by the user.

The default is used when the config variable is "undefined".  
When the config variable is "true" or "false" it means an  
explicitly wanted setting by the user.

This means the default behaviour must be implemented  
as a fallback when no specific behaviour is defined.

But it is not needed to change zillions of places in the code  
to do that.

Actually it is sufficient to only implement setting the  
config variables this way, i.e. setting the default value  
of the config variables as a fallback when no specific  
value is defined by the user.

Currently usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf is read  
in usr/sbin/rear at the very beginning, in particular  
it is read before the user's settings in etc/rear/local.conf

Hereby I propose to do that the other way round:

First read etc/rear/local.conf to know what config variables  
have an explicitly wanted setting by the user.

Then do in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for boolean variables something like

<pre>
is_true $VAR || is_false $VAR || VAR=default_value
</pre>

and for non-boolean variables something like

<pre>
test "$VAR" || VAR=default_value
</pre>

Basically before user settings did overwrite defaults  
now defaults are only set if not specified by the user.

What do you think?

Can you please provide a specific example of a use case where we would  
achieve a major improvement with such a change?

In short: Forget it (it does not work).

The wish was the father of the thought.

Last weekend I had that idea because I thought  
it could help me to escape from the old problem  
to find out if a setting is actually intended by the user  
or if it is just the default.

As usual, a short time after I posted it,  
it crept into my mind that "my great idea"  
actually does not at all help.

The result is the same for both kind of implementations:  
First set defauts then overwrite what is set by the user  
or  
first do user settings then set defaults for the rest.

But the first implementation is simpler.  
Therefore "my great idea" would only make  
the implementation more complicated.

The reasons why it does not help to solve the  
original problem are:

Regardless how a value was set,  
later it is imposible to find out if the value was set  
explicitly by the user or by a default setting.

Assume the default setting is VAR="this"  
and "this" is what the user wants to have,  
then the default "just works" for the user  
so that he will not explicity specify VAR="this"  
and there is no way how to find out that the  
user explicitly wants to have "this".  
(When later the default changes to VAR="that"  
it suddenly does no longer work for that user.)
