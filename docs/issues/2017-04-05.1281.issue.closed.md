My local.conf is as below.

@jfucanada  
perhaps you misunderstand what OUTPUT\_URL=null  
actually does?

For some background information you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/734](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/734)  
and also see the other issues mentioned therein.

Accordingly you cannot avoid the local ISO because  
currently there is no support in ReaR that ReaR  
creates its ISO directly on a remote location.  
You can only avoid that the locally generated ISO  
gets afterwards copied to a remote location.

@jfucanada I think the solution you are looking for is described in
issue \#802

@gdha  
I do not know what exactly @jfucanada is asking for.

I assumed @jfucanada likes to avoid  
that the ISO exists in a local directory  
(which is by default /var/lib/rear/output).

If @jfucanada only likes to change the default directory  
where the local ISO gets stored, ISO\_DIR helps.

With ISO\_DIR I could only specify a local directory  
where the ISO is created like

<pre>
ISO_DIR="/tmp/myISOdir"
</pre>

but I failed to specify a remote place for the ISO  
(i.e. so that one never has the ISO locally).

Even manually mounting e.g. a NFS share  
using ISO\_DIR as mountpoint like

<pre>
ISO_DIR="/tmp/nfsISOdir"
PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT="mkdir -v -p $ISO_DIR ; mount -v -t nfs -o $OUTPUT_OPTIONS 10.160.4.244:/nfs/$HOSTNAME $ISO_DIR"
POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT="umount $ISO_DIR"
</pre>

does not work  
because backup/default/990\_post\_backup\_script.sh  
that umounts the NFS share from ISO\_DIR  
is run before output/ISO/Linux-i386/800\_create\_isofs.sh  
that creates the ISO - now in the local ISO\_DIR  
so that one gets in the end still a local ISO:

<pre>
# ls -lh /tmp/nfsISOdir/rear-e205.iso
-rw------- 1 root root 1.3G Apr  7 15:08 /tmp/nfsISOdir/rear-e205.iso
</pre>

In local.conf I even tried things like

<pre>
export TMPDIR="/tmp/myReaRtmpdir"
ISO_DIR="$TMPDIR/rear.*/myISOdir"
</pre>

and

<pre>
ISO_DIR=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs/$HOSTNAME
</pre>

but that did not work - as expected when looking briefly  
at the code about ISO\_DIR which basically does

<pre>
mkdir -p "$ISO_DIR"
</pre>

Mainly for my own information  
why the 'output' stage is usually before the 'backup' stage see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283\#issuecomment-293205009](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283#issuecomment-293205009)  
(excerpt):

<pre>
... there is a reason why the output workflow
is before the backup workflow and that is OBDR
(however, is anyone still using that?)
</pre>
