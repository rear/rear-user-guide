-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When I restore an server with redhat 7.3 I will get the following
    error.  
    I edited then the `diskrestore.sh` and removed or set the two
    attributes =0 from all mount commands.

Run the restore script with “5) Continue restore script”, and the
restore worked fine.

sunit=128,swidth=86016  
sunit=0,swidth=0

The original FS had those attributes set.

    /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-root / xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbsize=64k,sunit=128,swidth=86016,noquota 0 0

After rear created the filesystem, those attributes are 0. This shown
down under Rear recreate Filesystem

If rear tries to mount the filesystem with `sunit=128,swidth=86016`, it
get the error.

I guess rear tries to mount the filesystem with the original attributes.
If this attributes are newly set to 0 the mount with the original
attributes does not work.

But I don’t know, why our filesystemes has set those attributes to this
values. The system are building automatically by redhat satellite.

Let’s say we have an redhat 7.2 server.

If you create an xfs filesystem, on this version, all filesystems are
created with this two options. (Maybe on other disk types other options)

    sunit=16     swidth=10752 blks

On this level we can restore with rear without problems. All file
systems are recreated with this options and mounted while the restore
with this option. **This seems to be the default for xfs.**

Now we ***migrate* this server to *redhat release 7.3***.

All existing file systems have still this options set.  
All newly created file system has this *option set to 0.* I guess the
default has changed.

Now we restore with rear. The rear creates all file systems with the new
iso (redhat 7.3).  
All File systems are created with this options =0, because it’s the new
default.  
Rear tries now to mount the newly created file systems with the original
options.

I try now to build a server redhat 7.3 directly from source. If the pxe
kernel is on release 7.3, all file systems should have the option set to
0.

Hello @gdha  
Yes and it is related to \#1208 as well.  
My
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208\#issuecomment-282854316](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208#issuecomment-282854316)
describes same behavior but with *ftype* parameter.

Looks like XFS does not forgive! :-)

I was thinking of calling `xfs_info` for every single XFS filesystem
during `rear mkbackup`, store is somewhere and using it during
`mkfs.xfs` ...

@gozora The problem might be across updates of xfsprogs that default
values change. Therefore, during recovery the default values might be
different then the ones captured in the `disklayout.conf` file, which is
the case in this issue.

The `fs` line in `disklayout.conf` file looks like for (when running
`rear savelaout`):

-   RHEL 7.2 (on a SAN attached disk) with
    *xfsprogs-3.2.2-2.el7.x86\_64*:

<!-- -->

    fs /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-home /home xfs uuid=27ae5138-014a-458e-8df2-66fe7edb1e1c label=  options=rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbsize=64k,sunit=128,swidth=86016,noquota

-   RHEL 7.2 upgraded to RHEL 7.3 with *xfsprogs-3.2.2-2.el7.x86\_64*
    and then *xfsprogs-4.5.0-9.el7\_3.x86\_64* - afterwards the `mount`
    command bails out (see below):

<!-- -->

    fs /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-home /home xfs uuid=27ae5138-014a-458e-8df2-66fe7edb1e1c label=  options=rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbsize=64k,sunit=128,swidth=86016,noquota

-   RHEL 7.3 (on a SAN attached disk) with
    *xfsprogs-4.5.0-9.el7\_3.x86\_64*:

<!-- -->

    fs /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-home /home xfs uuid=574090d7-be7f-4f54-9243-0612dfb8e048 label=  options=rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota

Please note that a fresh installed RHEL 7.3 lacks the parameters
`sunit=128,swidth=86016` on a direct attached SAN device.  
According
[http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS\_FAQ\#Q:\_How\_to\_calculate\_the\_correct\_sunit.2Cswidth\_values\_for\_optimal\_performance](http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_How_to_calculate_the_correct_sunit.2Cswidth_values_for_optimal_performance)
these 2 parameters are meant for RAID performance optimization. Another
article
[http://linuxsnippets.net/en/snippet/xfs-how-calculate-correct-sunitswidth-values-optimal-performance](http://linuxsnippets.net/en/snippet/xfs-how-calculate-correct-sunitswidth-values-optimal-performance)
about the same.

-   \[ \] The default behaviour with xfsprogs-3.2.2-2 changed when using
    `mkfs.xfs` on a direct attached SAN device, especially for the
    parameters `sunit`, `swidth` and `crc`

-   \[ \] Be aware ReaR fails when trying to mount during recovery from
    an updated RHEL 7.2 to 7.3:

<!-- -->

    mount -o rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbsize=64k,sunit=128,swidth=86016,noquota /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-root /

and the correct command should be (as the mkfs re-created the file
system with the defaults `sunit=0,swidth=0`):

    mount -o rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-root /

-   \[ \] perhaps we need to cross check the values in `disklayout.conf`
    file with the ones returned by `xfs_info` before mounting it in
    recovery mode? @gozora @jsmeix any thoughts?  
    Also the `/etc/fstab` file may need to be changed.

Hello @gdha,

I was working on this topic a bit.  
For me only reasonable and safe way is to parse/save `xfs_info` data
during `rear mkbackup/mkrescue` and use this data for filesystem
re-creation during `rear recover`. Once we have filesystem created with
correct options mount will just work.

If I should host "Least friendly parse output" contest `xfs_info` would
be winner. ([some interesting
reading](https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2012-July/msg00025.html)).
I'll try to find some way how to process these data and transform them
to `mkfs.xfs` friendly syntax.

V.

@gozora I did some tests by trying to re-use the values found in
`options` of the **fs** line in `disklayout.conf` file. The bottom-line
is not that simple, and what we use to re-create a XFS file systems in
recover mode (the *defaults*, e.g.
`mkfs.xfs -f /dev/mapper/h50l270vg00-root`) is most likely the desired
state we want.

I agree that this is not a simple thing to do, but using defaults is not
desirable (to my opinion).

Imagine situation where you would create your file system with e.g.
**crc=1** (despite it is non default option.) I think that using non
default options is perfectly fine and ReaR should reflect user choice
during `rear recover`. In upper listed scenario you'd get back system
which have **crc=0** hence some applications that were previously
working might start misbehave, or performance problems might be
introduced. (Take
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208)
as an example).

Now speaking as sysadmin, I would really not appreciate this much ...

@gozora strictly spoken you are right, however, in practice I noticed
that mkfs.xfs seems to do whatever it pleases with most parameters
given, or by bailing out (and end-user complains), or by modifying the
parameters to whatever XFS thinks best fit. I assume as sysadmin that
gives you a bad feeling as well. For this reason I find it very
uncomfortable to choose between defaults (what we do now) and do the
right thing (and increasing bailing out).  
Therefore, I think that using the input from `fstab.txt` could help us
to decide what was defined before? OTOH, you can tune XFS in other ways
too and that complicate things further. Pff need some time to decide.  
@jsmeix Can you assist us in making a decision? :-)

A generic proposal from my point of view:

I assume we can agree that in practice it is impossible  
(with reasonable effort) that ReaR always recreates a  
filesystem exactly as it was on the original system. cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208\#issuecomment-282991951](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208#issuecomment-282991951)

Furthermore my personal opinion is that currently ReaR  
tries too much to do things right in a silently working  
automated way, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-282252947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-282252947)

Therefore I would like to suggest that first and foremost  
configuration variables are implemented where the user can  
(if needed) specify special filesystem setup parameters, cf.  
the new USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_PARAMS variable, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1217/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1217/files)

This way the user has at least some manual means for now  
to enforce that "rear recover" results exactly what he needs.

Afterwards step by step ReaR can be further enhanced to  
autodetect more and more filesystem settings so that then  
step by step ReaR can recreate a filesystem more and more  
as is was before.

Because during "rear recover" several filesystems are recreated  
(also several filesystems of same type) I have currently no real  
good idea how configuration variables for filesystem setup  
parameters could be best implemented. I think those variables  
have to be arrays but currently I have no real good idea  
how to generically specify which parameters should belong  
to which particular filesystem. Perhaps using the device node  
of the filesystem (e.g. /dev/sda1 ) to match an 'fs' entry  
in disklayout.conf is a useful way?

Yes, I've noticed this as well, *sunit, swidth* are such parameters
where you need to include some math to set them correctly. There is also
a group of parameters that are derived or mutually exclusive ....

This is another nightmare, because mount options would not tell you
about how e.g. *crc*, *ftype* are setup ...

I'm trying to find out reasonable (both readable and easy to maintain)
sollution that could help here. So far I've failed 3 times already, but
I keep trying. At the end it is interesting challenge for me ...

I take the risk that you will refuse merging PR (if I ever succeed to

@gozora  
regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1213\#issuecomment-285376306](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1213#issuecomment-285376306)  
"I take the risk that you will refuse merging PR":

Don't worry:  
I will not refuse to merge useful additional automatisms.

But I think you may have misunderstood what I mean.

I am not against automatisms.  
I am for automatisms as default or fallback functionality.

I am against automatisms that remove the final control from the user  
(which I called "do things in a silently working automated way").

Have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212)  
how I have documented UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
in default.conf (so that it is no longer "silently working") and  
how I have implemented UEFI\_BOOTLOADER support in  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh)  
therein in particular (excerpts):

<pre>
When the user has specified UEFI_BOOTLOADER
in /etc/rear/local.conf use it
...
fall back step by step to more and more complicated
autodetection methods until a usable UEFI bootloader file is found
or error out if nothing is found
...
what the user has specified must have precedence over automatisms
</pre>

This way the user still has the final control because when he  
specifies UEFI\_BOOTLOADER this is used (and nothing else)  
but when the user does not make such a decision  
ReaR does various automatisms to "get things right"  
and if that fails ReaR errors out at that current place  
with a meaningful error message, cf.

Hello @gdha, hello @jsmeix

My first idea would be to trigger save of XFS related options using
[230\_filesystem\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/master...gozora:xfs_parse)
into $VAR\_DIR/layout/config/.  
This configs would be later transposed by
[xfs\_parse.sh](https://github.com/gozora/xfs_parse/blob/master/xfs_parse.sh)
to `mkfs.xfs -f ...` command used in *diskrestore.sh*

What do you think?

@gozora  
I think during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" saving XFS specific things  
into a file in $VAR\_DIR/layout/ and use that during "rear recover"  
is "the one and only" (TM) right way.

On only wonder if $VAR\_DIR/layout/config/ is right  
or perhaps if $VAR\_DIR/layout/xfs/ could be better?  
In the end this does not really matter.  
Use whatever file in $VAR\_DIR/layout/ you like most.

I also wonder if for XFS specific things a separated new script  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/232\_xfs\_filesystem\_settings.sh  
would be better?

Fine with that, for me it doesn't really matter where we will store xfs
properties files.

> I also wonder if for XFS specific things a separated new script  
> layout/save/GNU/Linux/232\_xfs\_filesystem\_settings.sh

I've decided to use *230\_filesystem\_layout.sh* because it already
contains code that handles some XFS specific tasks:

    (xfs)
                    uuid=$(xfs_admin -u $device | cut -d'=' -f 2 | tr -d " ")
                    label=$(xfs_admin -l $device | cut -d'"' -f 2)
                    echo -n " uuid=$uuid label=$label "
                    xfs_info $device > $VAR_DIR/layout/config/$(basename ${device}.rear_xfs)
                    ;;

Creating separate file for saving XFS options will in my opinion create
duplicate code with same functionality we already have.

But if you think it will be easier to read, I have no problem adapting
it.

In general:  
Because you implement and maintain it,  
you make the decisions what is best.  
What I do are only some side notes

-   */etc/fstab* entry:  
    `/dev/mapper/vg00-lv_xfs /data                    xfs    sunit=512,swidth=1024,attr2        0 0`

Tests on SLES12 SP1 passed!

Only troublemaker occurred was problem with mounting of XFS partition.  
Mount failed with error: `mount: Structure needs cleaning`  
This was caused by code in *130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh*:  
`xfs_admin -U $uuid $device >&2`  
Fortunately it was easy to fix with `xfs_repair`

Next week I'll continue with tests on Debian and its derivatives (Ubuntu

I would rename script ` usr/share/rear/lib/xfs-functions.sh` into
` usr/share/rear/lib/filesystems-functions.sh` in case we need to add
new functions for new to discover file systems.

In script
`usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130_include_filesystem_code.sh`
I have one doubt with line
`echo "    mkfs.xfs -f $xfs_opts $device >&2"` - what if the values
create by the `mkfs.xfs` code are slightly different then what we
give?  
It could be that the `mount` command would still fail, because the mount
options registered in the mount options variable of the `fs` line in the
`disklayout.conf` file would differ from the ones we created above by
the `mkfs.xfs` command.  
To be fair I did not come that far in my tests.

There should be no problem with this. `230_filesystem_layout.sh` first
dumps file system parameters during `rear mkbackup/mkrescue` and ReaR
later stores `mount` parameters for each XFS filesystem. Meaning that if
you had mounted XFS file system during `rear mkbackup/mkrescue` you have
a quite good chance that rescue system will mount it without problems as
well.  
If you have some real life example when we could have failure with
mounting, just let me know and I'll test it.

I'm still testing different XFS versions and looking for possible
problems, but so far it looks quite well.  
For an update, yesterday I've done tests on Ubuntu Mate 16.4 with quite
new version of XFS and it just worked.  
Today I'm continuing with Debian Jessie ...
