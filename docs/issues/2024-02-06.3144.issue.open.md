the whole check in
usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-s390/305\_include\_s390\_tools.sh should now
be deleted, it is useless and potentially harmful (any failure during
checking /boot will result in all s390 tools omitted from the recovery
image, with disastrous results).  
Actually this whole file can then be deleted and the PROG+= lines moved
to usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-s390x.conf or whatever is appropriate for
s390 (this file got deleted in cba3590b27bedb526e5b439cd8d4d01e1ec0169a
without explanation).
