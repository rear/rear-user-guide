I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help  
with Borg backup specific issues.

In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:  
Usually we at ReaR upstream do not use third-party backup tools  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.

Nevertheless we try to help as good as we can from plain looking at the
code.  
But to do that we need to know what ReaR scripts are actually run  
and what actually happens while those ReaR scripts are run.  
This is why we ask for specific information  
when submitting a ReaR upstream issue, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
therein note in particular the last part about

    "rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files

Furthermore see the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
