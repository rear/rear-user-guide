[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/eb631551fb2af12e820db73df6f1a9bb519ec340/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh\#L35](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/eb631551fb2af12e820db73df6f1a9bb519ec340/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh#L35)

There is a bug in the DHCP interface discovery. The for loop…

    for dev in `get_device_by_hwaddr` ; do

…correctly iterates over all relevant interfaces. But the $DEVICE
variable is only set the first time of the loop. In subsequent loop
iterations this line will prevent $DEVICE from taking on the new
interface name:

    [ -z "$DEVICE" -a -n "$HWADDR" ] && DEVICE=$(get_device_by_hwaddr $HWADDR)

$DEVICE is still present from the previous run so the test for an empty
string (\[ -z $DEVICE\]) will always fail.

This bug will not appear if the first interface found is the interface
which you want to use for a recovery. But in my case the first interface
was a Wifi interface (wlan0) and the second was my connected ethernet
interface (eth0). However the 'dhclient' kept trying to get an IP
address on wlan0.

I will send a pull request in a minute to fix this issue. I have already
tested it on my system.

In addition it may be better to ask the user which interface to use for
DHCP if there are multiple of them.
