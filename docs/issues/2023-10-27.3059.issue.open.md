For the reason behind see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2777\#issuecomment-1077600797](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2777#issuecomment-1077600797)

Currently during "rear recover" it mounts filesystems  
with all mount options that have been reported by  
`mount -t ...` and/or  
`findmnt -mnrv -o SOURCE,TARGET,FSTYPE,OPTIONS -t ...`  
at the time when "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" was run on the original
system  
except for 'vfat', see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/576](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/576)

In some cases mounting with all those mount options fails  
and then "rear recover" also fails, e.g. see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2777](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2777)

Probably in most cases all those mount options are not needed  
to mount the recreated filesystems during "rear recover"  
because all what is needed during "rear recover" is to get  
the filesystems mounted "sufficiently OK" so that it works  
to restore the files from backup into the empty recreated  
filesystems, for an example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/576](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/576)

After "rear recover" the recreated system will be rebooted  
and then its filesystems get mounted according to what is  
stored in the restored config files from the backup.

So a possible way to make "rear recover" robust  
against problematic mount options could be to  
first try to mount the recreated filesystems  
with all those mount options  
but when this fails  
then try to mount it without any options as fallback  
and only if also this fails stop with an error,  
cf. "Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

So in the mount\_fs() function in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133\_include\_mount\_filesystem\_code.sh  
we may add a separated case for each `$fstype`  
for example like (totally untested offhanded proposal):

    (<fstype>)
        ( echo "mkdir -p $TARGET_FS_ROOT$mountpoint"
          echo "if ! mount $mountopts $device $TARGET_FS_ROOT$mountpoint ; then"
          echo "    # Trying to mount without mount options as fallback"
          echo "    mount $device $TARGET_FS_ROOT$mountpoint"
          echo "fi"
        ) >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
        ;;

I cannot imagine what could go worse with such a fallback attempt.  
If the fallback works to get the backup restored things should be OK,  
if not "rear recover" behaves as before i.e. it also fails  
(only later at a different place).

Perhaps some standard mount options might be useful  
also in the fallback case?  
For example mount options to ensure mandatory behaviour  
like 'rw' because write access is needed to restore the backup.  
On the other hand it might be perhaps better to leave out 'rw'  
('rw' is the default) and proceed "bona fide" in the fallback case.  
When later the backup cannot be restored, "rear recover" would fail  
there at the right place where the actual error happened.  
Perhaps some filesystem gets mounted 'ro' in the fallback case  
but no backup files will be restored into that filesystem?

üëç , at the same time I would remove the special handling of VFAT
introduced because of \#576

Yes of course I planned to remove the special handling of VFAT  
(except for VFAT it never works with those mount options).

@pcahyna  
while looking at the mount\_fs() function in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/133\_include\_mount\_filesystem\_code.sh  
I noticed

    (ext2 | ext3 | ext4)
        (
        echo "mkdir -p $TARGET_FS_ROOT$mountpoint"
        echo "mount $mountopts $device $TARGET_FS_ROOT$mountpoint"
        # try remount for xattr
        # mount and then try remount for systems supporting xattr
        # add a second mount for extended attr (selinux) 
        # the first mount will do perform the basic mount, the second mount (remount) will try for xattr
        # if xattr are not support, the mount will fail, however, the first mount will still be in effect and not cause any errors
        echo "mount $mountopts,remount,user_xattr $device $TARGET_FS_ROOT$mountpoint"
        ) >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
        ;;

where I think that in contrast to what the comment states  
"rear recover" will fail when the second mount (remount) fails  
(i.e. when the second mount results a non-zero exit code)  
because LAYOUT\_CODE="$VAR\_DIR/layout/diskrestore.sh"  
runs with 'set -e' see  
layout/prepare/default/540\_generate\_device\_code.sh

@jsmeix good catch, I looked at this code, but I have not realized this.
Note that we never had any report about the problem occurring in
practice, IIRC. So I suspect that this special handling is unnecessary,
but we need to check why it was introduced.

From the comment at that code place follows  
that also 'user\_xattr' should be considered  
as a "problematic" mount option (i.e. a  
mount option that could let 'mount' fail)  
so this issue also applies to that part.

@jsmeix but you have found that the code is not as fail-safe as it
seems, due to use of `set -e`. So, given the notable lack of actual
reports of failures at this code spot, I suspect that the implied
judgement that '`user_xattr`' should be considered  
as a "problematic" mount option in your sense was simply a wrong
judgement from the code's author. Note also the lack of explanation of
what actual problem was the code supposed to solve, or even why is it
necessary to enable '`user_xattr`' even if it has not been present among
the original mount options (one would normally assume that if the
original system has not had it, it is not needed - this is general
assumption of the whole ReaR operation, we attempt to reproduce the
original system faithfully, not to improve it).

IOW: if 'user\_xattr' were really as problematic as the code implies, we
would have seen reports of failures due to `set -e` already.
