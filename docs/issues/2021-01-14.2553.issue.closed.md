-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.3 Git

-   OS version: Ubuntu 18.04.05 LTS Bionic

-   Hardware: KVM Guest

-   System architecture: x86\_64

-   Firmware: GRUB

-   Storage: Virtual Disk under KVM

-   Storage layout:

<!-- -->

    vda                           30G     disk
    |-vda1                        1024M   part
    |-vda2                        1M      part

       |_ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv    20G     lvm    /

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I expect this to be a "no" considering how ReaR tends to work, but I'm
stuck in a situation where I have no control over the network (no PXE
booting), and no ability to add a secondary partition or USB device.
This is a VPS that provides no backups or any support for snapshotting
that would normally allow me to achieve this easily.

But I have to come up with a way to back up and restore a full image of
a system with no extra storage, no network source like PXE, other than
the partition I am supposed to restore.

Is this even possible?

@sissieadmin If your cloud provider allows nothing then it becomes very
difficult. At least they should foresee some kind of snapshotting. If
nothing is possible I would start looking for another VPS provider.

That's what I was afraid of.

Unfortunately this is a situation I have inherited, but I have ruled out
a couple dozen options for accomplishing what I need to do, and perhaps
this may be enough to drive a change.

Thank you anyway. I know this is a very unusual situation, I had already
concluded that it was unlikely to be doable but needed to confirm that
the few solutions I have found are not applicable.

@sissieadmin  
you need at least one separated whole disk where the ReaR stuff  
(ReaR recovery system plus the backup) can be stored  
and wherefrom the ReaR recovery system can be booted  
and wherefrom the backup can be restored.

You cannot do that with one the same disk via separated partitions.

Reason:  
During "rear recover" the target system disk(s) get completely  
recreated from scratch starting with `parted mklabel` command(s)  
followed by `parted mkpart` commands that completely destroy  
all existing partitioning information on the disk.

So you need at least two disks:  
The system's normal operating disk and a second disk for ReaR.

Because that second disk is usually a USB disk  
the matching method in ReaR is called "USB"  
which is set up in etc/rear/local.conf like

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

as described in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

The exact same "USB" method also works with a second built-in disk.

So your VPS provider would have to provide you  
a VPS with two separated virtual disks.

FYI:  
I used ReaR on QEMU/KVM virtual machines with two virtual disks  
to simulate a USB disk when there are issues with ReaR's "USB" method.

@sissieadmin  
as always sleeping over an issue helps me to better see how things
actually are.

In short:  
It is possible to use ReaR only on a single system disk with limited
functionality  
according to what one can reasonably expect in such a limited
environment.

What is possible in such a limited environment is basically only  
a plain restore of a backup that is stored on a separated partition  
on that single system disk.

Obviously when that single system disk gets damaged  
(in particular when the partition table gets damaged  
or when bootloader things get corrupted) all is lost.

But what can be recovered are so called "soft errors" in the operating
sytem  
like deleted or corrupted essential files - i.e. all where a plain
restore of a  
backup of the files helps where the restore is run from "outside" i.e.
from  
within the booted ReaR recovery system so that the backup restore does
not  
depend on some files (programs libraries whatever) of the operating
sytem.

I used a KVM/QEMU virtual machine with this disk layout:

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

    NAME        KNAME     PKNAME   TRAN TYPE FSTYPE   SIZE MOUNTPOINT
    /dev/sda    /dev/sda           ata  disk           10G 
    |-/dev/sda1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda      part            8M 
    |-/dev/sda2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda      part ext4     3.6G /
    |-/dev/sda3 /dev/sda3 /dev/sda      part ext3     5.4G /other
    `-/dev/sda4 /dev/sda4 /dev/sda      part swap     1.1G [SWAP]

Intentionally I did not use the complicated openSUSE btrfs structure,  
cf. "btrfs" in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I used current ReaR upstream GitHub master code as described in  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

You use ReaR version 2.3 which is too old for that  
because the new "mountonly" workflow is nice to have here.  
You could mount things manually and then things could  
also work with ReaR 2.3 but I did not (and will not) test that.

I use this etc/rear/local.conf

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # grep -v '^#' etc/rear/local.conf 

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///other/rear
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='rear'
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
    PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="3"
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )
    GRUB_RESCUE=y

I use `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` and `MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )`  
to get a small ReaR recovery system and I don't need more for  
recovery on the exact same (virtual) machine.

The crucial part is `GRUB_RESCUE=y`  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf what it does (excerpt)

    Note that GRUB_RESCUE is the only functionality
    where "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue"
    changes the currently running system.
    It changes the currently running system even
    in a critical way because it changes the bootloader
    of the currently running system.
    The main reason for the GRUB_RESCUE functionality
    is to be quickly able to recover a system from soft errors
    (like deleting all of /lib/)

After `mkdir /other/rear` I did

Now making a "soft error":

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # rm -r /lib*

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # ls
    -bash: /usr/bin/ls: No such file or directory

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # cat /etc/fstab
    -bash: /usr/bin/cat: No such file or directory

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # reboot
    -bash: /sbin/reboot: No such file or directory

pretty broken system so recovery is needed.

Rebooting the system via hard power off  
shows the new GRUB boot menue entry:

    Relax-and-Recover

This boots the ReaR recovery system.

The ReaR recovery system bootloader files are in particular

    /boot/rear-initrd.cgz
    /boot/rear-kernel

When those files get deleted or damaged  
the ReaR recovery system cannot be booted.

I logged in via ssh into the booted ReaR recovery system  
(one can do things also directly on the ReaR recovery system console  
but I prefer working from remote via my usual `xterm` terminal program).

In the ReaR recovery system I did:
