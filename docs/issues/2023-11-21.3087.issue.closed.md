-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.7

-   If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you
    can't upgrade:

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat

    Debian 11

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

The static networking configuration is being ignored.

I have tried using both:

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=”Yes”

and

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=Yes

In the log file I see the following:

    2023-11-21 12:43:55.981052718 Including prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh
    2023-11-21 12:43:56.019326262 Detected an active Network Manager connection 'Wired connection 1' set up via DHCPv6

Set

    USE_DHCLIENT="No"

to enforce disabling DHCP client on the rescue system.

With

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="Yes"

\[usr/share/rear/skel/default\]/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
won't do anything so "Auto-enabling DHCP on the rescue system"  
should not matter.

ReaR configuration file settings like

    IP=10.254.242.85
    NM=255.255.255.0
    GW=10.254.242.1

should have no effect because IP, NM, GW  
are no documented config variables.  
See "man rear" the  
section "RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"  
about "ip= nm= netdev= gw="  
e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and see "KERNEL\_CMDLINE" in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Hello,

I have tried entering IP=10.254.242.85 and so on in the Recovery
environment, but while the commands are accepted, the IP address is not
changed.

When the doc states that you can edit the kernel command line, can you
advise how I do this?

Thanks

OK, I worked this out.
