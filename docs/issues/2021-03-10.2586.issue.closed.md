#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"): RHEL7.9

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): Baremetal (UEFI)

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): X64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): UEFI

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): Local RAID

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift): Layout is /dev/sda and /dev/sdb

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

How do I tell rear to only backup specific volumes / partitions? Our
/dev/sda is 11TB most of which is not used. /dev/sdb is where the kernel
and all user files are. Is there a way to specify to only back up
/dev/sdb?

Maybe I am blind, but I tried reading these documents, no of which
mention partitions or volumes:  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

**EDIT:** I did look over the default.conf file. From what I understand
REAR will backup everything, and its the user's responsibility to define
exclusion of mount points. However its not clear to me which option to
use for my purposes.  
Which option should I use to exclude say "/dev/sda" from backups, but
backup everything else?

In general including/excluding components like
disks/partitions/filesystems  
is different from what gets included/excluded regarding the backup.  
There are some relationships but in general both are different things.

From my experience with other issues the backup include/exclude
functionality  
versus the components include/exclude functionality in ReaR is "hairy".

Currently - as far as I see - there is no simple clear and consistently
working way  
how the user could specify what disk layout components he wants to get
recreated  
and what mountpoints or directories he wants to get included in the
backup.
