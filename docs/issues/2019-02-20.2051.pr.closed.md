-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Full backup restore on UEFI bootable RHEL 7.6

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    When system is set for UEFI boot,
    *finalize/Linux-i386/630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh* script should create
    boot menu entry via `efibootmgr`. This however never happens because
    script is looking for $UEFI\_BOOTLOADER outside chroot
    (*/mnt/local*) environment, where we unlikely find
    $UEFI\_BOOTLOADER. This leads to messages like shown in
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2035\#issuecomment-465602717](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2035#issuecomment-465602717)
    (despite system might still boot without any problem).  
    This patch changes condition mentioned earlier and looks for
    $UEFI\_BOOTLOADER inside of chrooted environment (*/mnt/local*).

@jsmeix this looks to be part of
e3ca4ce8987dcd475696f32ce49ea3b0bc3dbb2a "Blind attempt to clean up
630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh", I guess we need to check for $UEFI\_BOOTLOADER
inside /mnt/local shouldn't we ?  
Or was there some other intention I've missed ?

@gozora  
thank you for this possible fix.

I like to see the "rear -D recover" log to see what actually goes on,
cf.

I think this pull request conflicts with my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2047)  
because therein I renamed/renumbered  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
into usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh

You are right! I did not realized the \#2047 is not yet merged. But I
somehow have a feeling that Git will handle this correctly, if not I can
fix this PR ...
