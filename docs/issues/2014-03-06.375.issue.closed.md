Hi there,

I have a usage case for Relax and Recover that might be a little out of
the ordinary, but I wondered if it's supported?

I have a virtual RHEL 6 server with 6 disks. The first disk contains the
OS + boot partitions, the second and third disks contain data that is
backed up by a Symantec Netbackup system.

However the fourth, fifth and six drives are not backed up. They are LVM
disks, used to provide a single large volume group + logical volume.

I am looking at configuring local.conf with:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NBU  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///root/backup

And then saving the resulting ISO out to a network share afterwards, and
then for recovery, mounting that ISO in vmware and booting from it.

If I do this, and run the restore, is there a way to recreate the LVM
layout for disks 4-6 without trashing them, so that they will be
accessible after the OS is restored with all their existing data on
them? My impression is that during the restore, the layouts are
recreated and 'new' physical volume / volume groups are applied to the
disks which would effectively 'destroy' existing data on the disks.

Apologies for not having quite the right technical terminology to hand,
I'm not 100% familiar with LVM and how disks are labelled / identified
properly yet.

I think I might have answered my own question!  
I've been looking through the documentation, and it seems having an
EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS section in the local.conf will generate me a
bootable ISO with the disklayout file preconfigured to exclude doing
anything to the filesystems associated with that mountpoint.

Also, do not forget the EXCLUDE\_VG variable if those mount points are  
mounted via their own VGs.
