##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? Unit tested + Recovery in
    migration mode

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

When a physical device is enslaved in a bond, its MAC address is
modified to the first network interface's MAC address of the bond. This
makes `/etc/mac-addresses` record an invalid information, e.g.:

**Broken**

    eth1-bond0 52:54:00:31:e0:b9
    eth2-bond0 52:54:00:31:e0:b9
    eth0 52:54:00:a3:97:5b

**Expected**

    eth1-bond0 52:54:00:31:e0:b9
    eth2-bond0 52:54:00:86:ec:a8
    eth0 52:54:00:a3:97:5b

@rmetrich  
I have two questions:

What is the reason why it errors out when the second `mac=...`
assignment failed  
but there is nothing when the first `mac=...` assignment failed?

What is the reason why it errors out with BugError (which means a bug in
ReaR that  
should be fixed) and not with Error (which means the root cause is
outside of ReaR)?

@rmetrich  
how embarrassing - forget my first question - now even I can see it.  
Probably too early in the morning - eyes already open but brain still
sleeping ;-)

It's unexpected to not be able to retrieve the MAC address of the
device. In the future, if Linux exposes this differently (e.g. "address"
gets renamed), then we should have ReaR abort and be fixed.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow.

@rmetrich  
as always many thanks for your continuous testing, validating,  
fixing, and improving of the networking setup code in ReaR.
