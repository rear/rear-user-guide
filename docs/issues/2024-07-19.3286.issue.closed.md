-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

sometimes after 'rear -v mkbackup'  
temporary files in /var/tmp are left and i got this mesage:

    To remove the build area you may use (with caution): rm -Rf --one-file-system /var/tmp/rear.uJ62KIIXrJKfD12

Why?

-   Workaround, if any:

It is normal in ReaR that in debug and debugscript mode  
(i.e. when called with '-d' or '-D')  
the build area is not automatically removed because the  
build area contents are kept for debugging purposes,  
see in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
the part about KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR that reads (excerpt)

    # KEEP_BUILD_DIR is automatically set to true in debug mode (-d) and in debugscript mode (-D).

e.g. for our ReaR GitHub master code online  
currently starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L223](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L223)

For your particular ReaR version

    Relax-and-Recover 2.7-git.5460.2b102fba.master / 2024-06-28

see your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf file  
which should be same - as far as I remember  
we did not change things there recently.

@oelkie  
in your initial description you wrote

    sometimes after 'rear -v mkbackup'
    temporary files in /var/tmp are left 

Inspect your ReaR log file for this case  
(i.e. when not in debugscript mode but only in verbose mode)  
to see why temporary files are left even in verbose mode.  
According to the KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR description in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

    # - empty (KEEP_BUILD_DIR="") which means that the build area will be kept on errors
    #   if running interactively (in a terminal) but not otherwise to avoid cluttering
    #   TMPDIR (see above) by cron or other automated jobs in case of errors.

the build area is kept in verbose mode "in case of errors"  
so you need to inspect your ReaR log file to see  
what errors there are.

Thank you for your information. Indeed, if i use only -v the tmp-files
are deleted, and only with -D the tmp-files are not deleted.  
This issue can be closed.
