-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):
-   OS is debian11

1.  is there certain sequence for the variables in /etc/rear/local.conf?

2.  the output of 'rear -v mkbackup' showed  
    excluding component fs:/var  
    what if have, for example, a mysql database under /var?

3.  if i use this config:  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    OUTPUT\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
    OUTPUT\_URL=file:////var/lib/rear/output  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=file:///var/lib/rear  
    ISO\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
    i got two ISOs:  
    /var/lib/rear/output  
    /var/lib/rear/output/debian11.. (with date and time)  
    how can i get only one ISO?

4.  where are the templates mentioned on the website?

best regards

To answer your questions:

1.  The `local.conf` has to be seen as a Bash script, therefore, the
    sequence is top-down.
2.  Never include a database in a `mkbackup` workflow as after a
    recovery the database could be corrupted.
3.  An ISO is stored under `/var/lib/rear/output` directory and also a
    copy is saved on the `OUTPUT_URL` location. Are you saying you have
    two ISO's under `/var/lib/rear/output` then it is because of the way
    you define the ISO name (with
    `${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')`. Anyhow, `%S` will be
    different.  
    Or, define a fixed name in `local.conf` as
    `ISONAME="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"` and use
    `$ISONAME` for `OUTPUT_PREFIX=$ISONAME` and `ISO_PREFIX=$ISONAME`
4.  templates can you find under `/usr/share/rear/conf/templates/`

to

1.  i asked if i can set  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    OUTPUT\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
    OUTPUT\_URL=file:////var/lib/rear/output  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=file:///var/lib/rear/  
    or  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    OUTPUT\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
    OUTPUT\_URL=file:////var/lib/rear/output  
    BACKUP\_URL=file:///var/lib/rear/
2.  i did that in the past with oracle express edition 11 and it worked
    fine.
3.  i got on iso in '/var/lib/rear/output' and the other in
    '/var/lib/rear/output/debian11-2024-07-07-114853'.  
    i will try your settings.
4.  templates are not in debian 11, but present in oracle linux 8 and
    opensuse 15.6. Ok, that's not yout fault.  
    I was hoping to find examples in the form of usb.conf, nfs.conf,
    local\_iso.conf and so on.  
    It would be nice to find such examples on github.

ok, as i set :  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
OUTPUT\_URL=null  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///var/lib/rear/  
i got some errors, but the ISO is build, (only one ISO).  
So whats the correct syntax to build a ISO, only one ISO, that is
locally stored and have the hostname, date, time in the filename?  
This would help as a template....

so as i read:  
OUTPUT\_URL  
Backup Target among NFS, CIFS, FILE, FTP, HTTP, RSYNC  
BACKUP\_URL  
Backup target location when using the internal backup method  
i don't understand the difference between the both.

Try to read the man page which should explain it in more depth. If that
is not the case tell us.

If you want to see example configuration files see under
`/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/`

i tried to read man page and the default.conf that did explain it
exactly.  
if i set  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file://  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///var/lib/rear &lt;- i got an error, this is
forbidden.

Or must i set first BACKUP\* and then OUTPUT\*?

BACKUP\_URL is the most important one. When OUTPUT\_URL is missing then
it becomes the same as BACKUP\_URL.

Hi,  
so here at home in my installation i set  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file://  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///var/lib/rear  
that worked without errors.  
A file rear-debian11.iso was created.  
I booted from it, tried to restore and that was aborted with 'missing
file /var/lib/rear/debian11/backup.tar.gz'  
The file was created, but it seems he was not copied to the image.  
Why?

The `BACKUP_URL=file:///var/lib/rear` stores the backup archive on the
local file system. However, the rescue ISO image is made before the
backup is getting made. What you want is the rescue image and archive on
the same ISO image, right?  
Therefore, have a look at the example configuration file stored at
`/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/rescue-and-backup-on-same-ISO-image-example.conf`

OK, a bit about my situation:  
I have two routers that I want to back up in an ISO image.  
They can't just be rebooted like that.  
Both machines have UEFI enabled and SecureBoot disabled.  
The goal would be to create a regular ISO backup that I can later write
to a USB stick using Rufus and then perform a recovery.  
At the moment, I want to limit myself to recreating the situation on
another machine (Debian 11.9), creating a local ISO backup and
performing a recovery.  
Later, create a manual backup of these two routers on a USB stick and,
if in doubt, create a recovery.  
At the moment, I'm testing the creation of a local ISO image on a VM on
proxmox, from which I can then boot and perform a recovery.  
Unfortunately, debain 11 only offers rear 2.6 via the repositories,  
which apparently doesn't work properly with UEFI yet.  
The examples and templates subdirectories you suggested do not exist in
rear 2.6 on debian 11.

I could only find them in the snapshot at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases).

I then got
[https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/download/snapshot/debian-11.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/download/snapshot/debian-11.zip),
which is rear 2.7 and it works quite well:

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://  
OUTPUT\_URL=null  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]} '/tmp' '/var/tmp'
)  
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1  
ISO\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT=4294967296

My setup for a USB stick would be like this look like this:  
OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]} '/tmp' '/var/tmp'
)  
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1  
USB\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"

Later, the plan would be to run the creation of the ISO image on an NFS
share via cron job:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file://  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://nfs-server-name/share/path/  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]} '/tmp' '/var/tmp'
)  
USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1  
ISO\_PREFIX="${HOSTNAME}-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S')"  
ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT=4294967296

To keep multiple backups, I set the ISO\_PREFIX with host name, date and
time.

Unfortunately, the debian-11.zip seems to be a snapshot, a stable
version

Yes, you could argue, 'upgrade to Debian 12,  
then rear 2.7 will be offered'.

That will only happen at a much later date.  
Or not at all, and a completely different technical solution will take
over the functions.

Tomorrow I will try the recovery via USB stick on a test computer with
UEFI enabled and SecureBoot.

I've just noticed that there's always a file left over in /root (because
I ran rear-D mkbackup as root)::  
rear-2024-07-14T11:16:42+02:00.log -&gt;
/var/log/rear/recover/rear-debian119rear.log  
that's a link that doesn't exist.  
/var/log/rear/recover/rear-debian119rear.log doesn't exist.  
I always have to do a  
'touch /var/log/rear/recover/rear-debian119rear.log'  
and a  
'rm rear-2024-07-14T11:16:42+02:00.log'  
after a reboot.  
Maybe not so bad, so i can see when a recovery ist done.
