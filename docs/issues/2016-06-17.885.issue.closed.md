During
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/882\#issuecomment-226765335](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/882#issuecomment-226765335)
I noticed messages on the screen  
that are not logged in the rear log file.

I did "rear -d -D recover" and got this on the screen  
(excerpts - long lines wrapped):

Perhaps this is a general missing functionality in rear  
that everything what appears on the screen is also logged?

@gdha  
do you know if everything what appears on the screen  
should also be logged when '-d' and '-D' is used  
or do I do something wrong?

@jsmeix Try using
[https://github.com/gdha/mismas/blob/master/make\_rear\_diskrestore\_script.sh](https://github.com/gdha/mismas/blob/master/make_rear_diskrestore_script.sh)
to generate the `disk_restore.sh` (see also
[http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/](http://www.it3.be/2016/06/08/rear-diskrestore/)
for more info).  
You will notice that the mkfs commands do not have `>&2` appended (I
guess that was done on purpose so that the user see something on the
screen).

Do I understand it correctly that only stderr gets into the log  
but stdout does not get into the log?

If in usr/sbin/rear the command

<pre>
exec 2>"$LOGFILE" ...
</pre>

is the only one that redirects things into the log  
then only stderr gets into the log  
but stdout stays on the screen.

To get both stdout and stderr on the screen and also in the log  
see my scripts in the section  
"Generic usage of the plain SUSE installation system for backup and
recovery"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In those scripts I implemeted advanced logging functionality  
so that everything what "appears on the screen" is also logged  
as follows (excerpts):

<pre>
# Start logging:
my_name=${0##*/}
starting_timestamp=$( date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S )
log_file=$my_name.$starting_timestamp.log
# Have a new file descriptor 3 which is a copy of the stdout file descriptor:
exec 3>&1
# Have a new file descriptor 4 which is a copy of the stderr file descriptor:
exec 4>&2
# Have stdout on the terminal and also in the log file:
exec 1> >( exec -a $my_name:tee tee -a $log_file )
logging_tee_pid=$!
# Make stderr what stdout already is (i.e. terminal and also in the log file):
exec 2>&1
...
# Stop logging:
# Have stdout and stderr on the terminal but no longer in the log file that is in use by the my_name:tee process
# which was forked at "Start logging" via: exec 1> >( exec -a $my_name:tee tee -a $log_file )
# Close stdout and stderr to finish the my_name:tee logging process:
exec 1>&-
exec 2>&-
# Reopen stdout as what was saved in file descriptor 3:
exec 1>&3
# Reopen stderr as what was saved in file descriptor 4:
exec 2>&4
# Wait one second to be on the safe side that the my_name:tee logging process has finished:
sleep 1
if ps $logging_tee_pid 1>/dev/null
then echo "$my_name:tee process (PID $logging_tee_pid) still running (writes to $log_file)."
     echo "Waiting 10 seconds to give the $my_name:tee logging process more time to finish."
     sleep 10
fi
</pre>

@gdha  
if you like to have such kind of advanced logging functionality  
I can work on it to implement that also for rear.

Of course I will use appropriate command line options  
so that by default the user does not get zillions of  
debug log messages on the screen.

@schlomo would like to see your opinion on this topic as well?

To avoid misunderstanding:

I do not plan to change the current behaviour.

My current idea is to add two command line parameters like

<pre>
Logging:
 -l  have stdout on the terminal and also in the log file
 -L  have stderr in the log file and also on the terminal
By default (i.e. without '-l' and/or '-L')
stdout is on the terminal and stderr goes to the log file.
</pre>

I think it would be nice to also duplicate stdout into the log file. I
don't see the additional benefit (beyond us developers) to mirror stderr
to the terminal as well. Quite the opposite, for ReaR users it is our
job to handle all the error situations either with a meaningful response
in our code or by aborting and asking the user to look into the log
file.

So, as in any case the logfile is the important source of truth I would
add the stdout to the logfile so that the logfile gives a more complete
picture. If a single command has output on stderr that we prefer on
stdout then for this single command we should redirect the output to
stdout (`2>&1`).

As in many other cases, I think that making this configurable adds more
complexity for little value. Adding stdout to the log is however
valuable to complete the picture in the logfile. BTW, looking at the
title of this issue also reminds me to keep it simple and just implement
that: screen messages in logfile.

@schlomo  
I will implement to duplicate stdout into the log file.

I agree that it is sufficient when all is in the log file.  
It is not needed to have all on the terminal.

I think duplicating stdout into the log file could be done  
in any case even without any additional option.

Yes, that's what I meant: Simply add all stdout into the logfile by
default, that should not be an option.

I like it so much that after some discussion  
we find simple solutions that "just do the right thing"!

Unfortunately it is not so simple as it looks to  
"Simply add all stdout into the logfile"  
if one wants to keep strict ordering of stdout and stderr outputs.

With

<pre>
exec 1> >( exec -a $my_name:tee tee -i -a $log_file )
exec 2>>$log_file
</pre>

one gets stdout on the terminal and also in the log file  
and stderr only in the log file (but no longer on the terminal)  
but then stdout and stderr outputs that happen at basically  
the same time can show up in the opposite order in the log file  
(usually stderr gets shown first).

I think the reason is that for stdout there is the 'tee' process  
in beween where output is even further delayed by the named pipe  
with its buffers that are also in beween compared to stderr  
that gets directly appended to the log file.

What would keep the ordering is

<pre>
exec 1> >( exec -a $my_name:tee tee -i -a $log_file )
exec 2>&1
</pre>

because with 2&gt;&1 both streams are correctly merged, cf.  
[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/157689/how-to-capture-ordered-stdout-stderr-and-add-timestamp-prefixes](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/157689/how-to-capture-ordered-stdout-stderr-and-add-timestamp-prefixes)  
because now bash outputs stdout and stderr both via  
the exact same file descriptor (that happens to be a  
named pipe with a 'tee' consumer process).

But of course one same file descriptor for stdout and stderr  
results that both stdout and stderr appear on the terminal  
(and in the log file) and I guess we definitely do not want  
stderr on the terminal for "rear -d -D ..." ;-)

BUT:

Usually we also do not want stdout on the terminal,  
cf. "What to do with stdout and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Therefore I wonder now if I should perhaps by default  
redirect both stdout and stderr only to the log file  
and have both of them no longer on the terminal.

For output that is really meant for the user on the terminal  
one could use explicit termial output e.g. via things like

<pre>
test -w /dev/tty && echo "output for the user" >/dev/tty
</pre>

or like the Print function does it by explicitly using fd7  
as implemented in \_input-output-functions.sh

<pre>
# duplication STDOUT to fd7 to use for Print
exec 7>&1

...

function Print () {
    test "$VERBOSE" && echo -e "${MESSAGE_PREFIX}$*" >&7 || true
}
</pre>

My question is now:

Should I implement stdout on the terminal and also in the log file  
and stderr only in the log file (but not on the terminal)  
without keeping strict ordering of stdout and stderr outputs

or

should I redirect both stdout and stderr only to the log file  
and have both of them no longer on the terminal  
(which keeps strict ordering of stdout and stderr outputs  
in the log file).

In the latter case I would also have to fix all actually intended  
user dialogs via the terminal - in particular all places that  
ask the user for input via a generic user input function, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366)

I think that a first good step is to make sure that all output intended
for the screen is generated by a ReaR custom function like Print and not
plain echo.

Once that is done we can experiment with global redirects. I am afraid
that if we start with global redirects before that then we might end up
missing crucial messages.

Of course I had meant fixing all actually intended user dialogs  
via the terminal as a precondition before redirecting stdout  
only to the log file.

But that could be a long task.

Therefore - if you agree - I would like to do the following:

As a first step for now I will implement  
duplicating stdout on the terminal and also in the log file  
without keeping strict ordering of stdout and stderr outputs.

Then as a second step I will fix all actually intended user messages  
and dialogs by using generic ReaR user input/output functions.

Finally as last step (after wating some time for possible bugs)  
I would implement redirecting both stdout and stderr  
only to the log file.

@jsmeix I am afraid that adding stdout to the log with wrong ordering
will do us more harm than good. It will be extremely confusing to
analyze such logs as you will have to **guess** what belongs where.

O.k. then I will do it right from the start:

First as a precondition I will fix all actually intended user messages

@schlomo  
I think usually the ordering would not go totally wrong  
but only a bit misplaced.  
But theoretically the 'tee' process with its named pipe  
could delay the stdout output arbitrarily so that it is not  
impossible that the ordering gets arbitrarily messed up.

Only an intermediate info:

I am currently experimenting with this in usr/sbin/rear  
to get both STDOUT and STDERR into the log file:

<pre>
# Source usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh because therein
# the original STDOUT and STDERR file descriptors are saved as fd7 and fd8
# so that ReaR functions for actually intended user messages can use fd7 and fd8
# to show messages to the user regardless whereto STDOUT and STDERR are redirected:
source $SHARE_DIR/lib/_input-output-functions.sh

# Keep old log file:
test -r "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" && mv -f "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE".old 2>/dev/null

# Start logging:
mkdir -p $LOG_DIR || echo "ERROR: Could not create $LOG_DIR" >&2
cat /dev/null >"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE"
# Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR into the log file:
exec 2>>"$RUNTIME_LOGFILE"
exec 1>&2

# Include functions after RUNTIME_LOGFILE is set and readonly
# so that functions can use a fixed RUNTIME_LOGFILE value:
for script in $SHARE_DIR/lib/[a-z]*.sh ; do
    source $script
done
</pre>

With this I get "interesting" looking results:

Now some scripts spit out error messages on the terminal  
regardless that STDOUT and STDERR should go to the log file.

It seems there is much to do and to clean up  
until also redirecting STDOUT works properly.

It seems parts of ReaR somehow depend  
on STDOUT not being redirected.

I think ReaR should work properly regardless whereto  
STDOUT and STDERR might be redirected because  
I think it must be possible that the user calls 'rear' from  
within any environment with any STDOUT and STDERR  
redirections set up by the user as he likes it (e.g. for  
whatever automated use case like via cron or whatever).

I think having by default STDOUT and STDERR redirected  
into the log file is only one particular use case.

Found a first easy explanation why error messages  
appear unexpectedly on the terminal.  
It is the old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8'  
e.g. as in prep/GNU/Linux/200\_include\_serial\_console.sh

<pre>
    for devnode in $(ls /dev/ttyS[0-9]* | sort); do
        if stty -F $devnode >&8 2>&1; then
            USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
        fi
    done
</pre>

because now with my new \_input-output-functions.sh  
the original STDOUT and STDERR file descriptors  
are now saved as fd7 and fd8 so that all what is sent to fd8  
appears on the original STDERR which is the terminal.

I was already aware of it that I also have  
to fix all the old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8'  
and if that is all, it is easy - much to do but easy.

I look forward to finally get all that old stuff cleaned up!

I.e. solving
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/887)  
is another precondition for this issue here.

this issue should be already solved regardless

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
I explained "What to do with stdout and stderr" when  
both stdout and stderr are redirected into ReaR's log file.

The redirection of STDOUT into the log file can  
cause regressions when interactive tools are "just called",

I reopen this issue because the  
redirection of STDOUT into the log file  
will not happen for ReaR v 2.2.

Because ReaR v 2.2 was preponed, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398\#issuecomment-315318878](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398#issuecomment-315318878)  
I postponed the redirection of STDOUT vor ReaR v 2.2 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f47f705c0857e46b93c2ccc49b8ba504c05559eb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f47f705c0857e46b93c2ccc49b8ba504c05559eb)  
cf.

For ReaR v2.3 redirection of stdout into the log file is re-enabled
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6ab3c4173fe425bb018880af4a8461bf575ba1e0](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6ab3c4173fe425bb018880af4a8461bf575ba1e0)  
so that this issue is fixed for ReaR v 2.3.

An addedum regarding the above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885\#issuecomment-310308763](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885#issuecomment-310308763)  
that reads

<pre>
# It is crucial to append to the log file '>>' instead of plain writing to it '>'
# because when a program (bash in this case) is plain writing to the log file it can overwrite
# output of the simultaneously running 'tee -a' process that appends stdout to the log file
# (i.e. with plain '2>$log_file' at least some stdout would be missing in the log file):
</pre>

here an example command that shows how append to one same log file
works:

<pre>
{ of=/tmp/out ; cat /dev/null >$of ; \
  ( for i in $( seq 10 29 ) ; do echo "i=$i" ; cat i=$i ; done 1>>$of 2>&1 ) & \
  ( for j in $( seq 10 29 ) ; do echo "j=$j" ; cat j=$j ; done 1>>$of 2>&1 ) & \
  wait ; \
  echo $( grep -o 'i=..' $of | wc -l ) i messages ; \
  echo $( grep -o 'j=..' $of | wc -l ) j messages ; \
  cat -n $of ; } | less
</pre>

that results e.g. this output

<pre>
40 i messages

Message lines of the two simultaneously running processes can get
intermixed  
but on the other hand all output of the two processes appears in the log
file and  
all output appears in the exact right chronological ordering  
(which is the reason why message lines get intermixed).
