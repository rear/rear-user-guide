-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I've been running an off-site Borg backup, that has been working,
    and connecting as root on the remote host.

Recently I encountered permissions issue with accessing the repository
on the remote host and after doing some troubleshooting I've been
advised that running as root on the remote host, rather than some other
user is not best practice and is likely going to periodically lead to
issues like the permissions issue which I have recently experienced.

So, I have reconfigured the remote host to use a user other than root.

And I can ssh to the remote host, using the non-root user (zen).

However, when I modify the conf file and specify the user: zen  
BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME="zen"

So, to be clear, previously I had the BORGBACKUP\_USERNAME commented out
and the backup was working connecting as root.

But I no longer wish to connect as root, but the BORGBAKUP\_USERNAME is
being ignored.

I've also tried prepending the username to the BORGBACKUP\_HOST, but
this doesn't work either.

The rear logs show that the username is being ignored and that rear is
still connecting as root

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):  
    Rear log attached

I know that I had some issues with performing Borg backups with rear
previously and we ended up modifying one of the rear bash scripts as a
work-around.

Perhaps that is the reason that the username is being ignored here. I
will try to find my notes about this earlier ticket

That mod to rear bash script was the reason.

My memory is hopeless.

This is resolved.

Sorry

I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help with  
Borg backup specific issues.
