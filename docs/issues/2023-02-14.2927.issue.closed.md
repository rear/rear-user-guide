ReaR 2.7 on Leap 15.4 x86\_64

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101384/218660284-befd43e7-f6b1-4b38-b1b9-b75a5590f9d5.png)

I first thoght that this is another example for \#2922, and that at
least on SUSE we should add `chattr` to `REQUIRED_PROGS` IMHO, in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/SUSE\_LINUX.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/SUSE_LINUX.conf)
to be specific.

OTOH, this might be a different problem. I checked for `chattr` in the
layout save code:

    $ grep -r chattr usr/share/rear/layout/
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/136_include_btrfs_subvolumes_SLES_code.sh:            echo "chattr +C $target_system_mountpoint/$subvolume_path"
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/135_include_btrfs_subvolumes_generic_code.sh:            echo "chattr +C '$target_subvolume_path'"
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/550_barrel_devicegraph.sh:#  lsattr chattr
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/550_barrel_devicegraph.sh:         lsattr chattr
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh:                # The 'no copy on write' attribute is shown as 'C' in the lsattr output (see "man chattr"):
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh:                        PROGS+=( chattr lsattr )

And it seems like in `136_include_btrfs_subvolumes_SLES_code.sh` there
is code to add `chattr` calls but in `230_filesystem_layout.sh` there is
code to actually add `chattr` to `PROGS`. I guess that those two things
should be better coupled, so that it cannot happen that `chattr` is used
but not added to the rescue system. Or add it by default.

@jsmeix what would be the right solution here?

There is no such thing as a "right solution"  
when dealing with the SUSE default btrfs structure ;-)

I will have a look...

On first glance I think in  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh

    PROGS+=( chattr lsattr )

should be

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( chattr )
    PROGS+=( lsattr )

Can it be the case that you use SLE with its  
default btrfs structure but your etc/rear/local.conf  
is not based on a matching SLE template like  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf\#L48](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf#L48)  
If yes, you will run into various problems.  
See also the SUSE documentation at  
[https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP4/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html](https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP4/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html)  
therein in the section  
"Limitations with Btrfs"

    Your SLE system needs matching ReaR configuration

    For example, the setups in SLE12 GA, SLE12 SP1,
    and SLE12 SP2 have several incompatible Btrfs default structures.
    As such, it is crucial to use a matching ReaR configuration file.
    See the example files
    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12*-btrfs-example.conf. 

FYI:  
Since several years recreating the SUSE default btrfs structure  
had worked without issues and I also got no customer reports.  
But I know that code is more complex than I can fully understand  
so there are certainly gaps in the code in this or that cases.

I assume it is fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/64e9228e9178e717534526ba8ccd9a51af0cb4a8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/64e9228e9178e717534526ba8ccd9a51af0cb4a8)

I don't want to overhaul the whole code that  
deals with the SUSE specific btrfs structure.  
More precisely:  
I cannot overhaul it with reasonable effort.  
I fear if I change it at one place it falls apart at another place.

I don't think that this solves the problem because `chattr` was
available on the source system but it was not included in the rescue
image. Therefore this code path was *not* used at all during `mkrescue`.

Also, let's keep it open till I can validate.

Show me how it failes in your specific case.  
I cannot reproduce it.  
For me it works.

The fix didn't solve the problem, `chattr` is still missing.

    Description:    openSUSE Leap 15.4
    Release:        15.4
    Codename:       n/a

In the `disklayout.conf` I find this:

    # Mounted btrfs subvolumes that have the 'no copy on write' attribute set.
    # Format: btrfsnocopyonwrite <btrfs_subvolume_path>
    btrfsnocopyonwrite @/var

Adding `PROGS+=( ... )` like that probably doesn't work because it is in
a *subshell* that ends on line 539 so that this assignment has no effect
on ReaR.

I'd suggest being more generic here:

1.  If BTRFS is in use, then add `chattr` and `lsattr` to
    `REQUIRED_PROGS`
2.  If SUSE\_LINUX, then add `chattr` and `lsattr` to `REQUIRED_PROGS`

BTW, we actually check for `REQUIRED_PRODS` in the `init` stage which
happens very early. Adding stuff to that array after the init stage only
ensures that it is also in the rescue system, but doesn't check in the
source system.

If you want to get hands-on then I can provide SSH access for you to
look at this.

Be patient...  
(fist things first and one thing at a time).

The "workaround" (i.e. the currently documented solution) is  
to use a local.conf that is based on a matching SLE template.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) commented at [2023-02-17 09:42](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927#issuecomment-1434386789):

Good point with the examples, especially as we also refer to them in the
default `local.conf`.

However, they are only about SLE12 and not SLE15 and I'd hope that we
can cover "known" issues like including `chattr` and other progs already
via our code to make it simpler for users.

The other aspect is that we can't change global variables in a subshell
so that your fix won't work like that:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh\#L505-L540](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh#L505-L540)

The entire - very long - block of code runs in a subshell writing the
stdout to `$DISKLAYOUT_FILE`- hence variable assignments are lost at the
end of this subshell.

Argh!

@schlomo  
thank you for finding the root cause!

Long code parts within uncommon environments (e.g. a subshell)  
call for trouble when someone "just adds usual code" in between  
without looking at the global stuff.

I think that subshell usage is legacy code because  
a subshell is not needed to have a redirection  
for a longer piece of code, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/190\_opaldisk\_layout.sh\#L24](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/190_opaldisk_layout.sh#L24)

We use `) >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE` there:

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh:
    ) >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/240_swaps_layout.sh:
    ) >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh:
    ) >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE

I think I can replace in all those cases

    (
        longer
        block
        of
        code
    ) >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE

by

    {
        longer
        block
        of
        code
    } >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE

which would - by the way - also fix this issue.

But I will have to have a bit closer look  
if perhaps an actual subshell is really needed  
in some of those cases.

the list of most often reported ShellCheck codes  
where this one is the very last one  
but it is just an 'info' - so "don't worry".  
Sigh!

But at least it proves my

    the SCnnnn that appear rarely may more likely indicate real errors

For the (not so) fun of it:

ShellCheck also found

    In usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh line 546:
    grep -q '^fs ' $DISKLAYOUT_FILE && REQUIRED_PROGS+=( mkfs )
                                       ^------------^ SC2031 (info): REQUIRED_PROGS was modified in a subshell. That change might be lost.

which is the last but one in the list in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847\#issuecomment-1446253316](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847#issuecomment-1446253316)

As far as I see this one is plain wrong by ShellCheck  
because line 546 is already outside of the subshell  
so this one seems to be a parsing bug in ShellCheck  
(it seems to fail to recognize the end of the subshell).

I fail to understand what  
[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2031](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2031)  
likes to tell.

I understand what SC2030 means  
but I do not understand what SC2031 means.  
Whether or not ARRAY had been modified in a subshell  
has no influence on `ARRAY+=( foo )` outside of a subshell  
because the latter will append 'foo' to the ARRAY.

Regardless what SC2031 means,  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2947)  
will fix both SC2030 and SC2031.

@thomasmerz  
for me this proves how carefully and thorougly  
we must implement our automated ShellCheck  
to get the right balance between usefulness  
and annoyance for us and our contributors.

E.g. in this case here:  
ShellCheck reported the bug only as 'info'  
but we cannot enable 'info' in general  
because most what ShellCheck reports as 'info'  
is an annoyance for us and our contributors.

Unfortunately '-S error --include=...' does not work  
to report errors plus explicitly specified non-error codes

    # shellcheck -s bash -S error --include=SC2030 usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh
    [no output]
