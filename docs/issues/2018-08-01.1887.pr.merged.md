@schabrolles  
could you have a look here an review it?  
If you don't have time I would "just merge" it tomorrow  
because it was tested by @rmetrich

@jsmeix, bootlist is responsible to set the boot devices order list for
an LPAR in PowerVM.  
Unfortunately, My PowerVM system is used for a customer test until end
of August. So I'm not able to perform a test to validate it.

@schabrolles  
does this pull request look o.k. to you from plain looking at the code  
or do you perhaps immediately see something that could be wrong?  
If things look o.k. to you, you could approve the pull request with  
an appropriate approval comment that you only looked at the code.

@jsmeix, for a plain looking code, this looks correct to me...
