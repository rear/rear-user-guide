### Use Cases

1.  I start `rear recover` on a virtual machine. The original system has
    three drives (`sda`, `sdb`, `sdc`), the recovery VM has two drives
    (`vda`, `vdb`), plus the recovery partition on another drive
    (`vdc`). The intention is to leave `sdc` unmapped. ReaR asks
    remapping questions for `sda` and `sdb`. Then it decides to map
    `sdc` to `vdc` without even asking. Continuing would overwrite the
    recovery system. I have to edit `/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings`
    manually.

2.  I start `rear recover` on a virtual machine, with a USB backup drive
    connected as `/dev/sda`. The original system's boot drive was also
    `/dev/sda`. ReaR asks remapping questions, but I do not notice that
    the `/dev/sdaX` partitions on the VM are actually those of the
    backup drive, while the VM boot drive would have been `/dev/vdaX`.
    ReaR happily overwrites the backup drive. This should never be
    possible.

### Background

-   Overwriting a ReaR rescue system partition is currently possible if
    it resides on a writable disk device (physical or virtual). This
    applies to the `RAWDISK` and `USB` output methods.
-   Accidentally overwriting backup devices is currently possible in any
    ReaR configuration.
-   Related issue: \#1271.

### Solution

-   This PR protects against accidentally overwriting a rescue system
    partition by keeping track of its partition ID. The capability is
    automatically enabled for the `RAWDISK` and `USB` output methods. No
    configuration is necessary.
-   To allow for additional user-configurable protection of devices,
    this PR introduces the following configuration section:
        ##
        # Designate target disk devices or partitions as write-protected to avoid being accidentally overwritten during
        # "rear recover"
        #
        # List of partition table UUIDs, which designate write-protected disk devices. ReaR's own disk device will be
        # automatically added to this list if necessary.
        # Example: WRITE_PROTECTED_PARTITION_TABLE_UUIDS+=("ecacbce4-e05e-4eb9-835c-ade0c3ed0fea")
        WRITE_PROTECTED_PARTITION_TABLE_UUIDS=()
        # List of (shell glob) patterns, which designate matching file system labels as write-protected partitions.
        # Entries may be quoted and contain blanks, but they may not contain single quotes themselves.
        # Example: WRITE_PROTECTED_FILE_SYSTEM_LABEL_PATTERNS+=("Backup *")
        WRITE_PROTECTED_FILE_SYSTEM_LABEL_PATTERNS=()

-   Disks designated as write protected or containing a partition
    designated as write protected will not be used as recovery targets
    by ReaR, whether in `MIGRATION_MODE` or not.

### Testing

-   I have tested complete `rear mkrescue` and `rear recover` cycles for
    `RAWDISK` output in various configurations on Ubuntu 20.04.
-   I have not tested `USB` output, as I find it too baroque to use.
    However, the added code for `USB` is simple and should just work.

### Compatibility

This PR uses command invocations and options which are present in
existing ReaR code with the following exception:

-   `RAWDISK` output invokes `sgdisk` with the `--disk-guid` option.
    This has been present in `sgdisk` [since release 0.8.0
    (September 2011) at
    least](https://github.com/samangh/gptfdisk/blame/81c8bbee46ad6ebacf72eae70ba5147f376205a4/gptcl.cc).

### Note

In migration mode, ReaR asks to remap disks until there is only one
left. Then it maps the last drive without asking. The comment states:

> Automatically map when only one appropriate current block device is
> found where to it could be mapped. At the end the mapping file is
> shown and the user can edit it if he does not like an automated
> mapping

Here, ReaR takes away control from the user (or at least makes it more
complicated that it needs to be). I think this should change (but
separately from this PR) as it does not conform to ReaR's principle.

E.g. `lsblk --output PTUUID --noheadings --nodeps /dev/sda`  
works with `lsblk` in util-linux 2.33.2 in SLES12  
but not with `lsblk` in util-linux 2.19.1 in SLES11  
The available columns for `lsblk` in util-linux 2.19.1 in SLES11:

    # lsblk --help

    Usage:
     lsblk [options] [<device> ...]

    Options:
     -a, --all            print all devices
     -b, --bytes          print SIZE in bytes rather than in human readable format
     -d, --nodeps         don't print slaves or holders
     -e, --exclude <list> exclude devices by major number (default: RAM disks)
     -f, --fs             output info about filesystems
     -h, --help           usage information (this)
     -i, --ascii          use ascii characters only
     -m, --perms          output info about permissions
     -l, --list           use list format ouput
     -n, --noheadings     don't print headings
     -o, --output <list>  output columns
     -r, --raw            use raw format output
     -t, --topology       output info about topology

    Available columns:
           NAME  device name
          KNAME  internel kernel device name
        MAJ:MIN  major:minor device number
         FSTYPE  filesystem type
     MOUNTPOINT  where the device is mounted
          LABEL  filesystem LABEL
           UUID  filesystem UUID
             RO  read-only device
             RM  removable device
          MODEL  device identifier
           SIZE  size of the device
          OWNER  user name
          GROUP  group name
           MODE  device node permissions
      ALIGNMENT  alignment offset
         MIN-IO  minimum I/O size
         OPT-IO  optimal I/O size
        PHY-SEC  physical sector size
        LOG-SEC  logical sector size
           ROTA  rotational device
          SCHED  I/O scheduler name

SLES10 seems to have no `lsblk` at all.

@OliverO2  
you wrote

    ReaR takes away control from the user ...
    I think this should change ... as it does not conform to ReaR's principle.

Huh?

Since I know ReaR it does take away control from the user at so many
places  
so basically it is ReaR's normal behaviour to take away control from the
user  
and do things automatically and silently.  
I tried to improve things according to my "final power to the user"
principle  
at several places where I was most hit by ReaR's silent automatisms  
but overall ReaR still takes away control from the user at many places.

@OliverO2  
thank you so much for that enhancement to avoid severe loss of data!

I try to have a closer look as time permits but possibly it gets delayed
until next week.

@gdha @rmetrich @pcahyna and all @rear/contributors  
I would much appreciate it if you find some time and have a look here.  
Perhaps you could spot this or that issue by plain looking at the code?

@OliverO2 @jsmeix A side note about control to the end-user: most
end-users maybe read the man page, and probably don't look at the
default.conf file. Do you think end-users look at the log files? The
answer is probably most don't.  
It is normal that ReaR with all its plug-ins becomes a bit complex to
maintain and do good for everybody. Perhaps we should perform a grand
cleanup and remove unused ones?  
My point of view is - only a recover exercise is the most useful one and
like most end-users don't look at the log files ;-) anymore as I know it
just works for my use-cases.  
PS: we have a log-file scraper to find errors and which reports it (for
the many systems we maintain).

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon as is  
unless there are objections.

I am thinking about to enhance it after it was merged so that  
the 480\_initialize\_write\_protect\_settings.sh scripts also
initialize  
WRITE\_PROTECTED\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_LABEL\_PATTERNS.

Additionally I am thinking about to rename the specific  
WRITE\_PROTECTED\_PARTITION\_TABLE\_UUIDS  
into a generic WRITE\_PROTECTED\_UUIDS  
and let in particular
USB/default/480\_initialize\_write\_protect\_settings.sh  
add all UUIDs that exist on $USB\_DEVICE to WRITE\_PROTECTED\_UUIDS

I think it cannot cause harm to remember too many UUIDs  
from a disk that must be sacrosanct during "rear recover"  
because UUIDs are sufficiently universally/globally unique  
so that collisions are so unlikely that they can be ignored.  
And even if a collision happens the user can edit his  
WRITE\_PROTECTED\_UUIDS in etc/rear/rescue.conf

The reason behind why I like to not only rely on partition table UUIDs
is that  
[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/375548/what-is-uuid-partuuid-and-ptuuid](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/375548/what-is-uuid-partuuid-and-ptuuid)  
reads (excerpt)

    UUID is a filesystem-level UUID, which is retrieved
    from the filesystem metadata inside the partition.
    It can only be read if the filesystem type is known and readable.

    PARTUUID is a partition-table-level UUID for the partition,
    a standard feature for all partitions on GPT-partitioned disks.
    Since it is retrieved from the partition table, it is accessible
    without making any assumptions at all about the actual
    contents of the partition. If the partition is encrypted
    using some unknown encryption method, this might be
    the only accessible unique identifier for that particular partition.

    PTUUID is the UUID of the partition table itself,
    a unique identifier for the entire disk assigned
    at the time the disk was partitioned. It is the equivalent
    of the disk signature on MBR-partitioned disks but with more bits
    and a standardized procedure for its generation.

    On MBR-partitioned disks, there are no UUIDs in the partition table.
    The 32-bit disk signature is used in place of a PTUUID,
    and PARTUUIDs are created by adding a dash and a
    two-digit partition number to the end of the disk signature.

So PTUUID may only be available on GPT partitioned disks and  
I don't know if on all Linux systems the 32-bit MBR disk signature  
is used in place of a PTUUID.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703)
merged

-   WRITE\_PROTECTED\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_LABEL\_PATTERNS  
    is shortened to WRITE\_PROTECTED\_FS\_LABEL\_PATTERNS
-   The specific WRITE\_PROTECTED\_PARTITION\_TABLE\_UUIDS  
    is replaced by WRITE\_PROTECTED\_IDS with generic functionality,  
    cf.

    together with the new WRITE\_PROTECTED\_ID\_TYPES which  
    defaults to UUID PTUUID PARTUUID WWN so that the user can  
    specify different lsblk columns as needed in his particular
    environment

In etc/rear/local.conf `WRITE_PROTECTED_ID_TYPES="PTUUID"`  
results basically the same behaviour as before this pull request  
where only PTUUID was used as ID,  
cf.
