Hi,  
Running rear -vdD mkbackup.  
I get the following

    Preparing 9 ISO images ...
    Preparing 9 ISO images for /mnt/Pluto_Rescue/pluto/backup.tar.gz.??...
    AUTHORS COPYING Makefile README doc etc packaging usr var
    /opt/rear

    Wrote ISO image: /opt/rear/var/lib/rear/output/rear-pluto_08.iso (372K)

The output/ISO/Linux-i386/81\_prepare\_multiple\_iso.sh has the
following :

    # in mkrescue workflow there is no need to check the backups made, otherwise,
    # NB_ISOS=(ls . | wc -l) [side effect is that lots of empty ISOs are made]
    [[ "$WORKFLOW" = "mkrescue" ]] && return

Is it a bug as its happening during mkbackup?

Can you paste your `/etc/rear/local.conf` file please?

I have a working configuration with:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    ## ISO backup included
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4500
    ###ISO_MAX_SIZE=650

Here whats happening now :

    pluto rear # cat etc/rear/local.conf
    # Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    #BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/Pluto_Rescue

    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4500



    EXCLUDE_MD=(${EXCLUDE_MD[@]} /dev/md0)
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( ${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]} /mnt/vol1 /mnt/mirror )
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE=( ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE[@]} /opt/mkcdrec /opt/ut/settings/torrents )

    pluto rear # ./usr/sbin/rear -vDd mkbackup

You need to define an `OUTPUT_URL` location which is different then the
`BACKUP_URL` location. If you omit, the `OUTPUT_URL` definition then it
is the same as the `BACKUP_URL` location and in your case it becomes
`OUTPUT_URL=iso://backup`. Therefore, you got the error message above.  
Please use something like `OUTPUT_URL=nfs://server/location/` and keep
the `BACKUP_URL=iso://backup` setting.  
My `local.conf` copy/paste was not complete - sorry about that.

Yep that worked :) the backup completed without any problem and iso
created .Thank you very much!!!  
The final local.conf looks like :


    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4500

    OUTPUT_URL=file:///mnt/Pluto_Rescue/
