Problem
-------

While working on the \#3190 story I noticed that we first apply an
update downloaded from `$RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL` and *then* check if we are
actually in the recovery system :face\_with\_head\_bandage:. This could
lead to an update getting applied to an origin system if somebody would
accidentally (or maliciously) run `rear recover` there.

Proposed Solution
-----------------

Check very early for recovery mode

init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh contains

    test "$WORKFLOW" != "recover" && return

so I wonder how it could apply an update downloaded  
into the original system?

Yes, still felt wrong to check so late for recovery mode ðŸ¤·

Of course the check for recovery mode was too late  
but I asked because I do not understand your  
initial description of this issue which looks  
as if you got update downloaded appiled onto  
your original system by 030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
i.e. as if I made a severe bug in that script.

FYI about its history:

    # git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/init/default/050_check_rear_recover_mode.sh

shows at its end i.e. at the very beginning of time  
(excerpts):

    commit d8f1571a213a9df272327bb070e8a87f78fc14c3
    Author: Johannes Meixner <jsmeix@suse.com>

        renumbered by ading a trailing 0 so that 12 becomes 120
        except 00 which becomes 005 and adapted symlinks to point
        again to the right re-numbered scripts
    ...
    rename from usr/share/rear/init/default/05_check_rear-recover_mode.sh
    rename to usr/share/rear/init/default/050_check_rear-recover_mode.sh

    commit ad2283c402736253e4f76d36659f353695aeceea

        prevent any other workflow in REAR rescue mode
        then recover - see issue #719
    ...
    --- /dev/null
    +++ b/usr/share/rear/init/default/05_check_rear-recover_mode.sh

so 05\_check\_rear-recover\_mode.sh  
(relatively early in 00...99)  
became 050\_check\_rear-recover\_mode.sh  
(relatively same early in 000...999).

So my fault was to add 030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
before 050\_check\_rear-recover\_mode.sh  
so I needed the extra check  
instead of after it and then leave out the check.

Ah, so I sort of fixed what happened at that old XX to XXX change? Nice.

I didn't have a problem with unplanned system updates, it was more of a
thought.
