This page seems to be the official rear docs for manual excludes:

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc>

I'm left with a few questions after reading that.

The first thing I notice is that it makes no mention of
EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS which is the only other option I've needed to use in
rear so far thats not mentioned in the quickstart guide. I presume thats
not an intentional omission?

I'd like to see EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS get covered on there and it should
explain how EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS differs from EXCLUDE\_BACKUP, if there
any difference or has EXCLUDE\_BACKUP supposedly deprecated
EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS?

It also briefly explains EXCLUDE\_RECREATE and EXCLUDE\_RESTORE but from
their current descriptions they sound like they do exactly the same
thing.

Is EXCLUDE\_BACKUP favoured over EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS? Do
EXCLUDE\_RECREATE and EXCLUDE\_RESTORE do different things or is one
favoured over the other?

Adding a few examples for excluding devices or not backing up or
restoring a certain dir (or dirs) from the backup would help clarify
this confusing array of very similar sounding exclude options.
