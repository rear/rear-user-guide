Not sure how we are organizing our workflow, but I am sure I am not
going to merge pull requests of everyone :-)

I think it's useful that we also restrict ourselves to "someone else
should review these changes" and point out blatant errors...

That's open for discussion.

I agree, but I prefer the current practice of sending changes to the
list, rather than creating a pull-request (and automatic issue). Not
only do you get a much larger audience, people will see the change
anytime, while through Github, the first person to merge will make it
invisible to the next person.

I would keep pull-requests exclusively for the occasional external
contributor (and maybe for a large changeset that might be
controversial), in all other cases we should be able to push to the
master tree like we have been doing.
