Hi everyone,

While I know there are advantages to decoupling the backup medium from
the actual backup copy of the OS, I was wondering if there are any
sample `local.conf` configurations for those of us who want to live on
the wild side and create a dual-purpose USB that's both bootable and
which contains, on it, the full system backup (ie the file backup)?

I'm struggling a bit with figuring out how to set up such a
configuration in the documentation.

TIA

E.g. see the "QUICK START GUIDE"  
in the "README" section on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear](https://github.com/rear/rear)  
or directly at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/README.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/README.adoc)  
or alternatively the  
"Relax-and-Recover Quick Start" on  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

They show a sample local.conf as follows  
(here without comments):  
for BIOS booting

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

and for UEFI booting

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=(/boot/efi/EFI/*/shimx64.efi)

In any case you need to prepare your USB stick/disk  
with "rear format" to be used only for ReaR.  
"rear format" destroys all existing data  
on your USB stick/disk.

In general you may also have a look at the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
