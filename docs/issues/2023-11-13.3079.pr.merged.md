##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): fixes \#3017

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    CI tested it - I enabled tests on Fedora 39 and Fedora Rawhide

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Newer versions of systemd (starting with Fedora 39) seem to mount
    /sys themselves. Mounting it again leads to errors on the recovery
    system startup (startup scripts failing with status=219/CGROUP ),
    see
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017).

Check if /sys is already mounted using the `mountpoint` tool and mount
it only if it is not.

Do the same for the other system mountpoints like /proc, /dev, /dev/pts.
Not sure if they suffer from the same problem, but they probably could.

N.B. the `mountpoint` command is already among REQUIRED\_PROGS.
