### ReaR version

Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / 2020-06-17

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

No IP address bounded to the network interfaces on RHEL 9 once booted
into ReaR rescue image.  
Reason:

    2025-02-25 14:15:52.073838813 Detected an active Network Manager connection 'lo' set up via DHCPv6
    2025-02-25 14:15:52.080518586 Auto-enabling DHCP on the rescue system

### Platform

Linux x64

### OS version

RHEL 9.5

### Backup

NETFS

### Storage layout

RHEL 9 is using the NetworkManager and not the legacy network scripts.
Therefore, we also better update the current
`450_check_network_files.sh` script with this one:

    #-> cat /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/450_check_network_files.sh
    # This file is part of Relax-and-Recover, licensed under the GNU General
    # Public License. Refer to the included COPYING for full text of license.

    if [[ -d /etc/sysconfig/network ]] ; then
        # SUSE
        ls /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-* >/dev/null 2>&1 && CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-* )
    fi


    if [[ -d /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections ]] ; then
        # Red Hat >= 8
        # Check if the network interfaces are really present in NetworkManager style and if yes also add nmcli to PROGS array
        ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*.nmconnection >/dev/null 2>&1 && CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*.nmconnection )
        PROGS+=( nmcli )
    fi

    if [[ -d /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts ]] ; then
        # Red Hat <=8
        # Check if the network interfaces are really present in legacy network configuration files
        ls /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* >/dev/null 2>&1 && CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* )
    fi

    if [[ -d /etc/network ]] ; then
        # Debian
        CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( /etc/network/interfaces )
    fi

    if [[ -d /etc/netplan ]] ; then
       # Ubuntu using NetworkManager
       CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( /etc/network/*.yaml )
       PROGS+=( nmcli )
    fi

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

Well, the side effect seems that on RHEL 9 it wants to use dhclient as
ReaR had no knowledge about the network manager configuration. And,
interface `lo` seems to enable DHCPv6.  
On RHEL 8 and older versions the legacy network scripts were used.  
We had to add the IP address manual on the console once booted into
ReaR.

### Workaround, if any

Add in `/etc/rear/local.conf` file:

    USE_STATIC_NETWORK=yes

### Additional information

*No response*
