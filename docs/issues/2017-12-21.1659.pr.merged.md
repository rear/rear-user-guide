This PR introduces

1.  support for TCG Opal 2-compliant self-encrypting disks (SEDs), and
2.  a RAWDISK output method (fixes \#1578) with UEFI/Legacy BIOS dual
    boot capability.

This PR introduces only minor changes to existing ReaR code as most of
it is extra functionality. The code has been tested successfully on
Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.

In the hope of simplifying development and maintenance, the new code
does not carry the backward-compatibiltiy overhead present in other
parts or ReaR. The extra capabilities are meant to be used on rather
recent systems and should not break any existing functionality.

Notes
-----

### PBA System

The new `mkopalpba` workflow generates a complete Pre-Boot
Authentication (PBA) system to unlock self-encrypting boot disks. Unlike
the implementation of
[Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil),
this PBA system does not require downloading and building an entire
Linux distribution from scratch. Instead, it builds upon ReaR's
capabilities to create a rescue system, adapted to create a minimal
system equipped with the required unlocking functionality.

PBA usability is best when a Plymouth boot splash is installed on the
original system, but the PBA will also work without one. It has been
tested with systemd only, but init stuff is also provided (test feedback
welcome).

### General Configuration Variables

New:

-   `EXCLUDE_RUNTIME_LOGFILE`: See
    [default.conf](https://github.com/OliverO2/rear/blob/feature/opal-support/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1984).

Changed:

-   `USE_DHCLIENT`: Can now be explicitly disabled. Previously, only
    explicitly enabling or auto-detection was available.

### General Use Functionality

The following code could be integrated into generic ReaR at some point
in the future:

-   `usr/share/rear/build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/810_deduplicate_files.sh`

-   From `usr/share/rear/lib/opal-functions.sh`:

    -   opal\_disk\_partition\_information()
    -   opal\_disk\_has\_partitions()
    -   opal\_disk\_has\_mounted\_partitions()
    -   opal\_bytes\_to\_mib()

TODO

### Boot scripts

Currently, `usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks`
selectively includes setup scripts from
`usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d`. Advantage of
this approach: It requires no restructuring of existing ReaR code.
Disadvantage: Code in `unlock-opal-disks` is vulnerable to the renaming
of setup scripts.

A future solution (which I'd propose in a subsequent PR once this one is
accepted) could use two different directories with

1.  setup scripts for a minimal system,
2.  setup scripts for a complete rescue system.

@OliverO2  
this pull request is big so that I cannot review it in full detail.

My main concern is whether or not changes in existing scripts  
might result incompatible behavioural changes anywhere else.

For example I wonder how your new  
skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/  
scripts for TCG Opal pre-boot authentication  
are ignored/skipped when TCG Opal pre-boot authentication  
is not wanted.

In some of your added scripts that are run in any case like  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/180\_include\_opaldisk\_code.sh  
a topmost test seems to be missing whether or not  
TCG Opal 2 and/or OUTPUT=RAWDISK is used.  
I assume e.g. in your  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/190\_opaldisk\_layout.sh  
and  
prep/default/380\_include\_opal\_tools.sh  
such a topmost test is implemented as

<pre>
has_binary sedutil-cli || return 0
</pre>

There are three systemd units:

-   `sysinit-opalpba.target`, which only becomes active if requested via
    the kernel command line (cf. `KERNEL_CMDLINE` setting in
    `usr/share/rear/prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001_configure_workflow.sh`)
-   `sysinit-opalpba.service`, which only becomes active if requested by
    `sysinit-opalpba.target`
-   `plymouth-start.service`, which only becomes active if requested by
    `sysinit-opalpba.service`, and only if plymouth is installed

So there is no effect on the standard boot procedure, which uses the
default `sysinit.target`.

> In some of your added scripts that are run in any case like

> a topmost test seems to be missing

Like other scripts in `layout/prepare`, the script
`layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/180_include_opaldisk_code.sh` only defines
functions, so there is nothing actually running. There are generally no
conditions in `layout/prepare` (cf. `150_include_drbd_code.sh` or
`170_include_hpraid_code.sh`) as these functions are only called if
their corresponding entries are present in `$DISKLAYOUT_FILE`. So in our
case, the condition in
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/190_opaldisk_layout.sh` should be
sufficient, right?

@jsmeix @gozora @schabrolles @schlomo @OliverO2 If no-one object I would
just merge it so we have plenty of time to get feedback from the user
