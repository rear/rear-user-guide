-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    Ubuntu 22.04

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR):  
    Hyper-V

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    USB

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT"):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Same issue as described in issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2761](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2761)

lusb - t  
produces no output?

I would like to identify a way to improve the speed of the formatting.

Is there a quickformat option for instance?

With Windows you can select quickformat,  
which does not scan the target disk for bad sectors  
and is many times quicker than a "standard" format.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    This is what I'm looking for.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

To paste verbatim text like command output or file content,  
include it between a leading and a closing line of three backticks like

    ```
    verbatim content
    ```

this depends on:

-   the device and bus speed
-   the partition size
-   the filesystem used

for some filesystems there are parameters to speed this up but then it
takes longer later when writing. so there is a tradeoff.  
I am sure parameters can get tuned but this is normally not the step
taking long. In my case about 20s for a 64GB usb stick.
