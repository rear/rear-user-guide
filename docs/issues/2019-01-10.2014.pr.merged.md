-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now `rear dump` shows array variable elements separated by `'`
characters as

        ARRAY_VARIABLE_NAME = 'first element' 'second element'

for example with `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( this that 'something else' )`  
(excerpts):

    # usr/sbin/rear dump
    ...
        BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS = 'this' 'that' 'something else' 
    ...
        BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE = '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' '/root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/output/*' '/nfs/*' '/tmp/rear.Prkdrs6sR9pybOv' 

Before it would have been e.g.

        BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS = this that something else

where it is not clear that actually `something else` is one array
element.

I also cleaned up the indentation in lib/dump-workflow.sh to N\*4
spaces.

Good idea, maybe we should also show which variable is an array and
which isn't? Maybe produce output similar to that of `declare -x`? IMHO
would be good if the output could be posted back into the configuration.

Idempotency between dump output and configuration input, in a way.

Great work!

@schlomo  
thank you for having a look.

I was also thinking about using `declare`  
but I was thinking about using `declare -p`  
to generate the output e.g. somehow as in

    # STRING="string of words"

    # export ARRAY=( '' this ' ' that 'something else' )

    # declare -p STRING ARRAY
    declare -- STRING="string of words"
    declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="" [1]="this" [2]=" " [3]="that" [4]="something else")

This way `rear dump` could output

        STRING="string of words"
        ARRAY=([0]="" [1]="this" [2]=" " [3]="that" [4]="something else")

that can be sourced to set STRING and ARRAY  
but it is less readable compared to the current output via this pull
request

        STRING = 'string of words'
         ARRAY = '' 'this' ' ' 'that' 'something else'

If `rear dump` would output the `declate -p` output as is like

        declare -- STRING="string of words"
        declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="" [1]="this" [2]=" " [3]="that" [4]="something else")

the output becomes even harder to read for humans  
but this could be sourced to set STRING and ARRAY  
exactly as it was before (i.e. ARRAY gets even exported).

Hopefully I can continue next week (as time permits)...

Yes, I meant `-p` indeed. How about this:

    # declare -p BASH_VERSINFO BASH_VERSION NASTY| sed -e 's/^declare -[[:alpha:]-]* //' -e 's/\([( ]\)\[[[:digit:]]\+\]=/\1/g'
    BASH_VERSINFO=("4" "4" "19" "1" "release" "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu")
    BASH_VERSION="4.4.19(1)-release"
    NASTY=("/foo/bar*" "\\twith backslash and 'quotes'\"")

Personally I wouldn't mind the more bashy output format

@schlomo  
what do you mean with "copy-paste compatible with the configuration
files"?

I guess first and foremost no artificual spaces around the `=`  
and in case of arrays enclosing it within `( ... )` as in

        STRING='string of words'
         ARRAY=( '' 'this' ' ' 'that' 'something else' )

Something else?

I was always wondering why there are the artificual spaces around `=`  
which make it impossible to copy&paste lines as variable assignent.

I mean that if we now change the output of `rear dump` to be more
precise then we should also gain the ability to paste the output of
`rear dump` into the configuration. That means that the output must look
like the output of `declare -p`, more or less.

Previously, `rear dump` was meant to be easy to read at the cost of
being less precise. For human consumption IMHO the precise details of
the arrays is not so crucial, on most cases it is obvious.

If we start to be precise then we can also enjoy the ability to
copy-paste the output.

Just my opinion, what do you think @rear/contributors ?

The

    declare -p VARIABLE | sed -e 's/^declare -[[:alpha:]-]* //' -e 's/\([( ]\)\[[[:digit:]]\+\]=/\1/g'

is not fully fail safe.

Deliberately evil self-implicating array element content breaks it:

    # ARRAY=( foo 'declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="foo" [1]="bar")' bar )

    # for e in "${ARRAY[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'foo'
    'declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="foo" [1]="bar")'
    'bar'

    # declare -p ARRAY
    declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="foo" [1]="declare -ax ARRAY=([0]=\"foo\" [1]=\"bar\")" [2]="bar")

    # declare -p ARRAY | sed -e 's/^declare -[[:alpha:]-]* //' -e 's/\([( ]\)\[[[:digit:]]\+\]=/\1/g'
    ARRAY=("foo" "declare -ax ARRAY=(\"foo\" \"bar\")" "bar")

    # ARRAY=("foo" "declare -ax ARRAY=(\"foo\" \"bar\")" "bar")

    # for e in "${ARRAY[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'foo'
    'declare -ax ARRAY=("foo" "bar")'
    'bar'

    # declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="foo" [1]="declare -ax ARRAY=([0]=\"foo\" [1]=\"bar\")" [2]="bar")

    # for e in "${ARRAY[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
    'foo'
    'declare -ax ARRAY=([0]="foo" [1]="bar")'
    'bar'

So plain `declare -p ARRAY` output seems to work fail safe in any case  
while readability improvements via `sed` fall apart in special cases.

In my opinion be precise is more important for ReaR's use-case  
than to make things look nicer (at the expense of subtle errors)  
because ReaR is meant for experienced admins who should  
be able to also understand the plain `declare -p` output.

The current output via this pull request falls apart for

    BACKUP_RSYNC_NASTY=( "/foo/bar*" "\\twith backslash and 'quotes'\"" )

that is shown in the `rear dup` output as

        BACKUP_RSYNC_NASTY = '/foo/bar*' '        with backslash and 'quotes'"'

in particular the `\t` got somehow evaluated...

Probably because of the `echo -e` in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/bf3c3cc4adee1851846a9876f83e8c8ffb4f3df8/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L249](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/bf3c3cc4adee1851846a9876f83e8c8ffb4f3df8/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L249)

Probably `LogPrint` is the wrong function for this sort of output. Maybe
we need to add a new **Raw**LogPrint function or support passing in
command line options to the existing functions.

The only places where `\` are used in `*Print` functions  
seem to be (just a quick `find&grep`, no deeper analysis):

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear | xargs grep -oh 'Print "[^"]*"' 2>/dev/null | grep '\\' | sort -u
    Print "Creating $disk_image_size_MiB MiB raw disk image \"
    Print "Decrypting backup archive with key defined in variable \$BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY"
    Print "Encrypting backup archive with key defined in variable \$BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY"
    Print "If the NSR_RETENTION_TIME=\"
    Print "Using PBA image file \"
    Print "Using local PBA image file \"

so that `echo -e` is perhaps not really needed in practice?

The cases you found seem to protect `$` or `"` from being interpreted. I
checked with `git grep 'Print.*\\t'` (and the same for `\n`) and also
couldn't find anything.

It is worth trying to remove the `-e` from the `Print` function. Since
the `Log` function does **not** have the `-e` option that might actually
be a functional improvement as it makes sure that console and log output
are the same.

To be able to return back to a less incompatible change  
I implement copy-and-paste compatible output in steps  
so that I could easily go back to a particular git commit.

implements copy-and-paste compatible output

    @jsmeix this looks really nice! Please note that the output of `BACKUP_RSYNC_NASTY` is actually wrong, the nested quotes are not handles properly. I think that making the regex not greedy in my `sed` suggestion will solve the example you gave above. I'd caution against re-implementing the functionality of `declare -p` and hope that we can find a way to utilize it.

    My next step towards using the `declare -p` output as is
    is commit
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2014/commits/a9e954a45c4aaae640569a3996d29d30ac63f50e
    which removes the `-e` option from the `echo` commands
    in lib/_input-output-functions.sh to output unchanged values
    which is an any case needed to show variable values as is
    (independent of what the `dump` workflow does), think about
    user messages that show whatever variable values to the user
    where the variable values should not be somehow interpreted.

    I looked again at your example and at the `sed` line. It actually works "as designed" and I would consider the individual assignment of array elements an unnecessary feature.

    We do not have any configuration feature that relies on specific array indices and I would veto any such feature as this would be way above our average user's experience.

    You can decide. I'll go along with using the `declare -p` output as-is and with beautifying it via this `sed` snippet while knowing that it handles only "plain" arrays.

    With my commit
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2014/commits/d97c6f8ea2c05085e20555adfcea5a45e4dc1fc1
    the dump workflow shows the `declare -p`
    output which gets beautified/simplified unless in debug mode
    so that it is possible (via debug mode) to get correct output
    even in special cases where the beautified output gets wrong:

grep BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS etc/rear/local.conf
===============================================

BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS=( '' this ' ' that 'something else' "don't use
brackets '\[...\]' as in \[123\]='foo' (it fails)" 'end' )

usr/sbin/rear dump | grep BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS
================================================

BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS=("" "this" " " "that" "something else" "don't use
brackets '\[...\]' as in 'foo' (it fails)" "end")

usr/sbin/rear -d dump | grep BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS
===================================================

declare -a BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS=(\[0\]="" \[1\]="this" \[2\]=" "
\[3\]="that" \[4\]="something else" \[5\]="don't use brackets '\[...\]'
as in \[123\]='foo' (it fails)" \[6\]="end")


    Furthermore I made the output so that it can be directly sourced
    (unless in verbose mode)

source &lt;( usr/sbin/rear dump ) && echo OK || echo FAIL
=========================================================

OK

source &lt;( usr/sbin/rear -v dump ) && echo OK || echo FAIL
============================================================

If 'Relax-and-Recover' is not a typo you can use command-not-found to
lookup the package that contains it, like this:  
cnf Relax-and-Recover  
-bash: /dev/fd/63: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token
`(' -bash: /dev/fd/63: line 2: `Running rear dump (PID 18114)'  
FAIL

    Because debug mode implies verbose mode it is not possible to get
    correct output even in special cases where the beautified output gets wrong
    that can be directly sourced.

    Here how full output looks like

    @schlomo 
    does it now look o.k. for you or should I change something?
    Your requested changes in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2014#pullrequestreview-191635881
    `improve the output to be copy-paste compatible`
    should be now implemented - and even more because
    now in normal mode the output can be directly sourced.

    @gdha 
    is the new and changed output format also o.k. for you?

    I found a simple way how to source `rear -d dump` output directly:

source &lt;( usr/sbin/rear -d dump | grep '=' ) && echo OK || echo FAIL
=======================================================================

OK


    This way even problematic cases work, cf.
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2014#issuecomment-454395650

for e in "${BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS\[@\]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
=================================================================

''  
'this'  
' '  
'that'  
'something else'  
'don't use brackets '\[...\]' as in \[123\]='foo' (it fails)'  
'end'


    Also readonly variables have the expected effect:

usr/sbin/rear -d dump | grep BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_DIRECTORY
===================================================================

declare -r
BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_DIRECTORY="/root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/moved\_away\_after\_backup\_restore/"

source &lt;( usr/sbin/rear -d dump | grep '=' ) && echo OK || echo FAIL
=======================================================================

-bash: declare: BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_DIRECTORY: readonly
variable  
OK

    i.e. the second run to source `rear -d dump` output will not overwrite
    the already declared readonly variable from the first run.

    @schlomo 
    thank you for your helpful comments and in particular
    for your `sed` command so that we can show by default
    the `declare -p` output in a more user friendly form.

    I think the current implementation is a good balance
    between being precise and being user friendly.
