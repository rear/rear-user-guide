-   rear version: Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git
-   OS version: Debian GNU/Linux 8.9 (jessie) with Openmediavault
    3.0.87)
-   rear configuration files: please see below
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? UEFI

Hello,  
please let me explain two things before describing my problems:

-   I know that ReaR is mostly used within professional environments,
    but my NAS, serving as media server at home, seems to be a little
    special, at least every other program I tried (like the 64-bit
    version of Clonezilla) just throws out error messages during
    startup. The problem seems to be the combination between 64-bit,
    boot by UEFI (GRUB2-bootloader) and a M.2-SSD attached via
    PCIexpress and NVMe.
-   I am also aware that the issue-section of github is normally not
    used to discuss user problems, but I could not found any other forum
    and the mailing list doesn't seem to be very populated.

Starting situation and objective
--------------------------------

I have got a self-built NAS Server which boots from a SSD (/dev/nvme0n1)
and uses two hard-disks (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb) which form a software raid
1 device (/srv/dev-disk-by-label-OMVDisc).  
I want to clone SSD to recover a broken system.

First attempt (creating USB-stick, bootloader not working)
----------------------------------------------------------

I installed Rear and started with the usage scenario of building a
bootable USB stick.  
`rear format /dev/sdc`. The USB stick is successfully formated and
labeled as `REAR-000`.  
The content of the configuration file is:  
`OUTPUT=USB`  
`BACKUP=NETFS`  
`BACKUP_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"`  
`rear format /dev/sdc` doesn't work and gives the following error
message:  
*ERROR: /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-EFI is not block device. Use \`rear
format -- --efi &lt;USB\_device\_file&gt;' for correct format*

Obviously, REAR tries to use the correct bootloader
(USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1) and is searching for a label 'REAR-EFI',
which does not exist.  
After modifiying the configuration file  
`BACKUP_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-**EFI**"`  
and changing the label `e2label /dev/sdc1 "REAR-**EFI**"` the command
`rear format /dev/sdc` works.  
But when I try do boot from the created USB stick I get the error
message:  
`No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!`  
Trying the same procedure another time resulted in the error message:  
`Failed to load COM32 file chain.c32`  
`Failed to load COM32 file menu.c32`

**==&gt;** Is there any possibility to label the USB Stick "REAR-EFI"
right from the beginning ?  
**==&gt;** What about the error messages when booting from the stick?
What do I have to do to correct this?

Second attempt (creating ISO-file, excluding devices and directories)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I changed the configuration as follows:  
`OUTPUT=ISO`  
`BACKUP=NETFS`  
`OUTPUT_URL=file:///media/usb1`  
`#OUTPUT_URL=file:///srv/dev-disk-by-label-OMVDisc/downloads` (this
would not work)  
`BACKUP_URL=iso://`  
An ISO-file containing the rescue system as well as the backup is
successfully created and copied to the USB-Stick. Unetbootin refuses to
work on my system because of a missing X-Server, so I copy the iso-file
to a Windows-PC and restore the iso-file using Unetbootin for Windows
(sic!) on an USB-Stick.

The so created USB-Stick boots successfully on the NAS using UEFI.

**==&gt;** The boot menu just contains the entries "Rear without secure
boot, Rear with secure boot, Exit, Reboot", is this correct or is there
something missing?  
**==&gt;** I just want the content of the SSD to be included in the
backup archive. The content of the two hard disks (forming the RAID1
device) should **not** be included neither the content of any connected
USB-device.  
What do I have to use to achieve this?  
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "fs:/media/usb1" )`  
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "/dev/sdc" )`  
Or should I use `EXCLUDE_BACKUP=()` or `EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()` or
`EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS` or .... ?

How do I have to address in this context the two hard disks ?  
Separated, something like  
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "/dev/sda" "/dev/sdb" )`  
or the RAID1 as a whole:  
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "/srv/dev-disk-by-label-OMVDisc" )`
?

**==&gt;** Directories of the SSD to be cloned can be exluded using the
following command, is this right ?  
`BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/reariso/*' )`

USBmount
--------

I didn't further investigate it, but is it possible that REAR interferes
with USBmount ? The USB stick has to be unmounted to execute the
`usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue` command, but even after `umount /media/usb0`
usbmount tries to mount it again, which confuses then REAR ?!?!

If you are using UEFI, you must use right command to format your USB
target device.  
As ReaR correctly suggests:  
`rear format -- --efi <USB_device_file>`

After ReaR is finished with formatting you should have (at least) two
partitions present:

1.  formatted with vfat (this one is used by UEFI to bring ReaR recovery
    system up)
2.  formatted with "Linux" filesystem (ext3 most probably) which will
    hold your data for restore.

Please be careful during formatting and choose right disk to format as
well as during `rear recover` to choose right disk for your target
restore.

@malvinas2  
Ahh, just realize there is another question about excludes ... That's
why issues should be posted separately I guess :-).

Try to read
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L535)
you might find some useful hidden information there. ;-).

@gozora  
Thank you for your support.

1.  Well, I don't know why there are two times two hyphens
    `rear format -- --efi <device>` instead of just
    `rear format -- efi <device>`, but it works.
2.  Wow, the information in default.conf is amazing! So in my case I
    would use `EXCLUDE_MD=(/dev/md127)` for the raid consisting of two
    hard disks (`/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb`, mounted at
    `/srv/dev-disk-by-label-OMV`) and I could use
    `EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=(/media/usb0)` to exclude USB-sticks, which in
    fact isn't necessary, because of the default setting
    `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media )`.

@malvinas2  
FYI regarding the syntax in things like

<pre>
rear -v format -- --efi --force /dev/sdX
</pre>
