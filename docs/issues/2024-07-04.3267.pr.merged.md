I did hopefully clearify the code a bit. Do you have any additional
suggestions?

Your example confuses me more than clearifies. Everybodys taste is a bit
different I guess, but I am glad we find a solution here :)

I our systems we use multipath to have different path to the same
storage lun. So in the end you are writing data to the same lun,
regardless with (multi-)path you are using. Or did I misunterstood you
question?

With multipath I would always check that the system can boot from the
secondary path. The problem is maybe not the boot code on disk but the
UEFI boot entry that only points to the primary path and not the
secondary path as a fallback.

When I read the issue description I thought that for multipath devices
you would actually create multie EFI boot entries, one per path, to
facilitate booting off the secondary paths.

Maybe I do not understand the concept of EFI correctly, but I our case
we do have the /boot/efi and /boot as two partitions on the same disk.
So when the system finds the EFI partition, it should also find the
kernel to load the linux.

Should I do anything now regarding this PR?

I'll merge it now and we see how it goes.

I'd really appreciate it if you could do the test I mentioned, to be
sure that a recovered system will boot also from the other / secondary
multipath devices.

Please ensure to wipe the EFI boot records on the recovery system before
the test to be sure that there is no "leftover" old configuration.

For illustration: On my home PC the EFI boot entries look like this:

    $ sudo efibootmgr -v
    BootCurrent: 0001
    Timeout: 5 seconds
    BootOrder: 0001,0002
    Boot0001* ubuntu    HD(1,GPT,ef2a7e35-5378-4d76-8d7c-024c8f67de08,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\UBUNTU\GRUBX64.EFI)..BO
    Boot0002* UEFI OS   HD(1,GPT,ef2a7e35-5378-4d76-8d7c-024c8f67de08,0x800,0x100000)/File(\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI)..BO

I must confess to the fact that I also don't know the details of the EFI
boot entries, and I don't know if a secondary multipath device will look
the same as the primary device to the UEFI firmware. Hence the idea to
test.
