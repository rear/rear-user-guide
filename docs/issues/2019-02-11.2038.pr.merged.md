I am not at all a DHCP expert but by plain looking at the code I
wonder  
why not the same fix is also needed for the `IPv6 DHCP clients` case
in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

@gdha  
if that fix is really only needed for the IPv4 case but not for the IPv6
case  
could you then please add a comment at that code that explains why  
both cases are different, cf. "Code should be easy to understand" at
