#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.4

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    RHEL 7.8

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    VMware

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Not sure, if it is a bug...  
    rear mkrescue generates multiple errors (s. below) and writes "rear
    mkrescue finished with zero exit code" to the  
    `/var/log/messages` at the same time.

On the other hand, according to the monitoring guidelines the logfile
should be monitored for "ERROR" strings:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/05-integration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/05-integration.adoc)

This causes the "rear mkrescue" to be marked as "failed" in monitoring
tool even though a rescue image was created.

    modinfo: ERROR: Module nls_cp437 not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module af_packet not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module unix not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module usbcore not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module usbhid not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module ide_cd not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module uhci_hcd not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module ehci_hcd not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module xhci_hcd not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module ohci_hcd not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module zlib-inflate not found.
    modinfo: ERROR: Module zlib-deflate not found.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )

But for it more space is needed in $TMPDIR (must be extended from 3 GB
to 4 GB) to avoid "no space left on device"

@geksi The 'modinfo' ERRORS are no fatal errors if you do not use these
kernel modules (most likely). I agree the messages are misleading and
perhaps we better use a different kind of message - any suggestion?

Also, be aware, that you can define another **TMPDIR** location in the
`/etc/rear/local.conf` file:

    export TMPDIR=/to/filesystem/with/plenty/of/space

@jsmeix Your input is more then welcome - no rush for now as you are on
a holiday break.

Only FYI before I actually do my "stay away from the Internet vacation":

I think `modinfo: ERROR: Module ... not found.` messages are not from
ReaR  
but stderr (or stdout) messages from `modinfo` that appear in ReaR's
log  
because stderr and stdout are always redirected into the log  
cf. "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

As long as ReaR's exit code is zero there is no error from ReaR.  
In case of "rear checklayout" ReaR's exit code could be even 1  
when all was OK with ReaR  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L583](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L583)

I think this issue is essentially same as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2473](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2473)

Both issues are example cases of our general issue

@geksi  
I think your specific `modinfo: ERROR: Module ... not found` issue  
might be perhaps already fixed in current ReaR upstream master code  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2469)  
(see also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2414))  
cf. "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/05-integration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/05-integration.adoc)

    We also monitor the /var/log/rear/rear-system.log file
    for ERROR: and BUG BUG BUG strings, so that in case
    of problems the operator is notified immediately.

The Error() function does

    PrintError "ERROR: $*"
    ...
    Log "ERROR: $*"
    LogToSyslog "ERROR: $*"

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L551](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L551)  
and subsequent lines  
but the BugError() function does no longer show "BUG BUG BUG" but only
"BUG"

    Error "
    ====================
    BUG in $caller_source:
    '$@'

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L695](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L695)  
so I adapted and enhanced doc/user-guide/05-integration.adoc right now
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a956a15af6b59f04344647be1f7b5c6217d1eca8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a956a15af6b59f04344647be1f7b5c6217d1eca8)

@geksi is your question sufficient answered?
