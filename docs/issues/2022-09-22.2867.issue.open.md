[\#2867 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2867) `open`: ReaR connects to rsync server over ssh even if configured to use the rsync protocol without ssh
================================================================================================================================================================

**Labels**: `bug`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6986430?v=4" width="50">[oldunclez](https://github.com/oldunclez) opened issue at [2022-09-22 00:50](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2867):

I am using the most fresh "Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git" to backup my
"src vm" , and then recover it to "dst vm".  
For non-interactive , when backup "src vm" , I set " --password-file"
for rsync.  
/etc/rear/local.conf is :

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=RSYNC
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://rsync@192.168.1.27::rsync
    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( -az  --password-file=/etc/rsync.pass  )

### Note 1:

No matter what rsync transfer method is using :

    BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using ssh
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]::/PATH  # using rsync

For displaying the progress of rsync data tranfer , rear will ssh to
rsync server to count how much data has been transfered.  
( function "check\_remote\_du" , line 94 in file
/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh ).

So if you want to make it works , you have to make sure "non-interactive
SSH login for rsync@192.168.1.27" is accessable.  
Otherwise, if you do not need the progress of the rsync transfer , maybe
you could modify 500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh to the following :

            while sleep $PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS ; kill -0 $BackupPID 2>/dev/null ; do
                ProgressInfo "Waiting  "$(rsync_remote_full $BACKUP_URL)"/backup  to be  finished"
            done

### Note 2:

Rear will pack "/etc/rear/local.conf" of the "src vm" into the the
rescue iso.  
When excuting "rear recover" on "dst vm" , rear will copy the backup
files from rsync server to "dst vm" via rsync with
"BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS=( -az --password-file=/etc/rsync.pass )" .  
But the "/etc/rsync.pass " will not be packed into rescue iso , so it
does not exist in "dst vm",  
You have to create it manually or remove it from BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS
.  
Otherwise , rear recover will fail because of rsync fail with the
non-existent "/etc/rsync.pass "

@oldunclez  
from ReaR 2.6 to ReaR 2.7 we changed something with rsync,  
see what is described about rsync in our release notes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
therein in particular (excerpt)

    Rsync OUTPUT_URLs are now properly supported with BACKUP=RSYNC.
    Previously the output went to the location specified
    by BACKUP_URL and OUTPUT_URL was ignored.
    One exception was OUTPUT=PXE, where the output
    was uploaded to OUTPUT_URL in addition to BACKUP_URL,
    but RSYNC_PREFIX was not respected and the
    interpretation of the URL was different:
    A URL of the form
    rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH
    was interpreted as using the rsync protocol,
    while in all other cases such URL would be
    interpreted as using rsync over ssh.
    This special handling is now removed:
    An rsync OUTPUT_URL with OUTPUT=PXE
    now creates the RSYNC_PREFIX directory
    at the destination and the URL is interpreted
    as in all other cases.
    ...
    Refactor rsync URL support, fixes rsync OUTPUT_URL:
    The code to parse rsync:// URLs was BACKUP_URL specific.
    If one specified BACKUP=RSYNC and an OUTPUT_URL
    different from BACKUP_URL, the OUTPUT_URL was ignored
    and the output files went to BACKUP_URL.
    Fix by introducing generic functions
    for rsync URL parsing and use them
    for both BACKUP_URL and OUTPUT_URL,
    as appropriate.
    Replace all uses of global RSYNC_* variables
    derived from BACKUP_URL by those functions.
    There also was inconsistent special handling
    for OUTPUT=PXE which is now removed:
    An rsync OUTPUT_URL with OUTPUT=PXE now creates
    the RSYNC_PREFIX directory at the destination
    and the URL is interpreted as in all other cases.
    See https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831
    and https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781

For details and background information  
about the reasoning behind those changes  
you may have a look the issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781)  
and the pull request  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831)

FYI:  
I am not a rsync user (and not at all a PXE user)  
so I can not much help with rsync issues  
(and I can not at all help with PXE issues)  
but others here may help (as their time permits).

Re **Note 1** : that's real and is one of the many oddities I noticed
(but not fixed) when working on PR \#2831 , see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831\#issuecomment-1170105155](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831#issuecomment-1170105155)
(the 4th bullet point).

Re **Note 2** : you need to add the file to the rescue system using
`COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/rsync.pass )`. This is sort of expected; I am afraid
it is not feasible to make it so automated that it would detect what
files you refer to and add them by itself.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your prompt help here.  
It is much appreciated!

@oldunclez generally I have found that the rsync-over-ssh seems to be
better supported and tested than rsyncd. See the third bullet point in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831\#issuecomment-1170105155](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831#issuecomment-1170105155)
that might affect you. Please check whether the solution for Note 2
works for you and if yes I will change the topic of the issue to cover
only Note 1.

For note 1 @jsmeix ,thank you for your reply .

For note2  
@pcahyna , I agree that people should set COPY\_AS\_IS+=(
/etc/rsync.pass ) manually .  
I prefer "rsyncd" instead of "rsync-over-ssh" , because I don't want to
place a SSH private key in any hosts.

@oldunclez I then consider **note 2** solved and focus only on **note
1**. I think the only solution is to disable the reporting of disk space
used and disk full entirely in the case of the rsync protocol. I think
that it would not be reported correctly anyway, because the "path" in
the case of the rsync protocol is actually a module name and one can't
now which actual path on the server the module name refers to (it
depends on the server configuration), so there is no way to construct
the correct `df` or `du` command.

About the ssh connection we found a w/a adding these lines in local.conf

    check_remote_df() { echo 0 ; }
    check_remote_du() { echo 0 ; }
    readonly -f check_remote_df
    readonly -f check_remote_du

@fadamo wow, I have not thought about a possibility of such a
workaround, thanks for sharing it!

Thank you for all your reply.  
It is a good news that people can customize his code in local.conf
without modifying the "offical" shell script files.

@oldunclez

regarding etc/rear/local.conf and other config files  
see the comment in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)  
which reads (excerpts)

    # ReaR reads the configuration files via the bash builtin command 'source'
    ...
    # Because 'source' executes the content as bash scripts you can run commands
    # within your configuration files ...
    ...
    # ... gets always executed when 'rear' is run
    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.

Regarding `"offical" shell script files`:

There is no such thing as "offical" scripts in ReaR  
that should be considered as "sacrosanct" by users.

Relax-and-Recover is intentionaly written entirely  
in the native language for system administration  
as shell (bash) scripts because experienced users  
and system admins can and should adapt or extend  
the ReaR scripts if needed to make things work  
for their specific cases.  
Additionally - if the worst comes to the worst - even  
temporary quick and dirty workarounds are relatively  
easily possible - provided one knows ReaR and  
one's own system well so that one is prepared  
for appropriate manual ad hoc intervention.

Things could be different when you use a ReaR software  
package from some vendor like a Linux distributor.  
Then in case of issues you should at least tell their  
support people if and what you have manually modified.  
In particular regarding SUSE see the section  
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
