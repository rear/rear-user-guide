-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Debian
    GNU/Linux 5.0 \\n \\l

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I try p2v of a physical machine with debian 5, software raid and
    lvm. Mkbackup works without problems. Restore on kvm (also tested
    restore on real hardware) is not working. I get the following
    error:  
    ERROR: BUG BUG BUG! Disk /dev/hda is not a block device  
    Any ideas?

Do what the log file recommends:

<pre>
HINT: If you can reproduce the issue, try using the -d or -D option !
</pre>

In general see the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover (rear)" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think the "Disk /dev/hda is not a block device." message  
comes from the create\_disk() function in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
therein the code

<pre>
    [[ -b "$disk" ]]
    BugIfError "Disk $disk is not a block device."
</pre>

I.e. in your target system /dev/hda is not a block device.

When you are in the recovery system before you run  
"rear recover" inspect your target system and verify that  
the contens of your var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
are appropriate for what there actually is in your  
target system.

In general regarding migration:

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
(or from physical to virtual hardware) does not "just work".

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
that would do the annoying legwork for you.

To migrate a system onto different hardware you usually  
have to adapt your disklayout.conf from the "old" system  
to make it appropriate for the "new" system.

For an example you may have a look at the  
"P2V HP microserver to VmWare" issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943)

To mitigate the annoying migrating legwork a bit,  
I recommend the newest rear GitHub master code that provides  
some first steps for RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL support.

See default.conf how RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL is meant to work:  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/dev/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/dev/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

For an example how RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL works see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-236547810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-236547810)

But when you use the latest rear master code see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-237544630](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-237544630)  
what is special about the disklayout.conf file location  
in the recovery system that you must consider  
to make RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL work.

@jandoe88 I guess your missing the right kernel module for the disk
devices on the target system (due to the p2v move). If you know which
kernel module it is, you have to make sure it is copied on the source
system (via LOAD\_MODULES) during the creation of the rear ISO image.

Or /dev/hda may not at all exist on the new system.

On virtual machines the device node for a virtual harddisk  
could be something like "/dev/vda", cf. the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover (rear)" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

E.g. on my SLES12-SP2-RC2 virtual KVM/QEMU machine:

<pre>
# test -b /dev/hda || echo no block device
no block device
# ls -l /dev/hda
ls: cannot access '/dev/hda': No such file or directory
</pre>

Hi. Thanks for your help jsmeix and gdha.  
I figured it out, it works now. There were different problems:

1.  The hard disk was shown in dmesg but not in fdisk.  
    Solution: Device in /dev was missing, create it manually  
    mknod /dev/sda b 8 0  
    mknod /dev/sda1 b 8 1  
    mknod /dev/sda2 b 8 2  
    \[...\]
2.  Kernel module for software raid had to be loaded manually:  
    modprobe md
3.  diskrestore.sh had to be changed during recovery:  
    echo "Y" | mdadm --create /dev/md0 --force --metadata=00.90  
    to  
    echo "Y" | mdadm --create /dev/md0 --force --metadata=0.90

After that, the recovery worked as expected :)

Best regards,  
Jan

@jandoe88  
many thanks for your feedback what the actual issue was  
in your particular case and how you got it working!

@gdha  
I think in this case

<pre>
BugIfError "Disk $disk is not a block device."
</pre>

is not the right kind of error.  
In migration mode it should be

<pre>
StopIfError "Disk $disk is not a block device."
</pre>

because in migration mode that issue is  
(with probability one) not a bug in rear.
