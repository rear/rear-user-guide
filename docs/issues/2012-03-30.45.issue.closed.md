Currently after recovering to a new system, only for Debian and SuSE the
initrd is being recreated in order to support hardware changes. We need
to extend this to other distributions (Arch, Gentoo) based on the
supported infrastructure.

-   finalize/Gentoo/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh
    -   needs to be written, I have no idea what should be done here
        (since I don't have Gentoo)

Move RHEL and Fedora to issue \#50 (which will be resolved for rear
v1.13.0 release)

so far no-one asked for this - move milestone to 'rear future'
