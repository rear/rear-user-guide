@gozora Does this issue ring any bell with you?

Hello @gdha,

Thanks for my first assigned issue! :-)

Yes, it does ring a bell,
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/849\#issuecomment-227459162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/849#issuecomment-227459162)).  
When talking about dependencies, this one is similar to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1198](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1198).

In my opinion, satisfy all dependencies we would need to install ALL
programs ReaR is supporting, which is just waste. Because during
installation of ReaR we basically don't know what backup type will be
used. :-(  
Not talking about solving nightmare where different distributions are
using different names with different content...

This specific case is mentioned in
[docu](https://github.com/rear/rear#requirements), but yes, who is
reading documentation nowadays?

Currently only idea I have, is something like `rear configcheck` which
would check user created configuration and inform him about possibly
missing packages ...

V.

I think it is perfectly right and o.k. when  
"rear mkbackup/mkrescue" errors out  
with a meaningful error message in such cases.

When the user gets something like

<pre>
Error: '/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst': No such file or directory.
</pre>

he is sufficiently informed what is missing.

Only an offhanded further comment:

I don't think a new workflow "configcheck" is needed.  
I think during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
all needed checks should be done.

See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892)  
and in particular note  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755\#issuecomment-171603580](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755#issuecomment-171603580)  
and subsequent comments.  
I.e. for me "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" did not error out  
if a program in REQUIRED\_PROGS does not exist.  
I think during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" according to the  
values in /etc/rear/local.conf the REQUIRED\_PROGS array  
should be extended and if something is missing  
"rear mkbackup/mkrescue" should error out.

For specific required files an additional array REQUIRED\_FILES  
might be useful where each array member is a list of files  
separated by space where one of them must be present  
so that one can specify AND and OR conditions like

<pre>
REQUIRED_FILES=( '/path1/foo' '/path2/this /path3/that' '/path4/bar' )
</pre>

which means that those files must exist  
/path1/foo  
AND  
/path2/this OR /path3/that  
AND  
/path4/bar

OK - we mark this one as **won't fix** then. I'll update the according
RH bugzilla with our decision.  
The following text was added to the RHBZ:  
*Using UEFI is not by default the standard boot mechanism, and
therefore, we do not advise to add this rpm requirement to the rear spec
file.  
If needed a prep script can be added or enhanced to capture this
short-coming. Your input is more then welcome - here and in the upstream
story*

[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1492177](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1492177)
explains how RH fixed the issue via a simple script:  
I propose the following change: add a file
`usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/249_check_rhel_grub2_efi_package.sh`
with this content:

    # 249_check_rhel_grub2_efi_package.sh

    is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return    # empty or 0 means NO UEFI

    (
        VERBOSE=1
        test -r /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst
        PrintIfError "WARNING: /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst not found, grub2-mkimage will likely fail. Please install the grub2-efi-x64-modules package to fix this."
    )

Output of "rear mkrescue" with this change:

**WARNING: /usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/moddep.lst not found, grub2-mkimage
will likely fail. Please install the grub2-efi-x64-modules package to
fix this.  
ERROR: Error occurred during grub2-mkimage of BOOTX64.efi  
Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-localhost.log for
details**

Note from @gdha : if we decide to add this we should verify the OS
version - probably only a script meant for RHEL

At least on openSUSE Leap 15.0 (probably on all SUSE systems)  
the directory is not `/usr/lib/grub/` but `/usr/lib/grub2/`  
so that the test should be  
`test -r /usr/lib/grub*/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst`

In current ReaR we have the `LogPrintError` function  
for messages that should appear in the log file and also  
on the user's terminal regardless whether or not the  
user launched 'rear' in verbose mode.

Finally I think we should better error out here because  
I assume it cannot work on UEFI without the GRUB2 `moddep.lst` file,
cf.

In general I do not like to have one kind of functionality  
split into pieces and spread over several scripts  
(because it makes it harder to maintain that particular  
functionality as a whole).

Accordingly I implemented all test for the prerequirements  
to make a bootable EFI image of GRUB2 at the one same place  
where the bootable EFI image of GRUB2 is actually made in the  
`build_bootx86_efi` function via

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2013](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2013)
merged  
this issue should be sufficiently solved:

Now it errors out if no `/usr/lib/grub*/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst`  
file is found with

<pre>
ERROR: grub2-mkimage would not make bootable EFI image of GRUB2
(no /usr/lib/grub*/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst file)
</pre>

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2013\#issue-242669421](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2013#issue-242669421)

In general when some program or file is missing, we try to tell what is
missing  
but often things will just fail with a generic system error because we
cannot  
check all and every preconditions, cf. the section about  
"No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If we detect something is missing, we will not tell the user what
software package  
(e.g. a rpm or deb package or whatever else) he must install to get the
missing piece  
because we cannot continuously track and maintain for all those various
kind  
of different Linux distributions what particular software package
provides  
what program or file in what version of each Linux distribution.
