##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): **N/A**

-   How was this pull request tested? openSUSE Leap 15.1 Baremetal via
    USB rescue medium

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Up until now while recover from Borg backup it shows all rear archives
to the user to select from. That can be a very long list with hundreds
of archives. Only the last items are visble.

With this PR a number (configurable, default is 10) of recent commits is
shown. A option is added for the user to set that a next set (default
10) of older archives is presented to the user. If all available
archives are shown, and the user didn't select anything valid, we cycle
through available archives again from the beginning.

More over output format was adjusted a little bit: before it was
something like `[<NR>] <ARCHIVE_NAME> <DATE> ...`, we change it to
`[<NR>] <DATE> <ARCHIVE_NAME>`, since archive names are not fixed with
their width, that was resulting in not aligned output. `<DATE>` has
fixed width, so last column with archive name takes then whatever space
the name needs.

Hello @jsmeix,  
I know that you are not Borg user (although one day you you will
certainly run out of disk space and start using it :-) ), but could you
please take a quick look here if you don't see anything obviously wrong?

Thanks

V.

Good idea. However I used value `0` to disable pagination, because
showing zero entries doesn't make sense imho.

I also tested, that `BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER >= 0` in
prep step.

My original attempt to change the order of shown entries (from newest to
oldest), I reverted back to from oldest to newest, so that in case
pagination is disabled, even with a lot of entries, the newest ones are
shown last and are visible to the user, as to resemble behaviour before
my PR.

If `BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER` is set to a positive
number, then show archives starting with
`<NEWEST> - BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER + 1` to `<NEWEST>`
with pagination enabled.

EDIT:  
In case `BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER` is set to a number
greater or equal to the number of available archives, pagination is
effectively also disabled. But for disabling pagination by the user,
setting to zero should be the way to go, since otherwise you have to
know the number of available archives before, and the number of archives
will also change over time, when backups are made.

Instead of the
`if [[ $BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER -eq 0 ]];` clause
setting
`$BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER=$(( archive_cache_lines ))` in
case `BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER=0` before the while
loop,should do the same, since the code in the current else clause
should handle properly that case then.

But either way there is a `if` construct, so I would just leave the PR
like it is now, if no other objections/opinions about that.

On a second thought, using same code, just resetting
`BORGBACKUP_RESTORE_ARCHIVES_SHOW_NUMBER` to the number of available
archives `$archive_cache_lines` seems cleaner and better imho.

Added commit 779ee6dfcf10b0e1d6a543fb0f5c9dbedd84bdb5.

Tested with pagination and without it (disabled: set to zero). Both
worked liked expected.

@gozora  
don't worry because of my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2402\#issuecomment-633508778](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2402#issuecomment-633508778)

I will have a look here for generic "possibly suspicious code".

What I cannot review is whether or not Borg related code  
does actually do what is intended because as non-Borg user  
I do not understand how Borg behaves.

When this part of the code is already reviewed currently, just one
question. This particular `break` for the `while` loop after the `Error`
seems to me dead code? As it is never reached, because with the `Error`
it would leave with that `Error` already? Or it has to be there for some
reasons? @jsmeix @gozora

Correct, I guess the `break` statement can be removed since `Error` will
exit the code either way.

Tried to work on all your suggestions.

@flyinggreenfrog I'll not have time to do review today. I need to
postpone until tomorrow.

Sorry for that!

No problem, take your time.

Everything works fine for me.  
If there are no further objections I'll merge this PR later today.
