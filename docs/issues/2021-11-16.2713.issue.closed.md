I changed a lot for output=USB the last 1-2 month so the version from 21
Apr is a bit on the old side. Try using a newer master version please -
your issue may have been fixed.  
For the older version the `--efi ` in format is correct.

@epaiser Try the deb package from
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/xUbuntu\_18.04/amd64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/xUbuntu_18.04/amd64/)
which was build this week. This contains the updated USB format code.

The latest version solve the problem I have.  
But it didn't to work to save the system and restore to a different  
machine with different hardware (Supermicro -&gt; ASUS Motherboard).  
I will investigate more.  
Thank you anyway!!

@epaiser Did you already try to add `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` in your
local.conf file? However, there is no guarantee this will have the
desired behavior on different HW.

`MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` is in default.conf since ReaR version 2.5  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
and @epaiser got the matching "rear mkrescue" message

    Copying all kernel modules in /lib/modules/5.4.0-90-generic (MODULES contains 'all_modules')

so the recreating on different hardware failure has a different cause.

@epaiser  
in general see in particular the section  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

E.g. I think it cannot "just work" to switch from a SATA disk to a NVMe
disk  
because the kernel device name changes from /dev/sda to /dev/nvme0n1  
but ReaR stores kernel device names in
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
so one has to manually adapt that file and likely some other files
like  
var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf  
var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt  
var/lib/rear/layout/diskdeps.conf  
to make "rear recover" work on replacement hardware with a NVMe disk  
when "rear mkrescue" was run on original hardware with a SATA disk.  
I don't know how far ReaR's MIGRATION\_MODE helps in this case  
because I never migrated from SATA to NVMe myself.

I guess the issue is meanwhile sufficiently solved  
where "sufficiently" could also mean it was found  
that migration is not possible with reasonable effort  
in this case.
