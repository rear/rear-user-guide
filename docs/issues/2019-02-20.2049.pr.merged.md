@gdha  
while you are at it I would like to suggest to replace in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/310\_migrate\_udev\_rules.sh

    cp $v "$rule" $TARGET_FS_ROOT/"$rule" >&2
    StopIfError "Could not copy '$rule' -> '$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$rule'"

with

    # Do not error out at this late state of "rear recover" (after the backup was restored) but inform the user:
    cp $v "$rule" "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$rule" || LogPrintError "Failed to copy '$rule' to '$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$rule'"

cf.

@rmetrich Will tis little fix be included in the RHEL rear-2.0 or
rear-2.4 release?

@gdha I don't think so, not now at least, we had no customer facing
this.

@pcahyna is dealing with RHEL ReaR package.

I don't remember any report about ReaR on VMware. I suspect ReaR is most
used on physical machines or LPARs.  
How does the problem manifest itself? Is it loss of network connectivity
in the rescue system?

@pcahyna @rmetrich Within the Johnson & Johnson group we have quite a
few VMware systems suffering from this missing file in the udev rule (at
least from systems build with RHEL 7.2 or 7.3):  
*During the recovery we had issues with:*

    LAN interface name being ens192 instead of "eno16780032"
    LAN interface name being ens224 instead of "eno33559296"

In a following up session we modified

    RULE_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/*persistent*{names,net}.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/*eno-fix.rules )

in script
`skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh`
which activated LAN interface migration questions during the recovery
booting and we could apply our IP addresses on the new interfaces
correctly.  
Our DR recovery went fluent afterwards.

Ah, so the network interfaces will have different names in the rescue
system. Is that really a problem after @rmetrich's \#2004 is integrated?

@pcahyna **yes**, as the `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-eno-fix.rules` overrules
the ifcfg files.  
However, if we remove the `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-eno-fix.rules` via
`BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/90-eno-fix.rules )`
setting in the `local.conf` then **no**  
So, if you let me know in which release of RHEL rear the \#2004 will be
included we can fix this via our internal rear chef cookbook.

Does that mean that (with \#2004 and without this PR) the rescue system
will work, but the restored system will be wrongly configured? I.e. even
with \#2004 included, we should include this PR?

We intend to include \#2004 in the next update.

Yes that is what we discovered. My advise would be to include it as it
targets only a small group of VMware users and cannot do any harm for
the others

Great news.

I can not reproduce the underlying issue on VMWare ESXi 5.5 btw. in RHEL
7.2 using the vmxnet3 driver. The network interface is called ens192
instead of eno *something*.

This approach of adding special cases to the code does not seem to be
well maintainable. Would it be possible to recreate the host
configuration in the rescue system as faithfully as possible by adding
everything under /etc/udev/rules.d/ ?

@pcahyna if you want to simulate the behavior under your test
environment you can do the following:

cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts  
mkdir backup

cp ifcfg-ens224 backup  
ethtool -P ens224  
mv ifcfg-ens224 ifcfg-eno33559296

cp ifcfg-ens192 backup  
ethtool -P ens192  
mv ifcfg-ens192 ifcfg-eno16780032

vi ifcfg-eno33559296  
and comment the line starting with HWADDR  
and rename ens224 into eno33559296

vi ifcfg-eno16780032  
and comment the line starting with HWADDR  
and rename ens192 eno16780032

cd /etc/udev/rules.d/  
vi 90-eno-fix.rules  
\[expected output\]

       # This file was automatically generated on systemd update
       SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:50:56:9b:99:d6", NAME="eno16780032"
       SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:50:56:9b:89:98", NAME="eno33559296"

     ==> change MAC addresses of two lines with above info from 'ethtool' command

Reboot the system
