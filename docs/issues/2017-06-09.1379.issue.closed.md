@genghongxiang  
if I understand your brief description of the issue correctly  
ReaR errors out for you in FindStorageDrivers () with  
the error message

<pre>
FindStorageDrivers called but STORAGE_DRIVERS is empty and no builtin storage modules found
</pre>

STORAGE\_DRIVERS is set in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/230\_storage\_and\_network\_modules.sh  
and in  
usr/share/rear/verify/GNU/Linux/230\_storage\_and\_network\_modules.sh  
(which is a symbolic link to the former) via

<pre>
STORAGE_DRIVERS=( $( find_modules_in_dirs /lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION/kernel/drivers/{block,firewire,ide,ata,md,message,scsi,usb/storage} ) )
</pre>

To find out why this results an empty STORAGE\_DRIVERS array  
in your particular case one needs to inspect the ReaR log file.

Regarding how to get the ReaR log file see  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" see  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Also inspect in the rescue/recovery system what  
kernel modules are there in /lib/modules  
in your particular case.

Some general information:

STORAGE\_DRIVERS is related to kernel modules.

Perhaps it helps to explicitly specify which kernel modules  
should be included in the rescue/recovery system  
e.g. include all kernel modules to be on the safe side via

<pre>
MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
</pre>

cf. "MODULES" in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

@genghongxiang  
for further debugging you could also re-run on your  
original system "rear -d -D mkbackup/mkrescue" with

<pre>
KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
</pre>

in your etc/rear/local.conf file and then inspect if the contents  
of your $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/  
look o.k. - in particular whether or not all needed  
kernel modules are there.

Assuming "no news is good news"  
i.e. the issue is sufficiently answered  
so that it can be closed.
