-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    In migration mode that is likely often even mandatory in practice.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    No URL.  
    The issue is:  
    In migration mode let the user confirm at beginning of finalize
    stage that  
    the up to that point recreated system (i.e. recreated disk layout
    plus restored backup)  
    is o.k. to run the finalize stage (i.e. to recreate the initrd and
    to reinstall the bootloader).  
    For example in case of a changed disk layout certain config files  
    that were restored from the backup could contain outdated content  
    which may need manual adaptions before the initrd gets recreated  
    and the bootloader gets reinstalled.  
    In particular in case of a changed disk layout the restored
    etc/fstab  
    is usually outdated and needs to be manually adapted to get  
    the recreated system ready to run the scripts of the finalize stage.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Migrating SLES12 with its default btrfs structure to XFS.  
    Without that confirmation at beginning of finalize stage  
    the initrd gets recreated based on the outdated content  
    of the restored etc/fstab so that after "rear recover" one must  
    manually again recreate initrd and reinstall the bootloader  
    after one had manually adapted the restored etc/fstab  
    to the new XFS filesystem.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The additional migation mode confirmation at beginning of finalize
    stage  
    is implemented in the new
    finalize/default/020\_confirm\_finalize.sh  
    and the existing finalize/default/010\_prepare\_checks.sh was  
    moved to finalize/default/050\_prepare\_checks.sh to ensure  
    the new 020\_confirm\_finalize.sh is the very first finalize script.

@schabrolles  
with this additional confirmation at beginning of finalize stage  
I was able to adapt the restored outdated etc/fstab during "rear
recover"  
so that ReaR recreats initrd and reinstalls the bootloader  
based on correct etc/fstab content and this way  
migrating SLES12 from its default btrfs to XFS  
"just worked" straightforward for me.

I "just merged" it because things work so well for me  
and I like to have that one in current master code for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1745\#issuecomment-373055597](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1745#issuecomment-373055597)

Of course - as usual - I will fix bugs that appear because of my
changes.
