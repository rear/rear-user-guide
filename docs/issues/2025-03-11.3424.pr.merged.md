-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**

There will be regressions when third-party scripts  
use '.' for sourcing because currently sourcing via '.'  
is always forbidden in ReaR.

I would like to wait a bit and see if sourcing via '.'  
is sometimes actually needed in practice.  
If sourcing via '.' is sometimes needed,  
I will further enhance things to make sourcing via '.'  
again possible for the user by explicitly specifying  
in another config array which specific file paths  
he allows to be sourced via '.' by ReaR,

I tested "rear recover".

So for me on a SLES15-SP6 test VM  
(with the SLES15 default btrfs structure)  
"rear mkrescue" plus "rear mkbackuponly"  
and then on another same test VM "rear recover"  
"just worked" - i.e. with the defaults for  
TRUSTED\_OWNERS and TRUSTED\_PATHS.

I use this etc/rear/local.conf  
(with the usual settings for the SLES15 default btrfs structure)

As far as I understand it  
the currently failing checks

    testing-farm:centos-stream-8-x86_64 — Failed to provision test environment.
    Please check https://status.testing-farm.io for possible outages.
    If the situation persists after retrying, please report an issue.

    testing-farm:centos-stream-9-x86_64 — Failed to provision test environment.
    Please check https://status.testing-farm.io for possible outages.
    If the situation persists after retrying, please report an issue.

show on [https://status.testing-farm.io](https://status.testing-farm.io)
the reason

    Public Ranch Outage - bug in security groups cleanup.
    ...
    This issue is not resolved yet

So it seems the reason for those currently failing checks  
is outside of the ReaR environment - in particular the  
reason is not the code changes in this pull request.

@schlomo @gdha @pcahyna  
please have a look here - as time permits.

For the new script that combines  
lib/\_input-output-functions.sh and lib/framework-functions.sh  
I chose the name `_framework-setup-and-functions.sh`  
because the shorter name `_framework-functions.sh` would be  
misleading because in contrast to the other `...functions.sh` scripts  
this special `_...` script does not only define framework functions  
but also does some framework setup actions so it does both  
framework setup and defining framework functions, in particular  
input-output functions (from \_input-output-functions.sh)  
and sourcing functions (from framework-functions.sh).

@rear/contributors  
as noone objected against my chosen name  
`_framework-setup-and-functions.sh`  
I will now change all ReaR scripts that mention  
the old name `_input-output-functions.sh` (usually in comments)  
to show the new name `_framework-setup-and-functions.sh`

@rear/contributors  
I need your help regarding how to properly use

    [[ ... =~ ... ]]

in particular with variables like

    [[ $foo =~ ...$bar... ]]

My current usage in \_framework-setup-and-functions.sh

    actual_path="$( readlink -e "$file" )" || Error "is_trusted_path(): 'readlink -e $file' failed"
    for trusted_path in "${TRUSTED_PATHS[@]}" ; do
        # Skip when trusted_path is empty (otherwise the [[ expression ]] would be falsely true):
        test "$trusted_path" || continue
        [[ $actual_path =~ ^$trusted_path ]] && return 0
    done

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#discussion\_r1992872215](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#discussion_r1992872215)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#discussion\_r1993048851](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#discussion_r1993048851)

This is how `[[ ... =~ ... ]]` is currently used in ReaR

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -oh '\[\[.*=~.*\]\]'

    [[ $latest_tar_restore_file =~ .*/.* ]]
    [[ $latest_tar_restore_file =~ .*/.* ]]
    [[ "$BLOCKCLONE_ALLOW_MOUNTED" =~ ^[nN0] ]]
    [[ $ID_NEW =~ ^dm- ]]
    [[ $1 =~ /dev/mapper/ ]]
    [[ $fs_spec =~ ^/dev/disk/by-id/ ]]
    [[ $DEV_NAME =~ ^dm- ]]
    [[ $1 =~ /dev/disk/by-id ]]
    [[ $major_version =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]
    [[ $BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX =~ [^a-zA-Z0-9] ]]
    [[ "\$REPLY" =~ ^[Yy1] ]]
    [[ "$UDEV_UID_LED" =~ ^[yY1] ]]
    [[ "$UDEV_UID_LED" =~ ^[yY1] ]]
    [[ "$DEVPATH" && "$UDEV_SUSPEND" =~ ^[yY1] ]]
    [[ "$UDEV_BEEP" =~ ^[yY1] ]]
    [[ $disk_name =~ ^dm- ]]
    [[ "$name" =~ ^mapper/ ]]
    [[ "$name" =~ ^dm- ]]
    [[ ${device_name: -1} =~ [0-9] ]]
    [[ "$test_ip" =~ $ip_pattern ]]
    [[ $length =~ [^0-9] ]]
    [[ $BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK =~ ^[yY1] && "$(basename ${BACKUP_PROG})" = "tar" ]]
    [[ "$BLOCKCLONE_ALLOW_MOUNTED" =~ ^[nN0] ]]

Currently I use totally unquoted

    [[ $actual_path =~ ^$trusted_path ]]

which seems to work rather well for me, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#discussion\_r1993048851](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#discussion_r1993048851)

But probably I should better use

    [[ "$actual_path" =~ ^$trusted_path ]]

or

    [[ "$actual_path" =~ ^"$trusted_path" ]]

which also work for me, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#discussion\_r1993048851](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#discussion_r1993048851)

Because "rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackuponly" work for me with

    [[ "$actual_path" =~ ^"$trusted_path" ]]

I use this now to be more on the safe side via

@rear/contributors  
tomorrow I will test it again with all my recent changes  
and if it still works well for my test case, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#issuecomment-2716931938](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#issuecomment-2716931938)

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#issuecomment-2720862367](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#issuecomment-2720862367)  
I did

so I now use the more secure

    [[ "$actual_path" =~ ^"$trusted_path" ]]

instead of totally unquoted

    [[ $actual_path =~ ^$trusted_path ]]

because

    [[ "$actual_path" =~ ^"$trusted_path" ]]

also works for me.

Because "All checks have passed" and because  
it also works for me (as far as I tested it)  
I will merge it as is right now.

This is because of

which results that also `lib/*-workflow.sh` scripts  
get sourced by the Source function in simulation mode  
so that e.g. in `lib/mkrescue-workflow.sh`  
the WORKFLOW\_mkrescue() function is not set.
