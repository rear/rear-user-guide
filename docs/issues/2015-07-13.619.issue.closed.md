The version of rear used is rear ver 1.17.

Also the method of recovery used is Rear Recovery with TSM .

@bibssun could you check within TSM if /run was back-up'ed? Also, when
you are still in recovery mode you could inspect the file systems under
/mnt/local whether all required mount points are present.  
You could verify the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file to see
if /run was a separate mount point?

On my centos7 system I have the following tmpfs file systems:

    tmpfs                          12229932       92  12229840   1% /dev/shm
    tmpfs                          12229932     9276  12220656   1% /run
    tmpfs                          12229932        0  12229932   0% /sys/fs/cgroup

These are temporary file systems and are not tracked in the
disklayout.conf file.

The problem with TSM is that variable `MOUNTPOINTS_TO_RESTORE` gets
defined in script `verify/TSM/default/40_verify_tsm.sh` and afterwards
as the variable is not empty in script
`restore/default/90_create_missing_directories.sh` it will skip the
creation of some critical mount points which are *not* backup'ed by TSM
such as `proc sys tmp dev/pts dev/shm`.  
Furthermore, I noticed that **sys** is missing in this list too.  
Therefore, this is a bug, that needs to be fixed

I think we need to do this in a more generic way and also restore the
moint points with correct ownership and permissions. Therefore, we
should make a *new* script in the prep work-flow and save the output for
later and use it in the restore work-flow as input.

A good starting point for the script could be:  
`$ ls -ld $(mount | grep -vE '(cgroup|fuse|nfs|/sys/)' | awk '{print $3}')`
to get the list of mount points where we need to save the permissions
and ownership

@bibssun feel free to test out the new script committed.
