That will not work.

Reason:

    # SHARE_DIR=usr/share/rear

    # grep 'BACKUP=' $SHARE_DIR/conf/default.conf | grep -v '_' | cut -d= -f2 | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u

so it seems the new test does not find many BACKUP methods  
that are mentioned in default.conf

The reason is indirectly described in my comments in my code before.  
Please do not just remove all those comments but read and understand
them  
so that you can adapt them so that they match the new code and still  
explain to other users what all that stuff is about, cf.  
"Code must be easy to understand" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

The reason is that most external BACKUP methods  
do not implement making a backup (see "man rear")  
but only implement to restore a backup, so

    # ls -1 $SHARE_DIR/restore/

is a better test that still finds all what the test before also found

    # for b in $( grep 'BACKUP=' $SHARE_DIR/conf/default.conf | grep -v '_' | cut -d= -f2 | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u ) ; do ls -1d $SHARE_DIR/restore/$b ; done

@OliverO2  
thank you so much for your continuous testing  
of the current ReaR master code!  
It helps so much to reveal hidden regressions.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e98c8adcd75d043672bbed9564bedef377d9639e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e98c8adcd75d043672bbed9564bedef377d9639e)  
I simplified prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
to make it work more predictable and fail-safe according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353\#issuecomment-606473207](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2353#issuecomment-606473207)

@OliverO2  
thank you for pointing me in the right direction how to improve  
my vague "grep in default.conf" stuff into a more reliable test.

@OliverO2  
I think all you need to do here is to move your  
usr/share/rear/backup/OPALPBA/readme  
to  
usr/share/rear/restore/OPALPBA/readme  
and remove your changed prep/default/035\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
from this pull request.

@OliverO2  
according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2352](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2352)  
`The BACKUP method 'INTERNAL' is not known to ReaR`  
I wonder if you may also need a  
usr/share/rear/restore/INTERNAL/readme  
file?

But I cannot find a script where `BACKUP=INTERNAL` is set.  
I even cannot find the word `INTERNAL` in the scripts at all  
so currently I do not understand how the BACKUP variable  
could get the value 'INTERNAL'?

@jsmeix  
Thank you for reviewing, good catch!

Actually, I had read the comments. I removed them as i found them to no
longer correctly describe the actual situation:

> For "rear mkbackup" and also for "rear mkrescue" \[...\]

As we know now, `035_valid_backup_methods.sh` is used in workflows other
than `mkbackup` and `mkrescue`. Even more workflows might be added to
ReaR in the future (without being aware of the above comment). So I did
not want to just extend the above comment, as doing so would not be
future-proof.

Your final solution is just what I was now considering as a fix. Clean
and simple. You were just too fast for my lunch break, and I was too
hungry ;-).

Yes, there is no `INTERNAL` backup method in ReaR as it's just what I'm
using over here. Actually, I have these directories, which integrate
nicely with ReaR updates as there is no common code:

    backup/INTERNAL
    build/INTERNAL
    prep/INTERNAL
    restore/INTERNAL

Configuration is done entirely via one line in `site.conf`:

    BACKUP=INTERNAL

And yes, I'll adapt the PR as suggested right away - hopefully, I won't
get too hungry, too soon again.

With the latest commits to this branch, the fix should be complete. I
have successfully tested the `mkopalpba` workflow.

`prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh`  
is run for those workflows that source the `prep`stage:

    # for w in usr/share/rear/lib/*workflow.sh ; do grep -q 'SourceStage "prep"' $w && echo $( basename $w ) ; done

    mkbackup-workflow.sh
    mkbackuponly-workflow.sh
    mkopalpba-workflow.sh
    mkrescue-workflow.sh

so `mkopalpba` is the only workflow that does not belong to  
the usual "mkbackup/mkrescue" workflows.

I think I even remember when I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8eb72c1d845d2b91fa76f18d47c74454ed5432ec\#diff-0ee6186ad0db8266a03846e3642551e5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8eb72c1d845d2b91fa76f18d47c74454ed5432ec#diff-0ee6186ad0db8266a03846e3642551e5)  
that I had checked the `mkopalpba` workflow but at that time  
I did not see how that workflow will become affected.

@OliverO2  
thank you for the explanation about your `BACKUP=INTERNAL` usage.

I did not get an example from a ReaR user that he actually adapted and  
enhanced ReaR in this way - which is exactly how ReaR is meant to be  
adapted and enhanced as needed by a particular user.

To be more on the safe side I would suggest to use a less generic  
name than `INTERNAL` because who knows if or when someone  
at ReaR upstream may all of a sudden use `BACKUP=INTERNAL`  
for whatever other generic ReaR-internal reason?
