Autoresize partitions is not working:

1.  grep error during autoresize
2.  can not find boot partition to exclude from resize.  
    (it is not reliable to assume that the boot flag in  
    partition table is set.)

I did test this modification in one situation and it solved the problem
for me.

Not sure what the original problem was you were having? Autoresizing was
working for a very long time. Trying to understand why this is
needed....

Some explanation:

file: usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/40\_autoresize\_disks.sh

Line 34,35: The "/boot" partition to exclude from resizing will not be
found if the boot-flag in the partition table isn't set. Setting the
boot-flag in Linux is not mandatory (it is originally for Microsoft
OS's).  
That's why it is not a good idea to test on the 6th field of the
disklayout.conf file.  
What I do is testing for "fs <mountpoint>" which is more reliable.

Line 45: Booting the rescue ISO gave a "GREP" syntax error

Ok thanks for the clarification. Will merge it, but it needs some
broader tests so we're sure it works on all supported Linux versions.
