I would like to store system backup in local file system first by using
"rear" and then transfer the outputs to centralized backup server with
in-house script. As a result, I make two copy of Linux system image.

My question is How to perform system restore ISO image from remote
server?

### local.conf

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://192.168.1.50/var/crash/rear/  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///fsbackup/  
EXCLUDE\_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE\_RECREATE\[@\]}" "fs:/tmp" "fs:/media"  
"fs:/var/tmp" "fs:/mnt" "fs:/var/crash"  
"fs:/sys" "fs:/dev" "fs:/proc" "fs:/fsbackup")  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=

If you copy the 2th copy on a NFS server then you can use that to
restore on a recovery system. You just have to modify to `local.conf`
file entry of `BACKUP_URL` to the new location, e.g.  
`BACKUP_URL=nfs://NFS-server/path-to-rear-images/` before starting the
`rear -v recover` process.

To further automate the process you could actually have Bash code in
your `local.conf` that sets `BACKUP_URL` differently depending on
running during recovery or during backup.

Since ReaR is a very simple Bash-based framework it should be also
simple for you to integrate your in-house script into ReaR to
automatically transfer away the backup after creating it locally.

If you do both you will be rewarded with the full automation that ReaR
can provide while still using your internal procedures.

Dear gdha,

I used above setting of local.conf. The implementation results are ..

1.  The system backup in local file system
2.  The rescue ISO image is stored in NFS server.

However, when I used the rescue ISO image for system recovery, the
source of system backup is pointed to file:///fsbackup.

Samson
