Hello @abbbi,

Do you know if this system was upgraded from older (SLES12, SLES11) or
clean installed ?  
Can you provide content of /var/lib/rear/layout/xfs ?

Thanks

V.

problem is that swidth is set to 0:

-d sunit=64 -d swidth=0

data stripe width (0) must be a multiple of the data stripe unit (64)

working around by setting -d swidth=64 in diskrestore.sh

System was freshly installed from scratch.

Thanks,  
I'll try to reproduce this problem, maybe I've forgotten about yet
another XFS special case in
[filesystems-functions.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/filesystems-functions.sh#L37)

Another interesting thing is that it also trys to mount with mount
option -o sunit=64, so one has to remove this from the mount command
line in diskrestore.sh aswell. I endet up removing the -d sunit=64 -d
swidth=0 options from the mkfs.xfs command and the mount option and was
able to recover the system then.

Unfortunately it was a customer system which im not remote anymore. I
tried to reproduce on a SLES15 system in house on PPC, and it seems the
sunit=8 setting on the other system is already an difference. My XFS
filesystem (created by the standard sles15 installation) looks like:

    meta-data=/dev/sda3              isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=404544 blks
             =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
             =                       crc=1        finobt=1 spinodes=0 rmapbt=0
             =                       reflink=0
    data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=1618176, imaxpct=25
             =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
    naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
    log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=2560, version=2
             =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
    realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

Probably thats some SAP related filesystem options.

These options are probably auto detected by mkfs during filesystem
creation. As the system uses Multipath SAN disks only, i think the xfs
tools might suspect other options than on a regular filesystem:

[http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS\_FAQ\#Q:\_How\_to\_calculate\_the\_correct\_sunit.2Cswidth\_values\_for\_optimal\_performance](http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_How_to_calculate_the_correct_sunit.2Cswidth_values_for_optimal_performance)

honestly its the first time i see these options used too :)

Never mind.  
It looks like XFS introduced some new features,.. Happens quite a lot.

Can you tell me what version of XFS is used on SLE15 ? ( I'm
unfortunately still missing such VM in my collection.)

its

but as i can see the filesystem sh already has some logic caring about
stuff like this:

@abbbi  
is that system really a plain usual "SLES15 on PPC" i.e.  
"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15" on PPC or is it perhaps  
"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 GA",  
e.g. see  
[https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-for-sap-15/](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-for-sap-15/)

I ask because what the YaST installer creates can be different  
depending on the exact product so that e.g. the YaST installer  
on "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 GA"  
might create a XFS with some subtle special differences  
compared to plain usual "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15".

Or was that particular XFS perhaps specifically set up  
by your customer with those special XFS option settings?

Cant say for sure at the moment. It was running SAP HANA so i think
chances are high its the SAP4HANA Release. All i have left at the moment

ReaR XFS code must work regardless of Linux distribution.  
I guess that some new features/rules emerged that must be included into
ReaR, XFS guys are quite progressive when it comes to implementing new
stuff.  
I'm currently installing SLE15 and will suspend my work on EFISTUB for a
while and try to look on this issue in upcoming days, hope it will not
be too much work :-).

Im not sure you will hit this problem with a regular SLE15 installation.
I have various SLES15 systems around that do not have an XFS formatted
with -d sunit=8 -d swidth=0.

I even cannot format an volume using these options to be able to get an
xfs\_info output that causes the problem:

sles15ppcl:~ \# mkfs.xfs -d sunit=8 -d swidth=0 ./myfile  
data stripe width (0) must be a multiple of the data stripe unit (64)  
\[..\]

im not quite sure how it was even possible to format it in that way.

One thing i could imagine is that the volume was created too small and
then has been resized with xfs\_growfs so that the width information
output by xfs\_info doesnt match anymore. Or that the multipath
configuration does something strange resulting in an xfs\_info output
not making sense.

> im not quite sure how it was even possible to format it in that way.

:-) I'm exactly at the same spot right now... Can't create filesystem
where `sunit > 0 and swidth == 0`

> One think i could imagine is that the volume was created too small and

> output by xfs\_info doesnt match anymore.

I'm afraid that this is not possible either, because if you specify
sunit &gt; 0 you must specify swidth as well and swidth must be multiple
of sunit (and can't be 0)  
This is why I was initially asking whether system was upgraded :-),
because there is a chance that older version of xfs-util was used for
formatting (which in theory could allow such combination)

has been around since 2002.  
But the git logs also show some things about misaligment from certain
hardware devices that result in width values not beeing right. At least
its smelling like this (Power, multipath, SAN ..)

One recent commit from xfsprogs:

    commit 99a3f52e337d9c785315e64a599755bc6f7b2118

        mkfs: avoid divide-by-zero when hardware reports optimal i/o size as 0

        Commit 051b4e37f5e (mkfs: factor AG alignment) factored out the
        AG alignment code into a separate function.  It got rid of
        redundant checks for dswidth != 0 since calc_stripe_factors was
        supposed to guarantee that if dsunit is non-zero dswidth will be
        as well.  Unfortunately, there's hardware out there that reports its
        optimal i/o size as larger than the maximum i/o size, which the kernel
        treats as broken and zeros out the optimal i/o size.

not sure we hit an issue in xfs here.  
It seems the version shipped in sles15 still have this issue, as it was
introduced in 2017 and fixed in 2018. Not sure if Suse have backported
this fix. Its too late to stare at more git logs now :)

I have asked at \#xfs in freenode, lets see if i get response.

response from \#xfs

    22:53 <dchinner_> the problem described in that commit was that mkfs crashed because devide by zero, not that it made a filesystem with swidth = 0
    22:54 <dchinner_> before that, mkfs would ignore invalid stripe configs where dswidth was zero
    22:55 <abi`> hm, okey. I still cant imagine how one is able to format with sunit=8,swidth=0.. so i guess it was some auto-detection thing that went wrong.
    22:55 <dchinner_> I doubt we'll ever know what caused swidth=0 to be considered valid
    22:56 <dchinner_> it's a CRC enabled fs, so it had to be an XFS tool that set it that way
    22:56 <dchinner_> I can create the situation manually by editting the superblock with xfs_db
    22:57 <dchinner_> but I cannot make any of the tools or mount options cause it
    22:59 <dchinner_> and, well, I can't mount a filesystem with that config, either
    22:59 <dchinner_> the superblock verifier fires and detects an invalid stripe unit config
    23:00 <dchinner_> one the first read during mount
    23:00 <dchinner_> what kernel does SLES15 run?
    23:01 <abi`> 4.12.14-23-default
    23:02 <dchinner_> yeah, Ok, I added the superblock stripe config verification in 4.18
    23:17 <sandeen> dchinner_, abi` there was also 14c57d50 mkfs.xfs: if either sunit or swidth is nonzero, the other must be as well

here is how to reproduce this situation. The filesystem is only
mountable by older kernels such as on sles15 which do not check
swidth/sunit parameters during mount. This should help to make REAR at
least handle such situations gracefully :)

Hello @abbbi,

From what I've understood from your communication with David,
`sunit=8 swidth=0` can be considered incorrect and we can only guess
how/why it happened.

First I was thinking that ReaR XFS code incorrectly parsed stored output
from xfs\_info but I was wrong. ReaR handled situation correctly and
tried to recreate filesystem as it originally was. This behavior
attracted your attention and you've find out that something is not right
so you can start further investigation on "why XFS changed its behavior
yet another time :-)). At the same time ReaR allowed reasonable fallback
(by editing `diskrestore.sh`) ale let you decide what are the correct
values for your XFS filesystem.  
In general this is how I intended this code should behave.  
Graceful handling of XFS filesystem creation code was present in ReaR
already, where we just blindly run `mkfs.xfs <device>` without
explicitly handling filesystem option. This lead us to quite complex
[issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1208). The one mentioned
include couple other issues, describing various ways of what can go
wrong if you are using graceful handling of XFS filesystem creation.

I've assigned labels *Discuss / RFC* because this topic can be widely
and endlessly discussed :-) and other people might have other opinions
...  
And I've assigned *nor ReaR / Invalid* because of reasons mentioned
previously in this comment, but it can be changed during discussion ;-).

In either way, if you have ideas how current code can be improved don't
hesitate to share them.

V.

I still don't understand if this is a transitioning problem or a
permanent problem. Or is the problem that after the `xfsprogs` update
the output of `xfs_info` contains data (size 0) that is not accepted by
the `mkfs.xfs` program?

Hello @schlomo,  
We don't know it either, in ideal world `sunit=8 swidth=0 blks` should
not be possible ...

In theory `mkfs.xfs` called during installation could allow such option
combination, and it could be upgraded to newer version which does not
allow it any more. But this is pure speculation ...

@gozora  
I do fully agree with your reasoning in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1998\#issuecomment-445149675](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1998#issuecomment-445149675)

By the way (cf. "by the way" below):

We already had some other issues where "rear recover" revealed  
that something was severely broken on the original system.

For an example see my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907\#issuecomment-434218293](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907#issuecomment-434218293)  
which actually belongs to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1927](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1927)  
that reads (excerpt)

<pre>
By setting up a disaster recovery procedure with ReaR
and by verifying that 'rear recover' actually works to
recreate the original system on replacement hardware
one gets "by the way" some kind of confirmation that
the basic setup of the original system is o.k. because
when the basic setup of the original system is broken
it is likely that then it is not possible to recreate such
a broken original system on replacement hardware.

Simply put:
Run 'rear mkbackup' on your original system
and 'rear recover' on your replacement hardware
to verify that your original system is still o.k.
</pre>

In general when someone likes to use ReaR for disaster recovery  
he must set up his original system so that ReaR can recreate it  
but not the other way round because that might only work by luck,  
cf. sections like "Disaster recovery does not just work" and  
"Let's face it: Deployment via the recovery installer is a must" and  
"The limitation is what the special ReaR recovery system can do" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

That SDB article is referenced in our SLE-HA manuals, e.g. cf.  
[https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-15/book\_sleha\_guide/data/sec\_ha\_rear\_more.html](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-15/book_sleha_guide/data/sec_ha_rear_more.html)  
and our SLE-HA manuals also tell very clearly that the user  
must verify in advance that his disaster recovery setup does  
actually work in his particular environment, cf.  
[https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-15/book\_sleha\_guide/data/sec\_ha\_rear\_testing.html](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-15/book_sleha_guide/data/sec_ha_rear_testing.html)

Users who do not do that are not supported,  
at least not officially supported by SUSE, cf. the sections  
"Help and Support" "Feasible in advance" "Hopeless in retrospect" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

But of course we try to help them here at  
ReaR upstream on a voluntary base - and even more:

ReaR is by design prepared to let an experienced admin even deal with
such  
unexpected issues during "rear recover" to be able to successfully
recreate  
his system with some manual intervention even in problematic cases,  
cf. "Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads:

<pre>
Experienced users and system admins can
adapt or extend the ReaR scripts to make it work
for their particular cases and - if the worst comes
to the worst - even temporary quick and dirty
workarounds are relatively easily possible. 
</pre>

Bottom line:  
I think everything worked perfectly well as it should here and  
this issue could be rightfully closed as "perfectly well done".

@gozora for me its some weird case and as we have seen not a problem in
REAR. But if you look closely, there seems to be something messed up in
the REAR part too. The xfs\_info output prints

sunit=8

but rear tries to format with:

-d sunit=64

not sure if that is an error crafted by the fact that swidth=0, but
worth a look anyway, not that we  
overlook some other issue here :)

@abbbi it is a feature ;-)  
if you specify `mkfs.xfs -d sunit=64` you will get `sunit 8` in
xfs\_info output.  
It was great pleasure to write this code I can tell you ;-).

Additional note, because as today this problem striked again at another
customer, again on PowerPC with SLES15.

The introduced MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS property helps during creation of the
filesystems, but one has to make sure that the mount options which are
passed to the volume are the right ones too. It might happen that the
mount options include the sunit=64 option too, resulting in mount
issues:

    mount -o rw,noatime,nodiratime,attr2,nobarrier,inode64,sunit=64,noquota /dev/mapper/vol /mnt/local/vol
    mount: /dev/mapper/vol: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on [...]

So the disklayout.conf has to be edited before recovery too, to get
things working again.
