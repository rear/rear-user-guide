Hi,  
Not sure your configuration directive
`BACKUP_URL=ftp://mx@asu-test/rear/` is correct.  
According
[manual](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc)
only following methods are supported:

    BACKUP_URL=file://
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://
    BACKUP_URL=tape://
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://
    BACKUP_URL=usb://

Hm. I did :

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup/  
OUTPUT\_URL=[ftp://mx@asu-test/rear/](ftp://mx@asu-test/rear/)

Its WORK. Thanks.  
( Sorry did not validate the input path )

This is the reason:

When making the backup.tar.gz  
backup/NETFS/default/10\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh  
calls the mount\_url function as

<pre>
mount_url ftp://mx@asu-test/rear/
</pre>

But in rear/lib/global-functions.sh the mount\_url function is

<pre>
mount_url() {
...
    case $(url_scheme $url) in
        (null|tape|file|rsync|fish|ftp|ftps|hftp|http|https|sftp)
            ### Don't need to mount anything for these
            return 0
            ;;
</pre>

I.e. for BACKUP\_URL=ftp://... nothing gets mounted  
whereto the NETFS backup method would write  
its backup.tar.gz so that the backup.tar.gz gets  
created in the local rear working directory as  
/tmp/rear.Bc8HbPypf7fe4Pn/outputfs/centos6-build/backup.tar.gz

This is just one more case where rear scripts  
proceed "bona fide" without explicit checks  
that everything is o.k.

I think rear scripts should be enhanced to better  
check for unsupported values.

I think in this case the script  
prep/NETFS/default/05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
should be enhanced to check for actually  
supported schemes in BACKUP\_URL.

I will perpare a GitHub pull request...

Sorry you could not be in future versions to add method ftpfs for
BACKUP\_URL ?

For completeness:  
The feature request for 'ftpfs' as BACKUP\_URL is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/843)
this issue here  
is considered to be fixed.

The feature about new/additional 'ftp' scheme  
is done via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/845)

Unfortunately
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/843)
caused a regression,  
see this user report on <rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org>  
(excerpts)

Subject: [rear-users] making bootable ISO
...
when I run:
rear -v mkbackup
I get the following error message:
ERROR: Invalid scheme 'iso' in BACKUP_URL 'iso://backup'
(only nfs cifs usb tape file sshfs are valid)
</pre>

It happened because neither the comments in  
05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
nor the documentstion list all valid schemes  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842\#issuecomment-220548557](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842#issuecomment-220548557)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/843)  
but I missed
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842\#issuecomment-220561307](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842#issuecomment-220561307)
that shows that also an 'iso' scheme works.

this above regression
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842\#issuecomment-222912051](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842#issuecomment-222912051)  
is considered to be fixed.

To all rear users:

Currently only

<pre>
nfs cifs usb tape file iso sshfs
</pre>

are valid schemes for BACKUP\_URL.

If you know about more (hidden) valid BACKUP\_URL schemes  
please report them here.

Many thanks in advance!

For the fun of it:

In prep/RSYNC/default/10\_check\_rsync.sh I found:

<pre>
#### OLD STYLE:
# BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST:PATH           # using ssh (no rsh)
#
# with rsync protocol PATH is a MODULE name defined in remote /etc/rsyncd.conf file
# BACKUP_URL=[USER@]HOST::PATH          # using rsync
# BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using rsync (is not compatible with new style!!!)
#### NEW STYLE:
# BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/PATH    # using ssh
# BACKUP_URL=rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]::/PATH  # using rsync
</pre>

Currently I don't know if those kind of BACKUP\_URL  
are affected by my test in 05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh

FYI:

In usr/share/rear/output/default/95\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
I found (excerpts):

<pre>
LogPrint "Copying resulting files to $scheme location"
case "$scheme" in
    (nfs|cifs|usb|file|sshfs|ftpfs|davfs)
    ...
    (fish|ftp|ftps|hftp|http|https|sftp)
    ...
    (rsync)
    ...
    (*) BugError "Support for $scheme is not implemented yet."
    ;;
esac
</pre>

Perhaps this lists all currently supported schemes in rear.

I still did not investigate what of all those schemes  
are affected by my "check for vaild BACKUP\_URL schemes"  
in 05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh where currently  
only those schemes are vaild (for NETFS):

<pre>
nfs cifs usb tape file iso sshfs ftpfs
</pre>

Interestingly 'tape' is vaild in 05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh  
but not listed in 95\_copy\_result\_files.sh

Questions upon questions ...
