Hello REAR users,

I had this bizzare issue related to rear.

I took a backup of the root disk on a RedHat linux system with IP
192.168.1.150/24 (Server A). The backup was stored in an NFS server with
IP 192.168.1.125/24. I created a new VM and started restoring the rear
backup of server 192.168.1.150/24 on this new VM (Server B). The restore
resulted in the new VM having the same IP 192.168.1.150/24 hence
resulting in an IP conflict.

I was using SSH to connect to the original server (Server A) from my
desktop with IP 192.168.1.200/24. Suddenly the connection dropped to
"Server A" and I saw the message "Apr 8 10:12:47 ServerA sshd\[2448\]:
Address 192.168.1.200 maps to user-pc, but this does not map back to the
address - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!"

I know this is related to the duplicate IP. But what I do not understand
is the process how this error was generated. Because between my desktop
(user-pc 192.168.1.200/24) and ServerA nothing changed. It was just that
there was another server (ServerB) that had the same IP but the error
reported is between user-pc and ServerA.

Can someone able to explain this?

Regards,  
IT-Guy

@IT-Guy-1973  
I had experienced the same or basically the same  
but I am neither a networking expert nor a SSH expert  
so I cannot explain why what seems to be a single  
established ssh TCP connection breaks.  
I guess what seems to be a single established TCP connection  
is not actually a single established TCP connection so the  
duplicate new IP gets somehow noticed.  
I even assume that detection is intentional in ssh to be more safe  
against possibly malicious users in the network that use same IPs.

Some general information FYI:

By default ReaR tries to recreate the original system as much as
possible  
exactly as it was before so the recreated system has the same IP as
the  
originial system had.  
This is because by default the recreated system has the same config
files  
(that are restored "as is" from the backup) as the originial system had.

By default even the ReaR recovery system uses the same IP as the  
originial system had. The reason is that network access should be the  
same as when "rear mkbackup" was run because during "rear recover"  
the same network is usually needed to access the backup to restore it.

But in my test cases all works well for me when I use DHCP in the  
ReaR recovery system via `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2611](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2611)  
(plus `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD` as needed)  
so that there is no IP address conflict while the ReaR recovery system
runs  
and after "rear recover" finished one can still from within the
running  
ReaR recovery system do `chroot /mnt/local` into the recreated system  
and adapt the network config as needed before the recreated system  
is booted.

You may also have a look at "the current workaround to migrate the  
networking setup on the recreated tartget system" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310\#issuecomment-595149640](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310#issuecomment-595149640)

@IT-Guy-1973 That was a normal reaction of SSH as suddenly there were 2
ARP MAC addresses for the same IP address. It is a built-in security ssh
thing.

Thank you, @jsmeix and @gdha for your replies.

I was trying to understand exactly how SSH was rejecting the traffic
from a previously established connection between two computers that did
not have any changes done to the network configurations. The only change
was adding a duplicate IP and SSH should have rejected the new duplicate
IP MAC, not the established ones.

I think the question is sufficiently answered as far as we can here.  
We cannot explain here how exactly ssh is working internally.  
I think you need to ask for that on a ssh developer forum.

Yes, it has. Thank you!! @jsmeix @gdha
