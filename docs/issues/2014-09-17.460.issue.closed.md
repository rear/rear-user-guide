Hi,

I have rear installed on RHEL 6 and experiencing the following issue:

in ip\_addresses I have configured  
eth0 192.168.80.100/18

restore finishes fine but in the ifcfg-eth0 it leaves me with:  
IPADDR='192.168.80.100/18'  
NETMASK=''

When I do a reboot it can't bring the eth0 interface up, because of
misconfigured ifcfg-eth0 file.

Some insight would be appreciated.

Thanks

@kruntas Are you sure it should be eth0? The syntax looks correct to me.
Perhaps, remove the `'` and restart network.

Hi,

original syntax that Red Hat requires is:

TYPE=Ethernet  
ONBOOT=yes  
BOOTPROTO='static'  
IPV6INIT=no  
USERCTL=no  
IPADDR='192.168.80.100'  
NETMASK='255.255.192.0'

After I do a recover, rear changes that file (ifcfg-eth0) and rewrites
it with:  
TYPE=Ethernet  
ONBOOT=yes  
BOOTPROTO='static'  
IPV6INIT=no  
USERCTL=no  
IPADDR='192.168.80.100/18'  
NETMASK=''

when I do a reboot, red hat cannot bring up the interface because it
does not expect  
IPADDR='192.168.80.100/18'  
NETMASK=''

Regards

@kruntas ok - seems like RHEL6 is still using old style (RHEL7/Fedora)
can cope with the new style.
