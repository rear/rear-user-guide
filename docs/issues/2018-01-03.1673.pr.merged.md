Sort layout entries before comparing  
to avoid a falsely detected changed layout.  
This should fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1657](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1657)

Tomorrow I try to also fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1658](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1658)  
but that looks more complicated...

Works well for me and because the checklayout workflow  
is not really critical, I dare to "just merge" it now.
