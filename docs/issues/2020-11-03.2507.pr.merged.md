##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2474

-   How was this pull request tested?

    As AMD graphics hardware was not available on the test system, tests
    were run by mocking as follows:

    -   Add these lines in `usr/share/rear/lib/mkopalpba-workflow.sh`
        after `SourceStage "prep"`:

                LogPrintError "FIRMWARE_FILES=<${FIRMWARE_FILES[*]}>"
                exit

    -   Run `usr/sbin/rear mkopalpba` with default configuration (Intel
        graphics), expect result: `FIRMWARE_FILES=<no>`.

    -   In `default.conf` use these single-line configuration changes:

        -   `FIRMWARE_FILES=( yes )`, expect result:
            `FIRMWARE_FILES=<no>`.
        -   `FIRMWARE_FILES=( a b c )`, expect result:
            `FIRMWARE_FILES=<a b c>`.
        -   `OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES=( one two )`, expect result:
            `FIRMWARE_FILES=<one two>`.

    -   In `usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf`, change grep expression
        `AMD` to `Intel`, expect result: `FIRMWARE_FILES=<amdgpu>`.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    OPAL PBA images only:

    -   Add a required firmware file when AMD graphics hardware is
        present.
    -   Allow setting a PBA-specific firmware configuration via the
        `OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES` configuration variable.

    The issue report \#2474 indicates that a single firmware file is all
    that is required to make a PBA boot with AMD graphics hardware. If
    field testing shows that more changes are necessary, this PR's
    solution should be easy to extend.

@OliverO2  
as always thank you so much for your continuous valuable contributions
to ReaR  
that help so much to make ReaR step by step better and better.

I think it is not right that a single firmware file is all that is
required  
to make a system boot with AMD graphics hardware because on my  
openSUSE Leap 15.1 system `find /lib*/firmware -ipath '*amdgpu*'`  
lists more than 300 firmware files and their names indicate that  
each kind of AMD GPU chips has and needs its own matching firmware  
which is what I would expect for all those many different AMD GPU
chips,  
cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon)

On my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system there are 24MB of AMD GPU firmware
files:

    # du -hs /lib/firmware/amdgpu/
    24M     /lib/firmware/amdgpu/

I hope this is not too much for a PBA?

@jsmeix  
Thank you for the thorough review, it seems to be a bit more tricky than
I had hoped for.

**Note that all of the following only applies to PBA images. Standard
ReaR images will contain the `amdgpu` module and all firmware by
default.**

The PBA image on my Ubuntu 20.04 desktop is about 46 MB (`du -hs`). AMD
firmware looks like this:

    $ du -hs /lib/firmware/amdgpu
    33M     /lib/firmware/amdgpu

On Ubuntu 20.04 the `amdgpu` firmware directory contains 336 files for
30 different GPU models. While we do not know which of those might
trigger the boot-time freeze, at least [some AMD GPUs seem to be
affected](https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo):

> Without this package installed, poor 2D/3D performance is commonly
> experienced. Some GPUs may require firmware to function properly at
> all.

The spec. allows a PBA size up to 128 MB. So we could just throw in that
entire firmware directory here to avoid boot-time freezes. Downside:
Slows down PBA uploading to the device (can take minutes).

Additional notes:

1.  We should not change `FIRMWARE_FILES`: By default (non-PBA), it
    already includes all available files. If the user chose to restrict
    firmware files, we should not override this choice by
    auto-configuration.

2.  With respect to modules, I don't think we need to change anything
    (PBA or non-PBA):

    -   `default.conf` contains `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`, which
        should include the `amdgpu` module automatically.
    -   `usr/share/rear/prep/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/001_configure_workflow.sh`
        contains `MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )` which apparently also
        includes the `amdgpu` module, otherwise the issue \#2474 would
        not have occured as described (the kernel would have never tried
        to load AMD firmware).

With 0a1ba2f3c8fa08de8d5528dc1bb583d94a5eddcc on Ubuntu 20.04 desktop,
the PBA size is

-   **48 MB** for systems without AMD GPU,
-   **59 MB** for systems with AMD GPU.

Looks like we get a good compression ratio on these files in
`initrd.cgz`.

@OliverO2

thank you for your explanatory reply.  
It helped me a lot to avoid a mistake.

I fully agree with your reasoning in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2507\#issuecomment-721820442](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2507#issuecomment-721820442)  
therein in particular

    We should not change FIRMWARE_FILES:
    By default (non-PBA), it already includes all available files.
    If the user chose to restrict firmware files, we should not override this choice by auto-configuration.

Yesterday I was too fast with my (false) conclusion that because of

    /lib/firmware/amdgpu/* firmware files plus the amdgpu kernel module
    are needed in any case to boot the ReaR recovery system
    on systems with AMD-GPU graphics hardware

we should have in ReaR some hardcoded

    if type -p lspci >/dev/null && lspci | grep --quiet ' VGA .*AMD'; then
        MODULES+=( amdgpu )
        FIRMWARE_FILES+=( '*amdgpu*' )

My conclusion is wrong because it would be against what I always
demand:  
"Final power to the user!"

In contrast with such hardcoded things it would be ReaR that has the
final power  
what gets included in the recovery system regardless what the user may
have  
specified in his etc/rear/local.conf.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it today afternoon.

@OliverO2  
I think my argument in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2507\#issuecomment-722241196](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2507#issuecomment-722241196)  
also applies to

    if type -p lspci >/dev/null && lspci | grep --quiet ' VGA .*AMD'; then
        OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES+=( '*/amdgpu/*' )
    fi

which hardcodedly adds amdgpu firmware files regardless what  
the user has specified for OPAL\_PBA\_FIRMWARE\_FILES in his local.conf.

So I wonder if not something like

    if type -p lspci >/dev/null && lspci | grep --quiet ' VGA .*AMD'; then
        # Add amdgup firmware files unless the user has specified to not add any firmware files:
        is_false "$OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES" || OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES+=( '*/amdgpu/*' )
    fi

would be better?

I know this is probably somewhat nitpicking or even over the top  
but I like to understand how OPAL\_PBA\_FIRMWARE\_FILES is meant to be
used.

@jsmeix  
Yes, in general you are right that `OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES+=...` always
extends the user's configuration. In this respect it works more like
`COPY_AS_IS` and others in `usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf`.

If we would like to give the user more control, supporting just a "no
firmware" decision seems insufficient. More likely an expert user would
want to include *some* firmware as in

    OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES=( '*/amdgpu/vega20*' )

To support this, we could choose to enable AMD firmware auto-detection
only if `OPAL_PBA_FIRMWARE_FILES` is empty. The downside would be that
if a user wanted to include some unrelated firmware like
`*/intel-ucode/*`, the user would also have to remember dealing with AMD
GPU quirks, probably without knowing.

The question is, given that

-   the added weight of AMD firmware files is not that significant and
-   those files are only present when an AMD GPU is detected, and
-   the probable outcome of not correctly including AMD firmware is a
    non-booting system,

is it worth it?

@OliverO2  
I will merge it as is because in its current state it is at least "good
enough".  
If further enhancements are needed we can add them as actually needed.
