Here is the text:

Description of problem:  
Once backup is completed (rear mkbackup), customer would like to log
message that "backup complete" with a timestamp and location of the
backup so the result can be inserted into a database.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  
rear-1.17.2-1.el7.noarch

How reproducible:  
Always

Steps to Reproduce:  
Currently there is no provision to log message after successful backup
completion.

Actual results:  
Currently there is no provision to log message after successful backup
completion.

Expected results:  
Have some kind of provision to log message after successful backup
completion only.

Additional info:  
As a temporary hack, I modified /usr/sbin/rear bash script itself to log
such message.

    # Check for and run the requested workflow
    if has_binary WORKFLOW_$WORKFLOW; then
            Log "Running $WORKFLOW workflow"
            WORKFLOW_$WORKFLOW "${ARGS[@]}"
            Log "Finished running $WORKFLOW workflow $BACKUP_URL"
            LogPrint "Finished running $WORKFLOW workflow $BACKUP_URL `date` " <<<<<< Added this line to print any messages and access variables 
    else
            VERBOSE=1
            LogPrint "ERROR: The specified command '$WORKFLOW' does not exist !"
            EXIT_CODE=1
    fi

I have not completely tested above but looks possible to get
notification from here.

Hello, not sure if I've understood all aspects of your problem, but
wouldn't be enough to modify command like:  
`rear mkbackup && echo "$(date) $(hostname): Backup finished." || echo "$(date) $(hostname): Backup failed."`  
?

@phracek And, rear does write a message in:

    [root@client vagrant]# grep rear /var/log/messages 
    Oct 18 06:01:25 localhost yum[10520]: Installed: rear-1.18-177.git201609201246.el7.x86_64
    Oct 18 10:38:45 localhost rear[8005]: DONE: rc=0

after each run (as you see). Your proposal only writes a message in the
rear log itself.

In its current form I cannot accept it, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1023\#issuecomment-251369333](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1023#issuecomment-251369333)

If the customer request is actually valid in general  
it needs to be implemented in a generally working way,  
in particular the kind of final reporting message must be  
configurable via a variable that is described in default.conf  
and by default it must be empty to behave backward compatible.

If the customer request is actually valid in general  
I am thinking about an array variable that lists those  
variables that will be printed as final reporting message  
e.g. in /etc/rear/local.conf something like

<pre>
FINAL_REPORT_VARIABLES=( WORKFLOW BACKUP_URL )
</pre>

and in /usr/sbin/rear at the end something like

<pre>
if test $FINAL_REPORT_VARIABLES ; then
    LogPrint "Final report:"
    for v in ${FINAL_REPORT_VARIABLES[@]} ; do
        LogPrint "$v : ${!v}"
    done
fi
</pre>

But currently I am wondering if the customer request is actually valid  
because when /usr/sbin/rear only prints some variable values  
it means basically nothing at all whether or not the reported stuff  
was actually successful.  
It only means that /usr/sbin/rear somehow reached the end  
and prints some variable values.  
Is this really what the customer wants?  
Or does the customer want to know if it was actually successful?

FYI why it means basically nothing  
when /usr/sbin/rear reached its end,

Please reference
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/991](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/991)
for my initial issue, that will help explain a lot of what I am trying
to do here.

What I am proposing, instead of hijacking the umount command like I have
in the past (which worked great up to and including rear v1.15) is to
add a new variable we can define in local.conf or site.conf that gets
executed at the very end of the backup, so that I can use internal rear
variables such as:

"$NETFS\_URL/${NETFS\_PREFIX}/${BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE}${BACKUP\_PROG\_SUFFIX}${BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_SUFFIX}"

In my case, I am interested in a string with the timestamp and the above
final location of the backup tar so that I can insert them into a
database. Let me know if any of that needs more explaining.

Thank you.

@gigawatts  
are you the above mentioned Red Hat customer?  
If yes, I appreciate it very much to have now a direct  
communication with the original requester.

A side note:  
Indirect communication via intermediate people  
who cannot fully understand the original request  
is just another instance of RFC 1925 (6a):

<pre>
It is always possible to add another level of indirection.
</pre>

which - from my personal experience - is one of the main  
root causes in more than 90% of issues. Another main  
root cause in more than 90% of issues is RFC 1925 (5):

<pre>
It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate
problems into a single complex interdependent solution.
</pre>

which I call "Keep Separated Items Separated" ('KSIS').  
Accordingly 81% of the issues have both as root causes.

Back to the actual topic:

In general regarding a "variable we can define in local.conf  
or site.conf that gets executed at the very end of the backup"  
see in current rear master code or in rear 1.19 release  
conf/default.conf

<pre>
POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT=
</pre>

I tested on my SLES12-SP2 system  
with that in local.conf (excerpts):

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
...
POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT=( 'echo "NETFS_URL: $NETFS_URL" ; echo "NETFS_PREFIX: $NETFS_PREFIX" ; echo "BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE: $BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE" ; echo "BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX: $BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX" ; echo "BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX: $BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX"' )
</pre>

I got:

<pre>
# /usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
Relax-and-Recover 1.19 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-g136.log
...
Archived 1221 MiB in 136 seconds [avg 9198 KiB/sec]
NETFS_URL: 
NETFS_PREFIX: g136
BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE: backup
BACKUP_PROG_SUFFIX: .tar
BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX: .gz
</pre>

In my case NETFS\_URL is not shown because  
it is nowhere used during "rear mkbackup"  
except in my POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT.

Note that NETFS\_URL is outdated according to  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt:

<pre>
Replaced NETFS_URL and ISO_URL by BACKUP_URL
and OUTPUT_URL. However, old references will still be
recognized and used.
</pre>

cf. prep/default/02\_translate\_url.sh  
and verify/default/02\_translate\_url.sh

<pre>
if [[ "$NETFS_URL" ]] ; then
    Log "Using NETFS_URL is deprecated. Use BACKUP_URL instead."
    BACKUP_URL=$NETFS_URL
fi
</pre>

When I use BACKUP\_URL in my POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
I get its value.

Bottom line:  
POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT should do what you need.

I regard this issue as a "support" question  
that is "fixed" hereby.

Yes, I am said customer. Originally I was trying to solve an issue with
NETFS\_UMOUNTCMD not working as expected (still an open issue), but
realized that a better solution to my problem was a post script. It
sounds like that new POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT var is exactly what I was
looking for!

I'll have a look at v1.19 and see if that works for my needs. Thank you.

@gigawatts what prevents your from adding your custom code in a script
in `/usr/share/rear/backup/default/99_custom_code.sh` or something
similar? Use `rear -s mkbackup` to see all the scripts in all the stages
that are run.

FYI, adding scripts to the ReaR structure is the recommended way of
extending ReaR with new or custom functionality.

@schlomo  
by the way regarding adding user scripts  
like .../99\_my\_script.sh or .../01\_my\_other\_script.sh:

I noticed several .../01\_... and .../99\_... scripts  
in the current ReaR master code.

I wonder if we should re-number them so that the  
numbers 01 and 99 are never used by ReaR so that  
those numbers are always reserved for user scripts?

The current ReaR 01\_ and 99\_ scripts:

<pre>
backup/default/01_pre_backup_script.sh
backup/default/99_post_backup_script.sh
build/default/99_update_os_conf.sh
finalize/NBU/default/99_copy_bplogrestorelog.sh
finalize/default/01_prepare_checks.sh
init/default/01_set_drlm_env.sh
layout/prepare/default/01_prepare_files.sh
output/default/01_set_umask.sh
rescue/GNU/Linux/99_sysreqs.sh
rescue/default/01_merge_skeletons.sh
restore/default/99_move_away_restored_files.sh
setup/default/01_pre_recovery_script.sh

</pre>

That might be a good idea. Thanks for seeing that.

FYI:

The re-numbering is done now via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053)

Since I merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1053)  
basically ALL scripts got a changed name  
from NM\_name.sh to NM0\_name.sh  
(except 00\_name.sh that is now 005\_name.sh)

This means you must update your working copy  
to the current master state otherwise I assume  
you will get big conflicts with further pull requests.
