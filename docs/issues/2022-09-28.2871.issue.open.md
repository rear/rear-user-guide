[\#2871 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2871) `open`: Customizing RSYNC\_PORT
========================================================================================

I found that simply adding in local.conf

    readonly RSYNC_PORT=nnnnn
    export RSYNC_PORT

I can customize rsyncd port.  
So I think it is possible to write

    RSYNC_PORT=${RSYNC_PORT:-873}

instead of

    RSYNC_PORT=873                  # default port (of rsync server)

in /usr/share/rear/verify/RSYNC/default/100\_check\_rsync.sh  
to give a proper way to customize that port.

@fadamo  
by the way:

Your

    readonly VARIABLE=value
    export VARIABLE

method in etc/rear/local.conf is a good real world example  
why `make rear working with "set -ue -o pipefail"`, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700)  
is not such a good idea in practice, see the section  
"Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
that reads (excerpt)

    Using 'set -eu -o pipefail' also during runtime
    is currently not recommended because
    it is a double-edged sword
    which can cause more problems in practice
    (i.e. problems for ReaR users)
    than it intends to solve in theory.

In this case here `set -eu -o pipefail`  
(therein in particular the `set -e` part)  
would hinder the user to do some "dirty hacks"  
to make ReaR behave as he needs it in his specific case,  
cf. the section "Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
and my continuous mantra: "Final power to the user!" ;-)

This is fine:

!  
Are you going to implement it ?

In depends on how you start writing *brand new* scripts.  
I always use

    #!/bin/bash -eEu
    set -o pipefail

Instead, modifying old scripts is more complex.  
BTW, this is your coding style, not mine, so I respect your ideas. And I
really appreciate ReaR.

to me it seemed that `RSYNC_*` variables have effectively been internal
variables, not something that was intended to be customizable by users
(the values have been supplied in `BACKUP_URL`). So I decided to
restructure the code and get rid of them without feeling the need for
backward compatibility. Setting it to `readonly` is a nice hack, but the
proper fix would be to extract the port from the URL.

Concerning

I am more positive towards stuff like `set -e`. I would not make it the
default in production, but set it during test runs. This would allow to
discover many problems (depending on test coverage), but not prevent
from using "dirty hacks".

Regarding `set -eu -o pipefail` see the whole text in  
the section "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
that also reads (excerpt)

    Preferably during development of new scripts
    or when scripts are much overhauled
    and while testing new code use 'set -ue'
    to die from unset variables and unhandled errors
    and use 'set -o pipefail' to better notice
    failures in a pipeline.
    ...
    Using 'set -eu -o pipefail' also during runtime
    is currently not recommended ...

where "during runtime" actually means  
"during runtime on the user's system".  
I made that text more clear so that it is now

    Using 'set -eu -o pipefail' also in general
    during runtime on the user's system
    is currently not recommended ...

@pcahyna  
I agree with all your reasoning in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2871\#issuecomment-1268662689](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2871#issuecomment-1268662689)  
in particular with your conclusion that  
`the proper fix would be to extract the port from the URL`.

I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2877](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2877)  
to implement a sufficiently easy way in practice  
so that certain scripts can be run with  
specific bash options like `set -eu -o pipefail`  
during development (e.g. while testing things).  
Of course also users can use that as needed  
(e.g. for debugging or whatever they like).
