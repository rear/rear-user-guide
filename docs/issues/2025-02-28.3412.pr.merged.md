#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#3411

-   How was this pull request tested? In a real DR test

-   Description of the changes in this pull request: The sizes of the
    disks will now also be saved in the ReaR log file which makes it
    easier to link the original disk with the new mapped one.  
    Furthermore, a new script `960_save_disk_and_vgs_mappings.sh` was
    added to assist further in the disk mapping process (even before we
    execute the recovery itself).

@pcahyna  
could you please - as time permits - have a look here?  
I ask you because I think you know much better than me  
about LVM stuff (I am out of that game here).

@jsmeix done, sorry for the delay! Your suspicion looks justified to me.

@gdha thanks, looks good. Can you please squash the commits and
force-push to avoid having the noise from
.../960\_save\_disk\_and\_vgs\_mapping.sh in the Git history? If you
don't want to bother with such details, I can do it myself.

By the way, the commits are done with an unusual address:
`D'Haese, Gratien [GTSBE - Non JJ] <GDHAESE1@ITS.JNJ...` . Is that
intended? If not, this could be corrected as well when squashing (if
yes, you can leave it this way of course).

@jsmeix a note regarding

> of the output from both commands is same ...

no amount of ordering would make this approach correct, as disks and PVs
do not need to have a 1:1 relationship. A disk can have no PVs (having
just traditional file systems on top of partitions) or multiple PVs
(having multiple partitions and a PV on each of these). The latter might
be a bit unusual, but certainly possible.

I think I cannot prevent this as it was part of the 1st commit too.

@gdha I removed it from the first commit and forece-pushed it. Please
let me know if that's ok and if so I can merge the PR.
