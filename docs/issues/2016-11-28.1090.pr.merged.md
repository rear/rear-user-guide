Added -C option to source additional config files  
is useful in general and in particular it is  
needed as prerequirement to implement  
support for "Multiple Backup Methods", see

Because such an option is useful in general  
I will just merge it...

.. what is currently missing is documentation.  
I will do that later when I have more experience  
with that option and for now I like to have that option  
not yet officially mentioned in our documentation  
so that I could still change it if needed.
