-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git
-   System architecture: x86
-   Description of the issue:

If `etc/ssh/sshd_config` is a symbolic link,
`build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh` will fail to apply patches:

    2020-04-14 15:07:30.912377983 Including build/default/500_ssh_setup.sh
    sed: can't read /tmp/rear.4sZcgsBNHi0t1lc/rootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config: No such file or directory
    sed: can't read /tmp/rear.4sZcgsBNHi0t1lc/rootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config: No such file or directory
    sed: can't read /tmp/rear.4sZcgsBNHi0t1lc/rootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config: No such file or directory

Symbolic links will eventually get resolved to target files in
`build/default/985_fix_broken_links.sh` but that's too late.

-   Suggestion (tested successfully): move `985_fix_broken_links.sh` to
    `490_fix_broken_links.sh`.
