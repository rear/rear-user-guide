[\#369 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/369) `closed`: Replace "lsb" RPM requirement in "rear" RPM for openSUSE
=========================================================================================================================

In contrast to RHEL6 where only redhat-lsb-core is needed, openSUSE has
not yet split its "lsb" package into sub-packages, see
[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=862824](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=862824)

Until that happened the RPM requirement for "lsb" requires much too much
for rear because since openSUSE 13.1 the lsb package requires various
graphical libraries, sound stuff, printing stuff, and so on, see
[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=807747](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=807747)

Therefore since openSUSE 13.1 the RPM requirement for "lsb" in rear.spec
should be replaced with a list of explicit packages that are actually
needed by rear.

I did that for rear in its openSUSE build service development project
"Archiving", see the rear.spec file at

[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1)

for an initial proposal how that might be done.

By chance I noticed  
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1002342](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1002342)  
"redhat-lsb-core pulls in the graphical stack due to cups"

To ensure a rear RPM can be installed without issues even on a minimal
(server) system, rear might in general no longer require lsb packages
but require explicitly only those packages (or executables) that are
actually needed by rear.

@jsmeix list the individual packages might become a nightmare to
maintain across all the different platforms and Linux distro's we're
supporting. The `lsb` package was meant to deal with this. I never
understood why it exploded in size the way it did? A *standard way* of
working (around `lsb`) across all Linux distro's seems to me the proper
way to go.

The SUSE lsb package requirements "exploded" because of
[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=807747](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=807747)
see in particular what Robert Schweikert wrote in
[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=807747\#c4](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=807747#c4)
and his original mail at  
[http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/2013-May/007643.html](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/2013-May/007643.html)

In short: A Linux distribution cannot be partially LSB compliant. In
contrast a particular installed system can.

Currently our lsb package requires the full LSB stuff. It is it is not
yet split into sub-packages, see
[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=862824](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=862824)
so that requiring the lsb package requires all LSB stuff.

As long as our lsb package is not split into sub-packages
Relax-and-Recover should not require it.

When our lsb package is split into sub-packages Relax-and-Recover may
require an appropriate sub-package like lsb-core (or whatever it might
be called).

Alternatively a more generic way could be when Relax-and-Recover
requires no lsb-\* packages but the files (in particular the
executables) that are actally needed by Relax-and-Recover. For example
our lsb package has this kind of requirements, see its current spec file
at
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Base:System/lsb](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Base:System/lsb)

If we would remove in our spec file the following:

    ###
    %if %{!?sles_version:1}0
    Requires: lsb
    %endif

We could replace it with a prep script to investigate if we have all the
required binaries with a script similar to
`prep/default/95_check_missing_programs.sh` (but perhaps specific for
SLES)?

@jsmeix could you list the packages SLES need at minimum? This is not an
urgent request - take your time.

I think in practice it is impossible to specify what SLES packages are
needed by rear at minimum. The problem is what "at minimum" means.  
I have no idea how I could determine that. I think it depends on
run-time on a particular end-user's system what exact code paths in the
rear bash scripts are executed which determines what exact programs are
actually called which results what exact software packages are needed on
a particular end-user's system.

What I did instead some time ago was a simple analysis what programs are
called by the rear bash scripts. I described what I did in the rear.spec
file of the source package rear in the openSUSE build service project
"Archiving" (which is the development project for rear in
openSUSE:Factory), see:

[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving/rear/rear.spec?expand=1)

excerpt:

<pre>
# LSB RPM Requires:
# Begin of "Requires: lsb" cleanup:
# Rear upstream has "Requires: lsb" but that requires much too much,
# see https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=807747#c4
# "A distribution is LSB Certified or LSB compliant if and only if
#  the distribution provides all requirements as outlined in the
#  specification."
# Accordingly SUSE's lsb RPM requires tons of stuff that is not
# needed by Rear (in particular various graphical libraries,
# sound stuff, printing stuff, and so on).
# Therefore "Requires: lsb" is replaced by explicitly listing the RPM packages
# that are mandatory (in particular when a binary is called in a script) for Rear (as RPM Requires)
# plus what seems to be optional (nice to have) for Rear (as RPM Recommends)
# minus library packages because needed libraries should be automatically required.
# I &lt;jsmeix@suse.de&gt; think requiring RPM packages instead of binaries is better
# because it keeps the list shorter which is hopefully easier to maintain and
# the requirements are on a more higher level which is hopefully more unsusceptible against
# minor changes in what exact binaries names are actually called by Rear.
# To test if a binary is called by a Rear script the following was done (example for /usr/bin/bc):
#   BIN="bc"
#   for f in $( find /usr/share/rear/ )
#   do grep "\&lt;$BIN\&gt; " $f 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -v '^[[:space:]]*#'
#   done
# What is not tested to find out if a binary is called by a Rear script is "eval" stuff,
# something like STRING=&lt;result of whatever calls&gt; ; eval $STRING
# Usually Rear calls "eval echo ..." or "eval "${EXTERNAL_whatever[@]}"
# except in /usr/share/rear/finalize/default/88_check_for_mount_by_id.sh that calls
#   eval "$(scsi_id ...
# where the only scsi_id that I could find is /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id
# which belongs to udev and I assume that udev is installed in any case
# so that there is no explicit RPM Requires for udev in Rear.
# What is also not tested to find out what Rear actually needs is
# which files (not only binaries) Rear needs to build up its recovery system
# (in particular tools for partitioning, creating filesystems, and bootloader installation).
# I assume what Rear needs to build up the system-specific recovery system is installed
# (e.g. if the ext4 filesystem is used, I assume mkfs.ext4 is installed)
# so that there are no explicit RPM Requires needed for that in Rear.
# The following list was derived from the RPM Requires of SUSE's lsb package
# (its last RPM changelog entry dated "Tue Oct  1 07:01:56 UTC 2013") as follows:
#   for r in $( grep ^Requires: lsb.spec | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2 )
#   do rpm -q --whatprovides $r
#   done | sort -u

That results the following RPM requirements

for SLES11

<pre>
$ osc getbinaries Archiving rear SLE_11_SP3 x86_64

$ rpm -q --requires -p binaries/rear-1.17.0-47.2.noarch.rpm | sort

rpcbind  
rsync  
/sbin/mingetty  
sed  
syslinux  
tar  
/usr/bin/mkisofs  
util-linux  
</pre>

and for SLES12:

<pre>
$ osc getbinaries Archiving rear SLE_12 x86_64
rear-1.17.0-47.2.noarch.rpm
$ rpm -q --requires -p binaries/rear-1.17.0-47.2.noarch.rpm | sort

rpcbind  
rsync  
sed  
syslinux  
tar  
/usr/bin/mkisofs  
/usr/sbin/agetty

</pre>

Note that in both cases e.g. dosfslabel (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/229](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/229))
is not yet included because I did my analysis what programs are called
by the rear bash scripts some time ago.

Other requirements are probably not mandatory (i.e. there are more than
the minimal requirements listed above). For example I guess that rsync
is not needed on all end-user's particular systems.

Correction:

Programs like dosfslabel are not required by rear because in my above
analysis I only tested which of the programs that are required by our
"lsb" package are actually called (i.e. needed) by rear.

What our "lsb" package requires is only what is called "lsb-core" by
LSB.

Because programs like dosfslabel are not required by "lsb-core" those
are not required by rear.

I think programs like dosfslabel should never be required by rear
because in general RPM requirements should be only used for what is
mandatory to run rear. Anything else should be specified by RPM
"Recommends".

Reasoning:

In general RPM requirements should be only used for essential stuff i.e.
for what is mandatory to make it work. For anything else RPM recommends
should be used. RPM Requires are hard dependencies that cannot be
skipped by admins (without having unresolved dependencies in their
systems).

Furthermore: If I remember correctly the openSUSE build service installs
all RPM Requires to set up the build system of a package so that all RPM
Requires in a package result that all those hard dependencies must be
installed in our build systems for any other package that directly or
indirectly BuildRequires the package.

In short:

We should keep RPM Requires as small as possible - i.e. only what is
really mandatory - and specify all what is optional (i.e. what is not
really mandatory) as RPM Recommends.

Currently there are no RPM "Recommends" in the rear package. The main
reason is that I don't know how to determine what should be recommended
by rear.

@jsmeix I think mandatory programs should be added to the
REQUIRED\_PROGS array. This way, when not available rear will stop with
an error. I have done this lately for EFI with `dosfstools` as an
example. We should use the *prep* work-flow in a better way - trying to
correct this step-by-step (when I come across a current situation).

@jsmeix @schlomo @jhoekx @dagwieers  
In packaging we still found some references to `lsb-release`:

    ./packaging/arch/PKGBUILD:depends=(lsb-release iproute2 parted cpio openssl gawk)
    ./packaging/arch/PKGBUILD.local:depends=(lsb-release iproute2 parted cpio openssl gawk)
    ./packaging/debian/control:Depends: syslinux, ethtool, ${shlibs:Depends}, lsb-release, portmap, genisoimage, iproute, iputils-ping, binutils, parted, openssl, gawk, attr, ${misc:Depends}
    ./packaging/gentoo/rear.ebuild: sys-apps/lsb-release

Shouldn't we remove these as well?

I am fine with removing the `lsb-release` requirement. Just keep in mind
the consequences:

-   We need to add much more stuff to REQUIRED\_PROGS
-   We need to be able to detect OS\_VENDOR and OS\_VERSION without
    `lsb_release`

I would actually remove the dependency only after we don't need the
`lsb_release` tool any more.

I fully agree with @gdha to move the requirements  
from the RPM spec file into the actual rear code.

Regarding OS\_VENDOR and OS\_VERSION:  
Only an untested idea how to detect OS\_VENDOR and OS\_VERSION  
nowadays (i.e. it does not work for older distributions):

Using /etc/os-release

Yes, `/etc/os-release`has the same info. What about pre-systemd distros?
Do we drop support for those?

The current RPM requirements seem to be o.k.
