@xwhitebeltx Why do you want to treat a Micron 960GB NVMe SSD as an USB
device? I guess you want to make a bootable UEFI device? Remember, a
local SSD device is **not** safe to keep ReaR archives on.  
@rear/contributors This is something we haven't foreseen so far (I
think, but could be wrong \[again\])?

@gdha in real use this is indeed unusual. For testing it is useful
though to treat NVMe as any other disk device - you can take a machine
with a secondary NVMe device, make a backup to it as if it were USB, and
boot from it for recovery.  
(yes, it is more realistic to test on a machine with a secondary USB
disk, or at least a SCSI or SATA disk since it also presents itself as a
`sd*` block device, but a machine with NVMe may be the only thing you
have)

Any thoughts why we can't use `find_device` here?  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2073e77f1ed213653bbf846d67bef346a9f65da9/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200\_check\_usb\_layout.sh\#L12-L13](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2073e77f1ed213653bbf846d67bef346a9f65da9/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200_check_usb_layout.sh#L12-L13)

It seems to me like our code simply doesn't handle the nvme use case
yet, it assumes a sysfs device path like
`/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.0/host2/target2:0:1/2:0:1:0/block/sdb/sdb1`
whereas in your example we have
`devices/pci0000:c0/0000:c0:03.3/0000:c5:00.0/nvme/nvme0/nvme0n1`

@xwhitebeltx have you tried creating a partition and specifying that
instead of the whole disk?

thank you all for your responses!

@gdha - we do as @pcahyna suggested, i have 2 local NVMes:

1.  OS
2.  backup drive i can boot from and restore the OS back to its original
    state  
    in this case the main purpose is not backup of critical data, it is
    to be able to "reset" the server anytime we want with an automated
    boot + restore process, in places where PXE is banned.

@schlomo - it works fine when the SSD is SATA, first time i'm trying
that on an NVMe,  
i have not tried creating a partition, i'll try tomorrow morning and
update =)

well, it worked but it ignored the partition(which is totally good for
me), the initial state was this:

after i executed "rear -v format -- --efi /dev/nvme0n1p1" i got this

i've performed a backup with "rear -v mkbackup"  
and i've restored it successfully!

there's one unexpected screen which i'm not sure yet what's happening
there and if it's related to rear or not,  
actions i took:

1.  reboot
2.  F11 for boot menu
3.  choose the REAR-000 NVMe Drive
4.  this screen pops up:  
    ![image](https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/100077488/56120363-4939-4226-b738-9a97c98a34b1)  
    and then the rear grub menu, from there it all seems to be working
    fine

thanks for the workaround! is this something you would consider
implementing in future releases? treating NVMe devices as USB?

@xwhitebeltx  
that "unexpected screen" was implemeted by me via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a0a6429119bc284fcf93775bd579bcd74d1c3b40](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a0a6429119bc284fcf93775bd579bcd74d1c3b40)  
see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1634068353](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1634068353)

Actually there is no new screen.  
It is a timeout delay on the normal initial GRUB screen  
(without timeout it shows up only for a fraction of a second)  
before GRUB replaces it with its boot menu screen.  
With the timeout delay you can see and even read  
what GRUB shows (in particular possible error messages)  
which helps to understand why GRUB fails when it fails  
(e.g. it fails when a wrong 'root' device is used).

@jsmeix oh, nice =)  
thank you very much,  
i'm sorry for the silly question but this is my first time reporting a
bug in github,  
please tell me should i close it as resolved (workaround provided) or do
you want to leave it open until it is fixed?  
what is the proper conduct?

@xwhitebeltx  
don't worry how you may close it "correctly".  
Leave that "problem" to us.

Personally I would like to fix it but unfortunately  
too often I don't find the needed time for it,  
too much other stuff elsewhere :-(  
I would like to keep it open for some time,  
hope dies last :-)
