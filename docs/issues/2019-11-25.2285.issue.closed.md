Basically always when there is a user report where "rear recover"
failed  
I would like to see the user's disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh  
to have it easier to imagine what goes on on the user's system.

Therefore I would like to print the disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh
content  
into the "rear -D recover" log (i.e. only in case of debugscript mode).

What I worry about is that disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh  
can contain secrets, e.g. "Disk layout file syntax" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
reads (excerpt)

    LUKS Devices
    crypt ... [cipher=<cipher>] ... [password=<password>]
    ...
    TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disks
    opaldisk ... [password=<password>]

which means the "rear -D recover" log can contain secrets, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2156)

On the other hand I assume that currently the "rear -D recover" log  
may already contain the cipher and password values for LUKS  
and/or TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disks  
via the normal `set -x` output.

@OliverO2  
FYI see this issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2285](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2285)  
because it is also about that ReaR's debugscript log may contain  
the password value for TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disks  
via the `set -x` output, cf.

@jsmeix  
I just had a short look, but to me it seems like the password is
protected from appearing in the log:

@OliverO2  
from plain looking at the code of the `create_opaldisk` function  
I think it only switches off `set -x` inside diskrestore.sh  
while the confidential commands are running  
but I think it does not redirect stderr to /dev/null  
while the `create_opaldisk` function is running.  
So I think `set -x` output may appear in the log  
while `create_opaldisk` is running.

On the other hand it seems $OPAL\_DISK\_PASSWORD  
is nowhere evaluated while the `create_opaldisk` function is running  
because it is always used as `\$OPAL_DISK_PASSWORD` so that  
$OPAL\_DISK\_PASSWORD is only evaluated while diskrestore.sh  
is running and there `set -x` is switched off.

But I found unescaped `$OPAL_DISK_PASSWORD`  
several times in various functions in  
usr/share/rear/lib/opaladmin-workflow.sh

On first glance I cannot see whether or not `set -x` could be set  
while those functions are running.

Yes, the `opaladmin` workflow contains no special debugscripts
protection. But this is an isolated workflow which does not interfere
with the rest of ReaR.

If a need should arise to debug this workflow with `-x` and send out the
log, the user should use demo passwords only or scrutinize the log for
any production password used.
