-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    Normally there should be no difference when things are OK  
    but for users with e.g. broken config files the impact is high  
    because now they see that their config files are broken.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I did some quick "rear -D mkrescue" tests with artificial syntax
    errors  
    in default.conf, \_input-output-functions.sh, and local.conf

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Error out or BugError in sbin/rear when
