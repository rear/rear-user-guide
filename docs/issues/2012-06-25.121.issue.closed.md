I am looking for feedback from users (and collaborators) regarding the
documentation structure. The below structure is based on the current
draft documentation. I would like to make sure the documentation tells a
story (is consistent, entertaining and useful) and is balanced in its
chapters.

It makes sense to start with an introduction explaining the project, how
it was conceived and what it can do. Then tackle installation and
configuration. Explain various scenarios (that we hopefully also test
automatically). And then some appendices (monitoring, support,
troubleshooting).

What I am struggling with is how the configuration section would work,
there are various items that cannot be ordered and have similar
importance. One option is to have a long alphabetical list of
configuration options, another option is to look at a batch of options
related to a certain topic, but that makes it harder for future
improvements to not miss (or clean up) options.

And then there's a partly overlap between configuration options, and the
use-cases/scenarios that explain the same options again. And I would
like the layout configuration manual in there as well somewhere. Now it
is listed as an appendix (and we have more appendices than actual
chapters).

My aim, to make it easier to help out with documentation, or to find
help, is to make a separate file of each chapter, which are included
from the main documentation. In this form the different chapters can
stand on their own from a packaged installation (even when not in HTML
or PDF file), while with one large document it is harder to find what
you are looking for (if there is no index). As soon as we have an
acceptable structure defined, I can got and start making the individual
chapters and collaboration on the documentation can begin.

I am just starting out trying to use ReaR and I am finding the
documentation to be the most frustrating part.  
I think that the thing that would help me the most would be more
examples of conf files for various implementations.  
I know you are worried about changes in the conf with new releases. One
way to mitigate that some would be to simply put the conf file examples
in the build and you would simply need to cite the name of the example
in the docs. Then the docs become more about how to use the application
(which shouldnt change as much).

We don't have these different conf files in the build as separate files,
simply because all possible combinations is simply too large. Basically
a configuration is combination of an OUTPUT method, a BACKUP method and
the specific configuration of both (usually OUTPUT\_URL and
BACKUP\_URL). That is it.

The documentation should explain the various options for both OUTPUT and
BACKUP. If this was not clear from the documentation please provide us
with patches/pull-requests to the documentation to improve it. Honestly,
writing good documentation is much harder for us, as we know exactly how
it works so we don't consider the obvious questions new users have.

So we need new users to tell us what they missed from the documentation,
or to explain their confusions, rather than adding specific config files
for specific cases. (Unless of course one config file would cover 80% of
the cases, which in our case is not the case...)

Implemented. Now we need to continue fixing \#4 !
