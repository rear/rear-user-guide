Correction to \#1886 - LPAR/PPC64 bootlist is incorrectly set when
having multiple 'prep' partitions

@rmetrich  
a question:  
Is there a reason why in that code `${boot_list[@]}` without double
quotes is used?

Because in general using ${VAR\[@\]} without double-quotes is
problematic,  
see 'Arrays' in "man bash" and for some examples see

No special reason. Here devices are used so there is no space, so no
issue.

... no issue except

;-)

Thanks for having a closer look and have a nice weekend!

@jsmeix indeed, it is better to avoid possibly problematic constructs,
even if they seem ok, because:

-   someone might copy the code to a place where it does matter
-   the original bug was found by shellcheck, which flags such
    problematic constructs, and the less false positives in shellcheck
    reports I have to examine, the higher are the chances that I will
    spot true problems.
