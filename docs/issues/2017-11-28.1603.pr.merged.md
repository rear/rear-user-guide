Hello @jsmeix,

`i=$((i+1))` and `(( i += 1 ))` are same a perfectly valid way how to
increment variable. Not sure about overhead on lower levels but outcome
is the same.

I don't remember why I'd choose one or the the other way, but until it
creates a problem, I just trust my past me for having a reason.

This is not part of the pull request, so feel free to update it how ever
you like. It is some time since I've implement this parsing nightmare.
In the near future I'll try to write patch for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1604](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1604)
(until somebody else writes it) so I'll need to retest whole code.  
That could be place for updating comments (and maybe iterators) ;-).

@gozora  
I am sorry my "FYI" addedum caused confusion.  
It was of course not meant that anything in your  
currently working code should be changed now  
via this pull request shortly before the ReaR 2.3 release.  
Again sorry for my useless addedum at this time  
and many thanks for your fix!

@jsmeix no need for apologies!  
Your comments are not useless!  
This fix (neither XFS recreation code) is not perfect, and it will
require a bit more work to recreate XFS file systems correctly. But it
comes from XFS nature, I guess you had similar fun with btrfs ;-)

I fear I had and will have "much more fun" with btrfs  
because btrfs subvolumes basically behave like filesystems  
within a whole btrfs (because subvolumes can be mounted).  
This "just breaks" the traditional assumption that one mount point  
belongs to one filesystem which is still a basic assumption for  
the whole current disk layout code in ReaR.  
Therefore since btrfs the whole disk layout code in ReaR  
actually needs to be fundamentally overhauled.  
I try as good as I can to ignore that skeleton in the closet ;-)

Only an addedum FYI regarding  
ReaR's disk layout code skeleton in the closet:  
Meanwhile I found what I had already written about it, see
