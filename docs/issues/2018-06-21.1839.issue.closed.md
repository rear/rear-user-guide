#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

-   Relax-and-Recover 2.4-git.3020.aa7b197.master / 2018-06-21
-   Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS x86\_64

Brief description of the issue:

`dpkg -i <package>` after `make deb` fails with the following:

    Selecting previously unselected package rear.
    (Reading database ... 289777 files and directories currently installed.)
    Preparing to unpack .../rear_2.4-git.3020.aa7b197.master_amd64.deb ...
    Unpacking rear (2.4-git.3020.aa7b197.master) ...
    dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of rear:
     rear depends on attr; however:
      Package attr is not installed.

    dpkg: error processing package rear (--install):
     dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
    Processing triggers for man-db (2.7.5-1) ...
    Errors were encountered while processing:
     rear

Work-around: `apt-install attr`  
Solution: Add package `attr` to dependencies.

The `control` file does contain it:

    Depends: syslinux[!ppc64el], syslinux-common[!ppc64el], ethtool, ${shlibs:Depends}, lsb-release, iputils-ping, dosfstools, binutils, parted, openssl, gawk, attr, bc, ${misc:Depends}

Why wasn't it picked up?

I looked into the `DEBIAN/control` file in the built package and the
line indeed contains attr:
`Depends: syslinux, syslinux-common, ethtool, lsb-release, iputils-ping, dosfstools, binutils, parted, openssl, gawk, attr, bc`

I now did the following: `apt install attr; apt remove ethtool` to see
if it would pick up ethtool as a dependency. It did not, as I now get
the error `Package ethtool is not installed.` when trying to install
rear.

I'm not really familiar with the packages, so I'm not sure what else to
try.

Tried `make deb` and `dpkg -i <package>` on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04.3 box,
same problem.

okay, nevermind.. i never really noticed it, but `dpkg -i` doesn't
resolve dependencies.
