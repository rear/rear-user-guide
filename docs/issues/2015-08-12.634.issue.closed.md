Hi,

I updated to rear-1.17.1 and read about the *OUTPUT\_URL=null* option. I
thought that would work out great for me and activated it, but I still
see two disk images in my environment.

I have default config files for local.conf and os.conf and:

    [@machine ~]# find / -iname "*.iso"
    [@machine ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.1 (Maipo)
    [@machine ~]# rpm -qa | grep rear
    rear-1.17.1-1.el7.noarch
    [@machine ~]# cat /etc/rear/site.conf
    # configuration file for relax and recover
    # don't upload to tsm directly as this is scheduled somewhere else
    BACKUP=TSM
    TSM_RESULT_SAVE=n
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    [@machine ~]# /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    [@machine ~]# find / -iname "*.iso"
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/rear/rear-machine.iso
    /var/lib/rear/output/rear-machine.iso
    [@machine ~]#

could you run `rear -vD mkrescue` to see where it goes wrong? Is linked
to issue \#501

Sure, no problem. Unfortunately I'm not seeing any option to upload the
logfile, therefore I put it here:  
[http://eholtz.de/rear-machine.log.xz](http://eholtz.de/rear-machine.log.xz)

@eholtz thank you for the log. Apparently the `OUTPUT_URL=null` was
designed to work well with `BACKUP=NTEFS` scheme and was not implemented
for other backup methods. This is not a bug, but a missing feature of
the patch kindly donated by an user.  
We need to enhance the code to make this happen in a generic way.

@eholtz if you define `TSM_RM_ISOFILE=1` in `/etc/rear/site.conf` file
then /opt/tivoli/tsm/rear/rear-machine.iso will be removed.  
PS: I rather use the generic code for `OUTPUT_URL=null` everywhere

@eholtz One last remark: by defining `TSM_RESULT_SAVE=n` you will not
make a backup of the iso file towards TSM. Is this what you want? As you
want all ISOs to be removed on the local system? I don't think so...

@gdha Thank you for your replies. The TSM-Backup is scheduled elsewhere,
so as long as I have one copy left the iso will be saved once a day to
the server. I don't want to upload it directly to TSM after the cronjob,
because I would produce a heavy load on the server when multiple VMs are
starting their jobs at the same time.  
I will try if the TSM\_RM\_ISOFILE=1 works out for me and let you know.

@gdha I tried using

    # configuration file for relax and recover
    # don't upload to tsm directly as this is scheduled somewhere else
    BACKUP=TSM
    TSM_RESULT_SAVE=n
    TSM_RM_ISOFILE=1

But I'm still left with two iso files:

    [root@lxf101p001 ~]# find / -iname "*.iso" -exec rm {} \;
    [root@lxf101p001 ~]# rear mkrescue
    [root@lxf101p001 ~]# find / -iname "*.iso"
    /opt/tivoli/tsm/rear/rear-lxf101p001.iso
    /var/lib/rear/output/rear-lxf101p001.iso

Apparently the iso gets only removed when it has been uploaded to TSM
(which I believe is kind of useful for standard environments)

@eholtz Is your question answered? The OUTPUT\_URL is only honored with
BACKUP=NETFS scheme. If you would like it different then I would prefer
another issue - to keep 2 discussions apart.

@gdha Thanks for your reply. I do understand that OUTPUT\_URL is only
honored with BACKUP=NETFS scheme. The documentation should be updated to
reflect that, maybe I'm not the only one who misunderstood that.  
Nevertheless I think there should be an option to do a BACKUP=TSM in
combination with TSM\_RESULT\_SAVE=n where I'm not left with two ISO
images. I would like to contribute this myself, but I need a couple of
hours to look into the code so I won't be able to do that in the next
days.

@eholtz @schlomo Well the OUTPUT\_URL was never a concern (in most cases
with external backup), but I agree you can use it to have second copy.  
Wonder what Schlomo idea is about the scope of OUTPUT\_URL=null: shall
we stick to NETFS mechanism or go broader?

@gdha grepping through our code makes me think that the actual challange
is that there is no single tool to handle all types of OUTPUT\_URL which
means that we need lots of code to handle the different types of URLs.

Another questions: Why do we need OUTPUT\_URL=null if the default of
OUTPUT\_URL is empty? So far most ReaR variables can be set to empty or
unset to disable a feature.

@schlomo Sorry for the delay - if OUTPUT\_URL is empty it will get the
same value as BACKUP\_URL (which is mandatory) and it makes sense as you
want your iso image saved (most likely on the same location as the tar
archive)

Re-open this issue when we found a sponsor to implement this missing
feature
