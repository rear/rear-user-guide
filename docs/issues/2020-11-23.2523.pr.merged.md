-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement** / **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Low** / **High**  
    Low for normal use cases with 'tar' as backup tool.  
    Probably high for users with third-party backup tools  
    that require special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH settings.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    "rear mkrescue" still works well for me with backup tool 'tar'

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The whole ldd testing code in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh was completely
overhauled:

Now a special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is only set directly before the "chroot
... ldd" test  
and afterwards it is restored to what it was before.

Now each binary is first tested without any LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set (which
is the normal case)  
and when that failed it is tested with the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting
while "rear mkrescue" is run  
(if there is such a LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting) and when that also failed
it is tested with a  
BACKUP method specific LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting (if there is such a
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting).

Only when all tests fail the binary is considered to have actually
missing shared objects dependencies.  
This way we do not need to know which binaries require what specific
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH setting.

We assume when the ldd test succeeds with one of those LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
settings that setting  
will be somehow 'magically' also happen inside the recovery system to
make things work therein  
because special backup tools should have their methods to set
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH as they need it.

Before this pull request the ldd test code was basically

    # Set special LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$special_stuff
    # Test all binaries with special LD_LIBRARY_PATH set
    for binary in $( find_binaries ) ; do
        chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "... ldd $binary"
    done
    # Restore previous LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ... export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$saved_LD_LIBRARY_PATH ...

which is bad because after `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$special_stuff`  
all programs run with that special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508\#issuecomment-726711801](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508#issuecomment-726711801)

With the current pull request the ldd test code is basically

    for binary in $( find_binaries ) ; do
        # Set special LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$special_stuff
        # Test the binary with special LD_LIBRARY_PATH set
        chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "... ldd $binary"
        # Restore previous LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ... export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$saved_LD_LIBRARY_PATH ...
    done

which is better because only `chroot ... ldd` is run with special
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set.

But this still looks wrong because the actual program that needs to
run  
with special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set is only `ldd` inside the chroot
environment.  
There is no reason to set the special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH in the bash that
runs `rear`.  
So I will further change the code to be like this:

    for binary in $( find_binaries ) ; do
        # Test the binary with special LD_LIBRARY_PATH set
        chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$special_stuff ... ldd $binary"
    done

Now the special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is set only in the bash that runs
`ldd` and  
that bash exits after `ldd` finished so the special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
setting is gone with it.  
So there is no need to remember and restore some previously set
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
because nothing was changed in the bash that runs `rear`.

@OliverO2  
only FYI:  
Via this pull request
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523)  
I completely overhauled the `ldd` test in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523\#issuecomment-732779380](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523#issuecomment-732779380)  
for a summary how it was before and what I changed.

If you are interested and have time for it I would appreciate it  
if you could test if the current one in this pull request works for you.

To get a git clone of the current state of this pull request you could
do:

    # git clone --single-branch --branch jsmeix-overhauled-ldd-test https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear.jsmeix-overhauled-ldd-test

    # cd rear.jsmeix-overhauled-ldd-test

    # vi etc/rear/local.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue

@jsmeix  
I'll have a look and I'll do a test run. Will probably take 2-3 days,
but if we're lucky, I can squeeze it in faster...

@jsmeix  
I ran your branch with minimal local configuration on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
Desktop. Everything worked as expected. Relevant debug output was:

    Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.mUiqWGXc9CVbk2Y/rootfs contains a usable system
    Testing each binary with 'ldd' and look for 'not found' libraries within the recovery system
    Testing that each program in the PROGS array can be found as executable command within the recovery system
    Testing that each program in the REQUIRED_PROGS array can be found as executable command within the recovery system

(Tried to boot the recovery system on VirtualBox VM, but that froze
after completing its startup to the root login prompt. However, this is
an issue most probably completely unrelated to ReaR.)

I have also looked at the code and did not notice anything suspicious
;-). So LGTM...

@OliverO2  
thank you very much for testing it and for looking at the code!

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.
