IMHO the patching of the sshd\_config should be extended to relax the
binding statement.

    -e 's/ListenAddress.*/ ListenAddress 0.0.0.0/ig'

Why is the routing information missing?

Is there a correct way to provide an own handcrafted sshd\_config for
the initrd? Then someone could tailor the config for the DR case.

Best regards
