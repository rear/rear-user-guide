[\#3390 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3390) `merged`: Automate ReaR Release Builds via GH Actions
=========================================================================================================

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) opened issue at [2025-01-29 08:49](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3390):

Here is my suggestion for automation the ReaR release builds.

Pushing a tag named like `release/x.y` will build a ReaR release with
`make ... OFFICIAL=1` after validating that the version in `rear`
matches the release tag version.

The result is then published to our releases, where we can also manually
update the release notes if we like so.

The release notes are auto generated and should - in theory - contain a
list of PRs. I've seen that in my first attempt but not in the
subsequent ones, and I'm happy to look at improving that in a future
iteration. For now it works and in any case we can then go and paste our
release notes into the GH release after it is created.

The download URL of the "Official source dist archive" is like this:
`https://github.com/rear/rear/releases/download/release/2.8.105/rear-2.8.105.tar.gz`
which is IMHO a fairly nice URL.

The download URL of the auto-generated source archives is unfortunately
`https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/refs/tags/release/2.8.105.tar.gz`
which is not so nice. I'm afraid that changing that would require
including `rear-` as the prefix to the version in the release tag.

As we want to encourage people to use the official dist archive instead
of the auto-generated release tag source archive I would like to suggest
to simply accept that as it is. I think that people downloading such
auto-generated source snapshots know what they do and it seems to be
common practice to not prefix the software name to the tag, e.g. see
[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/tags](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/tags)
for another example with the same behaviour.

I'll merge this this afternoon if I don't hear from you so that \#3389
can proceed. Please excuse the stupid branch name, it will be gone then.
I'll also squash all commits for merging to mask my bumping the version
in the rear script.

BTW, I disabled CentOS 7 and SL 7 from the Docker builds, so maybe we
also should remove them from the "supported" distros in our release
notes

@pcahyna what do you think? Any idea why the two `rpm-build` jobs are
failing? Is it a false positive or a real problem?

@schlomo: RHEL7 is still supported due to extended life cycle support
(ELS) of Red Hat until June 30, 2028. Additionally SuSE provides
extended support for Centos 7 until June 30, 2028 [(ref.
here)](https://www.suse.com/products/multi-linux-support/). Maybe this
should be the milestones to skip also ReaR's support of those
"RHEL7"-ish OSs since they are still "alive" in the field?

@hpannenb ah, thanks for the details. Since ELS is AFAIK a paid thing
I'd say that we, as the Open Source project, don't need to deal with
that as part of our community efforts. In any case both RH and SUSE
provide commercial ReaR support for the packages that they included. I'd
hope that nobody gets to the idea to use an old RHEL7 with brand new
hardware or backup software.

Personally I'm simply tired of the way how I need to update
`tools/run-in-docker` all the time to "fix" the old RHEL7 stuff.

@hpannenb  
the fundamental difference is  
what we at ReaR upstream support on a voluntary base  
versus  
what is supported for RHEL and SLES customers  
by Red Hat and SUSE via customer support contracts.

What we at ReaR upstream describe in our release notes  
is what we at ReaR upstream support on a voluntary base,  
e.g. for ReaR 2.8 see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

In contrast  
for example what SUSE supports for SUSE customers  
is described in the section  
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
Therein see also the section  
"Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) RPM packages for disaster recovery"  
what "rear..." RPM packages are provided by SUSE  
for what SUSE Linux Enterprise version.

@schlomo  
feel free to drop support for older Linux distributions  
when they become problematic as you like.

Understood. At a certain time support needs to be dropped and there is
obviously a difference between commercial versus voluntary support.
