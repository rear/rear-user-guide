-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

`rear mkrescue` is failing:

I know that REAR cannot backup or restore ZFS partitions. That's fine, I
use syncoid to backup and restore ZFS but here it seems `rear mkrescue`
is failing because `/dev/nvme0n1p9` (and /dev/nvme1n1p9 ) have an
unknown partition table. It is just an empty placeholder partition that
I definitely don't want to backup because I couldn't anyway.

My understanding of rear is that EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS is used to exclude
certain devices from being backed up but nothing that I've tried so far
stops `mkrescue` from analysing the nmve devices, which are formatted
with ZFS, and then aborting `mkrescue` because of the unknown
partitions.

-   Workaround, if any:

Under rear 2.5 I was successful in getting this machine to backup (and
hence mkrescue worked too) by using `ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg1" )` in my
`/etc/rear/local.conf` because it uses LVM but that doesn't work any
more under 2.7. rear 2.5 also didn't produce bootable USB drives under
Ubuntu 20.04.

Thanks

@danboid  
in general for an analysis we need a full debug ReaR log file,  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

    Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files)

Caution with possible secrets in a full debug log file:  
When 'rear' is run via '-D' in debugscript mode  
it logs executed commands via the bash command 'set -x'  
that print commands and their arguments as they are executed  
so in particular when arguments contain secret values  
(e.g. something like a password or whatever else)  
such secret values may appear in the log file.  
Also secrets may be stored in some other files  
like /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
or /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  
cf. `[password=<password>]` in the section  
"Disk layout file syntax" in  
doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc  
online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
So before you attach your full debug log file and other files  
here (GitHub is a public accessible place) inspect your files  
and verify that they do not accidentally cointain secrets.

@danboid  
as far as I see in your

    ++ disk_label=gpt

the problematic disk where the

    /dev/sda

which is according to your 'lsblk' output

a USB device.

So I wonder if you could (at least as a workaround for now)  
disconnect this USB device while you run "rear mkrescue"?

By the way:  
I did right now  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2aaa1967710314c7bc12ccacac67dcf76b10b95a)  
to make that "Unsupported partition table" error message meaningful  
in particular for systems with more than a single disk ;-)

I can't physically remove that disk now but if it is that causing the
error then I would've expected changing to:

    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=( "${EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS[@]}" "/dev/nvme0n1" "/dev/nvme1n1" "/dev/nvme0n1p1" "/dev/nvme0n1p9" "/dev/nvme1n1p1" "/dev/nvme1n1p9" "/dev/sda" )

Should fix my problem but I still get:

My amateur, not knowing rear well guess is that the $device array as fed
into 200\_partition\_layout.sh doesn't exclude the devices listed in the
$EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS array so it tries to fetch the label/ partition
type of ALL partitions regardless.

Yes, this is how it currently behaves.  
The exclusion happens afterwards.  
Basically for normal disks  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
does

        for disk in /sys/block/* ; do
    ...
                    extract_partitions "$devname"
    ...
        done

I removed the Ubuntu install USB disk, rebooted and that did fix
`mkrescue` and `mkbackup` as rear is backing it up now but why did
adding "/dev/sda" to the $EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS array not fix that error
if that was the disk causing trouble?

As far as I see  
adding "/dev/sda" to any EXCLUDE variable  
cannot help here because of
