Good Day I am new to gethub and I am having an issues getting it to
mount an NFS3 partition from and AIX system.  
The issue I am facing is that I am trying to mount an NFS share from an
AIX system to use this as my backup storage location. This will then be
backed up by TSM and has the most disk to take the Linux system backed
up images.

ReaR works fine if I go to a Red Hat Linux system. I have configured a
test Linux system and made it the place I put the files on for testing.
I am able to recover a system and use the ISO etc.

When I looked at the ReaR logs I see that it is trying to mount an NFS4.
AIX is exporting and needs an NFS3 setting.

I did find this posting in Red Hat site  
mount.nfs: Remote I/O error  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/61602](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/61602)

When I try the mount by hand it mounts fine.  
mount -o vers=3 server\_ip\_addr:dir local\_mount\_point  
The AIX mount works like a charm.  
Is there a command line option or a file I need to change to tell ReaR
to use NFS3 not 4.  
Any help on how to make this work with NFS3 would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your time.

Update log info:

I did see that is calls the script üëç
/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/06\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh

However there is no reference to the nfs mount version in there.

In the log i do see this line:

If I can add the -v nfs3 to the line that should fix it???

I didn't check any details - for now only a quick hint:  
For me

<pre>
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
</pre>

always worked, see the examples in

Ok sorry about that. Here is the document.  
Also I dont have this dir on the system  
"usr/share/rear/conf/examples/"

There is one usr/share/rear/conf/templates  
I am assuming this is the same.

While mounting AIX nfs share on RHEL6 error "mount.nfs: Remote I/O
error" is seen  
Solution Verified - Updated May 23 2016 at 12:48 PM - English  
Environment

    NFS Server: IBM System p5 51A, OS - AIX
    IBM X3950
    NFS Client: Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL) 6 - All Releases

Issue

    While mounting AIX nfs shares, the following error is obtained:
    Raw

    mount.nfs: Remote I/O error

Resolution  
Aix NFS server with NFSv4 protocol support

    This may be due to a misconfiguration of NFSv4 on the Aix NFS server. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1463043

Aix NFS server without NFSv4 protocol support

    To resolve the issue, mount the nfs share with an option vers=3. Eg:
    Raw

    # mount -o vers=3 server_ip_addr:dir local_mount_point

This option can be added to /etc/fstab file so that the share will be
mounted automatically. See Mounting NFS File Systems using /etc/fstab in
the Storage Administration Guide for more details.  
Root Cause

    The NFS client tries to use NFSv4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 by default. When talking to the old (AIX-based) NFS servers, in order to be able to mount the NFS shares we need to add options -o vers=3.

From the log file. Looks like it is not passing the options as I was
hoping.  
notice no version 3 on the command line.

I looked in here /usr/share/rear/conf and the only place I can find for
this BACKUP\_OPTIONS= is in this file default.conf

From the file

<pre>
# BACKUP=RBME
##
# This mode allows restoring a RBME backup from NFS shares.
# As NFSv4 is not fully supported with rear (yet) it is safer to
# use BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock" in the local.conf file.
# Also, do not forget to open the TCP/UDP ports on the NFS server (iptables)!
</pre>

For me it works with this etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
</pre>

when I run "rear -d -D mkrescue"  
I get in my log file (excerpts)

<pre>
++ BACKUP_OPTIONS=nfsvers=3,nolock
++ OUTPUT_OPTIONS=nfsvers=3,nolock
++ mount_url nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs /tmp/rear.D3Oix3D2tXnQ5nO/outputfs nfsvers=3,nolock
++ local options=nfsvers=3,nolock
++ mount_cmd='mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/nfs /tmp/rear.D3Oix3D2tXnQ5nO/outputfs'
...
+++ mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/nfs /tmp/rear.D3Oix3D2tXnQ5nO/outputfs
...
+++ mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/nfs /tmp/rear.D3Oix3D2tXnQ5nO/outputfs
</pre>

But when I specify an additional OUTPUT\_URL

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
</pre>

then I get after "rear -d -D mkrescue" in my log

<pre>
++ BACKUP_OPTIONS=nfsvers=3,nolock
++ mount_url nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs /tmp/rear.TyKAjkNUJMIPVVx/outputfs nfsvers=3,nolock
++ local options=nfsvers=3,nolock
...
+++ mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/nfs /tmp/rear.TyKAjkNUJMIPVVx/outputfs
...
+++ mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime 10.160.4.244:/nfs /tmp/rear.TyKAjkNUJMIPVVx/outputfs
</pre>

Note that "OUTPUT\_OPTIONS=nfsvers=3,nolock" is missing  
and then "nfsvers=3,nolock" is missing for the second  
mount command.

Accordingly with

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
OUTPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
</pre>

both mount commands have "nfsvers=3,nolock"  
but I think it is simpler to only specify  
BACKUP\_URL and BACKUP\_OPTIONS.

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
# specify the location of the output
# when OUTPUT_URL is not specified it inherits the BACKUP_URL value
OUTPUT_URL=
OUTPUT_OPTIONS=
</pre>

I assume the issue is solved by my above comments  
so that I close it - if not @unix1adm you can reopen it.

No it was not resolved. I will try this again. i still have the issue.

I just reread this and saw you added a 2nd option for the output url.

I made the change and ran a test.  
Seems to have backed up as expected.

Thank you so much for the help. Made my day :)
