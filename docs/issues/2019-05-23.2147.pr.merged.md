-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me via  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Before output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh falsely errors out
with

    Could not copy '/usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT_usage_FOO.txt'

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495010023](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495010023)  
when `OUTPUT=FOO` is used where no  
usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT\_usage\_FOO.txt  
exists.  
Currently only  
usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT\_usage\_PXE.txt  
usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT\_usage\_RAMDISK.txt  
usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT\_usage\_ISO.txt  
usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT\_usage\_RAWDISK.txt  
usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT\_usage\_USB.txt  
exists so that 950\_copy\_result\_files.sh falsely errors out for all  
other OUTPUT methods.

Additionally 950\_copy\_result\_files.sh is now skipped  
if RESULT\_FILES is empty at the beginning of the script  
because I think if there are no actual RESULT\_FILES  
it means there is no actual output and then is is useless  
to copy VERSION and README and LOGFILE  
to the output location.  
I think it could be questionable if perhaps LOGFILE  
should be always copied to the output location  
even if there is no actual output.  
If LOGFILE should be always copied to the output location  
I can easily fix that.

I merge it right now.

I will of course fix them.
