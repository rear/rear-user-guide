-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Bareos 22.0.0 (stable) introduced [breaking
    changes](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/ReleaseNotes.html#breaking-changes)
    in their CLI tools. Bareos changed the way its binaries parse CLI
    arguments. Four existing options now require two minus signs (`--`)
    instead of one (`-`) .

Since Rear calls `bconsole -xc`, the latest release of bconsole returns
the following error (and exits with 113 exit code):

    # rear mkrescue                                                                                                              
    ERROR: Director not configured in bconsole                                                                                                                       
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 500_check_BAREOS_bconsole_results.sh:                                                     
      2022-12-28 07:30:58.877051019 Including prep/BAREOS/default/500_check_BAREOS_bconsole_results.sh                        
      The -xc and -xs options have changed.                                                                                                                          
      Use --xc and --xs as given in the help.                                                                                                                        
      Run with --help for more information.                                                                                                                          
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-host-example.log for details                                  
    Terminated

-   Workaround, if any:  
    It's possible to modify
    `usr/share/rear/prep/BAREOS/default/500_check_BAREOS_bconsole_results.sh`
    and replace `bconsole -xc` with `bconsole --xc`, but this will break
    compatibility with older (still supported) Bareos releases. It would
    be more appropriate to use the correct switch depending on the
    bconsole version.

For me it is not a bug but a needed enhancement in ReaR  
when ReaR does not yet support incompatible changes  
in newer versions of this or that tools.

@hseagle2015  
thank you for your issue report and for your fix!

Contributions for third-party backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have those third-party backup tools  
so we totally depend on contributions from people  
who use and know about third-party backup tools.
