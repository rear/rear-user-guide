Debian systems use
[setupcon](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/console-setup/setupcon.1.en.html)
to configure font and keyboard layout for the console.

Without specifying anything in the configuration ReaR uses `dumpkeys` to
backup the keyboard configuration and `loadkeys` to load it again. In my
case the `loadkeys` failed with an error about missing `ckbcomp`.

I had to add `ckbcomp` to `PROGS` to fix this, see
[https://github.com/schlomo/rear-ppdm/commit/bb41f08e47b11cc7c4fa493643911320a9f863ae](https://github.com/schlomo/rear-ppdm/commit/bb41f08e47b11cc7c4fa493643911320a9f863ae)

Looking at our code it seems to me like we don't consider systems with
`setupcon` at all, and I'm wondering if we wouldn't be better off by
simply supporting that and automatically including all required files.

In any case, a "small" fix was adding `ckbcomp` which will be part of my
next PR

Only a general side note:

The root cause of most issues with Debian based systems is  
that we have nobody from Canonical or Ubuntu or Debian  
who actively contributes to ReaR so support for  
Debian based systems is what they contribute.

Some time ago I talked to one who works at Canonical  
(about something different than disaster recovery)  
and I also described ReaR but unfortunately  
it seems Canonical is not (yet?) sufficiently  
interested in actively supporting upstream ReaR.

I am not a Debian or Ubuntu user  
(and I won't find time to test things there).  
I don't know what Canonical provides to their  
customers regarding disaster recovery.  
Perhaps something different so they don't need ReaR.
