that reads

    I do not understand why $(...) command substitution is used here.
    It looks as if it could be just removed but I am uncertain.
    Perhaps I overlook some obscure magic?
    But grep -q won't ouput anything so $(...) would execute nothing?

@rmetrich  
could you have a look here - if time permits?  
(I ask you because it is your code.)

Yes this `$(...)` didn't make any sense!
