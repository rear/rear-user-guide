If you use a USB disk, that was e.g. automatically mounted already in
/media, it's best to give an error, rather than mounting it again on a
separate location. Mounting one device at two locations could be
dangerous.

We could opt to use a bind-mount, but since the original mounted
filesystem is not managed by us, it's probably better to be safe than
sorry.
