hi,

just as a discussion for that topic: Currently on PPC64 REAR defines the
CMDLine of the  
linux kernel in:

    ./usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ppc64.conf
    KERNEL_CMDLINE="LANG=en_US.UTF-8 SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 KEYTABLE=us console=hvc0"

on SLES Systems however, there exists:

/etc/sysconfig/bootloader

which contains the original CMDLine and the fallback CMD line like this:

    LOADER_TYPE="ppc"
    DEFAULT_NAME="SLES11_SP4"
    DEFAULT_APPEND="quiet sysrq=1 insmod=sym53c8xx insmod=ipr crashkernel=512M-:256M"
    DEFAULT_VGA=""
    FAILSAFE_APPEND="quiet sysrq=1 insmod=sym53c8xx insmod=ipr crashkernel=512M-:256M"
    FAILSAFE_VGA=""
    XEN_KERNEL_APPEND="quiet sysrq=1 insmod=sym53c8xx insmod=ipr"

so i think it would make sense to:

1.  use KERNEL\_CMDLINE if it is set in the config to override default
    with special user settings
2.  if KERNEL\_CMDLINE is not set try to get it from
    /etc/sysconfig/bootloader
3.  if /etc/sysconfig/bootloader is not found, stick with the default
    that is currently used

Would it make also sense to create yaboot.conf with multiple boot
options even if the failsave  
and the normal boot on SLES seem to be the same in default installation?

@abbbi, since \#1442, I remove this specific KERNEL\_CMDLINE for power
(both ppc64/ppc64le).

Power are now using the same rear KERNEL\_CMDLINE than other arch.

Does it answer to you question ?

I assume with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1442](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1442)
merged  
this issue is fixed.  
If not, this issue can be reopened or a new issue should be  
created if there is a subsequent related but different problem.
