### Platform

Linux x64

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

The Cove team would like to propose an integration with the Backup
Manager. It will allow to use new `COVE` backup method.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The Backup Manager integration with Relax-and-Recover will be
implemented and tested by the Cove team.

@svlv  
thank you for your contribution to ReaR!

I had only a first quick look at your  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3464>  
and made some quick comments FYI.

But I could not yet do an actual analysis.  
To do that I need to get some basic understanding  
how the Backup Manager is meant to work.

Currently I am wondering why during "rear recover"  
the Backup Manager must be downloaded in any case.  
I read that the Backup Manager needs to be  
installed on the partitioned target disks  
and launched from there to restore the backup.  
But I do not yet understand why the Backup Manager  
could not get included in the ReaR recovery system  
during "rear mkrescue" or "rear mkbackup" and then  
during "rear recover" the included Backup Manager  
could get installed onto the target disk.

I ask because for all other backup methods in ReaR  
the backup restore tool and all what it needs to run  
(libraries, config files, whatever else) get included  
in the ReaR recovery system during "rear mkrescue"  
or "rear mkbackup" so the backup restore tool is available  
"ready to use" from within the ReaR recovery system  
without the need to download the backup restore tool  
from some external location.

With certain ReaR OUTPUT methods like OUTPUT=USB  
but (to some extent) also with OUTPUT=ISO  
the backup can be included on the same medium  
where the ReaR recovery system system is  
so the user can create one single medium  
(in particular a bootable external disk via OUTPUT=USB)  
that is self-contained for a disaster recovery.  
As far as it currently looks like, it seems this  
is (currently) not possible with BACKUP=COVE.

To avoid possible misunderstanding:  
It is no problem when some functionality or feature  
is not supported by certain backup methods in ReaR.  
I only like to get some basic understanding  
how the BACKUP=COVE method is meant to work.

Hello @jsmeix. Thank you for your time and comments. I am in progress of
applying them.

Let me explain how the Backup Manager integration with Relax-and-Recover
is intended to work.

1.  Backup Manager installation flow

    We added the ReaR tarball created by `make dist` into the Backup
    Manager installer (it's RUN package created via
    [makeself](https://makeself.io/)). During the Backup Manager
    installation process the ReaR tarball is extracted to
    `/opt/MXB/rear` directory. `/opt/MXB` is not a static folder in
    meaning that Cove users may have different installation location but
    this location in predefined by the particular installer.
    Additionally, the Backup Manager installer provides `site.conf`
    config file. It contains at the moment:

        BACKUP=COVE
        OUTPUT=ISO
        ISO_PREFIX="cove-rear"
        # static URL to CDN to download BM
        COVE_INSTALLER_URL="https://cdn.cloudbackup.management/maxdownloads/mxb-linux-x86_64.run"
        # it depends on the installer
        COVE_INSTALL_DIR="/opt/MXB"

    And some workarounds for Ubuntu but I am planning to propose fixes
    for that, so `site.conf` should contain only this params.

    The idea behind `site.conf` is to provide some predefined default
    values that are controlled by the Backup Manager. But users still
    can use `local.conf` to set up things.

2.  Backup flow

    Users must have two data sources: Files and folders and System state
    for Linux. System state for Linux is the ISO rescue image created by
    ReaR. The Backup Manager under the hood launches `rear mkrescue`
    (`rear` here is `/opt/MXB/rear/usr/sbin/rear`) and then backs up the
    created ISO image. It is supposed that `BACKUP=COVE` and
    `OUTPUT=ISO` because the Backup Manager expects that the ISO will be
    created and not any other type of `OUTPUT`.

3.  Recovery flow

    Users need to restore the backed up ISO image and then boot the
    device from this ISO rescue image.

    As you mentioned, ReaR downloads the installation package from the
    internet and the Backup Manager is installed on the target disks. By
    this we are solving the following problems:

    -   The Backup Manager included to the ISO image may be outdated and
        not compatible with new storage nodes.
    -   The Backup Manager requires certificates and they will be
        outdated even if they are copied to the ISO image. Moreover, the
        authorisation during the installation process is chanding at the
        moment to improve the security.
    -   Updating the Backup Manager during BMR
    -   Keep the ISO image as small as possible

    Currently we are working on creating the generic ISO image that will
    be used to get the rescue ISO image created by ReaR which is
    device-specific one. This generic ISO won't contain the Backup
    Manager as well but will download and install it.

    -   Process flow with genetic ISO

    After the installation, the Backup Manager restores the ISO image
    created by ReaR. Next, `initrd` for the rescue system is repacked to
    move the Backup Manager files into the rescue system. Next, the
    system is booted from the rescue `initrd` and kernel via `kexec`
    call. In this case the Backup Manager will be provided by the
    generic ISO and won't be downloaded from the internet. But we would
    like to support two ways: recovery directly from the rescue ISO
    created by ReaR (in that case users need to restore the rescue ISO,
    also it can be a workaround if the generic ISO is not bootable on
    the target device) and recovery from the generic ISO (it's more
    automated, users can use one single ISO to recover different
    devices). It is also a point why we do not include the Backup
    Manager in the rescue system.

Also, as far as I know, we are not really the first who want to download
the agent from the internet, e.g.
[410\_use\_replica\_cdm\_cluster\_cert.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/CDM/default/410_use_replica_cdm_cluster_cert.sh#L55-L64)

@svlv  
thank you for your explanations!

Today I won't find time to read them and  
tomorrow is public holiday in Germany  
and I am on vacation on Friday  
so (hopefully) next week...
