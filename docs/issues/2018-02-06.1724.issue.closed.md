This is a follow-up of another issue starting at

I guess (but I am not at all a sufficient networking expert  
to make an authoritative decision here) that this issue  
depends on "special hardware" - probably not on the ppc64  
architecture because @schabrolles tested ReaR a lot  
on POWER architecture - but perhaps more likely on special  
networking hardware (e.g. special network interface card).

@schabrolles  
if time permits, could you have a look here?

@schubiduuu  
according to your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701\#issuecomment-363384811](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701#issuecomment-363384811)  
you already use in your etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'yes' )
REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION="lzma"
</pre>

but that alone would not make all those kernel modules loaded  
in the recovery system that were loaded on your original system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701\#issuecomment-362537902](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701#issuecomment-362537902)

If the issue depends on the kernel driver for your network interface
card  
and/or on other kernel modules related to networking, you may also try  
if it helps to get all modules that were loaded on your original
system  
also loaded in the recovery system via

<pre>
MODULES_LOAD=( first_module second_module ... )
</pre>

where you could generate the list of needed modules in the right
ordering  
on the original system e.g. by a command like

<pre>
cat /proc/modules | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | tac
</pre>

under the assumption that /proc/modules lists last loaded modules
topmost.

I included every module listed in the output of "cat /proc/modules | cut
-d ' ' -f 1 | tac".

The issue still persists. The strange thing about this issue is that we
were able to use REAR with SLES11 and the same HW in the past. We didn't
change anything regarding devices, drivers, OS etc.

Local.conf of the initial post is updated to the current one.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2018-02-06 14:53](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724#issuecomment-363446158):

@schubiduuu  
if you were able to use an older version of ReaR  
with SLES11 and the same HW in the past  
it would be of interest which older version had worked for you  
(ideally up to which ReaR version it had worked for you).

The major rewite of 310\_network\_devices.sh  
is only available in the current ReaR GitHub master code since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/02937854b6ea2060a978d69355581ba93adb9e7e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/02937854b6ea2060a978d69355581ba93adb9e7e)

The last released ReaR version 2.3 still has the  
"traditional" 310\_network\_devices.sh (plus separated 360\_teaming.sh).

@schubiduuu  
could you verify if it works again when you downgrade your  
current ReaR GitHub master code to the released ReaR version 2.3.

To download RPM packages of ReaR version 2.3 see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

Hmmm...  
by the way I noticed that for SLE11 it is not built for POWER
architecture  
only for openSUSE\_Factory\_PowerPC it gets built for ppc64 and
ppc64le  
so that RPM packages of ReaR version 2.3 for POWER architecture  
are currently only available at  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE\_Factory\_PowerPC/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE_Factory_PowerPC/)  
but it should not matter for which SUSE product you use ReaR  
because ReaR is always the same bash scripts.

To downgrade a "git clone" of a ReaR GitHub master code  
to a particular git commit, for example to the git commit  
that matches theReaR version 2.3 release you can do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
find and checkout the desired git commit and finally  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# git log | grep -B5 'ReaR 2.3 release'

commit 37bfa9c8591a69c83ea48bae73b6b0286ac36e8c
Author: Gratien D'haese <gratien.dhaese@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 20 16:22:57 2017 +0100

    ReaR 2.3 release

# git reset --hard 37bfa9c8591a69c83ea48bae73b6b0286ac36e8c
HEAD is now at 37bfa9c8 ReaR 2.3 release

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

To run `git` on SLE11 you need the RPM package "git-core" for ppc64 on
SLE11.  
Currently I don't know wherefrom you could download it if you do not yet
have it.

The file "310\_network\_devices.sh" was modified to incoporate the
latest changes \#1701 .  
The version which worked for a while is:
rear-2.2-106.git.0.39e3103.unknown.changed.  
We had to test newer REAR version due to some issues we encountered
during some tests in the past.

I don't use the version for SLES11 on x86 but the
openSUSE\_Factory\_PowerPC version.

@schubiduuu  
I have no good news because I cannot reproduce  
any such issue on my SLES11 SP4 x86\_64 system  
with current ReaR GitHub master code.

On my SLES11 SP4 x86\_64 system everything "just works" for me  
for DHCP and  
for static IP address setup (same as the one of the original system)
and  
for manual network interface setup via

<pre>
NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip addr add 10.160.4.255/16 dev eth0' 'return' )
</pre>

and for manual network interface setup via recovery system kernel
command line parameters

<pre>
ip=10.160.4.255 nm=255.255.0.0 gw=10.160.255.245 netdev=eth0
</pre>

I found some minor issues related to manual network interface setup  
so that I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1725](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1725)  
but nothing really serious - even without that changes I always got a  
usable network interface eth0 so that both remote access via SSH  
and "rear recover" worked well for me.

I use this local.conf:

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="yes"
NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip addr add 10.160.4.255/16 dev eth0' 'return' )
FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )
</pre>

@schubiduuu  
does this issue and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701)  
appear only on one single system or do they appear on several systems?

In case of the latter do they appear only on same kind of hardware  
(e.g. only with one particular kind of network interface card)  
or do the issues appear on various different ppc64 systems?

Is "every SLES11 system (ppc)" same kind of hardware  
(in particular do all have same networking hardware)  
or do you have various different ppc64 systems?

I assume it only happens for SLES11 ppc64 systems  
but with SLES12 ppc64 systems it works  
or do you not have SLES12 ppc64 systems?

Yes we are speaking about the same hardware as each system is virtual
running on the same host.  
We have issues for SLES11 ppc64 but not for SLES12.

@schabrolles  
I dare to assign this issue to you - even if you may not have time right
now.

I will still have a look but as non-POWER user I can neither really
help  
with POWER architecture (PPC64) specific issues nor can I do  
a meaningful analysis what the root cause could be.

@schubiduuu, I got one idea,

I think your issue could be related to a TOO BIG initrd  
This is mostly due to the size of TSM client included into the rescue
image.

Try the following to reduce the amount of data to copy into the rescue
image:

    COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmc /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/tsmbench_inclexcl /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.opt /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/libgpfs.so /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/libdmapi.so /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/EN_US/dsmclientV3.cat /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* )

replace `/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/tsmbench_inclexcl` with your TSM
include/exclude file if you have one.

-   You normally don't need to copy the firmware files or all modules
    (try by removing those lines in your local.conf)

@schabrolles  
many thanks for having a look!

FYI  
why @schubiduuu has currently all kernel modules  
and firmware in his recovery system, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701)  
in particular starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701\#issuecomment-361954934](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701#issuecomment-361954934)  
and the subsequent comments, in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701\#issuecomment-363364586](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1701#issuecomment-363364586)

I did some googling for "SIOCSIFFLAGS: Invalid argument"  
and got the impression that this error message is usually related  
to low-level issues like unsupported networking hardware,  
misbehaving networking hardware kernel driver,  
no MAC address (or a MAC address 00:00:00:00:00:00),  
and things like that.

From that I assumed that needed kernel modules or even firmware  
might be missing in the recovery system.  
Therefore I suggested to try things like MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'yes' ) and MODULES\_LOAD=( ...), cf.

@jsmeix,

I remember I had an issue with SLES11 and too BIG initrd (with TSM).  
The symptoms were: rescue image can boot (even with too BIG initrd) but
I got network ERRORS and FiberChannel failures.

I got a Power LPAR with SLES11 and just tested it with current master
branch. it always boot without having to specify :  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'yes' )  
=&gt; I recommend to not use them, because I want to have the smallest
initrd as possible.

A good think would be to have the latest kernel updated for SLES11 SP4.

@schabrolles  
in general it would be good when during "rear mkrescue" it could
autodetect  
as many issues as possible that would later lead to failures during
"rear recover"  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718\#issuecomment-361871332](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718#issuecomment-361871332)

Do you think it is possible to autodetect during "rear mkrescue"  
that the ReaR initrd is too big and error out in this case?

@schabrolles We followed you advice to include less files to reduce the
size of the recovery boot media and voilà we are able to use the network
interfaces and we are currently running a restore. Thanks so far for
this incredible helpful advice. 👍

I set this "support question" issue to "fixed/solved/done"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724\#issuecomment-364113716](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724#issuecomment-364113716)  
see my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859)  
which intends to make such issues more obvious to the user  
provided corrupted or missing files in the recovery system  
are the root cause of this issue here.

@jsmeix, You're right, I think \#1859 could really help here. If initrd
cannot be uncompressed totally due to lack of space, we should detect it
with md5sums (file missing or with different size).

@schabrolles  
could you explain the reason behind why in particular on POWER
architecture  
it might happen that the "initrd cannot be uncompressed totally due to
lack of space"  
because I would think in particular on POWER systems there is plenty of
"space"  
(I assume that "space" is main memory).

@jsmeix, It is specific to the PowerVM (Firmware based
virtualization).  
During LPAR (aka Logical Partition which could be seen as a VM) boot,
the Power Hardware hypervisor allocates private space for the bootstrap
(256MB). I don't have all the detail (and knowledge) about this very
specific phase (virtual firmware of the LPAR before LPAR kernel
bootstrap), but this 256MB should store some Firmware information,
kernel and initrd (compressed). It seems that the 256MB is hardcoded in
Linux kernel for Power ( variable ppc64\_rma\_size ). Recent Redhat
(since rhel7.4) and Suse (since sles12sp2) should have 512MB RMA size.

Finding a rule to know what is the maximum size allowed is a bit
difficult as it depends on:

-   Power FW version
-   Kernel version (256MB or 512MB)
-   number of real and virtual adapters (will increase space needed by
    the FW part)

So, having something that tell us that something is wrong about initrd
data in the recovery system is a good start even if it would be better
to have it during backup or rear-initrd creation (rear mkrescue).

@schabrolles  
many thanks for your explanation.  
Now I understand the reason behind.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1864](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1864)
merged  
corrupt files in the recovery system should be detected  
and reported in an obvious way.

I assume this isssue is meanwhile sufficiently answered  
and handled so that I can close it hereby.
