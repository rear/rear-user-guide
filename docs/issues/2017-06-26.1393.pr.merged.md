-   Without this modification, rear always think it is still on the
    same  
    system to restore and always avoid migration.
-   /dev/mapper contains link to real /dev/dm-X files managed and  
    generated by device mapper.  
    We do not have to copy them manually and let them being recreated
    by  
    device mapper during recovery process.

tested on SLES11, SLE12, RH7

@schabrolles  
I dared to do some minor spelling fixes in your comment like  
"rear" -&gt; "ReaR" and "link" -&gt; "links".
