Horever, for recovery I transfer the file to a network share hence the
commented out options at the bottom, i just switch those on and off.

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    PC

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    32

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    BIOS

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    local

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    When I try run recovery I get mount fail "mount: fs type, bad
    option, bad supereblock"  
    in dmesg I get CIFS VFS: No username specified.

I have cifs-utils-4.8.1-19.e16.i686 installed.

I try mounted with just the mount command by it self such as

mount -t cifs -o credentials=/root/cifs,vers=1.0 //192.168.1.100
/mnt/test

i've tried different variation without vers or different vers like
2.0,3.0. Same issue, I am suspecting maybe this is an issue with the
recovery disk itself? However I do use 192.168.1.100 file server on my
other systems running ReaR version 2.4 without issues.

-   Workaround, if any:

don't mind the "/root/.cifs" versus "/root/cifs" that was just a typom
in creating this ticket, that type doesn't exist within the
configuration.  
[rear-vox.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3347211/rear-vox.log)

Not sure if this is a recovery iso issue, but when I enter mount.cifs :
command not found

I don't use CIFS but "man rear" reads  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

    BACKUP_URL=cifs://
      To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use
        BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path
      To provide credentials for CIFS mounting
      use a /etc/rear/cifs credentials file and define
        BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"
      and pass along:
        username=_username_
        password=_secret password_
        domain=_domain_

In general during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" what is specific  
for a particular backup method gets included in the ReaR recovery
system  
via various automatisms in the scripts that run during "rear
mkrescue/mkbackup".

Therefore in general it does not work to do "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
with one backup method and then switch to another different backup
method  
for "rear recover" because the ReaR recovery system would only contain  
what is specific for the backup method during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
but not what is specific for the backup method during "rear recover".

Cf. the documentation about "Using Multiple Backups for
Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
therein see in particular the section about  
"Relax-and-Recover Setup for Different Backup Methods"

To verify in advance that all what you need to use CIFS during "rear
recover"  
is in your ReaR recovery system use KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR so that you can
see  
what in your /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs actually is in your particular
case.  
In /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs are the files of the ReaR recovery system.  
See the KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR description in default.conf e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L128](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L128)

Then `chroot` into /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs and try out if you can use
CIFS  
from within your ReaR recovery system environment as you need it.

One thing that you cannot test with `chroot /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs` is  
that all needed kernel modules are available in the ReaR recovery
system  
but with `chroot /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs` you can find some missing
pieces  
earlier and easier compared to the real "rear recover" test.

E.g. CIFS needs the `cifs` kernel module, cf.  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/050\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh

    # include required modules, like nfs cifs ...
    ...
    MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" $(url_scheme $BACKUP_URL) )

plus some more modules like on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system:

    # lsmod | grep cifs
    [no output]

    # modprobe cifs

    # lsmod | grep cifs
    cifs                  794624  0
    dns_resolver           16384  2 cifs,nfsv4
    fscache                73728  3 cifs,nfsv4,nfs

Fortunately since ReaR 2.5 by default all kernel modules  
get included in the ReaR recovery system so that  
since ReaR 2.5 there should be no longer the various  
kernel module related issues in the ReaR recovery system  
that we had before ReaR 2.5, cf. the issues mentioned at  
"Now there is in default.conf MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )" in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5)

Nevertheless a real "rear recover" verification is still mandatory in
any case,  
cf. "No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation"
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@chumunga check you rear log file when you run **mkbackup** to see
whether *mount.cifs* is copied to the rescue image (as it was apparently
missing in the recover phase)

I checked the logs and this was the only trace of cifs,

`/lib/modules/2.6.32-431.el6.i686/kernel/fs/cifs' -> `/tmp/rear.Z5GVsZWlT8ABPRm/rootfs/lib/modules/2.6.32-431.el6.i686/kernel/fs/cifs'

`/lib/modules/2.6.32-431.el6.i686/kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko' -> `/tmp/rear.Z5GVsZWlT8ABPRm/rootfs/lib/modules/2.6.32-431.el6.i686/kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko'

This was after i add this parameter to the local.conf

MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )

however in my recovery environment mount.cifs still doesn't show but
when i run

mount -t cifs <target> <mountpoint> -o
username=username,password=pass,vers=(1.0, 2.0,3.0)

I get a new error message saying the mount is read only and fails to
mount.

@jsmeix I think I am understanding what your saying, are you implying
that the backup location (or backup parameters) determines how my
options to how I can recover or what I can do in the recovery options?

@chumunga  
the ReaR recovery system that gets created during "rear
mkrescue/mkbackup"  
is specific for the host and its environment where "rear
mkrescue/mkbackup" was run.  
In particular the ReaR recovery system is specific for

-   the disk layout (partitioning, filesystems, mount points)
-   the bootloader
-   the network environment
-   the backup method
-   and more...

Cf. the section "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

sorry been on PTO, thanks for the update.

I eventually got this to work by installed 2.4 and RPM-ing the files
from centos 7 32bit repository at centos.org
