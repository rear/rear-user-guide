See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2132\#issuecomment-487960213](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2132#issuecomment-487960213)  
for the original issue.

With current ReaR github master code  
build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh can get in conflict  
with what rescue/default/010\_merge\_skeletons.sh did before  
when the `COPY_AS_IS` array contains a symlink to a directory  
that was already created in ROOTFS\_DIR by 010\_merge\_skeletons.sh

Example:

    # mkdir /etc/myscripts

    # echo myscript >/etc/myscripts/myscript

    # ln -s /etc/myscripts /etc/scripts

    # find /etc -ls | grep myscripts
    ... drwxr-xr-x ... /etc/myscripts
    ... -rw-r--r-- ... /etc/myscripts/myscript
    ... lrwxrwxrwx ... /etc/scripts -> /etc/myscripts

and in etc/rear/local.conf

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/scripts )

results

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Copying files and directories
    ERROR: Failed to copy files and directories in COPY_AS_IS minus COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE

I think as the current code is it is even good that it fails  
in this particular case.

This particular case is only the tip of an iceberg:

In other cases it just blindly proceeds and `COPY_AS_IS` array elemets  
can just overwrite anything that was already created in ROOTFS\_DIR  
by 010\_merge\_skeletons.sh - i.e. `COPY_AS_IS` can destroy needed  
recovery system content.

Example:

    # mkdir /etc/scripts

    # echo my-system-setup >/etc/scripts/system-setup

    # find /etc/scripts -ls
    ... drwxr-xr-x ... /etc/scripts

    ... -rw-r--r-- ... /etc/scripts/system-setup

and in etc/rear/local.conf

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/scripts )

results

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Copying files and directories
    Copying binaries and libraries
    ...
    Running exit tasks
    You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.CdodUBnLMNMmf3m

but now `etc/scripts/system-setup` in the recovery system  
is overwritten by the content from /etc/scripts/system-setup  
on the original system

    # cat /tmp/rear.CdodUBnLMNMmf3m/rootfs/etc/scripts/system-setup
    my-system-setup

I think we should test in build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
if directories are already there and when files that are already there  
would be overwrtitten.
