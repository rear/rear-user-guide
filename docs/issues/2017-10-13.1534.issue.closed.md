-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    BIOS.
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    The ReaR command "rear recover" starts in the recovery environment
    normally.  
    But then when no /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD existed in the server, ReaR
    doesn't show up an correct prompt for the password for the TSM
    client.
-   Work-around, if any:  
    Type in the password without knowing about it.

Full detailed log is attached.

By this step of the "rear recover" workflow, ReaR should ask the user
for the communication password of the TSM client but it doesn't (and so
the workflow hangs here forever in a loop):

    RESCUE brp-server:~ # rear recover
    Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / 2017-07-20
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-brp-server.log
    Running workflow recover within the ReaR rescue/recovery system

    TSM restores by default the latest backup data. Alternatively you can specify
    a different date and time to enable Point-In-Time Restore. Press ENTER to
    use the most recent available backup
    Enter date/time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) or press ENTER [30 secs]:
    Skipping Point-In-Time Restore, will restore most recent data.
    ^CERROR: 'dsmc query filespace' failed !
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-brp-server.log for details
    Terminated

And by this input the workflow waits for user input but without showing
the output from TSM (for encryption/decryption):

    RESCUE brp-server:~ # rear recover
    Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / 2017-07-20
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-brp-server.log
    Running workflow recover within the ReaR rescue/recovery system

    TSM restores by default the latest backup data. Alternatively you can specify
    a different date and time to enable Point-In-Time Restore. Press ENTER to
    use the most recent available backup
    Enter date/time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) or press ENTER [30 secs]:
    Skipping Point-In-Time Restore, will restore most recent data.

    The TSM Server reports the following for this node:
                      #     Last Incr Date          Type    File Space Name

@dcz01  
many thanks for testing the current ReaR master code  
together with TSM!  
We really need users who test the current ReaR master code  
with their particular third-party backup software.  
Such tests help us very much to get issues fixed in advance  
before ReaR v 2.3 is released.

I am not a TSM user so that I cannot reproduce  
anything that is specific for TSM.

In general when an intercative program waits for user input  
but without showing any output to the user (e.g. no prompt)  
that program call must be fixed so that it is run with the  
original file descriptors when usr/sbin/rear was launched like

<pre>
COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

see "What to do with stdout and stderr" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6ab3c4173fe425bb018880af4a8461bf575ba1e0](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6ab3c4173fe425bb018880af4a8461bf575ba1e0)  
STDOUT is redirected into the log file  
see also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1399](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1399)

When STDOUT is redirected into the log file  
there could be regressions, see

I know nothing about TSM so that I could be totally wrong here  
but in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1382135/rear-brp-server.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1382135/rear-brp-server.log)  
I found the following suspiciously looking message  
"Please enter your user id <BRP-SERVER>:"  
that is not in the ReaR code so that I guess it  
comes from TSM:

<pre>
+ source /usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/400_verify_tsm.sh
...
++ dsmc query filespace -date=2 -time=1 -scrollprompt=no
++ grep -A 10000 File
Please enter your user id <BRP-SERVER>: ++ '[' 12 -eq 0 -o 12 -eq 8 ']'
++ StopIfError ''\''dsmc query filespace'\'' failed !'
++ ((  1 != 0  ))
++ Error ''\''dsmc query filespace'\'' failed !'
</pre>

If my guess is right the "dsmc query filespace" command in  
verify/TSM/default/400\_verify\_tsm.sh  
is (or sometimes could be) an interactively running command  
so that it requires to be called with appropriate file descriptors  
but because it is used in a pipe

<pre>
LC_ALL=${LANG_RECOVER} dsmc query filespace -date=2 -time=1 -scrollprompt=no | grep -A 10000 'File' >$TMP_DIR/tsm_filespaces
</pre>

its stdout file descriptor cannot be changed.

It also seems that the "dsmc restore" command in  
restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
is (or sometimes could be) an interactively running command  
so that it requires to be called with appropriate file descriptors  
but because it is also used in a pipe its stdout file descriptor  
also cannot be changed.

Regarding the oversophisticated "animated\_cursor" functionality  
(why the "dsmc restore" command is run in a pipe), see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398\#issuecomment-313097020](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398#issuecomment-313097020)  
and subsequent comments.

@dcz01  
only a blind proposal because I do not have TSM:  
Does it perhaps work better when you simplify  
usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
to something like

<pre>
for num in $TSM_RESTORE_FILESPACE_NUMS ; do
    filespace="${TSM_FILESPACES[$num]}"
    # make sure FileSpace has a trailing / (for dsmc)
    test "${filespace:0-1}" == "/" || filespace="$filespace/"
    LogPrint "Restoring ${filespace}"
    TsmProcessed=""
    Log "Running 'dsmc restore ${filespace}* $TARGET_FS_ROOT/$filespace -verbose -subdir=yes -replace=all -tapeprompt=no ${TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS[@]}'"
    LC_ALL=${LANG_RECOVER} dsmc restore \""${filespace}"\" \""$TARGET_FS_ROOT/${filespace}/"\" \
        -verbose -subdir=yes -replace=all \
        -tapeprompt=no "${TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS[@]}" \
        0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
done
</pre>

@schabrolles  
I do not understand the overcomplicated looking quoting in

<pre>
... dsmc restore \""${filespace}"\" \""$TARGET_FS_ROOT/${filespace}/"\"
</pre>

Can you provide background information what the reason behind is?

@jsmeix I'm not a TSM expert, but I would say it is to protect against
space or special characters.  
`dsmc restore "/my filesystem" "/target/my filesystem"`

I think usually double quotes do not sufficiently protect (e.g. not
against '$')  
but perhaps the intent is that $var gets evaluated like in

<pre>
dsmc restore "/$myfilesystem" "/target/$myfilesystem"
</pre>

Normally would use single quotes to avoid any shell evaluation e.g. like

<pre>
#  foo=' $( echo FOO ) '

# echo $foo
$( echo FOO )

# echo "$foo"
 $( echo FOO ) 

# echo "'$foo'"
' $( echo FOO ) '

# eval echo "'$foo'"
 $( echo FOO ) 

# eval echo "$foo"
FOO

# eval echo \""$foo"\"
 FOO 
</pre>

@jsmeix  
1- I made several test by simplified quoting... Seems to work even if
there is "spaces" in the Path.  
2- I had some difficulties to use the `0<&6 1>&7 2>&8` redirection on
the first `dsmc` call because this one is used with PIPE.

    dsmc query filespace -date=2 -time=1 -scrollprompt=no | grep -A 10000 'File' >$TMP_DIR/tsm_filespaces

I decided then to add a NEW first connection before this line
(`dsmc query mgmt`).  
It just print some information about the server. If the TSM passwd file
is missing, it will ask the user to enter login/passwd to the prompt.

    dsmc query mgmt 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8

@dcz01 with \#1539 merged, TSM should ask for ID/passwd on the prompt
when TSM passwd is not part of the rescue image.  
Waiting for your confirmation before closing this one.

@schabrolles Well i would like to test your changes but i can't because
the other bug isn't fixed yet with the missing librarys -&gt; \#1533

@dcz01,

I'm made a small change in the code to ask TSM password sooner.  
Could you give it a try and tell me if it is better :

    git clone http://github.com/schabrolles/rear
    cd rear
    git checkout TSM_ask_passwd_2
    make install

If you prefer this one, I'll create a Pull Request.

@schabrolles I'm sorry, i cannot test this little change of the code
because our servers to test cannot reach the internet above the proxy of
my business.  
And i can't change the proxy settings myself.

I installed git but it doesn't work.

@dcz01,

`yum install patch` on a rhel6 should be enough to get access to the
patch command.

@schabrolles There is now an error in the recovery:

I think we can cancel this issue here and restore the old defaults from
the files in ReaR like it was in ReaR 2.0 to 2.2.  
This is because an TSM client with ReaR recovery should always have an
password file to be copied to the rescue image.

that will prompt for TSM password via a separated script  
as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1641](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1641)  
was merged into the ReaR master code.

@dcz01  
this is probably not what you want according to your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1534\#issuecomment-350741413](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1534#issuecomment-350741413)  
but I think it is at least a step into the right direction  
to get the TSM first connection via "dsmc query mgmt"  
out of usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/400\_verify\_tsm.sh  
into a separated script  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/389\_check\_TSM\_connexion.sh  
because now you could simply remove that separated script  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/389\_check\_TSM\_connexion.sh  
if it causes problems for you.

Later that separated script could be adapted and enhanced  
it to make TSM work even without a TSM password file  
in the ReaR recovery system because in general the  
recovery system should not contain secrets.

According to what I read in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533)  
it seems such a TSM password file is something like  
/etc/adsm/TSM.PWD or /etc/opt/tb017/security/TSM.PWD  
and I assume that file contains secrets.

@dcz01  
I would like to know if TSM restore works for you even with  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/389\_check\_TSM\_connexion.sh  
when you have your TSM password file in your recovery system.

@jsmeix @schabrolles Yes, the restore with an TSM password file
(TSM.PWD) works fine.  
But the first connection to test if password is available should be a
litte bit shorter.  
We could maybe use the `dsmc query session` command instead of
`dsmc query mgmt`?

As far as I (as non-TSM user) understand the issue now,  
it is currently no actual bug in ReaR that TSM backup restore  
requires a 'TSM.PWD' file in the recovery system because  
currently this is how TSM support is implemented in ReaR.

But TSM support should be enhanced in a future ReaR release  
so that TSM backup restore also works without 'TSM.PWD'

@dcz01  
I cannot decide if for the connection test

dsmc query session

could also be used because (as non-TSM user) I don't know  
if that command would be a valid connection test in any case  
so that I like to leave that part to @schabrolles

I have closed this issue for ReaR 2.3 because  
as far as I understand it TSM works as currently intended.

I guess the root cause of all evil could be the overcomplicated  
way how the "dsmc restore" command is called in  
usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
because it is currently not called as

<pre>
dsmc restore ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

If the "dsmc restore" command shows a password prompt  
via STDERR that password prompt is currently redirected  
into the ReaR log file so that you won't see it on your terminal.

@jsmeix With "doesn't display all password inputs" i mean that some
inputs of the password like of the encryption or decryption of files is

I think we should change the wohle `dsmc` command from ReaR...  
Is the `-verbose` option important for ReaR or could it be the `-quiet`
option instead?

@dcz01 @schabrolles  
is it possible to provide passwords via command line options  
to 'dsmc restore' i.e. via TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS  
because conf/default.conf reads:

<pre>
# Additional dsmc options for restore. Point-in-time read from user
# input is also added to this array.
TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS=( )
</pre>

and I wonder what "Point-in-time read from user input" means?

@jsmeix Yes, it is possible to deliver the TSM client directly the
password with an extra option.  
But i think this would not be enough...  
The best solution is to check if an password file or (in TSM 8.1) many
password files exist and if not then offer the chance to enter an
administrator id and the password of that id.  
Also should an extra option in `TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS` be used to
avoid the automatic password change on the TSM server with the
`-virtualnodename` option.

Or ReaR deletes by default the entry `PASSWORDACCESS GENERATE` in the
`/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys` file when creating the rescue
image.  
Then the TSM client always wants the input of an password for each
session and we don't need the `-virtualnodename` option.

@jsmeix, for security, the best would be to not include `/etc/adsm`
directory by default in `COPY_AS_IS_TSM` array.  
and create an option like `ADD_TSM_PASSWD_IN_RESCUE` in default.conf
file to activate the TSM password inclusion into the rear rescue image.

I cannot test if or how it works in practice  
but with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1646](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1646)  
it should now at least be technically possible to also specify
TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS on command line.  
The idea behind is that this way the user may not need  
TSM password files in the recovery system but he could  
specify the needed TSM passwords via

<pre>
export TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS=( ... )
</pre>

directly before he calls "rear recover".  
If there is TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS  
set in /etc/rear/local.conf the user could alternatively  
add the TSM password options there as usual.  
The way via 'export' on command line is just for  
convenience.  
In both cases the dscm options (i.e. also password options)  
will appear in the ReaR log file and the ReaR log file is  
copied into the recreated system so that one must  
care about possible secrets in the ReaR log file,  
cf. my code comments about "security relevant information" in  
usr/share/rear/wrapup/default/990\_copy\_logfile.sh
