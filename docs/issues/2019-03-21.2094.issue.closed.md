@kkoehle,

I tried rear from the git repo on a sles12 without any issue (on KVM not
PowerVM)

I notice that you don't have `POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT` in your rear
local.conf file.

Here is the part I usually add to my SLES12 servers.

    ## SLES12
    #BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=4,nolock"
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" snapper chattr lsattr )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )

    for subvol in $(findmnt -n -r -t btrfs | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash') ; do
            BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE[@]}" "$subvol" )
    done

    POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( 'if snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT get-config | grep -q "^QGROUP.*[0-9]/[0-9]" ; then snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT set-config QGROUP= ; snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT setup-quota && echo snapper setup-quota done || echo snapper setup-quota failed ; else echo snapper setup-quota not used ; fi' )

@schabrolles

I added the POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and no change. I don't imagine it is
a KVM vs PowerVM thing that determines if a disk shows bootable. Does
your SLES12 install use LVM and BTRFS for the boot disk?:

     PowerPC Firmware
     Version FW860.11 ### (SV860_063)
     SMS (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 2000,2016 All rights reserved.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Current Boot Sequence
     1.   Device is not bootable or removed.
     2.    None
     3.    None
     4.    None
     5.    None

What can I do to make PowerVM think it is bootable? Why is there no
error message saying the bootloader didn't work? Is there anything I
should check for?

@kkoehle,

agree, I don't think my KVM test could explain the difference. I think
there is something wrong with grub2 but I never had this on my rear on
Power test.

you can try to run `rear -d recover` to have a debug log and check if
something wrong happens during the grub installation.  
`usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/620_install_grub2.sh`

I won't be available from today to end of next week.

@jsmeix do you think it could be related to \#2093

@kkoehle  
use `rear -d -D recover` (i.e. with `-D`) to get a full debug log,

@schabrolles  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2093](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2093)
looks totally unrelated  
because there `1:1 restore for all fs and disks works fine`.

But what happens in this issue here is not a recovery  
on 100% compatible hardware because in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2993248/rear.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2993248/rear.txt)  
there is (excerpts)

    ***** At this point I change the line: 
        lvm lvcreate -L 64424509440b -n root system <<<y
    ****** to: 
        lvm lvcreate -L 55g -n root system <<<y
    ***** I do this because I am restoring a disk that was 100 GB to a 60 GB disk, and the 64424509440b is too big (especially since swap still needs 2 GB)

So the recovery hapens on a smaller disk and that is a migration  
that will for sure not just work.

I was wondering why that

    Partition primary on /dev/mapper/36005076802818158a4000000000004c0: size reduced to fit on disk.

happened because that is a far too late "desperate" mesage from  
the create\_partitions() function when it works aready with  
wrong data in disklayout.conf

I would have expected to see messages from  
layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
because of

    Device mapper!36005076802818158a400000000000495 does not exist (manual configuration needed)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration

we are in MIGRATION\_MODE where in particular scripts like  
layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
should run (regardless that this script alone does not help here  
because in case of LVM manual adaptions are needed anyway,  
cf. the `Resizing partitions in MIGRATION_MODE during "rear recover"`  
section in default.conf:

I think I know why
layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
doesn't actually do something in this particular case:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2998736/rear-hana-n3.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2998736/rear-hana-n3.log)
contains

    + source /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh
    ...
    ++ cp /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf.resized_last_partition
    ...
    +++ grep '^disk ' /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
    ++ mv /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf.resized_last_partition /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

i.e. `grep '^disk ' /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` does not find
anything.

@kkoehle  
we also need at least your var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
plus some more additional files in the /var/lib/rear/ directory  
and in its sub-directories in the ReaR recovery system,  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Be careful when attaching files here to not make  
possibly confidential internal information public here.  
I.e. you may have to obfuscate some values in those files  
before you upload those files here.  
On the other hand you should not obfuscate too much  
so that it would become impossible for us to see  
what actually goes on on your particular system.

Additionally describe as exact as you can how  
your replacement system where you run "rear recover" differs from  
your original system where you had run "rear mkbackup/mkrescue".

@schabrolles @jsmeix, I found the problem: the boot flag never gets set
on the correct partition:
