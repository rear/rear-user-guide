I recognised the below and I assume the CI for the ReaR repository is
broken since then:

> Since June 15th, 2021, the building on
> [travis-ci.org](http://www.travis-ci.org/) is ceased. Please use
> [travis-ci.com](http://www.travis-ci.com/) from now on.

Not knowing all technical details I suppose this needs to be changed to
re-activate a proper CI testing for ReaR.

Hello @hpannenb , I haven't seen Travis CI checks even long before June
15th, 2021. I went through old merged PRs and the last one that seems to
have been tested is
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2347](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2347).  
That said, the checks performed in that CI were very basic, so the
regression is not huge. @antonvoznia has been working on more complete
tests as a topic of his diploma thesis.  
We can also test building RPMs using Packit, @antonvoznia I suppose this
can be enabled almost immediately, can you please open a PR?

@pcahyna Thanks for the status. So I suppose the non-working Travis CI
(links) should be removed from the `README.adoc` then?

@hpannenb I suppose so, has it been useful anyway to have such links in
the README document, even if they were working?

Up to now I had never noticed that link.  
I always overlooked that little image because it was meaningless for
me  
without some text what that image actually means.  
I know - I know - I am way too old school ;-)

Personally, I find such little images a bit annoying. Maybe they are
suitable for developer docs, but the README seems mostly end-user
oriented.
