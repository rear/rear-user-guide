… by attempting to unmount device before backup/restore.

-   Type:**Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2200](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2200)

-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   test VM installed with Leap 15.0 (grub2-efi, LVM, filesystems
        are ext4 and xfs)
    -   created new, LUKS-encrypted logical volume with xfs mounted on
        /products
    -   stored an extra decryption passphrase into slot \#1 of LUKS
        header (main key in slot \#0)
    -   created a "multiple backup" configuration where the base system
        is backed up the usual way (ISO + NETFS to NFS share), ignoring
        /products, while the block device that hosts /products is then
        backed up (mkbackuponly) using the BLOCKCLONE method. See
        configuration files below:  
        [site.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3466879/site.conf.txt)  
        [base\_system.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3466880/base_system.conf.txt)  
        [products\_backup.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3466881/products_backup.conf.txt)
    -   the new option `BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT` is set to "yes"
    -   during /products backup phase (mkbackuponly), the filesystem is
        now successfully unmounted prior to issuing the `dd` command
    -   at the end of the backup phase, that filesystem is also
        successfully re-mounted
    -   the test VM is then shut down and its virtual HDD is deleted and
        recreated empty (same size, in this case)
    -   during base system recover phase, the encrypted filesystem is
        correctly recreated (the user is prompted to enter a new
        passphrase -- which will later be overwritten). No data is
        restored on that filesystem as we ignored it through
        `BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE`
    -   during /products restore phase (restoreonly) the target device
        (`/dev/vg00/lvol4`) is successfully unmounted prior to issuing
        the `dd` command, which overwrites the recreated encrypted
        filesystem with the original LUKS keys and all the filesystem
        data
    -   upon reboot of the VM, all filesystems are clean, /products can
        be decrypted using any of the 2 original passphrases and can be
        successfully mounted

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    -   new configuration variable `BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT` in
        `default.conf`, including short documentation
    -   `500_start_clone.sh` now use existing global function
        `umount_mountpoint()` to try and unmount the source device if
        `BLOCKCLONE_TRY_UNMOUNT` is set to "yes". It obtains the mount
        point through a new global function called `get_mountpoint()`
    -   if the unmounting fails, `500_start_clone.sh` proceeds as
        before, issuing a warning message that the backup has been taken
        while the source device was mounted
    -   if the device was initially mounted AND it could be unmounted,
        then `500_start_clone.sh` attempts to re-mounted it before
        exiting
    -   `400_restore_clone.sh` now implements the same checks and
        unmount attempt as `500_start_clone.sh`. It does NOT try to
        remount the target device at the end, but issues a warning
        message instead
    -   bug fix in global function `umount_mountpoint()`: return value
        now visible by calling script
    -   cosmetics in global function `is_device_mounted()`: local
        variables now defined as `local`
    -   new global function `get_mountpoint()`
    -   extensive documentation of the new `BLOCKCLONE` use-case in the
        User Guide, chapter 12
    -   fixed typo in User Guide, chapter 11, "multiple backups"

@gozora  
could you have a look here?

FYI:  
I am not in the office for some weeks so that I cannot do much for
ReaR,  
in particular I cannot try out something.

I'll take a look as time permits (most probably during this weekend) ...

Updated code to fulfil both suggestions by @gozora.

Short comment about fixes in `is_device_mounted()` function:

-   local variables now defined as local (was already the case in my
    first commit)
-   fixed an 'inverse logic' bug in the test for empty parameter: not
    mounted or not found should return 0, not 1
-   added missing early exit to the test for empty parameter -- passing
    an empty argument to the function might have resulted in an error
    similar to the following:

<!-- -->

    ./fn_is_mounted: line 10: [: [SWAP]: binary operator expected

All of this does nothing to address the (valid) remark of @jsmeix about
the behaviour of `is_something()` functions, but as I call
`is_device_mounted()` from the code I contributed, I thought it fair
game to fix these bugs at this time.

Regarding testing:

-   I've tested extensively all three functions I modified or added by
    taking them out of ReaR and by feeding them different values to
    trigger a positive or negative result, including empty strings
-   I've again performed a full "2-steps backups + 2-steps recover"
    scenario on a VM with a LUKS-encrypted filesystem. Everything
    behaved as expected.

Branch `issue-2200` has been re-based against `trunk/HEAD` before
commit/push.

@petroniusniger thanks for updated PR.  
Please fix those couple indentation problems, and I'll merge this PR.

Thanks!

@petroniusniger many thanks for contributing this new functionality and
respective documentation to ReaR!
