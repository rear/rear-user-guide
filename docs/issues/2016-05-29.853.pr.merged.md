`20_partition_layout.sh`gets partition size from `/sys/block` filesystem
for every hdX or sdX device.  
But if the block device `$blockd` is a path of a multipath device,
partition and size information does not exist anymore in `/sys/block`
which stop the script with the following message:

> "ERROR: BUG BUG BUG! Could not determine size of disk sdb/sdb2, please
> file a bug.  
> === Issue report === Please report this unexpected issue at:
> [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)
> Also include the relevant bits from
> /var/log/rear/rear-XXXXXXXX.log.lockless"

To avoid this situation, I propose to test if the sdX or hdX (`$blockd`)
is part of a multipath device.  
If yes, we ignore it because it will be handled by
`28_multipath_layout script` (real multipath device `dm-X` will be
treated further by multipath scripts).
