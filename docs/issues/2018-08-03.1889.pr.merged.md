-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    When loading multipath devices in rescue mode, ReaR rescue print to
    the user the name / UUID / size of the discovered multipath
    device.  
    if multipath is used with "friendly\_name" option, the output of the
    command `multipath -l` is

<!-- -->

    <friendly_mpath_name> (<mpath UUID>) <dm-name> <Vendor, type>
    rootvg (3600507680c82004cf800000000000306) dm-2 IBM     ,2145 

while it is a bit different when "friendly\_name" is disabled

    <mpath UUID> <dm-name> <Vendor, type>
    36005076400810051380000000000007b dm-2 IBM,2145

=&gt; "dm-" can be the 3rd or 2nd field.....  
This means we have to adjust the awk to print the line where "dm-"
appears and not when "dm-" is the 3rd field.
