### ReaR version

Relax-and-Recover 2.9 / 2025-01-31

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

Greetings REAR developers =)

i have an ubuntu 22.04 system (this behavior also occurred on RHEL
7.9),  
it has a sata SSD /dev/sda as the REAR target, that was formatted by
REAR using "rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sda"  
i created a backup by executing "rear -v mkbackup" and i get this error
right before returning to prompt:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe83129-0fbc-4c72-a82b-4ed3b05aad5d)

what does "since it's on a different device" mean?

some info about the environment:

    cat/etc/rear/local.conf

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9ed780-8843-4fb5-a1fc-35df1958c4c3)

    cat /etc/os-release

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60c42d5d-c5f7-4578-b07a-a6b3f366a1d4)

    lsblk - note that the lsblk shows the still mounted rear mount

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae7664da-8061-4d2a-bb42-474dba255731)

it happened recently on two different environments (repeatedly) and i'm
not sure how to avoid it or what i'm doing wrong,

can you advise?

### Platform

*No response*

### OS version

Ubuntu 22.04

### Backup

NETFS

### Storage layout

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49d9c741-569f-4dce-917c-0fdf6789e446)

### What steps will reproduce the bug?

1.  install latest rear
2.  backup using rear -v mkbackup to a preformatted /dev/sda

### Workaround, if any

i can just unmount and delete the folder, but i'm not sure if it this
error indicates something is wrong

### Additional information

i did not see this error in REAR v2.6 & 2.7 for more than a year of
using it

@xwhitebeltx Could you copy/paste the `/etc/fstab` file please? And,
also the output of `grep -v \# /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`

apologies for the delayed response,  
sadly my server was taken away, however i do still have the RHEL 7.9
with the same issue on REAR v2.7 if you are willing to investigate
further on a different setup.  
(in previous comment i wrote i did not see this issue on v2.7, at the
time i thought this RHEL has the latest REAR version)

see screenshots from the second server below including the outputs you
requested:  
same error from a backup i took today:

@xwhitebeltx Could you just run `rear -D mkrescue` to see why the
temporary rear-efi.xxxx is not unmounted at the end of the rear run?

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397\#issuecomment-2654100973](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397#issuecomment-2654100973)  
the first screenshot shows

    "Could not umount EFI partition '...' at '...' (you should do it manually)

which comes from  
output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh

I guess we may need in  
output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
the same kind of umounting code as at the end of  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh

@gdha of course,

@xwhitebeltx  
does it help when you add in  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
a line with

    sleep 3

just before `umount $efi_mpt` is done, i.e. like this

    # Cleanup of EFI temporary mount point:
    sleep 3
    if umount $efi_mpt ; then
        rmdir $efi_mpt || LogPrintError "Could not remove temporary directory '$efi_mpt' (you should do it manually)"
    else
        LogPrintError "Could not umount EFI partition '$efi_part' at '$efi_mpt' (you should do it manually)"
    fi

@xwhitebeltx Could you attach the `rear-localhost.log` file please? The
screenshot doesn't give me any hint.

@jsmeix yes it does, i tried twice, the process completes with no
errors, but still gives the message about removing the build area even
though it is not mounted (lsblk right after):

@gdha unfortunately my environment makes it very hard to extract files,
i can only take screenshots, if it is crucial i can try and obtain it
but it can take a few days

KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR is automatically set to true

@jsmeix thank you, although i'm not sure i fully understand yet, is
adding the "sleep 3" line the solution to this issue? or is it a
workaround?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408)  
intends to avoid this issue, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#dirty-hacks-welcome](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#dirty-hacks-welcome)

@xwhitebeltx  
both ;-)

The added 'sleep' is the solution to this issue  
(as far as what we can do in ReaR)  
and it is also a workaround for what I think  
is some error elsewhere (probably in kernel area)  
why 'umount' (sometimes?) fails in such cases nowadays.  
I think a sequence of commands like

    mount something somewhere
    cp somefile somewhere
    umount something

should "just work".  
But here and also in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908)  
that kind of code which had "just worked" "for ages"  
recently fails (sometimes?) and in both cases  
the "something" is some EFI stuff so it seems

    mount some_EFI_stuff somedir
    cp somefile somedir
    umount somedir

lets 'umount' fail (perhaps with recent kernels?) but

    mount some_EFI_stuff somedir
    cp somefile somedir
    sleep 1
    umount somedir

succeeds.

Perhaps there is a general issue with the VFAT filesystem?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408)
merged  
this issue should be sufficiently avoided.
