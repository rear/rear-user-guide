-   introduced BORGBACKUP\_PASSPHRASE, to send pass-phrase to Borg using
    environment variable
-   logic of Borg backup work-flow was reordered, now we are able to
    COPY\_AS\_IS\_BORG keyfile to Relax-and-Recover rescue/recovery
    system
-   Introduced BORGBACKUP\_REMOTE\_PATH, which sets location of Borg
    binary on remote server. Borg can be now installed to arbitrary
    location
-   default encryption is now "none" (see

Update of documentation will follow soon ...

@gozora  
now you introduce some all-caps variables like  
OPT\_COMPRESSION, OPT\_PRUNE, OPT\_REMOTE\_PATH,  
and ARCHIVE\_CACHE that I find nowhere else in current ReaR.

I assume these variables are currently only used for BORG  
but they look as if they are intended for a more general  
usage also for other backup methods because they  
have no "BORG\_" prefix.

I would like to know how those variables are meant to be used.

Yes that is correct, scope for these variables is intended only for
Borg. The reason why they are all caps is that I've try to follow [ReaR
conding
style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#variables).  
*"All variables that are used in more than a single script must be
all-caps:"*  
I've decided not to prefix them with **BORGBACKUP\_** as they are not
intended to be configured by default.conf.

I can of course change them, so their use become more obvious.  
Do you have any preference?

Thanks

V.

@gozora  
all-caps is fine for me - but because that indicates some kind  
of "global" usage (strictly speaking in more than one script)  
I would prefer a prefix when it is "not so much global"  
to indicate that it is only meant "global" for BORG.

For example we have already  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
and now the OPT\_COMPRESSION may cause  
some confusion what each one is about.

In contrast when you use BORG\_OPT\_COMPRESSION  
or BORGBACKUP\_OPT\_COMPRESSION (as you like)  
the distinction is clear.

Only some offhanded thoughts for the future:

Alternatively one could perhaps use the existing  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS array  
also for other backup methods like Borg Backup?

But currently default.conf states that  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
belongs only to "internal BACKUP stuff".

Perhaps this could become a good example how one  
could use existing variables also for other backup methods?

If one likes to use BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
also for other backup methods one would first of all need to  
change ReaR so that the current default '--gzip' is no longer  
set in default.conf so that it is empty there.  
Then for each backup method its particular default  
could be set in a script of each backup method if
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS is empty.  
For each backup method a comment in default.conf  
would tell about the default.

As far as I know currently the various backup methods  
are implemented mostly separated from each other.  
"Mostly" because e.g. 'tar' and 'rsync' both use  
e.g. BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS, cf.  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh

Perhaps it is better to keep different backup methods separated?  
(I.e. avoid RFC 1925 item 5 and keep separated things separated.)

Perhaps it is better to do common things via same variables?  
(E.g. see also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823))

Currently I don't know...

In my opinion they should remain separated, it is maybe nicer to have
one variable for multiple backups but, this can cause some trouble
connected with introducing more and more complicated code when new
features will be build into ReaR.

For new variable names (OPT\_COMPRESSION and co.) I'll prefix them with
BORGBACKUP\_\*, to avoid confusion.

I also think it is better to keep separated things separated.

In particular keeping different backup methods separated  
is even more future proof, cf. "Multiple Backup Methods" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769)  
"Multiple Backup Methods" require separated config  
variables for each backup method.

@jsmeix sorry for my trashy development management!  
You can merge this one.  
(In next days I'll create one more, but that will be just introduction
of couple of Borg variables)
