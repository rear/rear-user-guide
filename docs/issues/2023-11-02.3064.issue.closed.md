libpopt.so.0 is missing. In order to reproduce the problem, no other
binary that requires libpopt should be included in the recovery system,
otherwise it would pull libpopt and the problem would be hidden. In
particular, `rsync` and `cryptsetup` use libpopt. Remove them before
reproducing the problem.

The underlying issue is that `chkconfig` got there as the symlink target
of `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install`
(`build/default/490_fix_broken_links.sh`), which got there in
`build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh` because `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-*`
is in COPY\_AS\_IS (see `prep/GNU/Linux/280_include_systemd.sh`).

    # ls -l /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 27 May 23 08:59 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install -> ../../../usr/sbin/chkconfig

and unlike other code that adds binaries to the recovery system, the
`build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh` and
`build/default/490_fix_broken_links.sh` tandem does not add required
libraries if COPY\_AS\_IS contains a symlink.

The problematic code is here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1521/files\#r1377909379](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1521/files#r1377909379)
- it skips library dependency resolution for COPY\_AS\_IS items that are
symlinks.

To trigger the problem, several condition must be met:

-   a binary shoud be added to recovery system via a symlink
-   the symlink is in `COPY_AS_IS` (OTOH `PROGS` handles symlinks
    properly)
-   the binary needs additional libraries
-   no other binary added to the recovery system causes the libraries to
    be added (cf. the remark about `rsync` and `cryptsetup` above)

The problem is thus quite rare (`PROGS` are the preferred way to add
executables to the recovery system, which works fine), but one can
trigger it using something else than `chkconfig`. For example,
`COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/bin/cdrecord )`. On RHEL, `cdrecord` is a symlink to
`xorriso`, which needs quite special libraries, so:

    # usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    /bin/xorriso requires additional libraries (fatal error)
            libisoburn.so.1 => not found

`PROGS+=( cdrecord )` works fine.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Add `chkconfig` to `PROGS` - this will trigger library dependency
    resolution for it

For now "discuss / RFC" until we came to a conclusion  
how COPY\_AS\_IS versus PROGS are meant to work.

Regardless that I did a lot of code changes related  
to COPY\_AS\_IS, I do not really know how COPY\_AS\_IS  
is or was actually meant to work from the beginning.  
Perhaps COPY\_AS\_IS means "only copy 'as is' but nothing more"?

Excerpt from default.conf:

    # Files and directories to copy as-is (with tar) into the ReaR recovery system.
    # As its name tells COPY_AS_IS is primarily meant to "only copy as is".
    # In particular tar does not follow symlinks when copying
    # (for the reason behind see the build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh script).
    # To get libraries into the recovery system, use the LIBS array.
    # To get non-mandatory programs into the recovery system, use the PROGS array.
    # To get mandatory programs into the recovery system, use the REQUIRED_PROGS array.
    # For elements in the LIBS, PROGS, and REQUIRED_PROGS arrays
    # the RequiredSharedObjects function is called to determine required
    # shared objects (libraries) that get also copied into the recovery system.
    # For what is specified via the COPY_AS_IS array there is an exception to the
    # above "only copy as is" rule that for executables RequiredSharedObjects is called
    # to also get their needed libraries copied into the recovery system.
    # But when libraries are specified via COPY_AS_IS that are not executable
    # no required other libraries get automatically copied into the recovery system.
    # The reasoning behind is when programs are specified via COPY_AS_IS they
    # should be handled gracefully but COPY_AS_IS is not meant for libraries.
    ...

I fear that `exception to the above "only copy as is" rule` bites us  
because it makes the original intent vague so things are expected  
to "always work" because such things "sometimes work" because  
we try to behave "gracefully" :-(

> Perhaps COPY\_AS\_IS means "only copy 'as is' but nothing more"?

The problem is, even if `COPY_AS_IS` copies the symlink as it is and
leaves a dangling symlink, `build/default/490_fix_broken_links.sh` then
copies the target. So, if `COPY_AS_IS` is really meant to just "copy as
is", `build/default/490_fix_broken_links.sh` should not exist.

@pcahyna  
welcome to the shadowy world how ReaR behaves in practice :-)

I do not argue against further enhancing the COPY\_AS\_IS code  
to make it behave more reliable and fail-safe.

I only like to provide some reasoning for the current behaviour.

I think you see and understand this shortcoming  
of the COPY\_AS\_IS code much better than I do.  
I like to also see and understand what is  
generically wrong with our current COPY\_AS\_IS code.  
I.e. when it even fails (under special conditions)  
when COPY\_AS\_IS is used as it is primarily meant to be used.

@jsmeix, maybe I was wrong. Without this exception, what I get are these
additional messages (which are not fatal errors):

    /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cryptsetup requires additional libraries
            libcryptsetup.so.12 => not found
    /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-integritysetup requires additional libraries
            libcryptsetup.so.12 => not found
    /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-veritysetup requires additional libraries
            libcryptsetup.so.12 => not found
    /usr/lib/udev/rename_device requires additional libraries
            libglib-2.0.so.0 => not found

I don't know whether this indicates a real problem in the recovery
system or not (that is, whether e.g. `/usr/lib/udev/rename_device` is
actually used during the recovery system operation or not).

I would say though that by default executables under `/usr/lib` or
`/usr/libexec` copied via COPY\_AS\_IS should be assumed to be useful
and not including their required libraries seems dangerous.

A totally offhanded and untested idea  
how to possibly get rid of the complications  
with executables in the COPY\_AS\_IS code:

Copy executables in COPY\_AS\_IS to PROGS  
and handle them via PROGS  
instead of handling them in COPY\_AS\_IS.

My assumption is that handling arbitrary files  
that are executable (i.e. where 'test -x' is true)  
via PROGS works well (i.e. sufficiently fail-safe).

If my assumption holds, this could much clean up  
the COPY\_AS\_IS code and make things behave more  
consistent because then it makes no difference  
if a program was specified in COPY\_AS\_IS or in PROGS  
and we would have only one code place that deals  
with programs or executables and their libraries:  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

I think duplicate entries should be filtered out  
in the 'all\_binaries' and 'all\_libs arrays' in  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
as currently done with COPY\_AS\_IS.

The problem is, PROGS is intended for executables in $PATH, while we are
using COPY\_AS\_IS for helper executables outside $PATH (under
`/usr/libexec` or `/usr/lib` or similar).

A program in PROGS will be unconditionally copied to `/bin` (see the use
of `copy_binaries` in
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh), but the COPY\_AS\_IS
items need to be copied to the same path as in the original system.

Yes, sigh!  
While sleeping on my "totally offhanded and untested idea"  
I also saw that this cannot work because of how PROGS behaves  
(i.e. handling arbitrary files that are executable  
via PROGS will not work well).

So currently our only way out is to more and more enhance  
the COPY\_AS\_IS code so that it behaves sufficiently OK  
for arbitrary files that are executable.

@pcahyna  
I would appreciate it if you would implement  
what you think works OK for your current case  
with reasonable effort (i.e. make a pull request).

Then let's just wait and see how things behave in general  
and when new issues appear let's just fix them one by one  
as usual as far as possible with reasonable effort.

A general addedum:

From my curent point of view our whole "copy things" code  
looks like a (long grown over time) pile of mess.

I think the root cause is that currently the ReaR recovery system  
is in general not a truthful and self-consistent copy  
of the needed parts from the original system.  
It works sufficiently OK for our known cases but the current  
implementation is insufficient in this or that special cases.

This leads to the (apparently at least in practice unsolvable?)  
problem how to truthfully and self-consistently copy "something".

Cf. the part about symbolic links  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972\#issuecomment-1669295963](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2972#issuecomment-1669295963)

    ... investigate how to really properly copy "something"
    also when there are symbolic links "in between"
    so that the whole structure is copied to a new place
    i.e. that after copying
    the link target with its owner,group,permissions,...
    and its name plus the symlink exist at the new place.

A self-consistent copy also means that linked libraries  
get automatically copied.  
I think our RequiredSharedObjects function is sufficient  
for that.

I think other required things to get a self-consistent copy  
like other files that are neded which are not linked  
is not possible in an automated way.

@jsmeix (or anyone else), have you ever considered using dracut to
generate the ReaR initrd? It is a tool that generates the initrd on
Fedora (and probably some other distros).

I would prefer to focus on areas where ReaR is really unique (mainly,
layout saving and restoration) and leave the "boring work" of
constructing the initrd to something else, if possible.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your encouraging proposal!

I fully agree with you to use as much as possible  
already existing tools for certain functionality in ReaR  
instead of reimplementing this or that functionality in ReaR.

I never considered using dracut to generate the ReaR initrd.  
Also SUSE/openSUSE uses dracut to generate its initrd for  
normal system boot and system startup.

Caution! ;-)  
here my next "totally offhanded and untested idea":

Based on our findings and assumptions in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1668940477](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1668940477)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1669490742](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1669490742)  
we might do something similar for ReaR's initrd:

Make ReaR's initrd as an enhancement of the already existing  
initrd for boot and startup of the original system,  
for example somehow like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017\#issuecomment-1645348480](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017#issuecomment-1645348480)  
i.e. basically something like

1.  unpack the already existing initrd into some directory
2.  add ReaR's specific additional stuff to that directory
3.  pack that directory as ReaR's initrd

My reasoning is same as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1668940477](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1668940477)

When the initrd of the Linux distribution  
makes the original system start up,  
then the contents of that initrd  
should also make the ReaR recovery system start up  
on replacement hardware  
because replacement hardware must be sufficiently  
compatible with the original system hardware.

Another (hopefully reasonable) assumption is that  
the initrd of the Linux distribution  
should be sufficiently feature complete  
to start up the original system on various hardware.

So only adding ReaR's specific additional stuff  
to the initrd of the Linux distribution  
should be (hopefully) sufficient  
to make ReaR's things work in the ReaR recovery system.

I.e. my "totally offhanded and untested idea" is  
to not use dracut and generate a ReaR initrd from scratch  
but perhaps simpler and perhaps even more fail-safe and  
hopefully more generically working on various Linux distributions  
because it does not depend on dracut - provided a sufficiently  
"normal" initrd already exists for system boot and startup.

@jsmeix using an already existing initrd would have the advantage of not
relying on a specific tool (dracut), but I am afraid that the original
initrd is not just feature complete (although that might be a problem as
well, for example I suspect that it does not have the all the kernel
modules and firmware), but that it does in fact too much. It needs to
activate all the storage on the original disks, mount the rootfs and
pivot to it. We need to avoid all this (activating the original storage
components should be preferably avoided if you are going to wipe them in
the next step), which means that we would not need to just "add ReaR's
specific additional stuff" but to remove lots of stuff as well. This
would require us to have a good knowledge of the specifics of the
particular initrd.
