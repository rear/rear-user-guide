#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19 / 2016-12-23
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):16.04.1 LTS
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When trying to boot from the rescue USB just created I get the
    message:  
    WARNING: PAE disabled. Use parameter 'forcepae' to enable at your
    own risk!  
    This kernel requires the following features not present on the
    CPU:  
    pae

I remember when loading Ubuntu 16.04 on to my laptop this was an issue
and I needed to use the forcepae parameter. Is there any way of using
REAR where by this parameter is included somehow in the rescue install?

-   Work-around, if any:none found as yet

Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered.

Hi,

Reading
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf):

    # You can add arbitrary kernel command line parameters when booting the rescue/recovery system
    # as you need it (e.g. things like 'console=...' see USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE below).
    # Additionally Relax-and-Recover supports the following special kernel command line parameters:
    # - 'debug' starts all init-scripts (in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/ in the rescue/recovery system)
    #   in debug mode (via 'set -x') and asks for confirmation before it runs each init-script
    #   so that you can skip a script if needed.
    # - 'noip' prevents initialization of the networking configuration which is useful when
    #   you want to do the networking configuration manually in the rescue/recovery system
    #   e.g. to prevent the rescue/recovery system to use the same IP address as the original system
    #   but for the latter using USE_DHCLIENT="yes" (see below) is probably easier:
    KERNEL_CMDLINE=""

So in your case, it should be enough to add `KERNEL_CMDLINE="forcepae"`
to `/etc/rear/local.conf`

Thanks heaps. This enabled the rescue image to boot.
