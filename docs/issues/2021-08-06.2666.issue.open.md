This is only a reminder issue for myself @jsmeix  
what I still need to do for GRUB2 with OUTPUT=USB  
(the ordering below is random and does not mean anything):

(a)  
Consistent calling of the create\_grub2\_cfg function in all scripts as

    create_grub2_cfg "/path/to/kernel" "/path/to/initrd" "GRUB2 command to set 'root'" >/path/to/grub.cfg

and removal of the matching backward compatibility code in
create\_grub2\_cfg

(b)  
Make GRUB2 as bootloader work with multiple ReaR recovery systems  
and backups on a USB disk (which is the default behaviour for
OUTPUT=USB)  
i.e. each ReaR recovery system and backup needs its own GRUB2 menue
entry  
so that the user can choose which one he wants to boot (i.e. what he
wants to restore).  
Currently GRUB2 with OUTPUT=USB can only boot the latest one.

This needs to be done before ReaR 2.7 can be released.

I postpone this to ReaR 2.8

Regarding item (b) above see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2948\#discussioncomment-5139092](https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2948#discussioncomment-5139092)  
excerpt:

    Currently there is no guarantee at all that
    I will find time to implement that item (b).

    I prefer to keep things simple and straightforward
    so one USB disk to recover only one particular system
    with only one backup (lastest most up-to-date one)
    is simpler and that results more fail-safe code
    (better simple and straightforward code
    than sophisticated and fragile constructs)
    which in the end results more fail-safe recovery.

    Even recovery for one single system with more than
    one single backup (more than the lastest up-to-date one)
    for that one system calls for trouble unless the user
    took extra care to ensure all is fully consistent,
    cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787

    This issue is not about several backups
    but it shows that the ReaR recovery system
    and the backup need to be fully consistent
    i.e. even only one ReaR recovery system
    with only one backup is already a problem
    so more than one ReaR recovery system
    plus more than one backup ensure trouble.
