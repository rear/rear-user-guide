-   Description of the issue:

I made an ISO image (files+recovery inside it) of a server and now I'm
trying to install the ISO inside to a notebook but when I run "rear -v
-d recover" the recover fails and I get this error: mount:
/tmp/rear.xxxxxxxxxx/outputfs: no filesystem type specified.  
I tryied to install the ISO inside a virtualbox VM successfully, but the
recover fails on real PC's... Why?

@BigMarioss Did you verify if the ISO could be mounted via the device
name, e.g. /dev/sr0 on the recovery system?

Hi, I resolved the problem by updating Rear version. The iso works
successfully now.

But I have another problem: the option
"NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=yes" does not work. There are only two
backup folders, "hostaname" and "hostname.old", and when I run the
backup task the folder "hostname.old" is overwritten by the folder
called "hostname", so there aren't more than two backups... Why?

`NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=yes` works as implemented and described  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2339](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2339)

    # Keep an older copy of the backup (mv $NETFS_PREFIX $NETFS_PREFIX.old before we copy the new version)
    # empty means only keep current backup:
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=
