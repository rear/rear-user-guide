-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    1.18
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL 5.10
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    ISO/NFS
-   Brief description of the issue  
    During FS creation in a recover, mkfs is called as follows:  
    mkfs -t ext3 -b 1024 -i 8128 -U UUID /dev/sda2

The version of mkfs available does not support the -U option.  
Removing the option allows the recover process to complete.

I think you mean that code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
(excerpts)

<pre>
    case "$fstype" in
        (ext*)
    ....
            # Actually create the filesystem with initially correct UUID
            # (Addresses Fedora/systemd problem, see issue 851)
            if [ -n "$uuid" ] ; then
                echo "mkfs -t ${fstype}${blocksize}${fragmentsize}${bytes_per_inode} -U $uuid $device >&2" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
            else
                echo "mkfs -t ${fstype}${blocksize}${fragmentsize}${bytes_per_inode}  $device >&2" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
            fi
</pre>

Accordingly it seems on RHEL 5.10 the filesystem has a UUID  
but on RHEL 5.10 the mkfs command does not support to set it?

Because the code was intentionally implemented  
this way by @exedor see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851)  
we cannot simply remove setting the UUID  
without causing regressions elewhere.

@gdha  
I also assign you because you had benn involved in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851)

By the way:  
This time I am so happy to find useful comments  
in the code that show why it is implemented as is.  
Such explanatory comments help so much  
to get issues fixed properly  
cf.

@jsmeix  
I agree, we should make sure to use -U whenever possible. Maybe we can
check the mkfs options available in addition to -n "$uuid". You know,
something like $? on mkfs.${fstype} 2&gt;&1 | grep -q "-U".

Oh man...yeah that's true. Older version of mkfs did not support this.
I  
can look at an alternative form of the patch which may still address
the  
issue.

I'd hate to do version checking...that kinda sucks because there are
so  
many different versions of operating systems.

I was thinking the same thing. I'll put another patch together.

@EQXTFL  
I feel a bit unhappy using things like

<pre>
mkfs.ext2 2>&1 | grep -q -- '-U' && echo 'mkfs.ext2 supports -U' || echo 'mkfs.ext2 does not support -U'
</pre>

regardless that it seems to work for me on SLES11  
and on openSUSE Leap 42.1 (that is like SLES12)  
because "man mkfs.ext2" does not tell that  
calling mkfs.ext2 without options is the actually  
right way to get the help text.

I am a bit astonished about what kind of commands  
still exist that have no support for '-h' or '--help'.

But on the other hand I have no better idea right now.

@exedor  
I also prefer to avoid checks based  
on versions of operating systems, cf.

I hear you....it seems like a kludge. Another option would be to check  
for a legit return code, if it fails assume it was because the UUID  
option isn't supported, then fall back to the non -U call combined
with  
the tune2fs call and then check that for failure and treat it the same  
way it was before.

FYI regarding "kludge":  
I added right now a famous  
"Dirty hacks welcome"  
section to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

For the fun of it regarding "retry commands":  
Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)
therein  
in particular

I think I have an idea how to implement it sufficiently well:

I agree with what @exedor wrote above in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/890\#issuecomment-228082714](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/890#issuecomment-228082714)  
and in general in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/851)

<pre>
I tested my revision so that instead of calling tune2fs
after the file system was created, I instead check
at the mkfs call and then use it's -U parameter
so it just uses the correct UUID at filesystem creation
time instead of first creating bogus UUIDs and then
trying to fix them up later. Seemed like a cleaner
approach until it broke older versions.
</pre>

Because "mkfs -U" works for me at least since SLE11  
(I did not test SLE10 and I don't care because that is no  
longer supported in Rear-1.18, see doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
I assume "mkfs -U" also works on RHEL6  
but only fails on RHEL5.

Therefore I think the right way it to try "mkfs -U"  
and only if that fails descend into dirty hacks.

The problem with the implementation in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
is the indirection that one has to generate code which  
makes it look somewhat overcomplicated, somehing like:

<pre>
    case "$fstype" in
        (ext*)
...
            if test "$uuid" ; then
                echo "# when 'mkfs -U' fails" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "# assume it failed because on older systems" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "# mkfs does not support '-U' (issue 890)" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "# then retry mkfs without '-U'" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "# plus 'tunefs -U' but that may fail" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "# on newer systems (issue 851)" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "if ! mkfs ... -U $uuid ... ; then" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "    mkfs ... " >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "    $tunefs -U ... " >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
                echo "fi" >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
            else
                echo "mkfs ... " >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
            fi
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894)  
I implemeted what I wrote above.

I tested it on SLE11 with ext3 and SLE12 with ext4  
but on those systems "mkfs -U" works.

I.e. I did not test it on a system where "mkfs -U" fails  
in particular I did not test it on RHEL5.

@EQXTFL  
please test if current rear master  
works for you on RHEL5  
and provide feedback here.

No feedback.

With the fallback assumtion that "no news is good news"  
I close it now.
