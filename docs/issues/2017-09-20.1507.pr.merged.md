Now a failure message like

<pre>
rear mkrescue failed, check /root/rear.master/var/log/rear/rear-e205.log for details
</pre>

is shown when it exits in any unintended way,  
e.g. when it exits because \[Ctrl\]+\[C\] was pressed or  
when it exits at an arbitrary command because of 'set -e'.  
For the latter case cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700\#issuecomment-327755633](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/700#issuecomment-327755633)

That failure message is not show when it exits/aborts  
intentionally via the Error function plus the USR1 trap  
because in this case the Error function and the USR1 trap  
show already appropriate messages.

It "just works" for me so that I "just merge" it now  
because I like to get early feedback or bug reports  
if something gets wrong because of that but I do not  
expect real errors because in the end it is only about  
an additional message.
