@gauvins2  
in our current GitHub master code this is since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3211ec8084e6b55c83e17a4eaf9e67be64a9f599](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3211ec8084e6b55c83e17a4eaf9e67be64a9f599)

    has_binary grub-install grub2-install || Error "Unknown EFI bootloader (no grub-install or grub2-install found)"

that is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh\#L56](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh#L56)  
which tells the reason why ReaR errors out here, see also your  
"latest log messages since the last called script
100\_create\_efiboot.sh"

      /usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 457: type: grub-install: not found
      /usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 457: type: grub2-install: not found

so you need to install something that provides grub-install or
grub2-install  
to make that particular part work (usually GRUB2 should provide it).

You may need to install some more things to make ReaR work for you  
because ReaR needs all the basic system setup tools, in particular  
disk partitioning tools, filesystem tools, bootloader tools, backup
tools and so on  
to create a ReaR recovery system that can reinstall your original
system  
on your replacement hardware.

For general information you may have a look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Therein read the initial sections and then see in particular the
sections  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover"  
and  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"

I recommend to use our latest GitHub master code because  
the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things and  
it helps when you use exactly the code where we could fix things.

Hello @jsmeix,

I'm afraid that simple installation of "something that provides
grub-install" is not enough.

Excerpt from [System 76
docu](https://support.system76.com/articles/bootloader/) states:

> Systemd-boot is the boot-loader for Pop!\_OS 18.04 and above  
> while GRUB is the boot-loader for Ubuntu and Pop!\_OS when  
> installed in Legacy BIOS mode. A boot-loader takes care  
> of getting the operating system started up

@gauvins2 would need to completely migrate his booting from
`systemd-boot` to `grub` in order to use ReaR, since to my current
knowledge, ReaR does not support `systemd-boot`.

Hope it helps

V.

@gozora happy to hear again from you!  
Thank you so much for your analysis.

I know nothing at all about systemd-boot.  
The only code places where `grep 'systemd.boot'` finds something are
about EFISTUB.  
Perhaps that boot method might be somehow useful here?  
I never tried EFISTUB on my own.  
I assume EFISTUB cannot be used with OUTPUT=USB because  
there is only output/ISO/Linux-i386/260\_EFISTUB\_populate.sh

Hello @jsmeix,

I try to be with my kids as much as possible, which reduces my free time
a bit ;-)

I don't think that EFISTUB method would be a good option here, since it
completely bypasses any Linux bootloader, hence restored system would
not be same as original. This issue is basically same as abandoned
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1214](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1214)
.

Pop!\_OS on the other hand have its [own bare metal disaster recovery
solution](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-recovery), which
might not be as versatile as ReaR but it is vendor preferred recovery
method.

Yes, humans - in particular kids - take natural precedence over
machines  
and spending time with kids changes leisure time into most meaningful
time.  
I never learned more about "life, the universe, and everything" than
with my kids,  
cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Hitchhiker%27s\_Guide\_to\_the\_Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)

As far as I understand
[https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-recovery/](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-recovery/)  
it is not about bare metal disaster recovery because I assume  
the Pop!\_OS recovery partition is on the same computer as the system  
so when the computer gets destroyed the Pop!\_OS recovery partition is
lost.

My blind guess about EFISTUB was based on the idea that  
perhaps Pop!\_OS can be booted by using the plain UEFI firmware  
according to the following comment in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/260\_EFISTUB\_populate.sh

    # In theory we don't need to have any boot loader for ReaR rescue system,
    # since kernel can be loaded directly by UEFI, but not everyone is familiar
    # or comfortable with EFI shell.

So perhaps it is sufficient for someone who is familiar with EFI shell  
to let ReaR recreate a Pop!\_OS without installing its bootloader  
and then boot into Pop!\_OS for the first time via EFI shell and  
in the booted Pop!\_OS manually (re-)install its bootloader.

Or perhaps an even simpler workaround:  
After "rear recover" in the still runing ReaR recovery system  
`chroot` into the recreated Pop!\_OS (via `chroot /mnt/local`)  
and manually install the Pop!\_OS bootloader, cf. what  
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/890\_finish\_checks.sh  
shows when "rear recover" could not install a bootloader  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/890\_finish\_checks.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/890_finish_checks.sh)

My conclusion as well. I've configured a recovery USB drive as [per
POP\_OS instructions](https://support.system76.com/articles/live-disk/)
