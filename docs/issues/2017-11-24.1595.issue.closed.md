In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593/commits/911b5830cd1524804da6ca70b118dd2133d66cbd](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593/commits/911b5830cd1524804da6ca70b118dd2133d66cbd)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593/commits/b6238a9f15c9af4224e5852e28f167f46fe6badd](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593/commits/b6238a9f15c9af4224e5852e28f167f46fe6badd)  
I set the MIGRATION\_MODE and USER\_INPUT\_\*  
config variables in default.conf only if not already set  
so that they can also be set individually by the user via  
'export CONFIG\_VAR=...' directly before running ReaR.

Hereby I propose to do that for all those config variables  
where it makes sense in practice that the user may prefer  
to set them individually via 'export CONFIG\_VAR=...'  
(and not statically in local.conf).

For a current use case example see

Can you describe the use case? This adds yet another configuration
mechanism, this time from the command line. Why isn't it enough to
specify a custom config file via `-C`? IIRC also DRLM added some kind of
command line variable support.

Why not generalize this into a new command line option like
`-x MIGRATION_MODE=true` that works for all variables, with multiple
invocations on the same name adding values to arrays. I can imagine that
this approach would reduce the amount of `test "$FOO" || FOO=bar` lines.

@jsmeix I'm not a big fan of external defined variables - it is already
complex enough for the users.

This enhancement request emerged from my personal use case  
where it makes sense for me for those config variables  
that specify the user related behaviour during "rear recover".

I find it much more convenient when I can do things like

<pre>
# export USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=30
# export MIGRATION_MODE=y
# rear recover
</pre>

compared to when I am forced to cumbersomely  
edit /etc/rear/local.conf in the recovery system  
only to change how one particular "rear recover" run  
interacts with me.

In general it is traditional Unix way to support that the user  
can control in particular user related behaviour of a program  
via environment variables (and not only via command line  
options or config file settings).

Accordingly I think this enhancement request does not  
make sense for all those config variables that specify  
what ReaR should do i.e. things like OUTPUT, BACKUP,  
and so on - basically for all the core config variables  
this enhancement request does not make sense.

Done for several config variables in default.conf  
where it is currently known to be useful so I close it.

If also needed for other config variables it can be  
easily adapted in default.conf as needed.
