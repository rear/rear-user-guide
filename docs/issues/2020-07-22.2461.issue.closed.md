In general `cd /some/dir` in a ReaR script is problematic.  
Usually it should be `pushd /some/dir` with matching `popd`.

At some places we have code like

    ( cd /some/dir
      some commands
    )

which uses a subshell which has the disadvantage that  
global variables cannot be modified inside the subshell  
(they can be modified but that has no result outside the subshell).

I think normally code like

    pushd /some/dir
    some commands
    popd

looks somehow "better" to me in ReaR scripts  
but here the drawback is that code like

    pushd /some/dir
    ...
    if ! command ; then
        LogPrint "command failed"
        return 1
    fi
    ...
    popd

would return from the script without matching `popd`  
so one must carefully have `popd` at all 'side exits' like

    pushd /some/dir
    ...
    if ! command ; then
        LogPrint "command failed"
        popd
        return 1
    fi
    ...
    popd

I wonder if we should perhaps do in the `Source` function  
something like

    function Source () {
        local current_dir=$( pwd )
        ...
        source "$source_file"
        source_return_code=$?
        cd $current_dir

to ensure that after each script  
we are back in ReaR's usual working directory?

Because both "cd in subshell" and "pushd / popd" have pros and cons  
so there is no "one best way" how to change the working directory in
scripts  
and because the only thing that actually matters is that all scripts  
get launched with one same predictable working directory  
I think meanwhile that  
each script can implement changing its working directory as it fits best
for the particular script  
and I will only implement to ensure all scripts get launched with one
same working directory.

ReaR does not run with some kind of static working directory  
but it runs with a predictable working directory which is  
the current working directory when `rear` is launched.

For a test I added a LogPrint to the Source() function in
lib/framework-functions.sh

    function Source () {
        local source_file="$1"
        LogPrint "Sourcing $source_file with current working directory $( pwd )"

Then I did

    # cd /other/mydir

    linux-h9wr:/other/mydir # /root/rear.github.master/usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
    Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git
    Running rear mkbackup (PID 6960 date 2020-08-13 13:11:40)
    Using log file: /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-linux-h9wr.log
    Sourcing /root/rear.github.master/etc/rear/os.conf with current working directory /other/mydir
    Sourcing /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-i386.conf with current working directory /other/mydir

    Sourcing /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/init/default/005_verify_os_conf.sh with current working directory /other/mydir
    ...
    Sourcing /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/980_umount_NETFS_dir.sh with current working directory /other/mydir
    Sourcing /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/backup/default/990_post_backup_script.sh with current working directory /other/mydir
    Exiting rear mkbackup (PID 6960) and its descendant processes ...
    Running exit tasks
    You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.ly800lywpxoEj6W

    linux-h9wr:/other/mydir # ls
    [no output]

I verified in the log file that all what was sourced by the Source()
function  
was sourced `with current working directory /other/mydir`  
and no file is written to the current working directory /other/mydir  
so at least the scripts for "rear mkbackup" with BACKUP=NETFS  
seem to work properly.

I think I will add to usr/sbin/rear something like

    readonly WORKING_DIR="$( pwd )"

and add to the Source() function something like

    function Source () {
        ...
        source "$source_file"
        ...
        cd "$WORKING_DIR" || LogPrintError "Failed to 'cd $WORKING_DIR'"

to ensure that after each sourced file we are back in the usual working
directory  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2478/commits/5fa006ef842e93eed5daeeae58955116d7980888](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2478/commits/5fa006ef842e93eed5daeeae58955116d7980888)  
because the first `source "$source_file"` is launched from the usual
working directory anyway  
and the intent behind this issue is to make things safe against if the
working directory  
was permanently changed within a script or code in a config file.
