It's very easy to have Bash syntax-check source code, but still we often
commit pieces that fail a simple syntax check.

Jeroen already provided an example of how to hook this into your Git
workflow. But it should be part of the workflow to building the official
release.

+1  
Do we have to do this on a user basis or can we force it somehow
(globally on \[source\])?

I added a 'make validate' target that will syntax-check all shell
scripts. However at this time it reports 3 dangling symlinks.

We can improve this scheme with Jeroen's Git hooks.

@jhoekx Can you repost the information on how you configured a hook to
do syntax-checks before commiting ? I cannot find your prior post :-( If
we can document this on the website, we can close this ticket.

My git pre-commit hook contains this.

    ### Check all scripts for syntax errors.
    declare -i errcount
    for shellscript in $(git diff-index --name-only $against | grep '\.sh') ; do
        if [[ -r "$shellscript" ]] ; then
            bash -n $shellscript
            errcount=$(( errcount + $? ))
        fi
    done
    if (( errcount > 0 )) ; then
        echo "Scripts with syntax errors."
        echo "Not committing."
        exit 1
    fi

The `$against` variable is defined in the hook as

    if git rev-parse --verify HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1
    then
        against=HEAD
    else
        # Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object
        against=4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
    fi

But the same and more is done by `make validate`?

And how is it being hooked ? The intention is to hook maybe
`make validate` into git pre-commit. One of the main differences is that
`make validate` syntax-checks the whole tree which is a lot slower than
if you actually syntax-check only the committed files.

And it might break because of something you didn't change (unless of
course everyone uses the pre-commit hook :-))

I have
[https://gist.github.com/2908915](https://gist.github.com/2908915) in
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` .

So the solution is to add the below line to the file
*.git/hooks/pre-commit*:  
´´´  
make validate  
´´´  
And to make sure the *.git/hooks/pre-commit* files is executable.
