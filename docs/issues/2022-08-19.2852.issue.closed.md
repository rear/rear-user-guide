#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Rear 2.7  
rocky linux 8.5  
VMware fusion.

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_PROG=tar  
BACKUP\_TYPE=Incremental  
FULLBACKUPDAY="SAT"

Went straight into an "incremental" backup

rear -v mkbackup

the first file shows as 2022-08-19-2021-F.tar.gz

But REAR complains it cannot find backup.tar.gz

I have no  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=y

@Hardcore-fs Could you please explain what you did step-by-step as it is
not 100% clear to us?

Used the above. (obviously with an NTFS mount point ..not shown)

then  
sudo rear -v mkbackup.

which scanned system built the ISO and then built a tar file with an
extension of \*-f.tar  
which WILL NOT WORK for recovery, without a base tar file
"backup.tar.gz"

if you go straight into incremental on a CLEAN system, there does not
appear to be a "backup.tar.gz"

also for sanity....... really... when the system runs the "full backup"
it should also at minimum find the "backup.tar.gz"  
to ensure it at-least exists....  
becasue otherwise , should it go astray, any backup is totally useless,
even though your system shows it has "full" backups.

If you comment out the "BACKUP\_TYPE=Incremental", then the system DOES
create "backup.tar.gz"  
and when you put "BACKUP\_TYPE=Incremental" back, the system functions
as expected.

Tomorrow I will test how an actual incremental backup

@Hardcore-fs  
perhaps in your initial comment `BACKUP_TYPE=Incremental`  
with capital `I` at the beginning is a typo only in your comment  
but for actual ReaR only `BACKUP_TYPE=incremental`  
(all lowercase `incremental`) will work because the code in  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh

    if ! test "incremental" = "$BACKUP_TYPE" -o "differential" = "$BACKUP_TYPE" ; then
    .
    .
    .
            case "$BACKUP_TYPE" in
                (incremental)

only tests for `incremental`.  
See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf how BACKUP\_TYPE  
is described therein.

Also `FULLBACKUPDAY="SAT"` with all uppercase `SAT`  
probably will not work.  
See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf how FULLBACKUPDAY  
is described therein (excerpt):

    # The weekday values must match the output of "date +%a" run in the POSIX/C locale

and on my system (openSUSE Leap 15.3) I get today

    # ( export LC_ALL=C LANG=C ; date +%a )
    Tue

i.e. for me only the first letter is uppercase.  
Furthermore FULLBACKUPDAY has to be normally an array.  
For a single word `FULLBACKUPDAY="Sat"` should also work  
by luck how bash handles arrays versus strings.

Hi,  
Your run is exactly what I get. INCLUDING your directory list.  
the problem is the restore, it demands a file that is NOT
"xxx.f.tar.gz"  
it insists it is given "backup.tar.gz"

Which i can fix by making 2 runs, as outlined above.

Could it be that during the **restore**, the BACKUP\_TYPE=Incremental
(capital I)  
is confusing the system, and THAT is why it is asking for
"backup.tar.gz" ?

I will check if simply changing the "I" will make it function on
restore.  
I think maybe the "upper case" is some damned interaction with "notes"
on the osx (where i keep base configs)  
I have seen it changing text pasted to the clip board, specifically
--\`' &"-- to some weird unicode values and also capitalization.  
same with MS outlook., which we use sometimes to pass copy & paste
configs to distribute to branch offices.

That said... SW should not be fooled by case changes, user /system input
should be sanitized with forced case before compares. (also what happens
if these are running on non English systems...? )  
where "( export LC\_ALL=C LANG=C ; date +%a )" will not produce this
output
