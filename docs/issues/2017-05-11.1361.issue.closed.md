This would have helped me in the
[workshop](https://github.com/schlomo/rear-workshop).

Idea is to create a new variable `ISO_EJECT` that would eject the CD
after recovery or before rebooting.

Effectively prevents a boot loop when using `ISO_DEFAULT=manual`

Only a side note for the fun of "eject CD":

In ancient S.u.S.E. times there was the default that after  
the S.u.S.E. Linux installation was done the installation CD  
was automatically ejected but we got unfriendly user complaints  
so that we switched to the current default to boot from harddisk.

What I like to say is that a physical "eject CD"  
may cause trouble for some users.

But with ISO\_EJECT="no" by default everything should be o.k.

I never used ISO\_DEFAULT other than the default "boothd"  
but I wonder if "eject CD" also works on virtual machines?
