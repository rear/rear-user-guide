-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Works well for me with SLES15-SP5

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Overhauled finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

Now it uses dracut by default and mkinitrd as fallback  
which fixes
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152)  
at least for me with SLES15-SP5.

Additionally improved the user messages  
(in particular the warning messages)  
to make it more clear that the point is  
to decide if the recreated system will boot  
with the initrd 'as is' from the backup restore.

Furthermore removed the whole INITRD\_MODULES code  
because INITRD\_MODULES is not used and  
/etc/sysconfig/kernel does no longer exist since SLES12 so the
INITRD\_MODULES code is dead code.

@abbbi  
could you please test if the overhauled  
finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
in this
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155)  
also works for you?

At least please respond when you cannot test it  
or if you could not test it right now but later  
so that I could better decide how to proceed here.

@rear/contributors  
when no comments or feedback appears here,  
in particular when there are no objections,  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

Hmm, thinking about it. The current initrd code for Suse has the same
problem which was fixed for Fedora in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2873](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2873).
At least on `s390`, the initrd will not be regenerated.

Also, if the code for SuSe and Fedora is very similar, it could make
sense to just merge it?

@lzaoral  
merging finalize/Fedora/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
and finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
into one same code is something that could be done later  
via a separated pull request if feasible in practice.

Currently finalize/Fedora/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
is rather different because it deals with INITRD\_MODULES  
which I completely removed for SUSE here because that code  
in finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/550\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
was "very dead" code.

With this pull request I like to switch from  
mkinitrd to dracut only for SUSE\_LINUX/i386  
as a first step.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3152)  
the discussion  
[https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WKZFPUPW3BQ4GYLI4HIWLJDWANUOBLIT/](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WKZFPUPW3BQ4GYLI4HIWLJDWANUOBLIT/)  
is mentioned which indicates that calling plain 'dracut'  
is not always the same as calling plain 'mkinitrd'  
regardless what some say about it's "just simple easy".

So I prefer to change such things in small steps  
and wait some reasonable time for user feedback  
because when my simplified and overhauled code  
"just works" for me on my QEMU/KVM test system  
it does not mean it also works for others, in particular  
perhaps not on whatever rather special server hardware.

@jsmeix Sure, the merging with Fedora is a topic for a separate PR.
However, the issue described in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2873](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2873)
is still valid for initrd regeneration on SuSe.
