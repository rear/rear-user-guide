The `/mnt/local/etc/sysconfig` should normally contain lots of files of
the restored image. Was the restore successful? The `kernel` file is one
of the many files you find under the `/etc/sysconfig` directory. At
least at SLES

Hi, as you see in the log file, the disk was partitioned and formatted
as well, I can even see that it was mounted as "/mnt/local" , but no
restore was taken place before running
"finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh". there is no error
regarding backup image, it seems that there is something went wrong in
between format and finalize. thanks a lot for the reply.

What is the content of the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file? And, what is the
output of `rear dump`?

@a417237 I cannot follow - I'm sure the system restore was *not*
performed, but how did you make backup? And which variables did you
define before running `rear -v mkbackup`? A `rear dump` would be really
useful

@gdha , I did a backup using a usb disk "output=iso,"; rear format
/dev/sdb; rear -v mkbackup;  
it was done pretty good. then I made a dvd using the following
procedure.

1.  initrd.cgz , unpacked and edit the local.conf to
    netfs\_mountcmd="mount -v -t iso9600 /dev/sr0"  
    2 new initrd.cgz was again copied to isolinux  
    linux-cllg:/tmp/onlytmp/linux-cllg \# l  
    total 1180608  
    drw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 Jun 21 19:11 isolinux  
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 202 Jun 21 19:11 README  
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 291 Jun 21 19:11 VERSION  
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 11703121 Jun 21 18:42 backup.log  
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 1134608378 Jun 21 18:42 backup.tar.gz  
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 62449664 Jun 21 19:11 rear-linux-cllg.iso  
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 162325 Jun 21 19:11 rear.log  
    mkisofs -o /tmp/onlytmp/rear-linux-cllg.iso -b isolinux/isolinux.bin
    -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4
    -boot-info-table -J -R -V disks .
2.  the dvd is written on dvd media
3.  booting is fine, menu selection works, automatic recovery lands in
    the "ERROR"

Ok, you want to backup on a DVD, perhaps you could try (and use the
latest rear-1.16.1):

    ## ISO backup included
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup   # this could  be a mounted USB disk on /backup
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://SERVER/vol/linux_images_dr/rear  # location to copy ISO image to
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4400
    TMPDIR=/mnt2/tmp  # alternative /tmp (as DVD size might be too big; use another location)

Thank you very much for the help. is there any document available to
create a disaste recovery dvd using rear ?. my understading is that the
software can be used with USB and NFS backup only.
