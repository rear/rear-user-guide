Daily I made a backup with rear of all our linux host. Works fine and I
can recover all hosts, except one.

I made a lab configuration for testing the recovery, VMWare with a nfs
server for storing the backups

I get the error:  
I mount the ISO and start automatic recovery  
ERROR mount command ‘ mount –v –t nfs –o rw, notime
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/rear/dest failed  
Check rear-s03.log for details

But on other host with rear recovery I can mount this path with no
problems

Furthermore I cannot go to option 2. Go to Relax and Reccover shell.
There I get errors,  
INIT: cannot execute “/sbin/mingetty”  
INIT: ID “t3” respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

I guess it is the ISO.  
What can I do?

Which ReaR version and which distro?

If you have several systems and only one cannot be restore - how is it
different from the others?

Was mingetty installed in the source system? Extract the initrd from the
ISO and check if mingetty is actuallly in it. chroot into the extracted
initrd to check if some libraries are missing.

Can you SSH into the recovery system (requires ssh keys in root
account)? If yes, check recovery log there for details about failed
mount.

Does the recovery system use same IP as source system or different? That
might be a reason for NFS mount failure.

In any case you have several issues (mount failure and mingetty
missing).

Hi  
I use Relax-and-Recover 1.16 / Git  
All our linux host are debian, the problem host:  
Linux s03.net-products.nl 2.6.32-5-amd64 \#1 SMP Sat May 5 01:12:59 UTC
2012 x86\_64 GNU/Linux  
Mingetty not installed….

Working host  
Relax-and-Recover 1.15 / Git  
Linux ontwikkel 3.2.0-4-amd64 \#1 SMP Debian 3.2.57-3 x86\_64
GNU/Linux  
Mingetty installed

I installed mingetty on the problem host en make an new iso, and now I
can go to the shell.

But mounting is still a problem. Seems to be same problem as mentioned
on posted issue : Mounting of NFS share fails at the time of recovering
Ubuntu\_12.04\_x64 VM to physical system \#463  
So I changed /usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh and added nolock
and recreated the iso

&lt; local defaultoptions="rw,noatime,nolock"
---------------------------------------------

>     local defaultoptions="rw,noatime"

Now I am restoring. Thanks!!!

And Yes, I recover to the same ip, we made a lab, with same
environment222

Met vriendelijke groet,

Nico van Elteren

use `BACKUP_OPTIONS="nolock"` in the `local.conf` file.

NFS lock requires rpc.statd IIRC. We have code that should deal with it
automatically:

    ~/src/rear$ grep -r rpc.statd .
    ./usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf:rpc.statd
    ./usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/08_start_required_daemons.sh:     if has_binary rpc.statd; then
    ./usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/08_start_required_daemons.sh:             rpc.statd
    ./usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/08_start_required_daemons.sh:             StopIfError "Could not start rpc.statd !"

You might want to investigate why this did not work in your case.
