Regarding the usual "by the way"

    Codespell / codespell (pull_request) Failing

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/actions/runs/12904381101/job/35988571739?pr=3382](https://github.com/rear/rear/actions/runs/12904381101/job/35988571739?pr=3382)  
which contains

    Error: ./usr/share/rear/restore/default/990_move_away_restored_files.sh:7: maily ==> mainly
    Error: ./usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:1005: carmel ==> caramel

    Error: ./usr/share/rear/build/USB/default/800_enforce_usb_output.sh:20: ortherwise ==> otherwise

Therein only the first 'maily ==&gt; mainly'  
and the last 'ortherwise ==&gt; otherwise' are valid.  
The rest are false alarm as usual by this dumb and annoying  
codespell bot.  
It seems that bot has nothing to distinguish actual code  
from human readable normal text and neither anything  
to reasonably separate words in usual code because things  
like `|*carmel[/!][0-9]*` or `carmel/?p?` or `|carmel\`  
are obviously no words in normal text where spell checking  
would make sense at all.  
I wonder why it does not complain about 'umount ==&gt; unmount'  
so it seems codespell has perhaps some hardcoded list of  
commonly known cases but it also seems such a hardcoded list  
is all it has (in particular no reasoable algorithm).

The 'carmel/Carmel' cases are

    # grep -i 'carmel' usr/share/rear/lib/*functions*

    usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:
            (*mmcblk[0-9]*|*nvme[0-9]*n[1-9]*|*rd[/!]c[0-9]*d[0-9]*|*cciss[/!]c[0-9]*d[0-9]*|*ida[/!]c[0-9]*d[0-9]*|*amiraid[/!]ar[0-9]*|*emd[/!][0-9]*|*ataraid[/!]d[0-9]*|*carmel[/!][0-9]*)

    usr/share/rear/lib/mkrescue-functions.sh:
    # Carmel 8-port SATA (carmel/?p?)
    #DEVwP=`expr "${1}" : "\(\(cciss\|rd\|ida\)/c[0-9]\+d[0-9]\+p[0-9]\+\|amiraid/ar[0-9]\+p[0-9]\+\|ataraid/d[0-9]\+p[0-9]\+\|\(emd\|carmel\)/[0-9]\+p[0-9]\+\)"`
           *rd[/!]c[0-9]d[0-9]p*|*cciss[/!]c[0-9]d[0-9]p*|*ida[/!]c[0-9]d[0-9]p*|*amiraid[/!]ar[0-9]p*|*emd[/!][0-9]p*|*ataraid[/!]d[0-9]p*|*carmel[/!][0-9]p*)

I "just fixed"

@jsmeix is this change ok also for SUSE distros? We disabled SUSE builds
in CI in this PR :
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3252](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3252)
(they could be useful in this case to check that the code still builds).

I can confirm it works now - at least in my case  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3379](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3379)  
where I clicked the "re-run failed check" a few minutes ago.  
Now "All checks have passed" there.  
@lzaoral  
thank you for taking care and for your fix!
