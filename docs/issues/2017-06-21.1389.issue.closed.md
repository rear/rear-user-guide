Trying to `make rpm` on SLES 10 SP3 ☹. Managed to install git 1.9.3 from
[some OBS
repo](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/poigru:/branches:/openSUSE:/12.1:/Update/SLE_10_SDK/)
(thanks @jsmeix !) but `make rpm` fails like this:

Any ideas?

In a git checkout I get:

<pre>
$ find . | xargs grep 'transform'

./Makefile:             tar -czf $(name)-$(distversion).tar.gz --transform='s,^,$(name)-$(distversion)/,S' --files-from=-
</pre>

It seems tar in SLE10 is too old for the the '--transform' option  
that is used in the Makefile because on my SLES10-SP4 system  
"man tar" does not mention the '--transform' option while  
it is mentioned in "man tar" on my SLES11 system.

According to the output of

<pre>
git log -p --follow Makefile
</pre>

the '--transform' option was introduced in Jun 2012 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e16dcd2d250036299eb0ac8918355a2ab0780624](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/e16dcd2d250036299eb0ac8918355a2ab0780624)

@schlomo @jsmeix Albeit that within OBS the rpms are properly build for
SLES10. Reverting the change? Remember SLES 10 is not on our support
list anymore, but nobody prevents you to adapt the Makefile for your
needs locally.

I think that I really would like to see a `make srpm` option which I can
use on my laptop and then build the rpm on the target distro.

@gdha  
I think building RPMs within the openSUSE Build Service  
happens via rear.spec which does not call 'make rpm'  
but only 'make install' as far as I see on first glance in rear.spec  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.1/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.1/rear.spec?expand=1)  
and in the build log for SLE10  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/live\_build\_log/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.1/SLE\_10\_SDK/i586](https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.1/SLE_10_SDK/i586)

OBS works because it just does `rpmbuild -ba` on SLES10. You feed it a
ready-made source tar.gz so that the problematic part is already done.

@jsmeix thanks for pointing this out - I was not aware (anymore) of how
it was build.

@schlomo @jsmeix Would reverting back to using `pax` bring *new* issues?
Or, would `make srpm` be a better solution in the end?

I'd like to see a `make srpm` step, that can use all the modern stuff.
The `make rpm` should be based on `make srpm`.

@schlomo Whenever you have time please verify the update of the
**Makefile**

It works - thanks a lot. Unfortunately with sles10 I had to do rpmbuild
from the tar.gz. Sorry for bothering you (although I do think it is
cleaner now). Let's work on the development build naming in \#1362
