    See
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2554](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2554)  
    and tested by others at SUSE on the upcoming SLES15-SP3  
    in particular also on an affected POWER machine

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In etc/scripts/system-setup.d/41-load-special-modules.sh  
load the nvram kernel module if possible to make /dev/nvram appear  
because nvram could be a module on POWER architecture, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2554\#issuecomment-764720180](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2554#issuecomment-764720180)  
and /dev/nvram should be there when installing GRUB,

I think I will move the `MODULES+=( nvram )` that I have currently only
in  
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ppc64.conf and
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-ppc64le.conf  
because currently "nvram could be a module on POWER architecture"  
to a generic place - likely to `MODULES+=( vfat ...` in
400\_copy\_modules.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh\#L120](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh#L120)  
so that nvram gets included for any archtiecture when it is a module  
because perhaps nvram could become a module also on non-POWER
architectures.

@rear/contributors  
could you have a look here (perhaps you notice an obvious mistake)?  
If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.
