The tool is under /sbin/gdisk:

@dcz01 Indeed you are right about linux-vdso.so.1 library. My best
advise is to use chroot on a /tmp/rear.xxx/rootfs directory and try to
find out if gdisk is working or not. Use the option -d with rear -vd
mkrescue

Regarding

/bin/gdisk versus /sbin/gdisk

The `ldd` test is run inside the ReaR recovery system (via
`chroot $ROOTFS_DIR ... ldd`)  
and inside the ReaR recovery system all binaries are actually in
`/bin/`  
because the other directories are only symlinks to `/bin/`

    localhost:/tmp/rear.XXXXX/rootfs # ls -ld bin sbin usr/bin usr/sbin
    drwxr-xr-x ... bin
    lrwxrwxrwx ... sbin -> bin
    lrwxrwxrwx ... usr/bin -> ../bin
    lrwxrwxrwx ... usr/sbin -> ../bin

@dcz01  
see the KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR description in default.conf that is currently
at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L163](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L163)  
how you could inspect the ReaR recovery system contents  
to find out what is missing for gdisk inside the ReaR recovery system.

@jsmeix @gdha  
Now i think i found the problem and mybe the solution for you...  
I changed the option/value `BACKUP=TSM` to `BACKUP=NETFS` and the ISO
was created successfully like before.  
But with the option/value `BACKUP=TSM` there is always the same problem
on some machines.

Could you now find the problem here?

@dcz01  
thank you for your feedback.  
It helps a lot to understand where the root cause likely is.

We (at ReaR upstream) know since a long time  
that third party tools often do "special" things with their libraries.  
Sometimes their "special things" are so very special that it only
works  
in their very special way in their specificially set up runtime
environment  
but e.g. not in the ReaR recovery system environment.

Because we (at ReaR upstream) do not have those third party tools  
we cannot help you with issues that are "inside" third party tools.  
In particular we cannot find out what special things would have to be  
set up in the ReaR recovery system environment to make some  
special third party tool work within the ReaR recovery system.

All you can do is to contact the vendor or manufacturer of that  
third party tool for help and support with their third party tool.  
When you paid them they should provide you what you paid for.

When the vendor or manufacturer of that third party tool  
opens an issue here at ReaR upstream we would help him  
to integrate his third party tool into our ReaR recovery system  
or we may find out together that this is impossible in practice  
with reasonable effort.

@dcz01  
now I see that you had already "a lot of no so fun" with TSM in the
past  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533)

So it seems TSM uses LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
which is known to cause troubles, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907\#issuecomment-434215448](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907#issuecomment-434215448)  
which links to  
[https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page\_id=1180](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=1180)  
which further links to  
[http://xahlee.info/UnixResource\_dir/\_/ldpath.html](http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html)

@dcz01  
could it be that the user 'root' on your original system  
(more precisely the exact 'root' that runs "rear mkrescue")  
has LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set to a non-empty value  
and if yes what is LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH set to?

@jsmeix Thanks for your fast reply.  
I've tested the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable with `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
but it was empty.  
So where could this variable been set outside of ReaR?

Empty LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH for 'root' who runs rear is good.

I have another idea:  
In your initial comment you wrote  
`Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / 2020-06-17`

On Nov 26 2020 I merged  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6b804a5cfcc45c1e2dc33110e33113d4b2db613f](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6b804a5cfcc45c1e2dc33110e33113d4b2db613f)  
where I completely overhauled the ldd test in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2523)  
because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508\#issuecomment-726711801](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2508#issuecomment-726711801)  
which could be the description of the root cause of this issue here.

@dcz01  
to test if this issue here is fixed in current ReaR master code  
do what is described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and provide feedback how current ReaR master code  
behaves in your particular case here.

@jsmeix You're right.
