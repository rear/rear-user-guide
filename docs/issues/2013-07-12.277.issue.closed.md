Debian wheezy both latest 1.14 as well as current master (12 July 2013)
fail to build a debian package with something mourning about FTBFS due
to outdated debhelper required (4).

Bumping to 5 seems to make the build working.  
I propose to up the required debhelper version to 8.0 which is what
currently old-stable (squeeze) requires since lenny has been EoL since
02.2012.

I'd say that this is kind of a hack, but at least it leads to a
buildable package that can be tested. :-)

OK, I hope this works up for you too I change the following things to
get a package:

dch wasn't happy about the changelog, I added Dag as commiter - the  
date and time is from git logs - hope that's ok:

This is more cosmetical but it doesn't like anymore the "Essential: no"
statement during build -  
since according to their packaging doc not writing results same:

Minor too, but I guess it's time to bump he required debhelper version -
not to high, but at least oldstable before it fires back once in the
future:

@matsimon did some change - could you double check please?

Hi @gdha, great, thanks I checked your changes with master (@
dd6de631371adc6bf5f4980485830ebe7d6d59c6)

Yes I can now build master on wheezy without issues, cool. For those who
don't want to build on their own - could you include building on wheezy
on the open build service? (currently only builds for squeeze)

Finally - more of a communication issue - is 1.15 definitely out?  
There are changelogs on the project page, but I don't see a release tag
or branch thus I'm asking :-)

There is an official branch 'rear-1.15' and a tag also (if I'm not
mistaken).  
PS: OBS should be ok now... thx for bringing to my attention

You're right, I should apply a patch on "how to read the github
interface" ;-)  
Thanks for OBS, great!
