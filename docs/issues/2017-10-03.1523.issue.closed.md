#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.00

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 7.3

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=NBU  
    KERNEL\_CMDLINE="$KERNEL\_CMDLINE net.ifnames=0"  
    ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "rootvg" )  
    SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD='<confidential>'

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue: Netbackup standalone agents vnetd
    and bpcd are not automatically started by rear recover command.  
    I have noticed there is prep script 450\_prepare\_netbackup.sh, but
    it's not automatically run by rear recover.  
    Is it by design? Or could you please advise how to make it start
    automatically?

-   Work-around, if any: Start agents manually with
    /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/90-netbackup.sh before running rear
    recover

@pdanek Have look at `conf/default.conf` file entry:

    grep COPY_AS_IS_NBU conf/default.conf 
    COPY_AS_IS_NBU=( /usr/openv/bin/vnetd /usr/openv/bin/vopied /usr/openv/lib /usr/openv/netbackup /usr/openv/var/auth/[mn]*.txt )

Is here something missing from the point of view of NBU?  
Also the script you should inspect is
`rescue/NBU/default/450_prepare_xinetd.sh` which starts the NBU
processes. Perhaps, it needs to be updated for RHEL 7.3 - systemd
scripts maybe??

COPY\_AS\_IS\_NBU files:

    RESCUE is-rear1t:~ # ls -ld /usr/openv/bin/vnetd

    ls: cannot access /usr/openv/var/auth/[mn]*.txt: No such file or directory

Inspection of script:

    if [ ! -f /etc/xinetd.d/vnetd ]; then
            /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/vnetd -standalone
    fi
    if [ ! -f /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd ]; then
            /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd -standalone
    fi

Executing the part of script manually:

    RESCUE is-rear1t:~ # ls -ld /etc/xinetd.d/vnetd
    ls: cannot access /etc/xinetd.d/vnetd: No such file or directory
    RESCUE is-rear1t:~ # ls -ld /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd
    ls: cannot access /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd: No such file or directory
    RESCUE is-rear1t:~ # /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/vnetd -standalone
    RESCUE is-rear1t:~ # /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd -standalone
    RESCUE is-rear1t:~ # ps -ef|grep -i netb
    root       453     1  0 09:47 ?        00:00:00 /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/vnetd -standalone
    root       457     1  0 09:47 ?        00:00:00 /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd -standalone

So why doesn't it start automatically? :-/

@pdanek because RHEL 7.3 uses systemd scripts to launch these daemons
and not xinetd.d scripts anymore. It should be updated from the ReaR
side.  
However, NBU is an external backup program for which we do **not write
for free** updates within ReaR. It can be done as it is not complicated
to do so.

@pdanek @rmetrich The pull request has been merged. Please provide
feedback if it works fine or not?  
Thanks for the effort already.

We will close this issue as no responsive is *good news*, right?

No, no, please reopen, I'm finishing the work (there is some issue to
deal with, unrelated to NetBackup but showing up because of it). I'm
currently waiting for feedback from @pdanek

As requested by @rmetrich we re-open the issue, but is the new issue
related to the PR you made? Or, is it something new due to the PR you
introduced?

The issue is within systemd service spawning the scripts (including
netbackup).  
With actual netbackup code, it still doesn't work because of that.  
So maybe opening a new issue is OK instead

@rmetrich Indeed it seems a new issue related to this one. Create a
separate issue please.  
I assume the new netbackup script you made works from the command line?
If that is the case, then it is related to systemd only and a new
systemd script should be written (and placed in the skel directory
structure perhaps).

won't be needed.  
Please close again, then. I hope to submit a PR soon (waiting for
@pdanek feedback).

@rmetrich was it \#1609 & \#1610 or something else?
