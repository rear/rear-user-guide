Please have a look at
[https://waffle.io/rear/rear](https://waffle.io/rear/rear), maybe this
helps our users see what we work on?

Don't want to sound paranoid but is this safe?

    Authorize application
    Waffle by @waffleio would like permission to access your account

@schlomo Did you authorized this access for your account?

Yes, I did. And I know what you mean. That is why I want your opinion on
this topic.

Waffle says: "Due to limitations in the GitHub API, we require
read/write access to your repos in order to interact with Issues". I
actually saw this kind of disclaimer in many tools and would say that
this is a reason why GitHub is only good for public stuff.

A possible alternative is to use [GitHub
projects](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features)
which kind of does the same but less fancy looking.

Well, reviewing permissions, I'm fine with:

-   Email addresses (read-only)  
    This application will be able to read your private email addresses.
-   Organizations and teams  
    Read-only access  
    This application will be able to read your organization and team
    membership.
-   write access to Issues

I'm not so happy with following write access:

-   Code
-   Pull requests
-   Wikis
-   Settings
-   Webhooks and services (despite I'm not entirely sure what this does)

But biggest NO NO for me is **Deploy keys**

But in general I'll trust you guys, as I'm pretty new in development, so
if you say it is safe I'm joining you.

If GitHub projects can do same thing, I'm prepared to exchange fanciness
for better security control any time ;-)  
A short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU) about
GitHub projects if you like watching more then reading ...

According to the video it seems like the projects can't use the labels
to sort issues into columns.

If we already talk about security, ATM we already have some external
apps enabled:

Maybe this is a good moment to talk about that and make sure that
everybody here agrees with that. I most definitively don't want to make
anybody feel worried about security here.

@gozora The deploy keys access that you mention is also the thing that
worries me most of all - and which is for me the reason to treat GitHub
more as a repo and less as a workflow tool that can change stuff
elsewhere.

To safeguard ReaR code we could also adopt GPG signing - as long as the
3rd party apps don't have your GPG key they won't be able to manipulate
our code without us knowing about it.

I actually started to sign all my commits this month.

GPG signing of ReaR is indeed a good idea!

I didn't read all the details but in general  
I never permit anybody or anything to act as if it was me.

It seems to me that we don't need Waffle.io or similar external tools at
the moment. If nobody speaks up in favor I'll remove it soon. Thanks a
lot, Schlomo

As nobody seems to use this we better close the case
