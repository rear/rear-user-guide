hi,  
im thinking about a feature in rear which would it make possible to
update a rear version within an already created iso image. This could be
very handy for example if an backup iso image has been created with an
rear version containing a specific bug or is missing a feature. Of
course it is better  
to go on with testing restores just after creating a backup.

So one way would be of course to unpack the iso image and update the
rear version in it to a more  
recent version, then repack. This however would not mean that the
restore works, maybe the  
disklayout created with the old version is incompatible. So i think it
would be great to have a  
compatibility version in the files created during backup. Then some
shellscript could handle things  
to repack the iso image and check if included items are compatible. Any
thoughts on that?

Would a live update not be easier to implement via e.h. HTTP protocol?
Just a thought...

Hi @abbbi, nice to hear back from you. Are you working on something
specific?

I think there are two ways to think about ReaR:

1.  Run it seldom, probably manually
2.  Run is often and automated

I am a big fan of running stuff often and automated so that I probably
would not have this problem at all. I think that if you are in the
middle of a Disaster Recovery then you will have enough stress to deal
with so that you probably would not upgrade ReaR as part of your general
recovery procedure.

If you have a system that won't recover then in my experience people
either give up or start to do the steps outlined in the diskrestore.sh
manually.

Another problem I see is cross-version compatibility: So far when we
write code for ReaR we know that the version running during recovery
will be the same as the one running during mkbackup/mkrescue. That means
that we will never have a problem of incompatibilities between the two
sides and we can easily change some internal data format or behavior by
changing it on both sides.

What you propose would essentially run a big risk that the more recent
recovery code will not handle the older data format of the recovery data
or it might even handle it different from what was intended by the older
code.

While it might be true that so far the changes in the data format have
been rather infrequent, I would hesitate to turn our recovery data
format into an official interface, at least as long as we don't have
automated tests for that.

I can imagine that another idea that comes up regularly might be more
useful for what you have in mind: The ability to create a generic
recovery media that could then be "connected" to an existing backup.
That way one would also get a new ReaR version for recovery.

Regarding "that the more recent recovery code will not handle the older
data format of the recovery data":

When I implemented generic basic btrfs support (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/497))
I just adapted the data format in disklayout.conf as I needed it and I
did not at all care about backward compatibility.

For me it is mandatory that what created disklayout.conf and what uses
it is from one same rear. I mean really "one same rear" not only same
rear version. "One same rear" means that the user can adapt/enhance his
rear as he likes.

When I enhance my current generic basic btrfs support (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556))
I will again change the data format in disklayout.conf as I will need
it.

@abbbi As we will not change our current design there is no need to keep
this open, right? Or is there still something you want to share with us?

hi,  
nope, currently nothing new to share on this topic
