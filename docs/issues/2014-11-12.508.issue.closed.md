During `rear recover` we hit an error:

    +++ type -p udevadm
    +++ udevadm control --stop-exec-queue
    +++ udevcontrol stop_exec_queue
    /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh: line 20: udevcontrol: command not found

For some reason:

    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10_include_partition_code.sh:type -p udevadm >/dev/null && udevadm control --stop-exec-queue || udevcontrol stop_exec_queue

is not interpreted as we hoped it would

related to issues \#480 and \#490

hi:  
I just install fedora21 beta server 64bit version. and udevadm
control--stop-exec-queue return 0. so I think maybe the problem only
happens when restore? I will try to figure out what happened.  
also I think the error message is ugly and misleading. when I did the
patch, I tried to use minimal code to do it. I will try to improve it..

hi:  
I try to do "rear recover" at another vm and "udevadm control
--stop-exec-queue" works fine and didn't complain. so my first restore
just fine. when I restore second time, I met some problem mentioned by
others (lvm wait for yes, strange I never met this problem with RHEL6),
but udevadm didn't return error code 2, it returns error code 0. maybe
the fedora 21 beta version we used are different? I install fedora21
beta by default (I don't choose anything, let installer decide
everything for me).

hi:  
try to recover several times at original vm, and it seems fine. also I
found something interesting, at first I backup at VM-A and restore to
VM-B, VM-B has a larger hardisk then VM-A. when I do second time restore
to VM-B, I met the "lvm wait yes" problem and grub2 can not install
problem. (first time restore is fine).

if the backup and restore vm disk are the same size, I never got any
problem...

@tbsky lvm wait yes" problem is related to issue \#493 (scroll down in
the issue). Should now be fixed in github... I think we are good to
close this on?

hi gdha:

I just check out github and did find the fix of "lvcreate" command to
fix the "lvm wait yes" issue. I haven't try it, but it looks good.

also I find out the fix of "udevadm control --stop-exec-queue". but I
don't think it is a proper fix. as I said, the udev problem is not nly
related to mdadm only, it is related to many procedure of disk
operation. and the new fix only pause udev, but didn't unpause it (I
don't know if udevadm trigger/settle will unpause udev, maybe you have
try it so these commands will unpause udev?)

the puzzle for me is that I can not reproduce what you saw under fedora
21 beta. in my testing "udevadm control --stop-exec-queue" is working
fine under fedora 21 beta. could you tell me what iso/install method to
use so I can reproduce what you saw?

@tbsky I prefer to leave it as it as for 1.17 as it is impossible for me
to test all the distro's and versions mix. I also moved the milestone to
1.18

@gdha I create a new pull request, hope it can make the situation
better..

@tbsky I can confirm it works well on Fedora21 now. Thanks for the hard
work and patience...
