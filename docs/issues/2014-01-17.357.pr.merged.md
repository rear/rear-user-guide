I updated the script to deal with changes introduced in Rhel7-Beta.  
The rescue-images that are being created when installing a new kernel
package should not be recreated by rear, as they  
should contain all available modules. Only the hardware dependant images
have to be recreated.  
Additionally the initrd-plymouth.img from plymouth for graphical booting
should not be touched.  
Also two unneccessary lines were deleted.
