Hi @do-d1,

May I assume your */etc/rear/cifs* looks something like:

    # cat /etc/rear/cifs
    username=_username_
    password=_secret password_
    domain=_domain_

?

Interesting,  
Honestly I'm not using Samba much, but I'll try to reproduce it and see
what can be wrong.  
One more question though, do you have some specific reason for using
ReaR 1.17 ?  
Could you maybe test with ReaR 2.0?

ill give a try for ReaR 2.0 and will update the results

Hello @do-d1

I just finished backup of my Ubuntu 14.4 to samba back end.  
For me, it just worked.  
I've used following configuration (quite similar to yours):

    ubuntu:(/root)(root)# cat /etc/rear/local.conf 
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://suse12/rear
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( /media/* )

Samba setup like (more/less default):

    suse12:~ # cat /etc/samba/smb.conf 
    # smb.conf is the main Samba configuration file. You find a full commented
    # version at /usr/share/doc/packages/samba/examples/smb.conf.SUSE if the
    # samba-doc package is installed.
    [global]
        workgroup = WORKGROUP
        passdb backend = tdbsam
        printing = cups
        printcap name = cups
        printcap cache time = 750
        cups options = raw
        map to guest = Bad User
        include = /etc/samba/dhcp.conf
        logon path = \\%L\profiles\.msprofile
        logon home = \\%L\%U\.9xprofile
        logon drive = P:
        usershare allow guests = Yes
    [homes]
        comment = Home Directories
        valid users = %S, %D%w%S
        browseable = No
        read only = No
        inherit acls = Yes
    [profiles]
        comment = Network Profiles Service
        path = %H
        read only = No
        store dos attributes = Yes
        create mask = 0600
        directory mask = 0700
    [users]
        comment = All users
        path = /home
        read only = No
        inherit acls = Yes
        veto files = /aquota.user/groups/shares/
    [groups]
        comment = All groups
        path = /home/groups
        read only = No
        inherit acls = Yes
    [printers]
        comment = All Printers
        path = /var/tmp
        printable = Yes
        create mask = 0600
        browseable = No
    [print$]
        comment = Printer Drivers
        path = /var/lib/samba/drivers
        write list = @ntadmin root
        force group = ntadmin
        create mask = 0664
        directory mask = 0775
    [rear]
        comment = ReaR backup folder
        path = /mnt/rear
        valid users = sodoma
        read only = no

However, I had a small problem with missing *mount.cifs* binary on my
Ubuntu, which was solved with `apt-get install cifs-utils`. After this
all worked fine for me.

If you still have trouble, please re-run backup with
`rear -d -D mkbackup` and post output log here. It should be more clear
what is wrong, once we have whole session record.

V.

P.S. I've tested with *Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git* so I guess you
don't need to upgrade. ;-).

@do-d1 I think it is a good idea to add some more comments in our
example configuration files about package dependencies

rear 1.19 & 2.0 depends on isolinux,  
isolinux is available only for ubuntu 16.04 and up

my test system is ubuntu server 14.04 x64

dpkg -i ./rear\_1.18\_amd64.deb  
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of rear

apt-get update  
apt-get install -f

this packages was installed:

attr binutils genisoimage iproute libcrypt-passwdmd5-perl mtools
syslinux  
syslinux-common

for cifs support i had to install cifs-utils  
and this dependency's was also installed :

keyutils libavahi-client3 libavahi-common-data libavahi-common3
libcups2  
libgmp10 libldb1 libtalloc2 libtdb1 libtevent0 libwbclient0
python-crypto  
python-ldb python-samba python-talloc python-tdb samba-common  
samba-common-bin samba-libs

cift works great

a feature i would like to see is an option to encrypt the
cred=/etc/rear/cifs  
file

hello @do-d1 ,

You are always welcome!

In my opinion, encrypting credential file just lack sense, especially if
you are using Samba which is not encrypted by default ...  
If you'd like to increase security of your backups, you should go for
`BACKUP_URL=sshfs://` (which I never personally tryied) or `BACKUP=BORG`
which uses ssh as transfer protocol (with Borg you will also get backup
deduplication).  
With these two methods you can take advantage of ssh keys functionality
and basically lock your credentials.

For more info, please check ReaR
[documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)
,and some basic backup
[scenarios](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)
can be useful as well.

Hope it helps.

V.

You can also use DUPLICITY as BACKUP method - security guaranteed.

Hello I wanted to try rear with a Ubuntu server for the first time

    # cat /etc/rear/cifs

Is the above right or do I have to add the \_ signs.
