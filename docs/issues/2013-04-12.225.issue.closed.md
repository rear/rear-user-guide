Hi,

In our environment, with local boot disks and SAN disks, we want to make
sure the SAN disks are only accessed via their multipath device, not the
direct paths. To do this, we block all access to the single paths using
a filter in the lvm.conf file. So in our filter line, we typically see
something like this:

    filter = [ "a|/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600508b1001cdac79483c5b08490cb4d.*|", "a|/dev/mapper/mpath.*|", "a|/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-pvol.*|", "r/.*/" ]

Now if we recover a system using this on other hardware, we need to
modify this filter line manually, otherwise the system will not boot
after recovery.

something we should add to the list of files we go through to change
paths, uuids,...

@wdpoorte how do you see this implemented in a recovery mode? Are you
able to give it a try?

@wdpoorte were you able to test this already with patch 6e05ec6?
