-   Brief description of the issue  
    I did a rescue image of a High Performance Computer, everything went
    well. Connected on serial console (ttyS1) I tried to restore the
    system using PXE boot method, the kernel and initrd are loaded and
    then everything seems to work normally but the process stops at : \*
    \* \* Rescue Image is Ready \* \* \*  
    and I never see the login prompt.. I don't know if it is a serial
    console issue or something else
-   Work-around, if any: I deleted the option *vga=normal* (there is no
    VGA card on the machine) in the kernel boot parameters and I have
    added the line *co:23:respawn:/sbin/agetty ttyS1 115200 vt100-nav*  
    in  
    **/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/inittab**  
    and

Thank you for your quick reply, unfortunately I am a student doing an
internship so I won't be able to test until tomorrow, I am sorry.. But I
will keep you informed and tell you the result tomorrow as soon as I
will be at work.

Adding the line `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y` did not work.. My kernel boot

`root=/dev/ram0 rd.debug rw selinux=0 console=ttyS1,115200`

@bryan06 In recover mode the script
`/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/45-serial-console.sh`
should add an entry to the `/etc/inittab` during boot up time. However,
it check if `stty` is present. Could you verify if that is the case?

@gdha I have verified the script execution during boot up time and
`stty` does find ttyS0 and ttyS1, the script adds the entries in
`/etc/inittab` and lauches `init q`. The only error I get is that it
could not find the file `/etc/init.conf`.  
P.S : I am using IPMI

@bryan06 The message
`init: /etc/init.conf: Unable to load configuration: No such file or directory`
is normal as there is no `/etc/init.conf` present on most systems.  
However, if you say ttyS1 has been added the the `/etc/inittab` why you
didn't get a prompt?

@gdha I don't know ... There is a blank line after \* \* \* Rescue Image
is Ready \* \* \* and I can't do anything else. I tried to boot the
rescue image from a Virtualbox VM and it worked correctly, so I think it
is a console issue but I don't have any idea of what could be
misconfigured..

@bryan06 According
[http://ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/IPMI\_on\_Debian.html](http://ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/IPMI_on_Debian.html)
it IPMI uses a serial console, or did you drop ReaR altogether ?

Hi @gdha,

I'm just having same problem with rear 2.2-5 rhel7.2 in a Physical Host
with VGA and Serial.

USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE=y  
/etc/inittab with the console configured in rescue image, but no prompt
in serial, and correct prompt in VGA.

If I run agetty ttyS0 115200 ... from the VGA prompt then I loss the VGA
prompt and the serial start working.

I'm trying to understand what is happening, but any help will be
appreciated.

Kind regards,  
Didac

I guess on RHEL7 the `/etc/inittab` file is not read anymore. I found
the following at RH:

Edit `/etc/default/grub` file. Find the clause GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX and
append the clause console=ttyS0,115200. For example:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap rhgb video=640x400 quiet console=ttyS0,115200"

And then, generate a fresh GRUB configuration:

    # grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg

However, we need to figure out how to do this with our rescue image -
hope it helps?

Yes, I've added these config in the GRUB config:

GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1 crashkernel=auto
rd.lvm.lv=vgroot/lv\_root rd.lvm.lv=vgroot/lv\_swap nomodeset
LANG=en\_US.UTF-8 KEYBOARDTYPE=pc KEYTABLE=es
transparent\_hugepage=never intel\_idle.max\_cstate=1
processor.max\_cstate=1 elevator=noop vga=normal
earlyconn=uart8250,io,0x3f8,115200n8 console=ttyS0,115200"

To configure it OK in ReaR I needed to set:  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE="earlyconn=uart8250,io,0x3f8,115200n8"

But at the end the serial console hang without prompt.  
I'm looking at it and I will resolve this problem soon :P I guess :D

I will update the issue with my results and questions.

Hi,

Well... I found some interesting things :-P

When ReaR detects serial it configures it in inittab, and this was
working until systemd.

With systemd there are some strange things in the skel that I had to
understand how they work (I'm not systemd expert :P)

The resulting KERNEL\_CMDLINE with serial found in ReaR is:
....console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0

the <serial-getty@.service> is not configured, or at least does not
work, the service file exist, but seems no one is using it. and it has a
typo:  
is:  
ExecStart=-/bin/agetty -s %I 115200,38400,9600  
should be:  
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -s %I 115200,38400,9600

But with this changed, still does not work...

I found a way to make it working, but I don't know if is the best
option, following the changes I made to an installed system with rear:

<pre>

cd /usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/

vi serial-getty@.service
---
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -s %I 115200,38400,9600
...
...
[Install]
Alias=serial-getty.target.wants/serial-getty@ttyS0.service
---

vi getty@.service
------
...
...
[Install]
Alias=getty.target.wants/getty@tty0.service
------

vi serial-getty.target
------
#  This file is part of systemd.
#

[Unit]
Description= Serial Login Prompts
-------

mkdir serial-getty.target.wants
cd serial-getty.target.wants/
ln -s ../serial-getty@.service serial-getty@ttyS0.service
cd multi-user.target.wants/
ln -s ../serial-getty.target serial-getty.target

cd getty.target.wants/
rm getty@tty{1,2,3,4}.service
ln -s ../getty@.service getty@tty0.service

</pre>

I've removed the tty1-4 services, because at login ig tty1 and tty0 are
present, both services get started and the graph console prompt is
impossible to enter commands. and if I stop any of them from the serial
console then works, but if I keep tty1 does not work at startup. :P

Let me know if this solution works also for you please, if is the case,
I will send a PR asap.

I've tested this with RHEL 7.2 and HP SuperdomeX servers. using serial
console connection and ILO console.

Regards,  
Didac

Hi, I'm testing with other changes that seems to work better, when the
tests were finished I will update the issue with the final proposal, I
guess :P

@gdha

I found a better solution. We tested it with RHEL7.2 on HP supoerdomeX
hardware with ILO console and serial console and with Debian 9 on
libvirt with and without serial port attached.

These changes worked in our tests:
