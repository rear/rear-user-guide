-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
ensure the partition name/type entry in disklayout.conf  
is always set (and percent encoded if needed)  
at least it is set to the fallback value 'rear-noname'  
regardless of the 'disk\_label' value

My attempt here makes things even worse!

That old code is so terribly obfuscated  
that it is basically impossible to fix things  
with reasonable effort.

Now its sucessor
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2803)  
tries to avoid issues like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2801)  
by ensuring a supported partition table is found  
and if not it errors out.
