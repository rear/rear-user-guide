In
[http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/](http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/)  
their "quite simple" examples section  
of the CurlFtpFS geeks is too simple  
because it does not mention how to do it  
with authenticated ftp.

@sergeymx  
can you provide a full command line example how  
to get a remote ftp URL with username and password  
"mounted" at a local directory and how to "umount" it  
after usage?  
Preferably by using your
[ftp://mx@asu-test/rear/](ftp://mx@asu-test/rear/) from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842)

Furthermore I would like to know if after such a "umount"  
has returned then it means that all data is actually  
successfully sent to the ftp server.

\[root@centos6-build mx\]\# curlftpfs -o user=mx asu-test/rear
/home/mx/ftp  
Enter host password for user 'mx':  
\[root@centos6-build mx\]\# ls /home/mx/ftp  
asu-test rear-centos6-build-backup.iso rear-centos6-build-rescue.iso  
\[root@centos6-build mx\]\# umount /home/mx/ftp

Steps:

1.  use 1 terminal and mount curlftpfs
2.  use 2 terminal and start : rear -v mkbackup
3.  switch to terminal 1 and run command: umount /home/mx/ftp/  
    i see :  
    \[root@centos6-build mx\]\# umount /home/mx/ftp  
    umount: /home/mx/ftp: device is busy.  
    (In some cases useful info about processes that use  
    the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))

Many thanks for the info.  
As time permits I will try to implement something  
as a very first starting point ...

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859)
implements  
first steps to support new ftpfs BACKUP\_URL.

Note that the URI scheme is "ftpfs" to distinguish  
that from the already existing URI scheme "ftp"  
cf.

@sergeymx  
can you test
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859)  
and report whether or not it also works for you?  
Note the currently needed "modprobe fuse" as descibed  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859\#issue-158191489](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859#issue-158191489)

@sergeymx  
can you test current rear master  
and report whether or not it also works for you?

With current rear master "modprobe fuse" happens  
automatically as needed, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859\#issuecomment-223540169](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859#issuecomment-223540169)

My next step would be trying to improve the speed when  
the backup is stored via curlftpfs, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859\#issue-158191489](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/859#issue-158191489)

@sergeymx  
do you perhaps already know how to improve  
the writing speed when using curlftpfs?  
"man curlftpfs" lists many options where most of them  
are meaningless for me (I am not at all a FTP expert).
