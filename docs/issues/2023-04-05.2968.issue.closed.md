@drakkainenn

only a guess:

Does it perhaps work for you with

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE='no'

in etc/rear/local.conf or in etc/rear/site.conf  
provided you do not use a serial console.

If you use a serial console specify the config variables

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB

according to what you need in your particular case.

All config variables are described in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
e.g. online for ReaR 2.7 at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

Sorry for this question, but how to check if and which console am I
using ?  
It this correct ?

    USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
    root     tty1     -                13:24    4.00s  0.00s  0.00s -bash

So is my console tty1?

Moreover i enter "set debug=all" and I can see a long, long, long
loading something.

I am talking about only the serial console.  
By default current ReaR automatically sets up serial console output  
by adding certain 'console=...' options to the kernel command line  
for booting the ReaR recovery system kernel.  
But when you do not have a serial console device connected,  
then all output may get falsely redirected to a serial port  
where no serial console device is connected  
so you may no longer get any output  
on your normal (i.e. non-serial) console, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)  
Usually your normal console is the VGA (video) console,  
e.g. for Linux kernel version 5.3 see  
[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.3/admin-guide/serial-console.html](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.3/admin-guide/serial-console.html)  
In the ReaR recovery system boot menue select  
the topmost enty of the form "Recover HOSTNAME" and  
press the \[Tab\] key to see the kernel command line  
which you can edit there as you need (e.g. remove or change  
possibly wrong 'console=...' kernel command line options), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843\#issuecomment-1196337765](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843#issuecomment-1196337765)

With "set debug=all" you enable all GRUB2 debug messages.  
I did this only once some longer time ago and with that  
GRUB2 never finished for me in practice because it took  
way too long when GRUB2 outputs all debug messages.  
I waited for almost an hour with the same kind of  
endlessly appearing GRUB2 debug messages as in your  
[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111309896/230096025-fdd31158-852c-4644-9dd0-d993d2f88924.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111309896/230096025-fdd31158-852c-4644-9dd0-d993d2f88924.png)  
Perhaps it works better to enable only specific GRUB2 debug messages  
via `set debug=this,that` where 'this' and 'that' are specific  
GRUB2 tags for only certain debug output that should be enabled.  
I am not at all a GRUB2 expert so I can  
neither list what possible GRUB2 debug tags exist  
nor what GRUB2 debug tags are useful in practice  
(quick "googling" for it did not show me something useful).

Thank you for your support.

After 10-20 minuites of waiting I finally have something new:

No idea.

In particular not because I  
neither have your server hardware  
nor do I use your Linux distribution.

Hi.  
I wasted week for troubleshooting it, using version 2.5,2.6 and 2.7.  
Finally - don't laugh - I was using mkbackup instead of mkrescue
command.  
Now I see recovery options.  
It failed now at

So I need to check it and I will back to you.

2.7 still not working as expected so Im working with 2.6 so far.

I don't know if I should create new issue or someone can check where but
I have problem with FS restore:

Somehow /var/log can't be recreate. Any idea what is wrong ? /var/crash
is almost the same but without any issue.

//Manually is working fine

In ReaR 2.6  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110\_include\_lvm\_code.sh  
contains

    lvm lvcreate $lvopts $vg <<<y

which only inputs a single 'y' into lvcreate  
that causes

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820\#issuecomment-1153681719](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820#issuecomment-1153681719)

Therefore in ReaR 2.7  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110\_include\_lvm\_code.sh  
contains a fix that is backward compatible with old 'lvcreate'  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820\#issuecomment-1153750220](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820#issuecomment-1153750220)

    ... ( yes 2>/dev/null || true ) | lvm lvcreate ...

to pipe as many 'y' as asked for into "lvm lvcreate"  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2827](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2827)

The current ReaR upstream master code  
it is no longer backward compatible with old 'lvcreate'  
and contains now

    ... lvm lvcreate -y ...

2.6 is working fine, I am able to restore system,  
Unfortunately due to some issue or I don't know what 2.7 is not working
at all.

2.6:

I don't know what has been changed 2.6 vs 2.7 but I as you can see on
screenshot I cannot boot rear menu.

Even if I add console=tty0 to 2.7 iso image still not working.

Something changed in 2.7 and I cannot boot rear to recovery menu

From what I see in the screenshots in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2968\#issuecomment-1514535513](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2968#issuecomment-1514535513)  
it looks very much like the 'console=...' kernel options issue  
that we have since ReaR 2.7 - see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)

See my above initial comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2968\#issuecomment-1497276627](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2968#issuecomment-1497276627)  
and see the related issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)  
that I mentioned in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2968\#issuecomment-1498590464](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2968#issuecomment-1498590464)  
in that issue in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843\#issuecomment-1196337765](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843#issuecomment-1196337765)

I.e. if you inserted 'console=tty0' before 'console=ttyS...'  
only the kernel startup messages may get shown  
but not the ReaR recovery system messages.  
So you need to append 'console=tty0' at the end  
as the last kernel option to make the kernel command line  
look same in ReaR 2.7 as it looks in ReaR 2.6.

When you do not have a serial console it is usually  
best to not specify any 'console=...' kernel option,  
i.e. when you do not have a serial console it usually  
"just works" to rely on the kernel default behaviour.

Did you actually try out how ReaR 2.7 behaves with

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE='no'

in etc/rear/local.conf or in etc/rear/site.conf ?

You should try it out on a separated test machine.  
The worst thing that I can imagine what could go wrong  
is that you will see nothing at all on your screen  
when the ReaR recovery system boots and runs.  
In this case you would have to shut down the system blindly,  
probably you may have to power off the machine without a  
clean shutdown which should not matter on a test machine.

Finally I found what what wrong :)

My colleague prepared rpm packages from source files and I had an issue
with this rpm.

Today I just typed "make install" from source and everything is fine!

So something is not correct with make rpm then or our environment which
we used for building rpm package.

Finally:  
"make install" -&gt; working. I am able to start recovery process  
"make rpm" -&gt; rpm is not working properly. All looks fine but
recovery process is not loading.

Next step:  
Check why "make rpm" is creating damaged rpm
