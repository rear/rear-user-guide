On Ubuntu precise + Cryptloop  
when booting rear

the step:  
cryptsetup --debug luksFormat -q --cypher aes-sha256 --hash sha1 --uuid

Failed to setup dm-crypt key mapping for device /dev/sda5

Check that kernel supports aes-sha256 cipher (Check Syslog for more
information)  
Gets: Command failed with code 5: Failed to write to key Storage

Syslog:  
davice-mapper: table 252:0: crypt: IV mechanism required  
davice-mapper: error adding target to table

Changing it to twofish has worked. for the cryptsetup, seems there is
some modules missing

@tyl0re could you find out to see which module is present on production
side? Perhaps dm-crypt needs an extra module??

Looked at the sources of
`https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/source/browse/src/cryptsetup.h`
and noticed that it relies on OpenSSL. So my guess is that `openssl`
should be added to the rescue image... worth trying.

@tyl0re any luck so far?

I have written you an email to <gratien.dhaese@gmail.com>, so you could
have a look for your self, mayby its faster,since there a two Ubuntu
Problems

*Finding 1*:

    root@test-rear:~# cat /proc/crypto | grep aes
    name         : cbc(aes)
    driver       : cbc(aes-generic)
    name         : cbc(aes)
    driver       : cbc(aes-generic)
    name         : aes
    driver       : aes-generic
    root@test-rear:~# cat /proc/crypto | grep sha256
    name         : hmac(sha256)
    driver       : hmac(sha256-generic)
    name         : sha256
    driver       : sha256-generic

    RESCUE test-rear:/var/lib/rear/layout # cat /proc/crypto | grep aes
    name         : cbc(aes)
    driver       : cbc(aes-generic)
    name         : cbc(aes)
    driver       : cbc(aes-generic)
    name         : aes
    driver       : aes-generic
    RESCUE test-rear:/var/lib/rear/layout # cat /proc/crypto | grep sha256
    name         : hmac(sha256)
    driver       : hmac(sha256-generic)
    name         : sha256
    driver       : sha256-generic

so, all required drivers are available in the kernel on both systems.
That is not the issue here.

Crypting it with other then aes-sha256 seems to work, only aes-sha256
fails

Does it aes-sha256 work fine on your test system (not recovery system)?

There are 2 Testsystems (1 Bootet Rear cd) 1 the Orginal System (2
Ports) So its easier to try and compare them

not sure what added value I still can deliver for this case?

Hi Sorry for the late answer, i have been in Holliday.  
I found the Error! :-)

The Orginal System is:

root@mail:/etc\# cryptsetup status sda5\_crypt  
/dev/mapper/sda5\_crypt is active and is in use.  
type: LUKS1  
cipher: aes-cbc-essiv:sha256  
keysize: 256 bits  
device: /dev/sda5  
offset: 4096 sectors  
size: 209207296 sectors  
mode: read/write

The command in Rear is:  
cryptsetup luksFormat -q --cypher aes-sha256 -hash sha1 --uid \[NR\]
/dev/sda5

When Changing it to:  
cryptsetup luksFormat -q --cypher aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -hash sha1 --uid
\[NR\] /dev/sda5

Works (Changed in the Cypher from the Orginal machine) Seems somehow
rear seems to get the cypher wrong

@tyl0re Ok, thx for the feedback - so in
`/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` the cypher was wrong?  
Perhaps, if you could debug the script
`./usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/26_crypt_layout.sh` to where it
goes wrong for me?

Errror is in:  
mode=$(cryptsetup luksDump $device |grep "Cipher mode"| sed -r
's/^.+:\\s\*(.+)$/\\1/'

Cipher mode: cbc-essiv:sha256

since the mode has an : in it, it cuts only the last part instead the
complete mode

mode=$(cryptsetup luksDump $device |grep "Cipher mode"|cut -d : -f
2-|awk '{printf("%s",$1)};')

Works,mayby there is an more elegant way to do it

Forgott to close ,since its working
