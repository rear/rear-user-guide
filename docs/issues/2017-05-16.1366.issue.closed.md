During ReaR recovery system startup I get from  
etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh

<pre>
The original network device eth0 12:34... is not available.
Please select another device:
1) eth0 56:78...
2) Skip replacing the network device
Choose the network device to use:
</pre>

and there it behaves like a 'sit-and-wait predator'  
(cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush\_predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_predator)
)  
and waits endlessly for my input.

For my use-case it is only a minor annoyance but  
I think this could become a major hindrance  
for any kind of automated "rear recover" run.

Hereby I propose to enhace it with an appropriate timeout  
so that it automactially proceeds with a default/fallback value  
when there is no user input.

In particular in cases like the above when there is only one  
actual choice it could usually safely automactially proceed.  
What else except the one actual choice could the user do  
in practice - I mean in practice the user wants to proceed.

The implementation problem is that bash 'select'  
has no timeout but bash 'read' has one so that  
I must probably replace 'select' by 'read -t'.

üëç I was also already annoyed by the two question for disklayout.conf and
diskrestore.sh which I would like to default to "5" (continue) at least
during an automated recovery.

If you rebuild `select` with `read` then please kindly do so in a
function. Maybe something that allows easily to convert a
`select ... done` clause into a `case ... esac` clause with similar
content.

@schlomo  
in this case even I agree to provide such general useful  
functionality in a global function.

Furthermore with 'read' one can - as needed - avoid  
the additional \[Enter\] key, just typing a single character  
and off it goes like

<pre>
REPLY=x ; read -t 3 -n 1 -p 'type a char (timeout 3 sec) ' ; echo ; echo using $REPLY
</pre>

The disadvantage of single character input is that the user has no
chance to fix an error, e.g. you meant 1 but hit 2 and off it goes. With
the Enter key the user can think if he really wanted to give that input.

Hence I would prefer to wait for Enter and actually time out with a
sensible default or abort where appropriate.

I meant the 'read -n 1' behaviour only optionally.  
With 'read' we could do that, with 'select' it is impossible.  
By default \[Enter\] is required.

Right now I tried an automated recovery and  
at the end I get a 'select' dialog that waits forever

<pre>
'rear recover' finished successfully

1) View Relax-and-Recover log file(s)
2) Go to Relax-and-Recover shell
3) Reboot
Select what to do 
</pre>

I would prefer an automated reboot  
(provided "rear recover" results zero exit code)  
after some timeout.

@jsmeix @schlomo Have you ever used the `MIGRATION_MODE` variable? That
is switched off when I run in **unattended** recovery mode. I also use 2
variables `PXE_RECOVER_MODE` or `ISO_RECOVER_MODE` to trigger the
behaviour.

The rear-workshop stuff auto-enables `MIGRATION_MODE` because it
recovers to a different hard disk. So yes.

@gdha  
I cannot find usage of MIGRATION\_MODE in anything  
except scripts in usr/share/rear/layout

<pre>
$ find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ | xargs grep -l 'MIGRATION_MODE'

usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/110_include_lvm_code.sh

usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/270_overrule_migration_mode.sh
usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/100_ask_confirmation.sh
</pre>

but here we talk in particular also about user input that is  
requested during revovery system startup i.e. in the  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\*  
scripts.

I think we should not mix up MIGRATION\_MODE functionality  
with new functionality how user input requests behave.

I think the latter should be implemented separated e.g.  
via a new config variable like USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT  
or USER\_INPUT\_WAIT\_SECONDS.

Currently I am playing around with a function  
that replaces 'select' by 'read'.  
In principle I got something working but the  
signature (i.e. its arguments and its output)  
of my current function is ugly.

My basic problem is that I would have liked to  
have an array of choices as first function argument  
and after that have optional other arguments to specify  
things like timeout (if not the default timeout should be used)  
like

<pre>
choices=( 'foo and bar' 'this and that' 'something else' )
timeout=30
choice="$( selectread "${choices[@]}" $timeout )"
case "$choice" in
    ...
esac
</pre>

Because one cannot pass an array as one function argument  
cf.
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16461656/bash-how-to-pass-array-as-an-argument-to-a-function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16461656/bash-how-to-pass-array-as-an-argument-to-a-function)  
the choices must be the last function arguments  
an all possibly optional arguments must be first  
always specified as positional parameters like

<pre>
choices=( 'foo and bar' 'this and that' 'something else' )
prompt="select something"
default="${choices[2]}"
timeout=30
choice="$( selectread "$prompt" "$default" $timeout "${choices[@]}" )"
case "$choice" in
    ...
esac
</pre>

Why not simply use `getopts` and named arguments? Something like this

    selectread -t 60 -p "Please choose one" "${choices[@]}"

IMHO a much cleaner interface and you can have default values for
arguments not specified.

I have something that seems to work not too bad for me  
but I did not yet test it very much.

Currently it is a stand-alone file choose.sh  
that uses no ReaR functions therefore for now  
there are things like plain "echo ... 1&gt;&2"  
that will be later replaced by appropriate  
ReaR functions (e.g. Log).

During development I use "set -e -u -o pipefail"  
which shows very nicely "too optimistic code"  
(at least for me).

I use non-zero return codes according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1134](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1134)

Simple example how it could be used:

<pre>
# ( source choose.sh ; choices=( 'foo and bar' 'this and that' 'something else' ) ; choose "${choices[@]}" )

1) foo and bar
2) this and that
3) something else
Your input (default 1 timeout 60) 2
User chose 'this and that'
this and that
</pre>

More complicated example:

<pre>
# ( source choose.sh ; choices=( 'foo and bar' 'this and that' 'something else' ) ; choose -a myarr -d q "${choices[@]}" || true ; for e in "${myarr[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done )

1) foo and bar
2) this and that
3) something else
Your input (default 1 timeout 60) 3 foo bar bazq
User chose 'something else'
something else
'3'
'foo'
'bar'
'baz'
</pre>

Finally the whole script choose.sh

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=60
USER_INPUT_PROMPT="Your input"
USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=1000

function choose () {
    set -e -u -o pipefail
    # Set defaults or fallback values:
    local timeout=60
    # Avoid stderr if USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT is not set or empty and ignore wrong USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT:
    test "$USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT" -ge 0 2>/dev/null && timeout=$USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT
    local prompt="enter a choice number"

    # Avoid stderr if USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS is not set or empty and ignore wrong USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS:

    local input_delimiter=""
    local default_choice_index=0
    # Get the options and their arguments:

    while getopts ":t:p:a:n:d:D:" option ; do
        case $option in
            (t)
                test "$OPTARG" -ge 0 && timeout=$OPTARG || echo "Invalid -$option argument '$OPTARG' using fallback '$timeout'" 1>&2

I already found some more issues (one needs to reset OPTIND), cf  
[http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035\#Complex\_nonstandard\_add-on\_utilities](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035#Complex_nonstandard_add-on_utilities)  
but now even automated retries until the user has explicitly  
entered a valid choice work for me:

<pre>
# ( source choose.sh ; choices=( 'foo and bar' 'this and that' 'something else' ) ; until choose -t 10 -D 99 "${choices[@]}" ; do echo "try again" ; done )

No default choice
1) foo and bar
2) this and that
3) something else
Your input (default 100 timeout 10) 
'read' finished with non-zero exit code
probably 'read' timed out
No choice for '100' using fallback ''

try again
No default choice
1) foo and bar
2) this and that
3) something else
Your input (default 100 timeout 10) fubar
-bash: test: fubar: integer expression expected
Wrong user input 'fubar' using fallback ''

try again
No default choice
1) foo and bar
2) this and that
3) something else
Your input (default 100 timeout 10) 7
No choice for '7' using fallback ''

try again
No default choice
1) foo and bar
2) this and that
3) something else
Your input (default 100 timeout 10) 2
User chose 'this and that'
this and that
</pre>

I think after some more fine-tuning it should be o.k.  
to be provided as a global function in ReaR.

Then I can step by step replace existing 'read' and  
'select' calls in ReaR by that new general function.

But that will happen after the ReaR 2.1 release.

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)  
I added new generic UserInput and UserOutput  
plus LogUserOutput functions that are intended  
to replace current user input functionality that  
calls select or read directly.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1408](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1408)
merged  
the UserInput function should be feature-complete  
now (at least from my current point of view).

Then for ReaR v 2.3 I could replace the existing 'read'  
and 'select' calls that get user input by the UserInput function.

This should make ReaR prepared for running unattended  
via predefined automated user input values as  
USER\_INPUT\_VALUES\[user\_input\_ID\] array members.

Of course this does not help when interactive tools  
are called in ReaR like special (external / third-party)  
backup and restore software that cannot run unattended.

Sufficiently done for ReaR 2.3.

Remaining things can be fixed for ReaR 2.4 or later  
as time permits and as users ask for it.
