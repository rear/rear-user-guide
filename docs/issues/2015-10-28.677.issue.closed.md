Hi,  
Similar to \#629, deb package build arch "all" (noarch package)
contradicts arch specific requirements.  
Package "syslinux" is only required for intel platform, not ppc
platform.  
("syslinux" is not available in ppc)

So, we can not create ppc deb package with current deb package build
configuration.

To fix this issue, I think there are several options:

option 1:  
change deb control file to build arch dependent packages as well as we
do against rpm.  
it might be painful to build several arch packages in each release.

      We are still looking for a Debian package maintainer who would write better

option 2:  
just move syslinux from "Depends" to "Recommends".  
we can keep noarch, but intel platform user will realize that syslinux
is required after issuing rear command.

I'm not so familiar with deb package build, but as far as I checked
there seems not to be other options.

Let's discuss how we should go.

Thanks @mmitsugi for bringing this up. I think that Option 1 (arch
specific debs) makes more sense:

-   Follow same strategy as with rpm -&gt; consistent mindset for rpm
    and deb
-   I don't like Recommends. ReaR should have a hard dependency on the
    things it actually needs.

@schlomo  
I wonder what exactly you mean with "things it \[rear\] actually
needs".  
In particular I wonder about the "actually" therein.

I think it can depend very much on the specific system  
where rear is running what is actually needed by it.  
Here I mean what other programs rear actually calls.

I do not know how to extract from bash scripts  
what executables can be called by them  
(in a sufficiently reasonable way).

If I knew this I could generate a list of the "callable executables".

Then we could decide which of them are considered to be  
mandatory in any case (i.e. RPM requirements) and which  
of them are probably only "sometimes called" so that  
for the latter RPM recommends might be sufficient.

Think about "usual systems" where chattr is not needed  
versus SLE12-SP1 with btrfs where chattr is required, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556\#issuecomment-139239652](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556#issuecomment-139239652)

Should I add e2fsprogs (provides chattr) as RPM requirement  
only because SLE12-SP1 with btrfs needs it  
(but e.g. SLE12-SP1 with ext4 does not need it)?

Have in mind that RPM requirements are hard requirements  
that cannot be ignored or skipped by the admin without  
causing that various package management tools  
will report that broken dependency all the time.

Hi I've created option 1 change in \#682  
Please merge it if there are any objections.
