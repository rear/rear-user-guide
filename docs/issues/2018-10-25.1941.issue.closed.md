#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git

-   OS version:

<!-- -->

    $ cat /etc/rear/os.conf 
    OS_VENDOR=Gentoo
    OS_VERSION=2.4.1

-   ReaR configuration files:

<!-- -->

    # grep -vP '^#|^$' /etc/rear/local.conf 
    OS_VENDOR=Gentoo
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/scratch/backup
    BACKUP_PROG=rsync
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" '/mnt/scratch' )
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/var/cache/*' '/tmp/*' '/var/tmp/*' '/root/.cache/*' '/backups/*' '/mnt/*' '/usr/portage/*' '/usr/src/*' '/var/log/*' '/home/ch/downloads/*' '/var/lib/docker/*')
    MODULES=( 'no_modules' )

-   Hardware: KVM VM

-   System architecture: x86\_64

-   Firmware: BIOS, GRUB2

-   Storage: local disk

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    ReaR fails on kernels with no modules support.
    `MODULES=( 'no_modules' )` fails to avoid problems in
    `FindStorageDrivers`

Should I submit this as a PR?

BTW: Thanks for this great project and all the effort you put it!

@hoffie  
thank you for the issue report and for your analysis and  
for your perfectly explained fix - I like explanatory comments  
so much, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I look forward to your pull request!

FYI:  
When I implemented support for `MODULES=( 'no_modules' )`  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)  
I could not test how ReaR actually behaves on module-less kernels  
because I do not use a module-less kernel on my systems.  
Therefore I appreciate it very much that now it was actually tested
that  
current ReaR does not yet behave as intended on module-less kernels.

@jsmeix Thanks for the quick reply. Submitted the PR.  
Glad you like the comments. However, I just borrowed them from
4a478b55cfd5081630c8c3ae762b4a83a9eb91c6 where some @jsmeix added them
initially. :)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1943](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1943)
merged  
this issue should be fixed (the places where FindStorageDrivers
results  
are used seem to work safe when FindStorageDrivers returns nothing).

@hoffie  
it is my sneaky plan that existing code with explanatory comments  
gets borrowed/copied/re-used so that more and more code emerges  
that is easy to understand ... ;-)

Thank you for your contribution to ReaR!
