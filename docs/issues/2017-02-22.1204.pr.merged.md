As seen on UEFI 64-bit Arch Linux distributions with efibootmgr package
installed.  
Upon "bootctl install" the .efi files are:  
Copied "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi" to
"/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi".  
Copied "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi" to
"/boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI".

When system is booting withing having a listing in the UEFI boot menu
(efivars) then the UEFI boot will most likely be booted using file
/boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI.

Uffff, I don't remember last time when Linux distro installation took me
more than 15 minutes, oh wait, I know "Linux From Scratch" :-). You
should warn me @ProBackup-nl!  
But on the other hand, it is nice to see how lazy I've become over time!

I have a question here. From what I've understood you have to prepare
everything by your self in Arch live environment. Isn't there some
magical command like
` pacstrap --i-have-no-idea-what-to-do=ofcourse just_do_some_default_partitioning_and_install_my_freaking_efi_system`
?

Do I get it right that having whole */boot* on vfat was your own
decision?

Hello @ProBackup-nl,  
Looks like this will require a bit more work to make ReaR running on
Arch...

From my first testing:

1.  OUTPUT=ISO does not work at all for me (did not check deeper for
    reason)
2.  OUTPUT=USB works somehow (when I manually set
    *USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1* which should be IMHO opaque variable)
3.  Patch you've provided did not work you my Arch distro because I had
    */boot/EFI/grub/grubx64.efi* instead of yours *BOOTX64.EFI*
4.  I did not check deeper for possible problems when */boot/EFI* is
    used directly and not as part of "standard" */boot/efi/EFI*

In general I'd say that current ReaR code does not work on Arch Linux.  
@gdha, @jsmeix, @schlomo, @didacog or anybody else that might get this
message, please let me know if there is someone running ReaR flawlessly
on Arch Linux.

I'll continue to work on this topic next days and see how much effort
would it require to make ReaR behave correctly on Arch.

I'll keep you posted.

V.

@gozora Because UEFI has got a boot menu implementation in itself, I
prefer not to chain another boot menu after that. In fact I prefer to
most quickly (directly) UEFI boot the Linux kernel (using EFISTUB, which
is enabled by default in Arch Linux).  
[Arch Linux also moved to
systemd](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1149530#p1149530),
so systemd gets installed by default, and that comes with
[systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot), which
can only start EFI executables. EFI booting is all I need. [systemd-boot
only boots from
VFAT](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Boot_loaders). It is
my decision to not install an additional boot loader. There is not much
choice in using /boot. Anything else is even more manual labour:

> Note: systemd-boot cannot load EFI binaries from other partitions. It
> is therefore recommended to mount your ESP to /boot. In case you want
> to separate /boot from the ESP see
> [\#Manually](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Manually)
> for more information.

Arch can use many different boot loaders, my interest is only in
**[systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot)**,
UEFI, 64-bit.

Hi @gozora,

I've used Archlinux, but the "problem" I see with that distro, from the
ReaR point of view, is that you can define boot partition, bootloader,
fstypes,... as you want and there is nothing strictly standard like on
other distros, with archlinux is always the user choice. Will be more
difficult make it work flawessly like on RHEL, Debian, SLES,... that
have, more or less, standard installation methods.

Thanks @didacog!  
That's what I actually thought! But as I'm Arch noob I wanted to be sure
that I did not overlooked something.

@didacog, I like the idea of clean system (Arch) as well, it can be
certainly useful in certain scenarios. Lets see if I can make ReaR like
it as well :-)

I think we should better open a separated  
ReaR GitHub enhancement issue regarding  
"ReaR support for Arch Linux".

In general regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-282240724](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-282240724)

<pre>
... with that distro, from the ReaR point of view, is
that you can define boot partition, bootloader, fstypes,...
as you want and there is nothing strictly standard like
on other distros ...
</pre>

For me there are way too much secretly working  
"magic automatisms" in ReaR that try to do "things right"  
but of course no automatism is infallible in parctice  
so that when such automatisms fail it results often  
really bad user experience because for the user it looks  
as if the "whole ReaR thing" behaves inexplicable.

Therefore I like to get ReaR step by step moved  
away from secretly working automatisms towards  
procedures that can be fully controlled by the user  
via appropriate variable settings if needed but that  
also use reasonable defaults or fallback values  
when those variables are not specified.

This way the current default behaviour of ReaR  
does not change but if needed the user can specify  
what ReaR should do in this or that particular case.

When there are no standards in Arch Linux  
then Arch Linux is only a good template case  
for any specific arbitrary Linux installation  
where the admin could have set up anything  
in his arbitrary special non-standard way.

Ideally - in the future - ReaR should be able  
to also work in such cases - of course not  
automatically right out of the box - but the user  
should be able to tell ReaR about each and any  
of his special non-standard things.

@gozora regarding your question in

I never used Arch Linux.

What looks wrong in this particular case is that  
in default.conf there is only USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
but the actual thing UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is set  
by a "secretly working automatism".

I would prefer there is also UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
documented and specified in default.conf  
so that the user knows how to set it right  
if needed in /etc/local.conf.

Perhaps - only an offhanded idea - the default setting of  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER in default.conf could be a list  
or an array of file names or even bash globbing expressions  
and the actual code searches in the ordering of that list  
for one single file and the first match is then used as  
actual UEFI\_BOOTLOADER value i.e. something like

<pre>
test "${UEFI_BOOTLOADER[*]:-}" || Error "Empty UEFI_BOOTLOADER"
local found_uefi_bootloader=""
for uefi_bootloader in "${UEFI_BOOTLOADER[@]}" ; do
    if test -f "$uefi_bootloader" ; then
        UEFI_BOOTLOADER=( "$uefi_bootloader" )
        found_uefi_bootloader="yes"
        LogPrint "Using UEFI bootloader '$uefi_bootloader'"
        break
    fi
done
test "$found_uefi_bootloader" || Error "No UEFI bootloader found"
</pre>

@ProBackup-nl  
do I understand your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-283033844](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-283033844)  
that it works for you without any modifications in the ReaR scripts  
only by specifying in /etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1
UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI

?

If yes, I think at least for now it should help to also  
document the UEFI\_BOOTLOADER variable  
in default.conf.

@gdha  
why should stderr be redicrectet to /dev/null ?  
I think stderr goes to the ReaR log file and  
I would want to see in particular any errors  
in the ReaR log file.

For me it behaves well on command line:

<pre>
# foo=$( find /boot -name "vmlinux*" | tail -1 ) ; echo "'$foo'"
'/boot/vmlinux-3.0.101-0.47.71-pae.gz'

@jsmeix redirect to /dev/null makes sense as the next if block checks if
the UEFI\_BOOTLOADER variable is empty and if so then it will bail out
with an error. It is a matter of taste. If you prefer to see an extra
error then you make merge the pull request. I have no real objections.

@gozora  
to merge a pull request hit that big green \[Merge pull request\]  
button and then you need (you really need) to provide  
a meaningful merge commit log message  
(the default message is usually mostly useless)  
that tells the essentials about 'what' and 'why' of it  
preferably without too bad typos ;-) because one cannot  
fix git commit log messages later with reasonable effort.

it makes a difference if the named file is not found

@jsmeix  
A clarification.

The location /boot/EFI/ has got very little to do with "Arch Linux", it
is the **UEFI spec ‘Fallback path’** mount point for most Linux
installation:

1.  /boot is the name that most Linux variants use to mount the ESP to
2.  /EFI/ or even more specific /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI (or
    \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI from UEFI's point of view) is the location
    where most (crippled) 64-bit UEFI firmware will only look to further
    progress boot.

> What it actually looks for is \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOT{machine type
> short-name}.EFI – ‘x64’ is the “machine type short-name” for x86-64
> PCs. The other possibilities are BOOTIA32.EFI (x86-32), BOOTIA64.EFI
> (Itanium), BOOTARM.EFI (AArch32 – that is, 32-bit ARM) and
> BOOTAA64.EFI (AArch64 – that is, 64-bit ARM).

> This mechanism is not designed for booting permanently-installed OSes.
> It’s more designed for booting hotpluggable, device-agnostic media,
> like live images and OS install media...

I'm a bit lazy lately doing partition layouts so I just tell installer
"do partitioning your self, I don't care" and here are couple of
examples how partitioning was decided by my 8.7 Debian and Centos 7.2

    root@debian:~# bdf | grep boot
    /dev/sda1                 118M   77M   35M  70% /boot
    /dev/sda2                 121M  766K  120M   1% /boot/efi

    centos:(/root)(root)# bdf | grep boot
    /dev/sda2                 194M   66M  119M  36% /boot
    /dev/sda1                  64M   10M   54M  16% /boot/efi

For SLES12 SP1 running SAP HANA it is quite similar

    /dev/mapper/vg_root-lv_root    100G   12G   89G  12% /
    /dev/sda1                      156M  4,9M  151M   4% /boot/efi

It have nothing to do with technical solution but I simply don't like
heaving /boot files (kernel, initrd, ...) on VFAT ...

Here I'd refer to [RFC 1925](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925)
section 2.3

    With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is
    not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they
    are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them
    as they fly overhead.

As time permits I will try to enhance  
rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh  
plus appropriate documentation in default.conf  
to make UEFI\_BOOTLOADER work in a more general way.

@ProBackup-nl  
I would appreciate it if you could test  
whether or not it still works for you  
with current ReaR GitHub master code  
where the follow-up  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212)  
is merged.
