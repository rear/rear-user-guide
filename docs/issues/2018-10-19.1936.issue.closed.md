I'm not sure I follow.  
Are you suggesting that the default TMPDIR doensn't have sufficient
space? Every drive on the system has more space available than there is
total data on the system. Please elaborate.

Some Ubuntu version use to setup */tmp* as tmpfs, so it is not part of
*/* ...  
You might check *df -h /tmp* output to see where is yours */tmp* mounted
...

Should you really have */tmp* setup on *tmpfs* you have two options.

1.  Disable such setup by masking tmp.mount service in systemd
2.  Create some /rear\_tmp directory and set `export TMPDIR="/rear_tmp"`
    into your `/etc/rear/local.conf`

/tmp is on /. I have 315G remaining on that drive. I have less than that
in data across all drives.

@ProfElectric  
your short information is not helpful for us  
because things work for us on our systems  
and we do not sit in front of your system so that  
we cannot imagine what goes wrong on your system  
in your particular case.

As a blind guess perhaps your issue might be somehow related  
to what I described at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1875\#issuecomment-406987662](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1875#issuecomment-406987662)

Simply put:  
It does not matter how much disk space you have in the filesystem  
where the `/tmp/` directory belongs to.  
What matters is how much disk space you have in the filesystem  
where `/tmp/rear-efi.XXXXX//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz` belongs to.

Regarding debugging what the root cause is in your case  
you need to run it in debugscript mode (see `man rear`)  
and inspect the log file, see also the section about  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@jsmeix

For what it's worth, the last attempt generated
"/tmp/rear-efi.nUXYO//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz ". /tmp/rear-efi.XXXXX is in
fact on the drive with / which should have ample space. The behavior is
puzzling. I hope you are able to glean something helpful from the log
when it's provided.

Thank you for your help and your work on this software.

It is the same kind of issue (not the same but the same kind) as I
described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1875\#issuecomment-406987662](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1875#issuecomment-406987662)

What matters is how much disk space there is in the filesystem  
where /tmp/rear-efi.nUXYO//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz belongs to  
and that filesystem is the one on /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-EFI  
because that gets mounted at /tmp/rear-efi.nUXYO  
(see the debug log excerpt 'Details' below).

With `OUTPUT=USB` the filesystem on /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-EFI  
was created by the `rear format` workflow, cf. the code in  
usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh

What the `rear format` workflow results can be specified by  
various `USB_...` config variables that are described in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

In this particular case `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE` should be the right  
config variable that needs to be adjusted to what is actually needed  
to make things work in this particular case.

Perhaps the current default of 200 MiB via `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="200"`  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1205](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1205)  
has again become too little to make things work on nowadays usual
systems?

This works as expected

@ProfElectric  
thanks for your feedback!  
It helps a lot to get an explicit confirmation when things work.
