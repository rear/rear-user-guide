[\#135 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/135) `merged`: Extend Relax-and-Recover to use duplicity and duply as backup methods
=================================================================================================================================

Duplicity is a backup tool that supports encrypted incremental backup to
local or remote storage. Duply as a shell frontend to duplicity
simplifies backup tasks.

This patchset adds two additional backup targets to ReaR to use
duplicity and duply while recovering a system.

Ok, looks simple and good!

One question:  
is it necessary to have two separate methods? As far as I could see the
code in DUPLICITY is a subset of DUPLY, the only difference being the
additional binary? Can't you merge them into one and copy duply only
when it's on the system.

Something like this:

    REQUIRED_PROGS=(
    "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"
    gpg
    duplicity
    python2.6
    )
    PROGS=(
    "${PROGS[@]}"
    duply
    )

That would mean you need at least duplicity and duply will be copied
when available.

Beside the binaries duply needs the files in the directories  
/etc/duply  
/root/.duply  
to be part of the recovery image. Is it possible to extend
COPY\_AS\_IS  
with paths which do not exist? If this is the case it's not necessaray  
to have two separate methods.

Yes, COPY\_AS\_IS does (or should) not complain when listed files are
missing. For example, I have no `/etc/termcap` and I can still make a
backup.

Ok, pull request is updated

Good.

Another question: what is build-stamp? You remove it in the makefile,
but I have never seen it...

The file is generated if you build a debian package with the make target
deb  
make deb

I use this target because I always install rear on a server as a
debian  
package.
