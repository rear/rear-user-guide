ReaR version: 2.6

ReaR version: Fedora Workstation 32 and other

ReaR configuration files:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NBKDC
    SET_STATIC_NETWORKING=y

Hardware:  
VMware guest and other

Description of the issue:

If NovaStor DataCenter 8.0.0 or higher is installed and `BACKUP=NBKDC`
is used, several issues are triggered:

1.  The installation directory of NovaStor DataCenter is not found, so
    `rear mkbackup` fails
2.  Important files are not copied to the live image, preventing network
    connection with NovaStor DataCenter backup server
3.  Some minor issues

Patches for these issues are already in the works, and are in NovaStor
internal review. A pull request will be published, once internal review
is finished.

@JohannesRoehlNovaStor  
thank you in advance for your contribution to ReaR  
to improve `BACKUP=NBKDC` support in ReaR.

Contributions for third-party backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have those third-party backup tools  
(in particular not when a third-party backup tool is proprietary
software)  
so in case of issues with third-party backup tools and ReaR  
we can usually do nothing but totally depend on contributions  
from those who use and know about the third-party backup tools.

Have a relaxing and recovering weekend!
