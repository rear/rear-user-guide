It seems our current backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
and restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
smell somewhat...

There are several issues in 500\_make\_backup.sh  
see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258\#issuecomment-546281119](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258#issuecomment-546281119)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258\#issuecomment-546335320](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258#issuecomment-546335320)

Furthermore the general code design in  
500\_make\_backup.sh and 400\_restore\_backup.sh  
seem to not match well.

For example on first glance it seems  
400\_restore\_backup.sh has more up-to-date log handling  
because of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1803](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1803)  
while  
500\_make\_backup.sh seems to have better pipe error reporting  
because of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1914](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1914)

So it seems 500\_make\_backup.sh and 400\_restore\_backup.sh  
need to be overhauled, cleaned-up, and enhanced.

An additional issue:  
Currently ISO\_MAX\_SIZE does not implement the maximum size of the
ISO.  
Instead it implements the size of the chunks when a backup.tar.gz is
split, cf.

This issue is only a minor bug so no real time pressure  
so it is something for "ReaR future" - as time permits.
