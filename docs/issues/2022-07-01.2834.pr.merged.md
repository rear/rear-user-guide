-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Created LVM on an empty disk (`mpatha`) and mounted it

<!-- -->

    parted --script -a optimal /dev/mapper/mpatha -- mklabel gpt mkpart extra ext2 1M -1M set 1 lvm on
    pvcreate --yes /dev/mapper/mpatha1
    vgcreate sigvg  /dev/mapper/mpatha1
    lvcreate -y -n  sig_lv  sigvg -L 1G
    mkfs.xfs /dev/sigvg/sig_lv
    mkdir /home/foo
    echo "/dev/sigvg/sig_lv                             /home/foo                   xfs     defaults        0 0" >> /etc/fstab
    mount /home/foo

ran `rear mkbackup`  
and then filled the disk with signatures

    EXTRADISK=/dev/mapper/mpatha1
    EXTRAFS=( $(lsblk -ln -o mountpoint $EXTRADISK) )
    for f in "${EXTRAFS[@]}"; do
        umount $f
    done
    EXTRADEVS=( $(lsblk -lnp -o name $EXTRADISK | tac) )
    for d in "${EXTRADEVS[@]}"; do
        EXTRATYPE=$(lsblk -ln -o type "$d")
        if [ lvm == "$EXTRATYPE" ]; then
            wipefs -a $d
            lvremove -y $d
        fi
    done
    lvcreate -y sigvg -n xfsloglv -l 100%FREE
    LOOPFILE=loopbackfile.img
    dd if=/dev/zero of=$LOOPFILE bs=100M count=10
    LOOPDEV=$(losetup -f)
    losetup -f $LOOPFILE
    MKFSOUT=$(mkfs.xfs -l logdev=/dev/sigvg/xfsloglv,size=2048b "$LOOPDEV")
    losetup -d $LOOPDEV
    BSIZE=$(echo $MKFSOUT | sed "s/.*\/dev\/sigvg\/xfsloglv bsize=\([^ ]*\)[ ]*.*/\1/")
    dd if=/dev/sigvg/xfsloglv of=/dev/sigvg/xfsloglv bs=$BSIZE seek=1
    lvremove -y /dev/sigvg/xfsloglv
    vgremove -y /dev/sigvg
    pvremove -y $EXTRADISK

and restored from the backup in migration mode

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Since PR \#2827 we have been piping the output of `yes` to
    `lvcreate`, but `yes` has not been added to the rescue system. Fix
    that.  
    (We could have added it to `REQUIRED_PROGS` only if lvm is present,
    but let's not complicate it and add it always.)

It is perfectly right to have 'yes' in any case in the recovery system  
because it should always be possible for the user to do things like

    yes | COMMAND

manually in the recovery system  
or manually edit commands in diskrestore.sh this way.

Cf. the section "It should be possible to run ReaR unattended" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
but I didn't do proper tests how far it is actually possible  
to run ReaR unattended with our current code.

I agree. The only question is whether it should be in `PROGS` or
`REQUIRED_PROGS` in case there is nothing to require it, but hopefully
systems without `yes` will be hard to encounter and thus the difference
would not matter in practice.

It is definitely possible. Virtually all my restore tests are run this
way.

REQUIRED\_PROGS is the exact right one according to  
"Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
(excerpt)

    In case of errors better abort than to blindly proceed.

I fear we have many programs in PROGS  
where we do not have appropriate checks in our code  
that error out when a program is actually needed but not there.
