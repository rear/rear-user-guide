-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): Relax-and-Recover 2.4 /
    2018-06-21

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Debian 9

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

        OUTPUT=ISO
        GRUB_RESCUE=y
        BACKUP=BORG
        …

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): Occurs on a Virtualbox VM and on an HP DL
    380 G7.

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): AMD64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): BIOS/GRUB

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): Local, virtualized, /dev/sda.

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

    -   Attach a serial console.
    -   Create a recovery boot medium as ISO.
    -   Boot from the ISO.
    -   Choose "Automatic recovery" from the GRUB menu.
    -   The VGA console shows the beginning of the automatic recovery.
        However the serial console stops the output right after the
        kernel messages.

Yes, this sounds a bit like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/878](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/878)
but either it's something different or a regression.

And this only happens when booting from the ISO image. It does not occur
when using the GRUB menu entry "Relax-and-Recover" that can be added by
*GRUB\_RESCUE=y*.

/etc/default/grub has these options set:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200"
    GRUB_TERMINAL="console serial"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"

Please let me know how I can further track that down.

-   Workaround, if any: None known. Only the VGA console can be used.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

Output on the serial console:

Hello @Signum,

When you are in boot menu of your ISO (ReaR recovery system), assuming
your are booting with isolinux (syslinux) press **F2** for edit boot
entry you wish to boot and try to manually add
`console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200` maybe it will help ...

@Signum  
I do not use serial console myself but I guess you need to play around
with  
the USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE and KERNEL\_CMDLINE config variables  
to get it work in your particular case.

Every now and then we get issue reports related to the serial console  
in the recovery system (which usually "just works") but as far as I
noticed  
things could get really weird if the serial console does not "just
work".  
I think often the root cause is not actually inside the ReaR recovery
system  
but the hardware or virtual machine setup that is related to serial
console.

For details what really happens you need to inspect the scripts  
that deal with the USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE config variable:  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/400\_use\_serial\_console.sh  
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/200\_include\_serial\_console.sh  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh

Run `rear -s mkrescue` to see which of those scripts are run  
in your particular case.

It seems to be "Tab" rather than "F2". But, no, that doesn't work. The
default grub commandline is:

@gozora  
Thanks for the suggestions. But COM1/ttyS0 is the correct port. After
all I get the GRUB menu and all kernel boot messages. Just on automatic
recovery I don't see any output from the REAR scripts that is sent to
tty0 only.

@Signum  
do you mean that with non-automatic recovery (i.e. when you  
select `Recover reartest` instead of `Automatic Recover reartest`)  
then you see the output from the ReaR scripts on your serial console?

@jsmeix  
Yes, exactly. As long as I login as *root* through the manual recovery
all is fine. So I guess the grub/kernel start line makes login shells
work. But the automatic recovery doesn't require a login and seems to
start in a different way (that I have not understood yet).

Please take a look what appears on my serial console in case of *manual*
recovery:

@Signum  
I have absolutely no idea what the root cause could be here.

The recovery system startup script that implements  
automatic (and unattended) recovery mode is  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
e.g. the current one online at  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup)

Note my comment therein before the `sleep 1`  
i.e. I already had inexplicable issues with missing output.

Likely a useless attempt:  
Add the kernel command line option `debug` as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1999\#issuecomment-444985949](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1999#issuecomment-444985949)  
which let's the recovery system startup scripts run with 'set -x'  
but I assume you won't get any output on your serial console  
because you get none after the last kernel message.

The difference between non-automatic recovery (the default case) and  
automatic recovery is that in case of automatic (and unattended)
recovery  
the script usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
is not finished - i.e. automatic (and unattended) recovery are run  
as "rear recover" calls within that script's environment and  
I guess that within this environment there is no output on your  
serial console - but I have no idea why.

Your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1999\#issuecomment-445249831](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1999#issuecomment-445249831)  
indicates that there is no output on your serial console while  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup runs  
(it runs as /etc/scripts/system-setup in the recovery system)  
because there are none of the messages from that script like

<pre>
Configuring Relax-and-Recover rescue system
</pre>

(see the `echo` commands in that script).

Only a blind guess:  
Perhaps something is missing to get serial console output  
in the systemd unit files in the recovery system  
that run /etc/scripts/system-setup like  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/run-system-setup.service  
or whatever script it actually is that executes
/etc/scripts/system-setup  
in a particular recovery system?

@jsmeix  
I will look into that later today. But it appears that the systemd
service is just sending output to the console (tty1) by default. systemd
services can be told to use other devices, but not both tty1 and ttyS0
at the same time. Maybe if I understand how the kernel bot option
"console=ttyS0" leads to also getting a getty on ttyS0 then I can copy
that.

@Signum  
are no news good news?

If you somehow solved it (or found a usable workaround)  
we would appreciate feedback how you did it in your case  
because that helps us to deal with similar issues in the future.

If you found a solution please provide it to us as GitHub pull request  
even if your solution is perhaps not yet the "last word in wisdom"  
we would appreciate to learn about any intermediate step forward.

@jsmeix Sorry for the delay. I had to shift my focus because we were
facing massive troubles at work on a different topic. I hope I can come
up with a proposal beginning of next week.  
I was thinking about the difference of login shells (that are started on
ttyS0 correctly) and the systemd-induced automatic recovery job… Would
it be an option to always make the user login first and then run either
"rear recover" as before or "rear autorecover" for a fully automated
experience?

@Signum  
I don't know how to automatically login as 'root' during startup  
of the recovery system and how to let the auto-logged-in 'root'  
automatically type `rear recover` and afterwards `reboot`  
(depending whether or not if 'rear recover' was successful)  
to keep the same automated experience as we have now.

I fear any scripted call of `rear recover` and afterwards `reboot`  
might behave different compared to a real interactive shell  
but I am not at all an expert in this area - in particular not  
when systemd is involved...
