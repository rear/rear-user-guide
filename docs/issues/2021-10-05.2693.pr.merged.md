-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh overhauled the  
automapping of original 'disk' devices and 'multipath' devices  
to current block devices in the currently running recovery system  
so that now it automatically finds an existing unique disk size
mapping.  
For details see the comments in the code that should (hopefully)
explain  
what goes on.

@jsmeix please also make a test with disk sizes completely different -
not the same as the originals. What will happen then?

Regarding `Using ... (the only appropriate) for recreating ...`  
see the comment in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
that explains why that automatism should be OK

    # Automatically map when only one appropriate current block device
     is found where to it could be mapped.
    # At the end the mapping file is shown and the user can edit it
     if he does not like an automated mapping:

@gdha  
see my above tests - all looks well to me.  
Please check whether or not it also looks OK to you.  
Do you like to see some more other tests?

@jsmeix I will have a look at the change, but it will take me a bit of
time because I am not familiar with this particular code (yet).

thank you for having a look!

@pcahyna  
do you soon have time to have a look?

@gdha  
are my tests sufficient for you?

I ask because I would like to merge it if there are no objections.

The changes improve things for me and also for a SUSE customer  
so the changes should be at least an improvement for MIGRATION\_MODE.

Of course this does not mean current MIGRATION\_MODE "just works", cf.

sure, looking at it now.

@gdha @pcahyna  
thank you for your reviews.

I will merge it tomorrow afternoon  
provided no objections appear until then.

Test with two disks according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2690\#issuecomment-942548003](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2690#issuecomment-942548003)

    original system  replacement system
    sda 7 GiB        sda 2 GiB
    sdb 2 GiB        sdb 7 GiB

This works with master code (i.e. without the changes in this pull
request)

    # rear -D recover
    ...
    Comparing disks
    Device sda has size 2147483648 bytes but 7516192768 bytes is expected (needs manual configuration)
    Device sdb has size 7516192768 bytes but 2147483648 bytes is expected (needs manual configuration)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration
    Using /dev/sdb (same size) for recreating /dev/sda
    Original disk /dev/sdb does not exist (with same size) in the target system
    Using /dev/sda (the only appropriate) for recreating /dev/sdb
    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/sda => /dev/sdb
      /dev/sdb => /dev/sda

    UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 275
    Confirm or edit the disk mapping
    1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    2) n/a
    3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    5) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)

This also explains why the current code in 300\_map\_disks.sh is as
is.  
Very likely I had only tested it with two disks.

How that works with the changes in this pull request:
