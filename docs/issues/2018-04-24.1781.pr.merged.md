Also include other keyboard mappings to also support users with a non-US
keyboard  
because without the right keyboard mapping it could become an awful
annoyance  
to work in the recovery system.

-   Type: **Bug Fix** and **Enhancement**  
    Actually this provides a workaround when in  
    etc/scripts/system-setup.d/10-console-setup.sh  
    the `loadkeys /etc/dumpkeys.out` fails.

-   Impact: **Low** and **High**  
    For US-keyboard users the impact is at most low,  
    for non-US-keyboard users the impact could be even critical.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    It works for me on a SUSE system.  
    I don't know where on other systems the other keyboard mapping files
    are stored.  
    But it is now at least a starting point that can be easily enhanced
    for other systems.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

By default the current keyboard mapping is dumped to etc/dumpkeys.out  
so that it can be set during recovery system startup by  
etc/scripts/system-setup.d/10-console-setup.sh  
via `loadkeys /etc/dumpkeys.out`.

But depending on the keyboard mapping  
the `loadkeys /etc/dumpkeys.out` command  
may not work in the recovery system  
so that some other keyboard mapping files  
are also included so that the user can manually set  
his keyboard mapping (e.g. via a command like `loadkeys de-latin1`).

This increases the recovery system size by about 1 MB  
(an usual recovery system size is about 500 MB uncompressed)  
but without the right keyboard mapping it could be an awful annoyance  
to work in the recovery system.

@gdha @gozora @schabrolles  
because my knowledge about keyboard setup is basically zero  
(I did this pull request based on a lot of trial and error)  
I would very much appreciate it if you could have a look.  
Perhaps I did something stupid and the real solution is "just simple".

In my case the keyboad mapping on the original system  
fails to load in the recovery system via `loadkeys /etc/dumpkeys.out`  
with this error message:

<pre>
adding map 3 violates explicit keymaps line
</pre>

and I get a keyboard with a default (presumably US) layout  
but actually I use a German qwertz keyboard.

On the original system I have a `/etc/vconsole.conf` file that contains

<pre>
KEYMAP=de-latin1-nodeadkeys
FONT=eurlatgr.psfu
FONT_MAP=none
FONT_UNIMAP=
</pre>

The unexpected thing is that in the recovery system  
I can run `loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys`  
which "just works" so that one could assume  
the dumped keyboad mapping on the original system  
is not de-latin1-nodeadkeys but something different  
but on the original system

<pre>
# dumpkeys -f >/tmp/dumpkeys.out

# loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys

# dumpkeys -f >/tmp/dumpkeys.de-latin1-nodeadkeys

# diff -s /tmp/dumpkeys.out /tmp/dumpkeys.de-latin1-nodeadkeys
Files /tmp/dumpkeys.out and /tmp/dumpkeys.de-latin1-nodeadkeys are identical

# loadkeys /tmp/dumpkeys.out

# loadkeys /tmp/dumpkeys.de-latin1-nodeadkeys 
</pre>

so something subtle makes in the recovery system  
`loadkeys /etc/dumpkeys.out` fail...

@jsmeix Perhaps it would be better we load all the keyboard keys like
the plain Linux OS? Is lot of overhead but this way we have all
keyboards. Just a though...

It is the `-f1` in `dumpkeys -f1 >$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/dumpkeys.out`  
in rescue/GNU/Linux/500\_clone\_keyboard\_mappings.sh  
that makes things fail:

<pre>
# dumpkeys -f1 >/tmp/dumpkeys.out2

# loadkeys /tmp/dumpkeys.out2
adding map 3 violates explicit keymaps line
</pre>

On none of my systems down to SLE10 a `-f1`  
is mentioned in `man dumpkeys`.  
It is always only plain `-f` and that works for me.

`git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/500_clone_keyboard_mappings.sh`  
shows that the non-working `-f1` was there since the beginning of git
history  
so that I have no idea if there was a reason or if it is just a typo.

@gdha  
including the whole keymaps default directory /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/  
increases the recovery system size by about 3 MB in my case

<pre>
# du -hs /usr/share/kbd/keymaps
2.8M    /usr/share/kbd/keymaps
</pre>

and I know that on POWER architecture the recovery system must be kept
very small  
(bigger recovery systems on POWER architecture can cause totally weird
failures).

But I agree that it can be crucial that the recovery system supports any
keyboad  
in particular for system migration when the keyboard of the new
hardware  
may not be known in advance when "rear mkrescue" is run.

So - as always - the right way out is to introduce config variables  
where the user can specify what he actually needs.  
I will implement that...

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781\#issuecomment-384230363](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781#issuecomment-384230363)

Interestingly on SLE10 things work with `dumpkeys -f1`

<pre>
# dumpkeys -f1 >/tmp/dumpkeys.out

# loadkeys /tmp/dumpkeys.out && echo OK
Loading /tmp/dumpkeys.out
OK
</pre>

but also with plain `dumpkeys -f`

<pre>
# dumpkeys -f >/tmp/dumpkeys.out

# loadkeys /tmp/dumpkeys.out && echo OK
Loading /tmp/dumpkeys.out
OK
</pre>

and there is no `-f1` described in `man dumpkeys` or via `dumpkeys -h`
on SLE10:

<pre>
# man dumpkeys
...
SYNOPSIS
       dumpkeys [ -hilfn -ccharset --help --short-info --long-info --numeric --full-table --funcs-only --keys-only --compose-only --charset=charset ]
...
       -f --full-table
              This makes dumpkeys skip all the short-hand heuristics (see keymaps(5)) and output the key bindings in the canonical form. First a keymaps  line  describing
              the  currently defined modifier combinations is printed. Then for each key a row with a column for each modifier combination is printed. For example, if the
              current keymap in use uses seven modifiers, every row will have seven action code columns. This format can be useful for example to programs that  post-pro‚Äê
              cess the output of dumpkeys.

# dumpkeys -h
dumpkeys version 1.12
...
       -f --full-table     don't use short-hand notations, one row per keycode
</pre>

so that I will use plain `dumpkeys -f` in
/rescue/GNU/Linux/500\_clone\_keyboard\_mappings.sh

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781/commits/e626787fa5e5a5293fdb2e9254953c5ddfb0f15f](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781/commits/e626787fa5e5a5293fdb2e9254953c5ddfb0f15f)  
including and setting keyboard mappings in the recovery system  
works well for me (and sufficiently fail-safe) for the first time.

Now there are the new (but intentionally not yet documented) config
variables

KEYMAPS\_DEFAULT\_DIRECTORY which specifies the default directory for
keymaps

KEYMAPS\_DIRECTORIES which is a string of keymap directories that
should  
get included in the recovery system

KEYMAP which is a keymap file for `loadkeys` in the recovery system

e.g. what I used in local.conf

<pre>
KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=""
KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES="/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy"
KEYMAP="de-latin1-nodeadkeys"
</pre>

@gdha @schabrolles  
if you do not object against the new KEYMAP\* config variables  
I would document them tomorrow in default.conf  
and then I would like to merge this pull request.

I think with the new KEYMAP\* config variables there cannot be  
a severe regression because if somehow the default behaviour  
does no longer work the user can now manually specify what  
is needed to make it work in his particular environment.

@gdha @schabrolles @gozora  
could you do me a favour and report here  
what the default directory for keymaps is  
on whatever non-SUSE systems you have.

On my SUSE systems I have in `man loadkeys`

<pre>
FILES
       /usr/share/kbd/keymaps
              default directory for keymaps
</pre>

which is actually true because I get things like

<pre>
# rpm -qa | grep -i kbd
kbd-...
kbd-legacy-...

# rpm -ql kbd kbd-legacy | grep de-latin1
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1.map.gz

FYI related to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781\#issuecomment-384334494](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1781#issuecomment-384334494)

I found out how one can determine what keymap files plus include files  
one particular keyboad mapping needs so that it can be loaded.

In my case for `loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys` it is "just as simple as"
;-)

<pre>
# for f in $( strace -f -e open loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys 2>&1 | grep '/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/' | grep -v 'O_DIRECTORY' | grep -o 'open.*,' | cut -d '"' -f2 ) ; do readlink -e $f ; done

/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1.map.gz
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/qwertz-layout.inc
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/compose.inc
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/linux-with-alt-and-altgr.inc
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/linux-keys-bare.inc
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/euro2.map.gz
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/include/compose.latin1
</pre>

Simplifying that command is left as an exercise to the reader ;-)

Accordingly with

<pre>
KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY="/usr/share/kbd/keymaps"
KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES="/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/qwertz/de-latin1.map.gz /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/qwertz-layout.inc /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/compose.inc /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/linux-with-alt-and-altgr.inc /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/linux-keys-bare.inc /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/i386/include/euro2.map.gz /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/legacy/include/compose.latin1"
KEYMAP="de-latin1-nodeadkeys"
</pre>

(one can as well specify plain files as KEYMAPS\_DIRECTORIES values)  
I get a minimal recovery system that contains only what is needed
