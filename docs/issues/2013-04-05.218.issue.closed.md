On Fedora18 in combination with UEFI booting the location of grub.cfg is
not /boot/grub\[2\], but /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg  
However, on Ubuntu 12.10 (with UEFI) the location is
/boot/grub.grub.cfg, and on OpenSuse 12.3 it is /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Knowing this, finalize/Linux-i386/22\_install\_grub2.sh will work (saw
it in the logs) as on Fedora18 /boot/grub2/ directory does exist, but
only contains the themes directory, but not the grub.cfg. Very confusing
for everybody...as grub2 drops into the grub prompt...

However, the good news might be in
[http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation\_Guide/ch19s02.html](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/ch19s02.html)  
efibootmgr -c -w -L Fedora -d /dev/sdX -p Y -l \\EFI\\redhat\\grub.efi  
I was hoping grub2-efi was clever enough...

finalize/Linux-i386/23\_run\_efibootmgr.sh was introduced to fix this -
needs some more testing before I can close this issue
