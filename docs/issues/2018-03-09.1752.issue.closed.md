-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.0 and higher
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 7.4
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): n/a
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue: `rear -D -d savelayout`  
    It tells us `Using guessed bootloader 'EFI'`, but AWS EC2 is using
    **GRUB** as bootloader. The funny thing is the following:

<!-- -->

    #-> cat /tmp/rear.V9AKAEZDKjqVbWE/tmp/bootloader_area_strings
    ZRr=
    `|f
    \|f1
    GRUB
    Geom
    Hard Disk
    Read
     Error
    EFI PART
    Hah!IdontNeedEFI"s8<

The AWS engineer who wrote this thinks this is funny...lol (notice
*IdontNeedEFI*)

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Is not such a big deal as we cannot use `rear` to recover an AWS EC2
    anyhow -&gt; no console available. But, if it is possible I would
    like to hear a success story!

Actually, "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" is the text representation of the official
GUID number for a GPT BIOS boot partition:

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779)  
I enhanced
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1754](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1754)  
so that now it also detects other non-EFI bootloaders  
(in particular also `GRUB2`).

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1780)
merged  
this issue should be (hopefully) fully fixed.
