-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): n/a

In pre-2017 version of the ReaR code there was no dependency for `bc`.

Some older Linux distributions apparently suffer a calculation bug which
appears in the ReaR partition resizing code. Other Linux distributions
correctly calculate partition sizes without helper utilities.

### Make ReaR more Relax

Change the hard dependency for `bc` only to a hard dependency for the
Linux distributions where needed.

Suggestion:

1.  make the sample sometimes failing calculation
2.  calculation failed? Only then include bc as required dependency

In general I agree that REQUIRED\_PROGS should be only  
what is mandatory to have in the recovery system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1570\#issuecomment-347790094](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1570#issuecomment-347790094)

Regarding 'bc':  
We have 'bc' currently unconditioned in REQUIRED\_PROGS  
because the current implementation of the mathlib\_calculate()  
function in lib/global-functions.sh and how that function is called  
by other scripts only works with 'bc' because it depends  
on the 'bc' syntax.  
Accordingly a precondition to have 'bc' no longer mandatory  
is a way that can be implemented and maintained with  
reasonable effort how to do such calculations independent  
of the actual calculation program.

@ProBackup-nl I would not mind to get rid of `bc`, OTOH there are too
many other issues open that should get fixed in a timely fashion.
Therefore, may I suggest if you have time and a strong desire to prepare
a PR for a better **bc-free** rear?

Only a side note FYI:  
Because etc/rear/local.conf is sourced by usr/sbin/rear after  
the functions in usr/share/rear/lib/\[a-z\]\*.sh had beed sourced  
one can re-define the mathlib\_calculate() function  
by any other implementation in etc/rear/local.conf  
and then check how that works with huge disks  
in particular in migration mode.

As no feedback or additional comments were added I may assume that this
issue has no future anymore? We better close it 'till further notice or
new inspired input has been given
