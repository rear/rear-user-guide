It makes no sense that `rear help` displays the recover workflow on a
real system, nor does it make sense to have `rear help` show most other
workflows in rescue mode.

So we should teach Rear in what context (mode) it is running and adopt
the possible workflows. And adopt the manual page to reflect the two
modes Rear runs in (Native mode / Rescue mode ?).
