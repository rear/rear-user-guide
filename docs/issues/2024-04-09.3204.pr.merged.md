-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **None**

No default should change.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

No GitHub issue.

A colleague asked me how to get backup.tar.gz  
and the ISO and all other RESULT\_FILES  
in the same directory that is not $HOSTNAME.

I had to somewhat reverse engineer things to find out how  
because this is basically not described in default.conf.

-   How was this pull request tested?

I did not yet test that this pull request  
does not change anything.

I had only tested that with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_PREFIX="my_prefix"
    NETFS_PREFIX="$OUTPUT_PREFIX"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///other/

backup.tar.gz and the ISO and all other RESULT\_FILES  
get stored in the same "my\_prefix" directory.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In default.conf better descriptions  
for OUTPUT\_PREFIX and NETFS\_PREFIX  
(OUTPUT\_PREFIX was not at all described)  
plus explanation how OUTPUT\_PREFIX and NETFS\_PREFIX  
belong to each other for the usual case  
OUTPUT=ISO and BACKUP=NETFS  
and made it explicit that by default

    NETFS_PREFIX="$OUTPUT_PREFIX"

to get backup.tar.gz and ISO image stored at the same place.

@rear/contributors  
my changes here are only comments in default.conf  
so they cannot change what ReaR does when it runs  
but wrong or misleading comments in default.conf  
could make things go wrong for our users  
when they do not get correct information from us  
so I would appreciate at least a quick review  
and an explicit approval from one of you.

@gdha  
thank you for having a look here!

I also think "all bits help", cf.

    I think better try to improve things than do nothing.
