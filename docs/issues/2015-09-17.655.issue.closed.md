Hi together,

on a RHEL 7.1 system with TSM-Backup and a team-interface as default
interface I tried to do a recovery with no success. The team-interfaces
will not be online while recovery process starts. As I can see, the
kernel modules for teaming are available and as I know you support
bonding. Do you also support teaming or is there a special option I have
to activate for teaming support? It's a regular activebackup
configuration. The only unusual part we configured is the name of device
team0 (name is net0 and not team0).

@rg-fine can you please take a look at \#530 if this helps you? It
removes the dependency on the naming scheme of network devices. Maybe
you can extend this code to also cover your use case?

@rg-fine Be aware the pull request is not yet in rear - testing is more
then desired...

@schlomo and @gdha: Many thanks for the hint with this pull-request.
Unfortunatelly this will not solve the teaming issue as there is no
setup function for teaming (like `bond_setup()`). Teaming interfaces are
also declared as virtual devices and because of this you need a function
which handle this fact.

    # ls /sys/devices/virtual/net
    lo  team0  team1

Maybe I can spend some time in writing a function which is compatible to
this pull request. But this will need some time, because I'm on customer
side and other topics are more important at the moment. So if you have a
quicker solution this would be very appreciated.

BTW: I tested this pull request also with "normal" interfaces, and for
this case it works perfect...

Cheers, Ralf

@schlomo and @gdha: I've written a workaround which worked for me.
Because teaming runs in user space it is not possible to take this
interfaces online without the daemons and tools. So my solution adds the
teaming ip-addresses to the first attached teaming-member to simplify
it.

I used `/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31_network_devices.sh` from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/530](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/530)
1:1 without any changes.

I changed `/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/35_routing.sh`. So it will
not write down routing for teaming devices.

**Why?**: I handle everything for teaming in a different script and I
will prevent adding the default route to teaming devices because in my
solution we don't need the teaming-interface itself but its first
member.

The changes in `35_routing.sh`:  
Lines 86 and 96: from `else` to the following:

    # be sure that it is not a teaming-interface
    elif ! ethtool -i $device | grep -w "driver:" | grep -qw team ; then

Then I created `/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/36_teaming.sh` which
handels everything for the teaming devices:

    # 36_teaming.sh

            done
        done
    done

Maybe there is a better way to do it in the rear structure, but I hope
this will help you to implement the teaming support into it.

BTW: I've testet this solution including the pull request
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/530](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/530)
with the following environments:

-   RHEL 7.1 Latest, physical server, single interfaces, TSM ✅
-   RHEL 7.1 Latest, physical server, bonding interfaces, TSM ✅
-   RHEL 7.1 Latest, physical server, teaming interfaces, TSM ✅
-   RHEL 7.1 Latest, VM, single interfaces, TSM ✅

I could do a successfull recovery in all this scenarios.

I will try to spent some time also for RHEL 5 and RHEL 6 tests (with
TSM) next week.

Hope this helps a little bit.

Cheers, Ralf 🍺

@rg-fine Would it help if we accept the pull request of the BONDING/VLAN
re-design so you could apply your addition into your trunk?

@gdha: From my point of view it would help for sure, but I can only
share my testings with RHEL 7 at the moment. So I don't know if the new
Bonding and VLAN script will work correctly on other derivates...

Would you like me to do a pull request afterwards for the teaming
enhancement or are you planning without teaming support at the moment? I
think teaming will become more popular and important in the future and
because of this it would be great to support this kind of network
aggregation.

@rg-fine yes - we have to move on and fix what needs to be fixed. And,
yes afterwards you can create your pull request on top of it. Thanks

@gdha Pull request was done with

Do you need any further information or are there some problems with the

on our environment.

own words... Thanks for the clarification.
