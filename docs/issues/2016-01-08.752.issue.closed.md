Hi.

I try to use BACKUP\_URL=cifs:// but it fails because noatime option
does not exist for cifs protocol.  
Tested with CentOS 7.2 (up to date).

    ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -o rw,noatime,guest //xxx/xxx/tmp /tmp/rear.Q89mvOdrDdmhh0F/outputfs' failed.
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-localhost.log for details

In /var/log/message :

    Jan  8 12:10:12 localhost kernel: CIFS: Unknown mount option "noatime"
    Jan  8 12:10:12 localhost rear[20257]: ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -o rw,noatime,guest //xxx/xxx/tmp /tmp/rear.Q89mvOdrDdmhh0F/outputfs' failed.

`noatime` is set in file :  
lib/global-functions.sh:108: local defaultoptions="rw,noatime"

noatime should not be used with CIFS protocol.

You should define (see man page of rear):

           BACKUP_URL=cifs://
               To backup to a Samba share (CIFS), use BACKUP_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path. To provide
               credentials for CIFS mounting use a /etc/rear/.cifs credentials file and define
               BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs" and pass along:

                   username=_username_
                   password=_secret password_
                   domain=_domain_

You got that error, because of the *guest* if-section in
`lib/global-functions.sh`. If you would leave the noatime away you would
have an issue with permissions.

If I manually mount my (anonymous) CIFS mountpoint with  
`mount -v -o rw,guest //xxx/xxx/tmp /mnt` (without noatime)  
it works.

If I try to mount it with noatime (rear defaults), it fails because it
is not supported by CIFS :  
`localhost kernel: CIFS: Unknown mount option "noatime"`

@DamienGombaultRecia And you want to mount as guest on purpose?

Yes, I mount it as guest on purpose.  
I will test with a login/password protected CIFS mount point.  
I think the guest option does not matter, it just tell the CIFS utils
that there is no password.  
But I think to noatime option will cause the same problem.

@DamienGombaultRecia If you use `BACKUP_OPTIONS` then you won't be using
`noatime` option unless you add it in there.  
However, I agree with you about `noatime` option: it doesn't seem to be
a valid option for cifs (anymore?).

I have set BACKUP\_OPTIONS="guest" and it works, thank you (I thought
BACKUP\_OPTIONS was appended to defaultoptions (not replaced)).  
However I think the noatime should not be used as a default at least for
CIFS.

@DamienGombaultRecia You said "However I think the noatime should be be
used as a default at least for CIFS" - is this correct? I thought
**not** would be better?

I fixed my comment.
