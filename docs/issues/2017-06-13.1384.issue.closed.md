#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): SUSE Linux
    x64 11 SP3
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): default
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS, VMware
-   Brief description of the issue: rear recovery iso has different
    order of scsi hosts initialization what creates problem to recover.
    When booting from REAR iso lsscsi gives different ids for scsi
    controllers. Hosts has 4 various controllers LSI and Paravirtual
-   Work-around, if any: No workaround found

Please provide both from the working source and the troubled rescue
system

-   `dmesg` which shows all the SCSI relevant parts, both about drivers
    and devices
-   `lspci`
-   `lsscsi -kds`
-   `lsmod`

Thanks a lot for the answer.

Original Situation VMWare SUSE 11 Enterprise SP3 with shared drives
running Oracle Database with ASM:  
rn2inssv268:~ \# lsscsi -H  
\[0\] mptspi  
\[1\] ata\_piix  
\[2\] ata\_piix  
\[3\] vmw\_pvscsi  
\[4\] vmw\_pvscsi  
\[5\] vmw\_pvscsi  
rn2inssv268:~ \#

SCSI adapters order is correct like in a vmx file

RESCUE statsus (rear 1.17, 1.19, 1.21 was tested):  
\[0\] vmw\_pvscsi  
\[1\] vmw\_pvscsi  
\[2\] vmw\_pvscsi  
\[3\] mptspi  
\[4\] ata\_piix  
\[5\] ata\_piix

Order is different. All other required information is attached.

Thanks a lot in advance,

Dan Zegelman

The source system loads all the storage modules in the initrd and has in
`/etc/sysconfig/kernel` the following entry (actually with more modules,
but those count for this issue):

    INITRD_MODULES="mptspi vmw_pvscsi"

The ReaR rescue system however loads the modules via udev and does not
know about this order. I think that we should pick up this information
automatically via something like this:

    MODULES_LOAD=( "${MODULES_LOAD[@]}"
      $(
        INITRD_MODULES=
        source /etc/sysconfig/kernel
        echo $INITRD_MODULES
      )
    )

@jsmeix do you know for which SUSE/SLES versions this would work?

Note: May be also related to \#1327

Yes, we had behavior mentioned in \#1327, it was relevant only for disks
remapping and we overcome it by pressing "y" through recovery flow :)
and later hacked scripts to avoid it. Can we implement any workaround
for now? Thanks, Dan

After reading the change in \#1327 I realized that there we only added
`--force` to the `wipefs` call and not to the `mkfs.ext?` calls. I'll
have a look into fixing this.

I think the whole module loading in the recovery system  
currently works too much automated that leads to  
unwanted results. For details see
