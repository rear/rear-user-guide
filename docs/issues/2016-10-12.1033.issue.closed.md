This issue is related to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1008](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1008)  
but now it is about the right spelling for the abbreviation:

In current master code I find:

<pre>
rear (451 times)
Rear (9 times)
ReaR (13 times)
REAR (27 times)
</pre>

What is the officially right spelling?

My personal preference would be  
either plain simple "rear"  
or (because "rear" is a normal English word and  
not a proper name) alternatively "Rear" to make it  
a proper name.

Because I am lazy I would prefer "rear" over "Rear"  
so that I do not need to fix it at hundreds of places.

If Relax-and-Recover is the official name then I would think ReaR to be
the official abbreviation. IMHO followed by REAR. Under no circumstances
should we write plain rear because that might lead to unpleasant
surprises with English.

Another argument: Our official logo has ReaR

Only my personal opinion:

I think nowadays camel case as in "ReaR" is considered  
to be outdated or even to be old-fogyish or ugly.

If I remember correctly some text writers and journalists  
refuse camel case spelling and use their own "right" way  
according to their own opinion of what "right" is.

Furthermore I myself find it hard to always type "ReaR"  
or even "REAR" ( the latter looks like shouting  
but is in perfect compliance with SUSE ;-)

Regardless what the reasons are I think the  
end-result is various kind of wrong spellings.

Therefore I would prefer a simple spelling that is  
automatically done right by usual people.

The usual English names spelling would be "Rear",  
cf. 'GNU Tar'  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)

I think many Unix tools also use normal English  
lowercase words as their name, cf 'tar'  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar\_%28computing%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29)

The official logo does not have "ReaR" but "REAR".  
The font is all uppercase glyphs.  
The two middle glyphs 'E' and 'A' are only smaller  
but they are no lowercase glyphs 'e' and 'a'.  
I know about "small caps" fonts, cf  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small\_caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps)  
but even if the font in the official logo  
is actually a small caps font, I assume  
nobody would recognize this - i.e. I assume  
everybody would read it as "REAR".

My personal summary:

Currently I think  
I would like "rear" most (plain and simple)  
then "Rear" (normal English name spelling)  
and last "REAR" (currently accepted spelling for  
abbreviation of longer names)  
but I do not like the camel case spelling.

For the fun of it:  
Initially it was "S.u.S.E"  
which got changed to "SuSE"  
which got changed to "SUSE"  
but often it is spelled "Suse" by non-SUSE people,  
let's see if at the very end "Suse" becomes official ;-)

I like **ReaR**, because if you are using it in text, it evokes it is
something else then "back part of something..."

Didn't know it is called "camel case" üëç

Ah!  
Good point - "ReaR" looks less than "rear", "Rear", or "REAR"  
like the English word for "back part of something... ".  
Also for me the abbreviation of "Relax-and-Recover"  
is a bit unfortunate English word ;-)

My current understanding is that  
meanwhile "ReaR" has most agreement  
(I changed my opinion since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1033\#issuecomment-255071562](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1033#issuecomment-255071562)).

In  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
I changed 'rear' to 'ReaR' and I explained both spellings in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Disaster\_recovery\_with\_Relax-and-Recover\_.28ReaR.29](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Disaster_recovery_with_Relax-and-Recover_.28ReaR.29)  
as follows:

<pre>
Relax-and-Recover is abbreviated ReaR
(often misspelled 'Rear' or 'rear').
Regarding Relax-and-Recover the word 'rear' is
mainly used when the program /usr/sbin/rear is meant
(e.g. programm calls like "rear mkbackup" and
"rear recover") and in ReaR file and directory
names (e.g. /etc/rear/local.conf). Also RPM package
names are usually lowercase so that ReaR RPM
packages are named 'rear'.
</pre>

If there is no objection I like to close this issue  
and open a new issue that I fix wrong spellings  
when Relax-and-Recover is abbreviated to make  
the texts in the ReaR 2.0 release look well.

If you like, you may read the whole  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and check if you agree with my usage of 'ReaR' versus 'rear'.

@jsmeix Ok let us use **ReaR** as official abbreviation for
Relax-and-Recover and use **rear** to point to the RPM package or
script.
