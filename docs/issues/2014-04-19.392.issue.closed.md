[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh\#L132](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L132)

Why don't we specify the CIFS filesystem with a `-t cifs` in the CIFS
mount command line? I have a user report who seems to have a problem
with this.

As I don't have a test environment I don't want to change it blindly...

@schlomo can you remember what the issue was with the current code?

A user contacted me privately with this issue. I will ask him to add  
details here.

Sorry for keeping you waiting.

Problem: Mount command for cifs not working.  
We think the cifs option is not detected or passed correctly within the
code.

The issue we faced was on RHEL 4 Update 6 - 32 bit.

The rear version used was the compiled rear-1.15-9.el4 from  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)
more precise  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RedHat\_RHEL-4/noarch/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RedHat_RHEL-4/noarch/)

The same rear version for RHEL 5 (rear-1.15-9.el5) did not have that
issue.

What we tried:  
First we thought its issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/108](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/108)  
But the mount command itself used manually with -t cifs option worked
just fine.

Solution:  
How I fixed it was in /usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh in the
lines 132/134 I explicitly mentioned cifs as file system (Add: -t cifs)

Let me know in case you need more details

@valentinnils thank you for you feedback - need to check it and decide
what to do with it

uups I just revisited this case and saw that there are two double
quotations, that must have happened when doing copy and paste, meaning
first double quotation is normal ,second is escape character.

That might have led to the issue, I can't check it straight away due to
server has been decomissioned.

most likely no need to change the code....
