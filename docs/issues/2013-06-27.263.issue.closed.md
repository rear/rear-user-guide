Hi  
First post,new user, be gentle ;)  
First I have to express myself... Rear is the best thing since sliced
bread.

Ok now to serious things.

Source server is running : Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 4 (Nahant
Update 9)  
Restoring on a proliant dl380 G4

I hit 2 problems during restore:

1.  Error: Expecting a partition number.

Comes from `+++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 set /dev/cciss/c0d0p3 on`  
why does the "set" is passed a partion instead of only its id?  
Temporary fix was to comment out the set.  
This happens for all paritions to be created

1.  Error: Can't create any more partitions.

<!-- -->

    +++ echo -e 'Creating partitions for disk /dev/cciss/c0d0 (msdos)'
    +++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mklabel msdos
    +++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart primary 0 509
    +++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart primary 509 100716
    +++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart primary 100716 220165
    +++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart primary 220165 220165
    +++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart logical 220165 264263

problem was fixed by replacing  
`+++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart primary 220165 220165`  
by  
`+++ parted -s /dev/cciss/c0d0 mkpart extended 220165 264263`

After fixing these issues the Disk layout completes and restore starts.

Any advice for a permanent fix?

@lpouellet I improved the code for your first problem. We now moved the
logic to get the partition number from the partition name to a separate
function. And we also trap when for some reason we don't get an integer.

Now to test this on RHEL4, it would be nice if you could send the output
of:

    source usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh
    source usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh
    get_partition_number /dev/cciss/c0d0p3

It should return 3 :-)

@lpouellet BTW We don't understand how the current or previous
implementation can return /dev/cciss/c0d0p3 for the partition number.
There should be no universe where
`echo "/dev/cciss/c0d0p3" | grep -o -E "[0-9]+$"` returns more than an
integer.

Yup, that's the expected behavior. We only support up to 9 partitions as
the code indicates. @jhoekx said this was a limitation in
Relax-and-Recover in other places anyway. I don't mind to improve the
code (and in the above case it's not that hard) however, in other cases
(see examples in code) it is impossible to know for sure how many digits
at the end represent the partition number. So we ended up not accepting
anything other than 1 to 9.

BTW /dev/cciss/c0d0p0 is not a valid partition number ! Partition
numbers start from 1, e.g. /dev/sda1 !

@dagwieers @jhoekx If 9 partitions is hard limitation by rear then we
better clearly state this in our documentation. Is there any reason why
we don't go beyond the number 9 except for the fact we don't like 2
digit numbers?

@gdha There's no dislike for 2 digit numbers, fact is that you cannot
create a function that correctly get partition numbers for all cases.
(There is no sane way to get the partition number for cases like:
/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c400001) Where exactly the other
limitation of 9 partitions is, I don't know. (That said, I never
encountered a system with more than 9 partitions these days since the
general availability of LVM, usually there are only 1 or 2)

BTW Like I mentioned in \#183, to me the above partition is *not* a
valid partition name according to the kernel, it should have been
/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000p1 according to the rules.
I don't know where that name comes from.

The whole partitioning stuff is not nicely written anyway (and I say
this having written it myself - twice). My decision to read the parted
output was not good for old systems. One day I should add a code branch
that uses sfdisk when the 'machine readable' parted output is not
available. There are various problems all around, but I think the
limitation is actually at most 8 partitions because of how extended
partitions work.

@jhoekx The GPT standard allows maximum of 128 partitions per disk  
@dagwieers \#183 - the code generated was not correct so I wouldn't
bother too much with what was original written (by me)

What I meant is the actual limitation *inside ReaR* is 8 partitions.

@gdha Can you tell me what system has a partition named
**/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c400001** instead of
**/dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000p1** ? Because I don't
think it is a correct name for a partition... It would be easy if the
example is wrong.

@dagwieers I've checked my old notes and the `disklayout` file was
beginning with:

    disk /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000 299959511040 gpt
    part /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000 1069254144 32256 primary boot /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000_part1
    part /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000 321053293056 1069286400 primary lvm /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000_part2

As I previously mentioned the code which produces the `diskrestore.sh`
script contained a bug and the interpretation was incorrect somehow.
However, I'm not sure it has been fixed as I couldn't test it anymore
since then...

@dagwieers it was not a real device. It was the result of our code base
not fully understanding devices that only contains numbers

@gdha There are two issues in this report and we didn't tackle the
second one. I looked at it, but it seems much more complicated than I
had hoped it to be :-/ The problem seems to be tuned for the expertise
of @jhoekx ;-)

at issue 2?

It's strange that we're not detecting it as an extended partition.

We'd need a `rear -D savelayout` logfile to know more.

@MarkusRoth Think output of `rear -D savelayout` is missing

Yes, I can and I see the content of:

> 1.  Disklayout.conf
> 2.  df-txt
> 3.  diskdeps.conf
> 4.  disktodo.conf

*However, I'm missing the debug output `rear -D savelayout`*
