    legacy BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    ReaR ISO recovery image leads to a kernel kernel panic.  
    /init: error while loading shared library: libpthread.s0.0: cannot
    open shared object file  
    Problem can be reproduced on physical and virtual servers and also  
    with ReaR version 2.x, found on OBS  
    Even we adapted the rear conf to include /lib64/noelision (it is
    actually copied over),  
    libpthread is not found
-   Work-around, if any:  
    Remove /lib64/noelision from /etc/ld.so.conf  
    Execute ldconfig  
    Create rescue ISO

@linuxstar2017  
I don't know about noelision stuff (and quick Googling did not  
show something explanatory - only various bug reports).

Nevertheless I try some guesswork:  
On my SLES12 system I have

<pre>
e205:~/rear.master # find /lib64 | wc -l
234
</pre>

but in the matching ReaR recovery system I have only

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # find /lib64 | wc -l
71
</pre>

In general the ReaR recovery system is by default very minimal  
so that this or that additional stuff might be missing which  
leads to this error.

@linuxstar2017  
could you try if

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/ )
</pre>

helps?  
With that I get in my recovery system:

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # find /lib64 | wc -l
230
</pre>

That looks better but it is still 4 files less  
that in the original system which are those links

<pre>
/lib64/libfuse.so.2 -> /usr/lib64/libfuse.so.2
/lib64/libfuse.so.2.9.3 -> /usr/lib64/libfuse.so.2.9.3
/lib64/libss.so.2 -> /usr/lib64/libss.so.2
/lib64/libss.so.2.0 -> /usr/lib64/libss.so.2.0
</pre>

It seems there is a general problem  
with links and COPY\_AS\_IS ...  
but I guess that is not related to this issue here.

@linuxstar2017 onyl FYI  
you might have a possibly severe syntax issue in your

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=(${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /lib64/noelision/)
</pre>

In almost all cases one must use quoted "${arr\[@\]}", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068)  
and see in default.conf

<pre>
# Some variables are actually bash arrays and should be treated with care.
# Use VAR=() to set an empty array.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" 'value' ) to add a fixed value to an array.
# Use VAR=( "${VAR[@]}" "$var" ) to add a variable value to an array.
# Whether or not the latter case works as intended depends on when and
# how "$var" is set and evaluated by the Relax-and-Recover scripts.
# In general using ${VAR[*]} is problematic and using ${VAR[@]} without
# double-quotes is also problematic, see 'Arrays' in "man bash" and
# see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068 for some examples.

@linuxstar2017  
can you explain to me how I could reproduce it  
on a SLES12 virtual QEMU/KVM machine?  
On my current SLES12 virtual QEMU/KVM machine

@jsmeix

Sure ...  
(on my lab server)

denbvslnxs1:/lib64/noelision \# ls  
libpthread-2.22.so libpthread.so.0  
denbvslnxs1:/lib64/noelision \# rpm -q --whatprovides
/lib64/noelision/libpthread-2.22.so  
glibc-2.22-61.3.x86\_64

Normally, you don't need it !

But in our case ..

/etc/ld.so.conf need to have the "noelision" library path at first to
prevent  
application crashes, which are caused by bad coded applications (like
Legato Networker's  
nsrexecd) and lead to a double-unlock.

I sent you in parallel a mail (in German) with all the background ...

@linuxstar2017  
I also have the noelision library in /lib64/noelision/  
but I do not have any noelision in my /etc/ld.so.conf  
so that I like to know what exact "noelision" library path  
you have in your /etc/ld.so.conf that might help me  
to reproduce it - preferably just post your whole  
/etc/ld.so.conf here so that I do not need to guess.

Additionally to really reproduce it it seems one needs  
"a badly coded application" which requires the noelision library.  
Do you know a free software that requires the noelision library?

<pre>

</pre>

I have no clue of any free sw, which requires  
this .. but for me, you don't need that step  
of verification ... the original issue need just  
to be fixed ... to do no kernel panic anymore  
and boot from recovery ISO.

Tests for the EMC Networker Recovery need  
to be done anyway later by the customer,  
as he owns the license and EMC is the original  
cause of the issues.

Just IMHO

thanks - and have a nice weekend!

I can reproduce it and  
I know a working workaround with the code as is and  
I know the solution (which needs a fix in a script):

I use always

<pre>
KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
</pre>

so that I can 'chroot' into the ReaR recovery system  
directly on the system where I made it with "rear mkrescue"  
without the need to boot the ReaR recovery system  
on another (virtual) machine only to do some tests  
in the ReaR recovery system which is impossible  
when the ReaR recovery system fails to come up  
like here when the kernel panics because init fails.

I can reproduce it with

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/noelision/ )
</pre>

I make a ReaR recovery system and  
'chroot' into it and do some tests therein:

<pre>
e205:~/rear.master # usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue
...
Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd
...
You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.mqtc7xtv52uuRgu

e205:~/rear.master # chroot /tmp/rear.mqtc7xtv52uuRgu/rootfs/

bash-4.3# export LC_ALL=C LANG=C

bash-4.3# ldd /bin/sort | grep pthread
grep: error while loading shared libraries: libpthread.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

bash-4.3# echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz' | sort
sort: error while loading shared libraries: libpthread.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</pre>

The working workaround without code changes is

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/ )
</pre>

cf. "could you try if ... helps" in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494\#issuecomment-329754377](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494#issuecomment-329754377)

With that I get:

<pre>
e205:~/rear.master # usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue
...
Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd
...
You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.ICBQgUUoYcvDCap

e205:~/rear.master # chroot /tmp/rear.ICBQgUUoYcvDCap/rootfs/

bash-4.3# export LC_ALL=C LANG=C

bash-4.3# ldd /bin/sort | grep pthread
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fc6a7267000)

bash-4.3# echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz' | sort
bar
baz
foo
</pre>

The solution (which needs a fix in a ReaR script) is  
to run 'ldconfig' inside the ReaR recovery system before  
"Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd ..."

<pre>
e205:~/rear.master # chroot /tmp/rear.mqtc7xtv52uuRgu/rootfs/

bash-4.3# export LC_ALL=C LANG=C

bash-4.3# ldconfig -v | egrep 'noelision|pthread'
...
/lib64/noelision:
        libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.22.so
bash-4.3# ldd /bin/sort | grep pthread
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/noelision/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f295567a000)

bash-4.3# echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz' | sort
bar
baz
foo
</pre>

@linuxstar2017  
verify with your customer that

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/ )
</pre>

also works for him with his particular backup program  
(I cannot test if his particular backup program also works).

At the end of  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
there is

<pre>
#ldconfig $v -r "$ROOTFS_DIR" >&2 || Error "Could not configure libraries with ldconfig"
</pre>

which would have helped in this case if it was enabled.

With this line enabled and

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/noelision/ )
</pre>

everything works for me.

@linuxstar2017  
verify with your customer that enabling the "\#ldconfig ..."  
line at the end of build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
is sufficient so that it also works with only

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/noelision/ )
</pre>

Because - as ususal :-( - there is not any comment that explains  
why the 'ldconfig' is disabled in 390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
I need to do forensics - but fortunately we have Git where

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh
</pre>

shows that it was disabled via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb)  
which points to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/772](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/772)  
and therein the reason behind is described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/772\#issuecomment-183457540](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/772#issuecomment-183457540)  
and the commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d62a555fd3460a618e47e8a6c6288e13cbd940fb)  
shows that the intent was to run 'ldconfig' in the booted  
recovery system but now as 'ldconfig -X' (WHY now the '-X'?)  
which is wrong because now it tries to boot the  
recovery system with inconsistent libraries configuration  
which can badly fail as in this case.

As far as I understand it the actually right solution seems  
to create a consistent libraries configuration at build-time  
of the recovery system with right confing files in the  
$ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/ld.so.conf.d/ directory and  
Error out if that fails because that could mean  
the recovery system may fail to boot.

We actually have
[usr/share/rear/build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh](../blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/980_verify_rootfs.sh)
which does a `chroot` test.

It seems to me that we should improve this test to be more thorough. At
the moment it only checks `bash` which apparently does not have this
problem. Can you maybe expand the test there to be more thorough and to
also check for such problems?

please be explicit so that I do not need to guess.  
If you do not invest your time to write explicit information  
others may not spend their time to investigate your issues.  
What change solved the issue?

COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/ )

or

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /lib64/noelision/ )

plus in build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

or did even both changes solve the issue?  
In the latter case what was the preferred way and why?

I reopen this issue because we still have a bug in ReaR  
that needs to be fixed.

@schlomo  
I will enhance build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
but that is of secondary importance.

First and foremost I need some help how to implement correctly  
that the libraries in the recovery system are consistent because  
plain 'ldconfig $v -r "$ROOTFS\_DIR"' seems to have  
unwanted side-effects

Sorry, I was explicit ... but agreed, only in the SR solution comment:

ReaR adapted as per below:

@jsmeix thanks. ATM I only can offer a wild guess: The way how ReaR
copies libraries to the standard paths can mess up some setups to put
"override" libraries in special paths. To be 100% correct we might have
to:

-   Take `ld.so.conf*` as it is
-   replicate the library directories when we copy libs
-   Have special code to handle known special cases

@linuxstar2017 are you really sure it did not work with
`/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/39_copy_binaries_libraries.sh` and
leaving
`#ldconfig $v -r "$ROOTFS_DIR" >&2 || Error "Could not configure libraries with ldconfig"`
==&gt; (line **commented**)  
It worked like that for 1,5 year already with commented line. I suspect
the missing `/lib64/noelision/` was the real reason.  
However, we need to be sure.

@gdha  
At least this is , what we tried/tested .... after un-commenting the
ldconfig line, it worked,  
before not.

The addition of the library path was days before ... it was copied over

but failed nevertheless....

you can reproduce it when you have

...
/lib64/noelision:
        libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.22.so
        libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.22.so

# ldd /bin/sort | grep pthread
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/noelision/libpthread.so.0
</pre>

I use /bin/sort as an example for a binary that is  
linked with libpthread which is now linked with  
the noelision version of libpthread.

Then reproduce it as I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494\#issuecomment-330192635](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494#issuecomment-330192635)

It worked like that for 1,5 year already with commented line  
because for 1,5 year already no ReaR user uses the  
noelision version of libpthread.

Simply put:  
As soon as a special libraries configuration is used,  
the libraries in the recovery system are likely inconsistent  
and when a library is involved where init is linked with,  
the recovery system fails to boot with kernel panic  
because init fails.

@jsmeix @linuxstar2017 Thank you both for the clear explanation of the
issue - now I'm following

With

merged  
issues like this one should now be avoided.

The recovery system libraries are still not fully consistent,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1518](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1518)
but  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514)
is merged  
for programs (i.e. files in a .../bin/... or .../sbin/... directory)  
a missing library in the recovery system is now an Error.

O.K. let me ask more concrete ... what my customer need to know ....

When is the SUSE SLES-supported ReaR package able to work  
non-modfied ? As a consequence, customer expects a PTF or  
fix going upstream.

If no ETA or PTF (customer would challenge, why ?), what according  
to your experience, need the customer to implement to have current,
non-working  
situation corrected ?

For the given scenario ... including /lib64/noelision, a bootable
recovery image and  
working Networker recovery at the end .. pls. keep in mind, this is the
customers  
recovery environment, they rely on !

Many thanks ....

@linuxstar2017

The fix is upstream:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1502](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1502)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494\#issuecomment-330557699](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494#issuecomment-330557699)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6afc9a0a8b5b80429fb0aba545302c1af8ccbe70](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6afc9a0a8b5b80429fb0aba545302c1af8ccbe70)

I do not understand why  
"customer ... have current, non-working situation"  
regardless of your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494\#issuecomment-330224625](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1494#issuecomment-330224625)  
"that change solved the issue ! Server is now recovering"  
Why cannot the customer adapt his ReaR scripts?  
That's why ReaR is implemented as bash scripts, read  
"Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
Regarding the upstream fix  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6afc9a0a8b5b80429fb0aba545302c1af8ccbe70](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6afc9a0a8b5b80429fb0aba545302c1af8ccbe70)  
When the customer uses an older ReaR version  
there is no LogPrintError function.  
In this case use the LogPrint function instead.

In general:

The public ReaR upstream GitHub is  
neither the right place for questions about SUSE's  
(or any company) official customer support handling  
nor for lecturing what people should "keep in mind"  
when working as ReaR upstream maintainers or contributors  
(where most of them do that even on a voluntary base).

The public ReaR upstream GitHub is the right place  
to report the plain facts about a ReaR issue  
to get the issue analyzed and ideally even fixed  
via direct communication with people who are here  
as ReaR upstream maintainers and contributors.  
This way an issue could get solved in a shorter time  
than via an indirectly working official company support.

The public ReaR upstream GitHub does not replace  
an official company support but it can complement it  
by providing an efficient direct communication with the  
ReaR upstream maintainers and contributors plus  
either fixes so that all official company support teams  
could get the fixes from the public ReaR upstream GitHub  
or alternatively by providing a public visible explanation  
why a particular issue cannot be fixed in ReaR  
(e.g. when the cause of an issue is not "inside" ReaR).

@linuxstar2017 As @jsmeix said for ReaR packages from SLES itself you
should open a software case at SuSE support center, and do not bother us
with these kind of questions as we have nothing to say what SuSE does or
has in the pipe-line with ReaR in their products.  
We are volunteers working on public ReaR upstream project and cannot
speak for RHEL, SuSE, Ubuntu or what-ever Linux distro.

@gdha @jsmeix  
Sorry (as explained already to jsmeix) my fault ....  
Just forget it ... it's already channeled again the right way ...

With

merged  
the whole binaries and libraries copying code is now  
cleaned up and simplified.
