In the `format-workflow.sh` script:

        # Parse options
        OPTS="$(getopt -n "$PROGRAM format" -o "fhy" -l "force,help,yes" -- "$@")"

These options are not honored as the `rear` main script interprets the
options first and these are *unknown*. So, this piece of code was not
well tested at creation time.

Not a bug, but lack of documentation of how to use it:  
Use `rear -v format -- --help /dev/<usb-device>`

Came across this when I was looking into making the USB disk EFI
bootable

Maybe we can simplify the usage?

rear format dev=/dev/sdb  
rear format /dev/sdb  
... ?
