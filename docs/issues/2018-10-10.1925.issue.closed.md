@cychung1  
I am neither a SAN nor a multipath user so that I cannot provide  
educated help but I try nevertheless - @schabrolles is our ReaR
upstream  
expert for IBM POWER in general and for SAN and multipath in particular.

As far as I see in your disklayout.conf basically all entries are
disabled  
(i.e. commented with a leading '\#' character) which means nothing  
will be recreated and accordingly your diskrestore.sh script  
is basically empty.

As far as I remember the reason is that by default disk and partition  
and filesystem entries that belong to SAN storage get disabled  
because usually one does not want to recreate non-local things  
that exist on a remote SAN storage because when the local  
hardware gets destroyed, the remote SAN storage is usually  
not affected so that the remote SAN storage should not be touched  
by a "rear recover" run on one of the SAN storage client systems.  
Simply put:  
By default "rear recover" is meant to recreate only  
the local system (in particular local disks).

Accordingly the default setting in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf is

<pre>
# Automatically exclude multipath disks and their dependent components
AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y
</pre>

When you set in your /etc/rear/local.conf `AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n`  
then "rear recover" will do disk partitioning, creating filesystems and
so on  
on your remote SAN storage multipath devices so that you need to  
carefully inspect the disklayout.conf file that gets created during  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" if the actually intended things will happen  
later during "rear recover" on your remote SAN storage (i.e. be
careful  
to not destroy unwanted things on your remote SAN storage).

Regarding SAN and multipath see also the similar looking issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1899](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1899)  
which mentiones additionally boot over SAN.

@cychung1  
by the way:  
In your disklayout.conf I see you use btrfs subvolumes but  
I do not see in your /etc/rear/local.conf the matching entries  
that are usually needed to recreate the special SLES12 btrfs  
subvolume structure with its special interdependency with snapper  
plus btrfs quota setup for snapper, see our SLE12 btrfs example  
configuration files in usr/share/rear/conf/examples/  
in particular since SLES12-SP2  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf)

Additionally:  
Regarding SAN and multipath and boot on SAN specific stuff on
PPC64/PPC64LE see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/RHEL7-PPC64LE-Mulitpath-PXE-GRUB.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/RHEL7-PPC64LE-Mulitpath-PXE-GRUB.conf)

@cychung1  
another side note regarding your  
`BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( ... /hana/backup /hana/log /hana/shared ... )`  
and the `Backup archive size is 35G` in your
rear-recovery-run-screen-output.txt

I assume things in `/hana/` belong to a SAP HANA database.  
I think that HANA stuff makes the backup huge.

I would thoroughly recommend as far as possible  
to Keep Separated Items Separated ( 'KSIS' ;-)  
to Keep It Simple and Straightforward,  
see 'KISS' at
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS\_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)  
and cf. RFC 1925 item (5) at
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925)

The ReaR backup is primarily meant to restore the files of the basic  
operating system but not to also restore big data like a whole database,
see  
the sections "Basics" and "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore"
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

The reason is that with a small ReaR backup that contains only  
what is needed for the basic operating system you get your  
basic operating system up and running again much faster  
during "rear recover" compared to restoring a huge  
'all-in-one' backup with "rear recover" because restoring the  
backup is the main time consuming task during "rear recover".

Related to that how to speed up backup restore you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

Normally you would restore big data as a second separated step  
after "rear recover" from within the rebooted recreated system.

This way you can restore a database with its specific tool  
e.g. a specific database restore tool from the manufacturer  
or vendor of your particular database.

You cannot do that easily during "rear recover" because  
"rear recover" runs within the special (rather minimal)  
ReaR recovery system which does not contain such specific tools  
unless you manually adapt and enhance ReaR to get that in which  
means you have to add one more external backup method to ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/10-integrating-external-backup.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/10-integrating-external-backup.adoc)

Thank you very much for your prompt reply.  
Once proper parameters were set and reduced the scope of backup (only
rootvg), I was able to recover successfully (/etc/fstab was modified).  
One question though, if one of VGs on the source system made up with a
multiple PVs and the target has only one PV with the equal size, how do
you map four LUNs (from source) to one LUN (to target)?

Offhandedly (I did not check the details in the code right now) but  
I assume that ReaR does not automatically map logical volumes.

My assumption is based on when I fixed in ReaR version 2.4  
how ReaR automatically resizes partitions, see in the  
`default.conf` file the description of the config variables  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE  
which reads (excerpts):

<pre>
Resizing partitions in MIGRATION_MODE during "rear recover"
... this does not resize volumes on top of the affected partitions.
To migrate volumes on a disk where the disk size had changed
the user must in advance manually adapt his disklayout.conf file
before he runs "rear recover".
</pre>

Accordingly I think ReaR does not automatically migrate  
logical volumes in general.

This leads to the general topic what ReaR supports  
to migrate a system to somewhat different new hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also a virtual machine)  
or to migrate a system to a different disk layout.

In general migrating a system to different hardware  
or migrating a system to a different disk layout  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

On the other hand ReaR supports to migrate a system  
but here "supports" means that ReaR provides a lot  
that should help you to get such a task done  
but it does not mean that it would "just work" without  
possibly laborious manual settings and adaptions  
with trial and error legwork until you made things work  
for you in your particular case, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1822\#issuecomment-405505923](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1822#issuecomment-405505923)

In particular for an example how ReaR can help to  
migrate a system to a different disk layout  
(a SLES12 btrfs to XFS migration), see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-April/003547.html)

In general regarding migrating a system you may have a look at  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-February/003528.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-February/003528.html)  
and follow the links therein.

I know that the current syntax of the `disklayout.conf` file entries  
is not really user friendly (e.g. one must specify byte values), cf.  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
but improvements here require tons of changes in many ReaR scripts.

With current ReaR I think RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL could help here see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-February/003528.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-February/003528.html)  
so that one could do the laborious work to edit disklayout.conf  
in a more relaxed way not within the running ReaR recovery system  
but in advance on your normally used system and provide the right  
prepared disklayout.conf via RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL, cf.  
"A note on the meaning of 'Relax' in 'Relax-and-Recover'" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Thank you very much, Johannes. I got sidetracked on this project, but
plan to get back and test further before this can be used in a
production environment.
