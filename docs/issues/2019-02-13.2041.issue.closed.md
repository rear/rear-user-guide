I had planned to ask for `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` in default.conf  
after the ReaR v2.5 release but in the sprit of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2040](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2040)  
I ask now:

For the ReaR v2.5 release I would like to have in default.conf

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )

instead of the current `MODULES=()`.

Reasoning:

Missing kernel modules in the recovery system lead to  
arbitrary bad situations where there is no way out, e.g.:

-   keyboard not usable in the recovery system  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1870](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1870)  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1860](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1860)
-   data on external medium (e.g. iso9660) not readable  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)

The current `MODULES=()` relies on 'modprobe --show-depends'  
to include dependant modules but that does not work reliably  
to really get all actually needed modules included, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355)

In contrast `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` is simple, straightforward  
and works reliably to get a usable recovery system.

Space requirements:

On my SLES15-like openSUSE Leap 15.0 UEFI system  
(I always use `FIRMWARE_FILES='no'`)  
I get the following `rear -D mkrescue` output (excerpts):

With `MODULES=()`

    Copying kernel modules
    Omit copying files in /lib*/firmware/ (FIRMWARE_FILES='no')

    ...
    Wrote ISO image: /root/rear.github.master/var/lib/rear/output/rear-g243.iso
    (137M)

With `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`

    Copying all kernel modules in /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp150.12.25-default (MODULES contains 'all_modules')

    Copying only currently loaded kernel modules (MODULES contains 'loaded_modules')
    Omit copying files in /lib*/firmware/ (FIRMWARE_FILES='no')

    Omit copying files in /lib*/firmware/ (FIRMWARE_FILES='no')
    ...

    ...

For comparison with our defaults `FIRMWARE_FILES=()` and `MODULES=()`

    Copying kernel modules

versus with `FIRMWARE_FILES=()` and `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`

    Copying all kernel modules in /lib/modules/4.12.14-lp150.12.25-default (MODULES contains 'all_modules')
    Copying all files in /lib*/firmware/
    ...

@rear/contributors  
what do you think about it?  
Any comments?

@schabrolles  
having `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` by default would  
increase the recovery system ISO by about 35 MiB (in my case).

Could this cause unexpected bad effects on POWER architecture  
with its special limits of the recovery system size?

Perhaps on POWER that 35 MiB more may result a too big initrd  
which can cause arbitrary other strange issues there, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724\#issuecomment-364070280](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1724#issuecomment-364070280)

That issue was also a reason for the md5sum verification  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1859)  
so that now broken files in the recovery system should be  
at least detected.

I personally don't mind having `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` (until I can
set whatever I like in *local.conf*, which I can).

Do you think it would make sense to wait with such change to ReaR 3.0
?  
At least I'm reading release notes more carefully when upgrading between
major versions. So there is a chance, that people administering
thousands of servers will not be surprised when they end up with full
filesystems ;-).

@jsmeix, I've tested it on my POWER system, it works even if it add 14MB
extra size on the initrd file.  
If problem, we could still add `MODULES=( )` in the local.conf, right ?

Of course settings in local.conf overwrite those from default.conf  
(because local.conf is sourced after default.conf in usr/sbin/rear)  
and I verified that right now on my test system to be 100% sure.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to set tomorrow in default.conf

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )

I consider this change "backward compatible" because

-   there is no lost or different functionality (just more
    functionality)
-   it is normal that a new version of whatever software may need some
    more resources (in this case disk and RAM space)
-   the 100% identical old behaviour can still be manually specified

Nevertheless this changes will be described in the  
"possibly backward incompatible changes" part in out

Puh!
