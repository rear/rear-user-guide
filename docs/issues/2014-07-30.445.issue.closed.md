Hello,

i'm new to ReaR and have a question about the "netbackup"-backupmethod
(NBU):  
Is it possible to configure ReaR in that way, that it uses "BACKUP=NBU",
but with manual recovery interaction like "BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE" ? When
i'm going to use the "REQUESTRESTORE"-way rear doesn't include the -for
me- required netbackup-client in the PXE-/Bootimage!

Background:  
The netbackup-policies of our company prohibit the netbackup-clients to
autonomously start backup/recovery-processes...

I hope you can give me a hind?  
Best regards!

sure, once booted from the rear image you could modify in  
/etc/rear/local.conf file the BACKUP method and rear will act as such.

Ah okay, sounds logically. I will test this!
