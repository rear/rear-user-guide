When using `rear recover` via ssh in an xterm window with disk
remapping, this is what is looks like when Backspace is pressed, trying
to erase the `1`:

    Choose an appropriate replacement for /dev/sda
    1) /dev/vda
    2) /dev/vdb
    3) /dev/vdc
    4) Do not map /dev/sda
    5) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
    1^?

After the digit `1`, an escape sequence for the delete character `^?`
appears, making the input invalid.

The cause is the `-n 1000` option used for the `read` invocation by
UserInput by default. To reproduce, use the following invocation, then
type `1` followed by the Backspace key:

    $ read -t 300 -n 1000 x; echo "Input: <$x>" | cat -v
    1^?
    Input: <1^?>

Removing `-n` makes everything work.

The bash manual page on `read` says:

> -n *nchars*
>
> **read** returns after reading *nchars* characters rather than waiting
> for a  
> complete line of input, but honors a delimiter if fewer than
> *nchars*  
> characters are read before the delimiter.

So *nchars* is not really useful to limit the input line length, but to
allow for single-character input without requiring a Return key press.

`USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS` is implemented as described, but not used
anywhere in ReaR.

The intent of USER\_INPUT\_MAX\_CHARS is not to limit the input line
length by default  
so the default `USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=1000` is intentionally so big  
to allow in practice unlimited input line length.

But `read -n 1000` has the bad (and undocumented as far as I can see)
side effect  
to make correcting/editing the input (before the Return key is pressed)
impossible.

So I have to change things to avoid that unintended and bad side effect.

Oh!  
It seems (at least for me with GNU bash version 4.4.23 on openSUSE Leap
15.2)  
read behaves with `-n 0` same as if no `-n ...` option was specified so
sinply  
`USER_INPUT_MAX_CHARS=0` in default.conf should do it.  
But I have to test if `read -n 0` behaves well also with older bash.

Things work well for me with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2658](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2658)

@OliverO2  
thank you for the issue report and in particular  
many thanks for your analysis what the root cause was that  
made correcting the input (before \[Enter\] is pressed) impossible.
