I don't understand the test with tty -s command in this file.  
When using rear through ssh like this :

    ssh <NODE> rear mkbackup -v

I haven't the progress info bar

    Archived 961 MiB [avg 3890 KiB/sec]

just

    Preparing archive operation

Due to this test with tty -s command.

    ssh <NODE> tty -s; echo $?
    1

    ssh <NODE>
    tty -s; echo $?
    0

I want to know what was the purpose of this test ?

Use ssh -t to get an interactive terminal (which is what you want since
you  
as a human are watching it). Without -t ssh just runs the command and  
conveys to the command that there is no interactive user present.
