I am trying to use rear to create a virtual copy from a physical
system.  
The virtual system is indeed different from the physical system and this
is likely the reason for the above error message but I am trying to
overcome this anyhow.

actually there is another input that migth be addition to your
investigation,,both the the source lpar and destination lpar where i am
try to put the iso image are lpars they are not phyiscal ,,,on poweor
systems we call it lpars,,,,

the lpar on which the iso image it taken is having rootvg disk named as
mpathh,,,the lpar on which the image i am trying to load is having only
one disk and the disk is named as mpatha,,,for me this should not be a
cause of concern but yes if it adds on to your investigation it would
good

Hi Hamntri,  
thank you for your multiple responses. I appreciate that.  
However, I am afraid I can't relate your anwers to my question.  
Are you sure you anwered my question?

@andreasberner, I don't have exact answer for your problem, but I'd
recommend you to start with storing your ReaR recovery system (ISO) and
backup separately on some remote (CIFS or NFS) share.

Something like:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

[here](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)
you can find some easy and tested configuration examples.

Be aware *file://* as a destination can be quite tricky and might
require some hacks to work correctly ...

@hamantri I'm somehow confused by your posts. As @andreasberner already
wrote, they looks to be unrelated to this issue.  
If you want, you can open new issue by filling the template

@gozora: Thank you for your advice the source server is in a remote
location and I would do hard to store the backup somewhere else if not
on file. I have already used rear on a different hardware where I store
everything on a mounted USB-Stick and this works like a charm.  
Can you explain a bit more into detail why storing the resulting backup
in a file would be problematic?  
Of course I moved away to the iso to the cd of the desingated copy
computer right after creating the iso on the source.

Well, I'm afraid I can't give you qualified answer, because I've never
actually used *file://*. and honestly I have just foggy idea how it
works ...  
Anyhow, as far as I remember there has been some people already having
trouble when they used *file://*, so you can search in [closed
issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
and maybe you will find something usefull ...

@andreasberner  
in general when you like to recreate on different hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also virtual hardware)  
things can get soon rather complicated, see my  
explanations in the mail thread with subject  
"Move from bare-metal2vm ?"  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html)

@andreasberner Did you looked at the target system in detail when this
issue happened? Were the file systems created? Could you inspect this
with fdisk or parted? vgs, lvs and pvs commands?  
The error seems to be related that the desired file system was not
created somehow. The logs should tell you more what really happened as
these are quite detailed for that section (in creating the disk
partitions and so on).

@andreasberner Is this issue still relevant? I see Debian, Sles and lpar
?? Very confusing...

@gdha  
I think the confusing SLES and lpar you see are in comment
