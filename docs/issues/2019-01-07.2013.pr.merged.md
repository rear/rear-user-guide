-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now it errors out directly in the 'build\_bootx86\_efi' function if

1.  neither `grub-mkimage` nor `grub2-mkimage` is found
2.  no `/usr/lib/grub*/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst` file is found
3.  grub-mkimage or grub2-mkimage results non-zero exit code

The `build_bootx86_efi` function is only called in  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
which runs only if UEFI is used so that we simply error out  
in that function if we cannot make a bootable EFI image of GRUB2.  
Normally a function should not exit out but return to its caller with  
various appropriate non-zero return codes depending on each error.

@rmetrich @gdha  
could you please test it on Red Hat and Fedora systems?

@gozora  
could you please have a general look because it is about GRUB2
bootloader stuff?
