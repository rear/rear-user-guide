-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Dear Staff:

I would like to prove that the bare-metal rear backup procedures I
developed for the System76  
machine, described below, are valid. However, I don't have a spare
System76 machine. I think,  
but don't know, if the procedures work on the Dell machine, described
below, configured with  
the same Linux OS version as the System76 machine, the same backup
procedures will also  
work for the System76 machine.

In your opinion, is performing rear validation on the Dell machine
sufficient to prove the same  
set of procedures used for the Dell machine will also work for the
System76 machine?  
(Assume they have machines have same release of the Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
OS installed on them.)

The System76 machine is described by the following link.

    https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze16/README.html

It has an 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz × 16 processor, 16GB
RAM, and a 1TB SSD.

The Dell Latitude machine is described by the following links.

    https://i.dell.com/sites/content/shared-content/data-sheets/en/documents/latitude-e6420-spec-sheet.pdf
    https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/52229/intel-core-i52520m-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3-20-ghz.html

It has a i5-2520M @ 2.5Ghz processor, 8GB RAM and a 128GB SSD.

Both of the above machines have AMD64 architecture and satisfy the
Ubuntu requirements described by  
the following link.

    https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-20-04-system-requirements

The sequence of validation procedures is as follows.

-   Install Linux Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS on the machine.

-   Use "rear mkbackup" on an external USB disk to create a rescue disk
    with both boot and data sectors.

-   Erase the internal disk on the machine.

-   Use the rear image on thee external USB disk to restore the machine.

Best Regards,

Paul R.

@paulra1 Hi - thanks for using ReaR, however, you cannot expect from us
that we validate your hardware setup. The ultimate test has to be done
by you. Don't be afraid to test it out as thousands of other end-users
already did it before you.  
If you encounter a bug with ReaR then submit an issue, but hope that
won't be necessary.

Hi gdah  
I understand and don't expect validatation of my hardware setup and that
is not the topiic of the case.  
The case is in fact an opinion question. In particular, I would like to
know if you and your colleagues  
believe the strategy I described in adequate to verify that a rear
backup will work. What prompted it  
is that I am unable to perform a direct test because I don't have the
right kind of spare machine.

Best Regards,  
Paul R.

@paulra1

I assume your System76 machine is the one that actually matters for
you  
and your Dell machine is intended only as some kind of "playground"  
so you can use your Dell machine to try out things with ReaR  
only on that machine, in particular you can risk that "rear recover"  
may fail to recreate your Dell machine (so you would have to  
reinstall your Dell machine manually from scratch and try again).

If my assumption is right, then yes, do that!

Try out how ReaR behaves on your Dell machine because  
you need to use ReaR yourself, play around with it yourself,  
do some trial an error experiments with it yourself,  
to get used to ReaR which is a mandatory precondition  
to be able to do a real disaster recovery, cf.  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding your question if a successful recovery on your Dell machine  
"proves" that then with same ReaR settings and same installed OS  
there will be also a successful recovery on your System76 machine:

The only possible answer is of couse NO.  
Here NO means that this is NO proof.

The reason is that things are different on different hardware.  
A "same installed" OS is not same on different hardware.

See the section  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
for some critical areas where differences matter a lot for ReaR.

Those areas are in particular firmware (BIOS type / UEFI)  
and storage (disk types, disk sizes).

Different firmware can behave differently  
in particular regarding booting from USB.  
We had issues in ReaR with exactly that.  
See what I wrote at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770\#issuecomment-1070968457](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2770#issuecomment-1070968457)  
how you could at least test if the ReaR recovery system boots from USB.

[https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze16/README.html](https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze16/README.html)  
reads (excerpts):

    BIOS ... System76 Open Firmware
    ...
    Storage
        1x M.2 (PCIe NVMe Gen 4)
        1x M.2 (PCIe NVMe Gen 3 or SATA)
        2.5" 7mm SATA drive bay

while in contrast  
[https://i.dell.com/sites/content/shared-content/data-sheets/en/documents/latitude-e6420-spec-sheet.pdf](https://i.dell.com/sites/content/shared-content/data-sheets/en/documents/latitude-e6420-spec-sheet.pdf)  
reads (excerpts):

    Primary Storage Options
        7200 rpm SATA up to 500GB
        Encrypted 7200 rpm 320GB12
        Mobility Solid State up to 256G

but it tells nothing about BIOS type or UEFI but I assume  
it has something different than "System76 Open Firmware".

You wrote that the one has a `1TB SSD` and the other one a `128GB SSD`  
but the crucial point would be the storage type i.e. if it is SATA or
NVMe.

ReaR is known to work with SATA and NVMe disks.

I only tell that there is no proof when ReaR works on one particular
hardware  
that then same ReaR settings will also work on different hardware  
with a "same installed" OS.

In general regarding different hardware:

When you do not have fully compatible replacement hardware  
then recreating the system becomes what we call a MIGRATION.

Migrating a system onto somewhat different hardware  
will usually not work "out of the box" with ReaR, see  
MIGRATION\_MODE in default.conf currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L375](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L375)

Regarding migration to a system with a bit smaller or a bit bigger
disk  
see in conf/default.conf the description of the config variables  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE

I reccommend to not use AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS="yes"  
with layout/prepare/default/430\_autoresize\_all\_partitions.sh  
because that may result bad aligned partitions in particular  
bad aligned for what flash memory based disks (i.e. SSDs) need  
that usually need a 4MiB or 8MiB alignment (a too small value  
will result lower speed and less lifetime of flash memory devices),  
see the comment at USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE  
in default.conf

In general regarding system migration with ReaR  
(e.g. to a system with substantially different disk size):

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also a virtual machine)  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
that would do the annoying legwork for you.

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before  
on as much as possible same replacement hardware.

Hi Johannes:

Thank you for your lucid explanation. I don't believe my question could
be addressed better,  
and think the the case should be closed.

You are right that the Dell machine is just being used as a playground
and your comments make  
it clear that the rear configuration behavior on the Dell machine has
only limited applicatility  
to how the configuration will behave on another machine--for instance
the System76 machine.

While both machines are UEFI machines, their BIOS are significantly
different.  
In addition, as you pointed out, the differences in low level SSD layout
merits  
careful consideration.

Best Regards,

Paul R.

@paulra1  
thank you for your feedback!

Only as a side note FYI:  
To avoid confusion I recommend to use the word BIOS  
only if you mean the legacy firmware in PC architecture  
and also when you use the firmware in legacy BIOS mode  
but the word EFI or UEFI if you mean nowadays firmware  
that you use in its native way (i.e. as \[U\]EFI bootloader)  
and the word firmware as generic name for such kind of software  
that is provided built-in by the manufactuer of the raw hardware.
