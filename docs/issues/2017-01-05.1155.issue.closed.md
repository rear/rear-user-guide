#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Rehl 6/7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):
-   Are you using legacy BIOS of UEFI boot?
-   Brief description of the issue:

I backed up a physical system successfully. I was able to restore to the
physical system successfully.

I want to restore the image of the physical system to a VMware client.

However no Ethernet interfaces show up when I boot into the rescue ISO
file.

I am assuming that could be because the image did not have the VMware
Ethernet drivers so it did not load anything.

Is there a way to get this to work?

I have need to move a physical system to the VM world and was hoping
ReaR would work for us.  
P2V was is not giving us what we need.

Thank you in advance for your help.

-   Work-around, if any:

As an update I tried a vm to a new vm container restore and that worked
fine. This makes me think my first assumption is correct about the
physical not having the drivers that are needed.

I did have to change the IP manually and the MAC address to be the new
nic,

Something interesting when I tried to do a restore of a VM back to its
original container. Networking did not get configured as it did on the
physical system. I did the following commands to get it working:

a. ip link set dev ens32 up  
b. ip addr add <ip>/24 dev ens32  
c. ip route add default via <my subnet gw> dev ens32

Restore then worked fine.

@unix1adm Have a look at the loaded network drivers of the VM and you
have to make sure that these kernel drivers are copied/loaded on the
physical system before you can do a P2V cloning.  
E.g. add
`MODULES_LOAD=( "${MODULES_LOAD[@]}" "my_vm_kernel_network_module" )`
into `/etc/rear/local.conf`

@unix1adm  
what you like to do is not a pure recovery but actually it is  
a system migration (from physical to virtual: 'P2V').

In general using ReaR for migrating a system onto  
different kind of "hardware" is tricky and depending  
on the exact difference it may become a complicated task.  
Simply put: The more different the new "hardware" is  
the more tricky and complicated the migration it will be.

Regarding P2V system migration  
you may have a look at the example in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943)

In general regarding special networking setup see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq)  
therein the "IP migration" section and see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/819\#issuecomment-239458728](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/819#issuecomment-239458728)  
and follow the links therein.

Thank you for the info.  
We tried P2V and it failed that is why I was hoping ReaR would help us
out. I will review the links your provided.

I appreciate the feed back and will post more question if any after I
review.

Only FYI an untested idea regarding possibly easier migration  
of an existing system onto very different new "hardware":

Instead of what I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-236129462](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-236129462)

<pre>
... you need to manually adapt the
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
file into something that matches the new "hardware"
</pre>

I like to suggest to try out if it works perhaps easier  
when you do it the other way round:

Instead of running "rear mkrescue" on the old hardware and  
then manually adapt the old var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
file into something that matches the new "hardware"  
I like to suggest the following opposite way:

Install a small initial system from scratch on the new hardware  
with the disk layout (i.e. partitioning, filesystems, mount points)  
as intended for the final system on the new hardware  
(e.g. by using the Linux distribution's native installer) and then  
run "rear mkbackup" in that initial system on the new hardware  
so that you get in particular a var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
file that matches the intended disk layout on the new hardware  
and save the whole var/lib/rear/ directory contents  
from the initial system to a safe place.

On the old system run "rear mkbackup" to get primarily  
only a backup of the files of the old system.

Then overwrite the initial system on the new hardware  
via "rear recover" where you use in particular the  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf that you made  
before in the initial system on the new hardware  
and the backup of the files of the old system that  
you made before on the old system.

Perhaps you could even use the ReaR recovery system  
from the "rear mkbackup" run on the new hardware  
because that one should contain the right kernel modules  
and other needed stuff that match the new hardware  
provided you used for the "rear mkbackup" run on the  
new hardware the same backup method as you use  
when you run "rear mkbackup" run on the old hardware  
to ensure the new ReaR recovery system also contains  
the right backup restore tools.

I guess it should work when you overwrite the backup.tar.gz  
from the "rear mkbackup" run on the new hardware  
with the backup.tar.gz that contains the files of the old system  
so that you could run the new ReaR recovery system on  
the new hardware and run "rear recover" to get the old  
system's files migrated onto the new hardware with the  
intended new hardware's disk layout.

Again:  
This is only an untested idea.

@unix1adm  
I would appreciate it very much if you could provide feedback  
whether or not that idea seems to work in general  
or if it is perhaps only a nonsese dead end.

An addedum:

System software migration at the same time  
together with hardware migration cannot work.

At least it cannot work when you intend to use the  
ReaR recovery system from the "rear mkbackup" run  
on the new hardware.

I.e. when you install the above mentioned initial system  
from scratch on the new hardware you must use the same  
Linux distribution version that you currently run on your  
old hardware to ensure the programs and other files  
in the new ReaR recovery system match what you  
use on the old hardware.

Good Day jsmeix

Well the initial issue I am having is that I cannot even do a recover as
I am missing the ethernet. The backup files are on a nfs share ( I have
them on a Linux system as well as a AIX nfs share.)  
but when I boot the system from the ISO file I cannot load anything as
there is no networking to mount the backed up files.

So you are saying to load a basic OS on the new VM container so it has
the networking? Then try to overlay a rear restore? I was under the
assumption you had to boot from the ISO file to do a restore.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937117?v=4" width="50">[unix1adm](https://github.com/unix1adm) commented at [2017-01-12 12:33](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1155#issuecomment-272152128):

On a similar point :

The other thing I am going to be working on is I need to take a backup
of a Rhel Linux system on Power then restore it to another Power system
as is. Hardware specs are not know at this time but they are in the same
family of Power systems. So I am hoping I will be able to restore it.

If I can get the networking going I think a restore will work in this
case.

Another question I have is :  
I am assuming I can make a backup to ANY nfs mountpoint then copy the
files over to another NFS server (different domain) and then do a
restore.

Now the question I have is with the /etc/rear/local.conf file will be
pointing to the OLD nfs server

sample local.conf file:

a. vi /etc/rear/local.conf add the below lines to the end of the file.  
UTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs://192.168.56.1/storage  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://192.168.56.1/storage  
SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="redhat"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/media'
'/var/tmp' '/var/crash')  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=

So is there a way to edit this file from the ISO or a command line
option to point to the new NFS server?

By the way I am not changing the release of the OS. If it is at 6.8 it
will stay at 6.8.

If your backup is on a remote machine you  
need networking in the ReaR recovery system.  
I think you cannot boot something else and  
overlay that with ReaR with reasonable effort.

What I use and what always works for me  
in my network environment to get networking  
in the ReaR recovery system is in local.conf

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
</pre>

cf. "First steps with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

But in restricted network environments  
(e.g. when there is no DHCP server)  
you may have to do manual networking setup  
for the ReaR recovery system, cf.  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
in default.conf.

When you copy the ReaR files (in particular backup.tar.gz)  
over to another NFS server you need to adapt in the  
running ReaR recovery system /etc/rear/local.conf  
before you run "rear recover" so that the BACKUP\_URL  
points to the right NFS share wherefrom "rear recover"  
can get the backup.tar.gz to be restored.

In general you can adapt in the ReaR recovery system  
anything as you need before you run "rear recover".

For example you can manually type appropriate commands  
in the ReaR recovery system to set up networking therein.

Hi @unix1adm,

Regarding P2V to VMWare, the easiest way to do it is to assign e1000
driver to the VM NIC for the initial restore. This should work without
issues and linux will recognize it in order you can have the network
working, after the recover, reboot, install vmware tools, shutdown,
switch the NIC driver to vmxnet and after boot will work as expected and
P2V.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

@didacog  
many thanks for your help regarding possible issues with VMWare.  
I don't have VMWare so that I cannot help with its issues.  
My KVM/QEMU VMs "just work" for me ;-)

To jsmeix

I think you dotn understand my question. Yes I have to modify the
/etc/rear/local.conf file

The initial backup needs to go to a NFS server on a ip 192.168.1.x says
for eample  
During the restore it needs ot be changed to point to 192.168.2.x say

How do I get to the local.conf file after the system is booting from the
restore ISO file?

If I change it before i take the backup it wont go to the NFS server it
needs to for that.

Sorry if I was not clear before.

or are you saying I can backup the system to a local dir on the system
then move that file off to another system and restore from that?

The issue I see is that I need to have the tar file on some mount point
that rear knows about so it can pull it down and restore the OS.

@unix1adm Just edit `/etc/rear/local.conf` and change it manually before
starting the recover. As simple as that :-)

Are you saying once I boot the ReaR ISO file this can be changed?

That would be simple. I have not had time to try that but I will and
report back.

Thank you.

Well thank you a bunch. That solution to the part of the restore using a
new NFS system worked great. I still have to test physical hardware but
in Vm it worked.

I am set with this issue for now. Thank you again for the great info.  
I will be testing the restore of the Linux on Power this week as I was
able to get the backup successfully.  
Crossing fingers the restores goes as smooth.
