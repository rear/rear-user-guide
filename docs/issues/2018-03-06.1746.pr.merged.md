-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    In 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh do all what belongs to
    autoresizing partitions  
    via AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS only in MIGRATION\_MODE.

Without that fix autoresizing partitions would happen in
100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
when AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS is true also when not in MIGRATION\_MODE  
but when not in MIGRATION\_MODE "rear recover" must and can recreate  
byte-by-byte identical partitioning (if a disk size changed
MIGRATION\_MODE  
would be true).
