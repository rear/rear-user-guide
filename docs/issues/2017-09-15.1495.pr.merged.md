I propose to check the current kernel parameters used (in
`/proc/cmdline`) to detect some important parameter we should use when
booting in rescue mode (means add them in KERNEL\_CMDLINE variable).

Based on the discussion with @gdha in \#1400, I started to detect
`net.ifnames` or `biosdevname` parameter in order to preserve interface
naming between rescue mode and real system after migration.

@gdha It was my thought.... I was starting this scipt by considering
KERNEL\_CMDLINE was an array ... but it was not ;-) May be @jsmeix or
@schlomo could tell us why it is a variable and not an array.

@jsmeix, I've just made some adjustments (using a Array
CHECK\_KERNEL\_PARAMETER in default.conf). Does it fit your expectation
? (not sure I understand what you mean by *"implement it via  
generically working code"*)

FWIW:  
Bash arrays are in the end only needed when the elements  
could be strings (i.e. consist of several words) so that

<pre>
# strings=( first 'second thing' last )

# for string in "${strings[@]}" ; do echo "'$string'" ; done
'first'
'second thing'
'last'
</pre>

works.  
When things are only words, a simple string is sufficient  
because then simple

<pre>
# words=" first second   third "

# for word in $words ; do echo "'$word'" ; done
'first'
'second'
'third'
</pre>

already works.  
Careful note quoting versus non-quoting!

@jsmeix variable name changed. (and tested an ubuntu with net.ifnames)

I'm waiting for last feedback/approval from @gdha and @schlomo before
merging this one.

Looks good to me. Did you check it with kernel options that are bare
words without a `=`? Like `gpt`?

@gdha, Yes I have some system (in PowerVM) where even if you put
`net.ifnames=0`, the inet are name with biosdevname. But it is a first
step ... (some other modification will come).  
Without this one, you could face the following problem:

1.  During a migration of a system that have "net.ifnames=0" (source
    machine) interface is named "eth0"
2.  Migrate to a new system... So boot on the ReaR rescue media,
    interface could be named "enpos1" if running ubuntu.... So ReaR
    start the network migration and rename interfaces from eth0 to
    enpos1 (ubuntu is not using udev rules file by default).
3.  After migration, reboot the the "Real OS" .... but this one will
    restart with "net.ifnames=0" ... so network won't be setup correctly
    ... :(

That's why we need to copy this option into the rescue image.

@schlomo, Yes it also works with parameters without `=` like `quiet`
(just tested)

Thanks, go ahead and merge.
