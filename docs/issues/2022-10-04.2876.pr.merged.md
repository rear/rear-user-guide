-   Type: **New Feature**

-   Impact: **High**

High impact only on systems where 'barrel' exists.

There should be no change (and no impact) on other systems  
regarding the actual disk layout recreation via diskrestore.sh  
(i.e. nothing of the actual disk layout recreation  
via diskrestore.sh is changed).

There are visible changes on all systems  
regarding the choices in the user dialogs  
during "rear recover" that are improved  
so that users have now more options what to do  
and what should happen during "rear recover".  
There was no change what the default choice is  
so the default behaviour of "rear recover" is same as before  
unless BARREL\_DEVICEGRAPH is explicitly set to true by the user.

In particular users can now additionally choose:

"Skip wiping disks"  
Before there was no way to do that without changing  
/etc/rear/local.conf and restarting "rear recover".

"Again wipe the disks in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED"  
Before there was no way to do that during "rear recover".  
The only way was to abort "rear recover" and restart it.

"Show what is currently on the disks ('lsblk' block devices list)"  
Before there was no easy way to see what is currently on the disks.  
The only way was to use the ReaR shell and manually type  
e.g. an appropriate 'lsblk' command.

"Confirm what is currently on the disks and continue 'rear recover'"  
Before there was no way to do that.  
The only way was to fix diskrestore.sh and re-run it until all is OK  
or do something via ReaR shell and re-run barrel until all is OK.  
But the user might also fix things (in particular smaller things)  
by only using the ReaR shell and then confirm what he created  
on his disks and continue with restoring the backup.

Those additional options during "rear recover" became useful  
and needed by me while I did my various tests with 'barrel'  
so those additional options during "rear recover" are a direct  
consequence of the added support for a second method how to  
recreate the disk layout - in particular when I first used  
'barrel' and then switched back to 'diskrastore.sh' where  
I needed to "Again wipe the disks in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED"  
and where I liked to see what is currently on the disks.

The BARREL\_DEVICEGRAPH and BARREL\_MAPPING\_FILE config variables  
are curently not documented in default.conf because the names  
and semantics of 'barrel' config variables may change during  
the currently ongoing development of 'barrel' support.

Several tests on my SLES15 SP4 test VM  
with the default SUSE storage structure:

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINTS

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh  
added the new storage layout recreation method  
`Recreating storage layout with 'barrel' devicegraph`  
as optional alternative to recreating with diskrestore.sh  
when the config variable BARREL\_DEVICEGRAPH is 'true'  
plus an option to switch from 'barrel' back to diskrestore.sh.

Additionally there are the new options  
`Show what is currently on the disks ('lsblk' block devices list)`  
and  
`Again wipe those disks ...` in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED  
to check after a failed attempt what was recreated and  
to redo the recreation from scratch on clean disks.

Currently this implements only very basic 'barrel' support.

In particular support for 'barrel' device mapping  
during "rear recover" via user dialogs in MIGRATION\_MODE  
is currently missing.

Current 'barrel' device mapping must be done manually via

    BARREL_MAPPING_FILE="/etc/barrel-mapping.json"
    COPY_AS_IS+=( $BARREL_MAPPING_FILE )

in etc/rear/local.conf with an appropriate manually created  
/etc/barrel-mapping.json file with content for example like

    {
        "mapping" : {
            "/dev/sda" : "/dev/disk/by-id/ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00001"
        }
    }

which works for me for my KVM/QEMU test VMs because  
all my VMs have `/dev/disk/by-id/ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00001`  
as a symbolic link that points to ../../sda

I also tested on my above SLES15 SP4 test VM  
that things behave backward compatible  
when there is no 'barrel' program.

@gdha @pcahyna @rear/contributors  
I would appreciate it very much  
if you could have a look at my code changes  
whether or not they look backward compatible to you.

I will do some more tests tomorrow  
and when there are no objections  
I would like to merge it on Friday afternoon  
to get some initial very basic 'barrel' support  
as a first step - further enhancements will happen  
afterwards via separated pull requests as needed.

@jsmeix I will not be able to review the change this week, as I am
leaving now. But according to the description, the "barrel" tool sounds
very promising for use in ReaR.

However, if you feel okay with it please proceed.

@gdha  
thank you for your feedback.  
I do not expect you or other ReaR contributors (except me)  
to know about 'barrel' or to even learn what 'barrel' is.  
I only liked to get feedback from a general point of view.

> There should be no change (and no impact) on other systems.

I had only a quick look at the change and I see some code changes in
places that are not protected by `if is_true "$BARREL_DEVICEGRAPH"`.
Especially in
usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/120\_confirm\_wipedisk\_disks.sh
and usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh .
It may be the case that the changes do not change anything when `barrel`
is not in use, but it is far from obvious and

seems to contradict it.

Would it be possible to separate the barrel-related changes from the
disk-wiping changes?

@pcahyna  
thank you for having a look!

I enhanced my initial description of this pull request  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2876\#issue-1395991143](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2876#issue-1395991143)  
that now explains why those additional user dialog choices  
got added together with the actual 'barrel' support.

In theory I could separate those additional user dialog choices  
from the actual 'barrel' support but in practice I needed  
those additional user dialog choices while I was using  
'barrel' and 'diskrestore.sh' alternately during one same  
'rear recover' run so in practice all that belongs together.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-10-13 07:24](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2876#issuecomment-1277148093):

If there are no strong objections against the  
new additional choices during "rear recover"  
I would like to merge this pull request as is  
today afternoon.

When issues appear with the new additional choices  
during "rear recover" I will of course fix them.

I already know one but that really belongs  
to a separated pull request:

Currently it does not work to run diskrestore.sh  
then "Again wipe the disks in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED"  
and then re-run diskrestore.sh  
because the second run of diskrestore.sh does nothing  
because all is marked as already done by the first run.  
The reason why things get marked as done can be seen  
how it is meant to behave in the section "The Ad-Hoc Way" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
so one can modify diskrestore.sh step by step and re-run it  
and it only does the not yet done things.

What currently "just works" (at least for me) is  
to run 'barrel'  
then "Again wipe the disks in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED"  
and re-run 'barrel'  
and so on as often as one likes.

It also works for me to just re-run 'barrel'  
even without "Again wipe the disks in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED"  
in between because 'barrel' does a lot to be able to run  
on already used disks where the same layout already exists  
because this is how 'barrel' gets usually tested  
(again and again via AutoYaST with already used disks).

Of course there is no guarantee that one can re-run 'barrel'  
again and again as often as one likes and all goes well.  
During my tests I managed to mess up things so much  
that 'barrel' failed to recreate things even with  
"Again wipe the disks in DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED" before.  
But in this case it "just worked" (at least for me)  
to abort the current "rear recover" run and  
re-boot the ReaR recovery system and let  
"rear recover" run again from scratch.

@jsmeix does it mean that in practice barrel supports to do "only the
not yet done things" natively without marking things as done? That's how
I understand it and would be good for consistency between barrel and the
usual layout code.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-10-14 12:42](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2876#issuecomment-1278958908):

@pcahyna  
no, you misunderstood.  
'barrel' does not support to do "only the not yet done things".  
It is the opposite:  
Running 'barrel' always recreates all from scratch.  
Running 'barrel' results that what is specified  
as so called 'devicegraph' via an XML file  
will get (basically mercilessly) setup on the disks  
(regardless what there already is on the disks),  
cf. at the end of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2863\#issue-1375652428](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2863#issue-1375652428)

    Its name is 'barrel' because it even supports
    "shooting yourself in the foot" when used without care ;-)

So with 'barrel' one cannot recreate step by step  
as with disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh.  
When recreating with 'barrel' plus devicegraph fails  
it is a dead end in practice because manually editing  
the devicegraph XML is likely not what one wants to do.

BUT  
One can run barrel also interactively to manually  
setup storage things, cf.  
[https://github.com/openSUSE/barrel/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md](https://github.com/openSUSE/barrel/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md)  
So when recreating with 'barrel' plus devicegraph fails  
the user may manually setup his storage things with 'barrel'  
interactively via the ReaR shell  
or the user can switch back to ReaR's native recreating  
method via disklayout.conf and diskrestore.sh  
or perhaps even a combination of both and finally he can  
"Confirm what is currently on the disks and continue 'rear recover'"  
to restore his backup into what he manually created.  
I assume this way will not be done very often in practice.  
But when all seems lost this could be the only way out  
(except reinstalling from scratch without ReaR).

With "'barrel' does a lot to be able to run on already  
used disks where the same layout already exists"  
I meant that 'barrel' does a lot to deal with unwanted  
remainders of what there already is on a disk on its own.  
So 'barrel' does not need a separated "wipe disks" step  
before - at least in usual cases a.k.a. in the already known  
cases where the 'libstorage-ng' developer(s) implemented  
"the right things" how to deal with remainders on disks.

'barrel' is a command line frontend for 'libstorage-ng'  
[https://github.com/aschnell/libstorage-ng](https://github.com/aschnell/libstorage-ng)  
so the actual work is implemented in 'libstorage-ng'  
(as far as I understood what I was told about it).

@pcahyna  
thank you for your questions!  
They help me to think in more detail about how 'barrel' works  
and how it can and should be well integrated into ReaR.
