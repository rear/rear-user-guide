@lzaoral  
perhaps a more failsafe implementation could be  
to first grep for "Total devices" (perhaps with ignore case?)  
and only if that matches grep for  
not "Total devices 1 " (with trailing space)  
for example something like

    # Only test when 'btrfs filesystem' shows the number of "Total devices":
    if grep -qi "total devices" ... ; then
        # Ensure a btrfs filesystem consists of only one device
        # cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2028
        if ! grep -qi "total devices 1 " ... ; then

@rear/contributors  
please have a look here and  
if time permits and when you have a system with btrfs  
check if this also works for you  
because currently it is intended to be included  
in ReaR 2.8 according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/22\#issuecomment-2540763985](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/22#issuecomment-2540763985)

When issues appear with the change here  
we can easily postpone it to ReaR 3.0 because  
when we do not do the check in this pull request  
it is not worse than it was all the time up to ReaR 2.7

I'd rather include this check now as we know about the problem and I
always prefer direct and clear communication to our users over "just
failing".

I fully agree with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3365\#issuecomment-2546046917](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3365#issuecomment-2546046917)  
in particular during "rear mkrescue" because  
even if some Error() exit would be false in some cases,  
it can be relatively easily removed in the code by the user and  
we get (hopefully) informed by the user via a GitHub issue,  
in contrast to "somehow failing elsewhere" where "elsewhere"  
is likely during "rear recover" which is much more annoying  
for the user and debugging is much more complicated  
both for us and the user.

@pcahyna  
could you also have a look here and tell your opinion  
whether or not it should be included in ReaR 2.8  
provided @lzaoral commits something like his

or if this pull request should be postponed to ReaR 3.0  
because without this pull request it is not worse  
than it had been all the time up to ReaR 2.7

@rear/contributors  
I intend to merge it in one hour or so  
unless severe objections appear against the currrently implemented

    grep -qE 'Total devices ([2-9]|[1-9][0-9]+) '

method which is tested on Red Hat / Fedora and SLES 12 / 15.

Tested is always a very hard arguments, so let's go ahead with it. We
can improve it when the output changes.

FYI an addendum regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3365\#discussion\_r1887100637](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3365#discussion_r1887100637)  
that reads (excerpt)

    any chance to have something more robust
    that [sic] matching on the english text output of the tool?

The **english** therein made me wonder if ReaR  
actually enforces English text output of what it calls  
and yes, it does because sbin/rear enforces C locale

    # Make sure that we use only English:
    export LC_CTYPE=C LC_ALL=C LANG=C

Phew!  
;-)
