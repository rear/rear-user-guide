Even with REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="fast", `rear mkrescue` does spend
significant time in compressing rootfs into a compressed initrd file.
After inserting [some bash timer
code](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/52313/how-to-get-execution-time-of-a-script-effectively#52347)
in
[900\_create\_initramfs.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c4754a35dc70fae8ad913f991ff8ea0051fefbf5/usr/share/rear/pack/GNU/Linux/900_create_initramfs.sh),
it seems that the creation of the 51M file takes 9 seconds.

> fast compression  
> Created initrd.cgz with gzip fast compression (53040694 bytes) in 9

I'd wish support for the even faster lz4 codec, which seems understood
by the Arch Linux kernel by default according to:

    $ cat /etc/mkinitcpio.conf | grep COMPRESSION=
    #COMPRESSION="gzip"
    #COMPRESSION="bzip2"
    #COMPRESSION="lzma"
    #COMPRESSION="xz"
    #COMPRESSION="lzop"
    #COMPRESSION="lz4"

Apparently I did something wrong. The commit that was intended for a new
pull request was merged with my earlier pull request. I don't know (yet)
how to fix this. My uneducated guess is that I need to make a git branch
somewhere in the process.

Note: with REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="lz4" the 64M initrd file creation
is now done in 4 till 5 seconds:

    Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd initrd.lz4 with lz4 compression
    Created initrd.lz4 with lz4 compression (66863824 bytes) in 4 seconds
    ...
    Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd initrd.lz4 with lz4 compression
    Created initrd.lz4 with lz4 compression (66864362 bytes) in 5 seconds

I can't test whether it boots correctly because I have an issue with:

@ProBackup-nl  
the way how I do GitHub pull requests is basically  
(on my local git copy):

<pre>
$ git checkout master

$ git checkout -b implement_new_lz4_initrd_compression_issue1218
Switched to a new branch 'implement_new_lz4_initrd_compression_issue1218'

code hacking

$ git commit -am "implemented new lz4 initrd compression (issue 1218)"

$ git push origin implement_new_lz4_initrd_compression_issue1218
</pre>

Now my new branch  
'implement\_new\_lz4\_initrd\_compression\_issue1218'  
exists on GitHub.  
Then I use the GitHub web interface  
to create a new pull request from that new branch  
'implement\_new\_lz4\_initrd\_compression\_issue1218'  
to the current ReaR upstream repository.

In general see

@ProBackup-nl  
assume you created a new pull request from your branch  
and now I request changes, then you can push more commits  
to that same branch and all your commits get automatically  
included in your existing pull request of that branch, e.g.:  
(on yor local git copy):

<pre>
$ git checkout master

$ git checkout implement_new_lz4_initrd_compression_issue1218
Switched to branch 'implement_new_lz4_initrd_compression_issue1218'

further code hacking

$ git commit -am "improved lz4 initrd compression (issue 1218)"

$ git push origin implement_new_lz4_initrd_compression_issue1218
</pre>

There is a bug in the code for this lz4 initramfs feature. When the
initramfs of Arch Linux itself is build using `mkinitcpio` using lz4
compression, the kernel will boot ok.  
REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="fast" boots OK too.  
REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION="lz4" results in error:

    initramfs unpacking failed: junk in compressed archive

@jsmeix Should this issue be re-opened or a new issue created?

Adding Linux legacy `-l` to lz4 results
=======================================

-   Size increased from 66864362 to 66871053: negligible factor 1.0001
-   Estimated extraction time reduced from 3.503s to 0.239s: 14.6 times
    faster
-   Creating the compressed initramfs file is still in the 4-5 seconds
    range
-   The lsinitcpio "ERROR: Newer lz4 stream format detected! This may
    not boot!" is gone

The strange thing here is that Arch Linux on the source system boots
even with an `lz4 -9` compressed initrd file. No need for `lz4 -l` on
the source system.

@ProBackup-nl  
regardless that I am not at all a Linux booting expert  
here an offhanded vague idea regarding why  
an lz4 -9 compressed initrd file works on the original system  
but not in the ReaR recovery system:

As far as I understand it  
it is the kernel that uncompresses the initrd  
and the kernel must do that on its own "as is"  
without any additional stuff like kernel modules  
because as long as the contents of the initrd are not  
accessible, the kernel cannot load a module.

Because the ReaR recovery system uses the exact same kernel  
as the original system (provided the KERNEL\_FILE value is really  
the kernel that runs in the original system - check that if several  
kernel files exist in /boot/) the difference that lets it fail versus  
that makes it work cannot be in the kernel.

Because at the time when the kernel uncompresses the initrd  
there is only the kernel and the initrd, the difference  
that lets it fail versus that makes it work  
must be in the initrd of the original system  
versus the initrd of the ReaR recovery system.

That the difference must be in the initrds matches the fact  
that the initrd of the original system is created differently  
compared to the initrd of the ReaR recovery system.

A colleague told me that he thinks to remember in the past  
for special initrd compressions one had to do special  
additional stuff with the initrd to ensure the kernel  
could later successfuly uncompress it - he was vaguely  
talking about manually adjusting magic numbers at the  
beginning of the initrd to help the kernel to correctly  
autodetect the actual initrd compression or things like that.
