##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#3349

-   How was this pull request tested? manually

-   Description of the changes in this pull request: `grubby` and
    `grub2-editenv` were added by PR \#3349 into the
    `conf/GNU/Linux.conf` file in the `PROGS` section. However, it seems
    proper to move these 2 programs to the
    `prep/GNU/Linux/300_include_grub_tools.sh` script.

According to

    git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/300_include_grub_tools.sh

but I do not understand the reason WHY it exists.

I also don't think it should be described as `feat:` or **Enhancement**,
as the change is not user-visible, isn't **Cleanup** more appropriate?

If there are no further objections I would like to merge the PR
tomorrow?

@gdha please remove the last commit - it is totally unrelated to the PR
topic.

By the way, please change the Type: in the template.
