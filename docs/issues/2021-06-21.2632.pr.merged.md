##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2612, \#2577

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Against CentOS 7:

    1.  full backup and restore using rsync over ssh
    2.  added nonsensical rsync option
        `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( -M--nonsense )`, verified that ReaR
        aborts mkbackup instead of displaying a warning message and
        continuing
    3.  added nonsensical rsync option
        `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( -M--nonsense )` in the rescue system,
        verified that ReaR displays a prominent warning during mkrescue
        before continuing and aborting later at a different place
    4.  added `BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK=1` and a nonsensical rsync option
        `BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( -M--nonsense )` in the rescue system,
        verified that ReaR displays a rsync error and aborts during
        mkrescue instead of continuing and aborting later at a different
        place

    Against CentOS 8:  
    full backup and restore using rsync over ssh

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Cleanups of rsync code to use better variable names and local
    variables, stop using `StopIfError`, use better redirections etc.  
    Fix a problem with rsync error detection that caused rsync errors
    during backup restore to be ignored (fixes \#2612). Now a warning is
    displayed and if `BACKUP_INTEGRITY_CHECK` is true, it is elevated to
    an error and ReaR aborts.  
    Detect errors during rsync backup: they were reported only as
    warnings, which is risky, because if nobody reads them, one could
    easily end up with a broken backup (therefore impact High).

Note: this intentionally reverts commit
3548430302cef3a8445de970eb763da33d9f6e8e of PR \#2011. I found that the
intent of the commit was wrong and the code was not correct.
