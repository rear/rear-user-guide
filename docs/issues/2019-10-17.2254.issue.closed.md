On an internal SUSE mailing list I learned about the following  
change in the kernel:

[https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=157013477505405&w=2](https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=157013477505405&w=2)  
that reads (excerpts)

    Beginning with kernel 5.3 the order in which SCSI devices
    are probed and named has become non-deterministic.
    This is a result of a patch that was submitted to add
    asynchronous device probing (specifically, commit
    f049cf1a7b6737c75884247c3f6383ef104d255a).
    Previously, devices would always be probed in the order
    in which they exist on the bus, resulting in the first device
    being named 'sda', the second device 'sdb', and so on.

An explanation what that is  
(except from an SUSE internal mail - a bit modified by me here):

    Controllers could be probed in parallel
    but the devices would still appear in the same order
    on a per-controller basis.
    If there was only one controller, they'd be predictable
    as long as new devices weren't added in the middle.

    Now the probing happens asynchronously on a per-device basis,
    so even devices on a single bus can appear in "random" order.

    The only stable configuration now is one with a single disk.

    That's a change in behavior that,
    even though ... documented as unpredictable,
    has been very much predictable for years.

This means when before `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` were  
on the same controller (or bus) their naming was stable  
but beginning with kernel 5.3 their naming is random.

Because in general kenel device names are unstable  
since a long time, ReaR must get rid of using kenel device names  
in particular in disklayout.conf and use better methods instead.

I think it becomes more and more a need  
to completely overhaul the whole disk layout recreation code  
to make it sufficiently up to date and ideally more future proof,

Something related:

It seems
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1958](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1958)  
is at least somehow related because in general  
it should not matter which of the possible names  
for one same block device is used.

E.g. on my workstation I have 9 additional (alias/link) names  
for my root partition `/dev/sda2`

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT /dev/sda
    NAME        KNAME     PKNAME   TRAN   TYPE FSTYPE   SIZE MOUNTPOINT
    /dev/sda    /dev/sda           sata   disk        931.5G 
    |-/dev/sda1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda        part vfat     500M /boot/efi
    |-/dev/sda2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda        part ext4   915.5G /
    `-/dev/sda3 /dev/sda3 /dev/sda        part swap    15.6G [SWAP]

    # find /dev/disk/by-* -ls | grep -o '/dev/disk/by-.*/sda2'
    /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x50014ee2b71cd724-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_WDC_WD10EZEX-75M_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-350014ee2b71cd724-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-1ATA_WDC_WD10EZEX-75M2NA0_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0ATA_WDC_WD10EZEX-75M_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD10EZEX-75M2NA0_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-partuuid/a55fd91f-6714-47a4-983a-e7b6f50fb9aa -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-ata-1-part2 -> ../../sda2
    /dev/disk/by-uuid/aed8d81b-29bf-405e-9049-29a6c0e702d3 -> ../../sda2

Ideally it should be possible to use anywhere any of the names

    /dev/sda2
    /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x50014ee2b71cd724-part2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_WDC_WD10EZEX-75M_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-350014ee2b71cd724-part2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-1ATA_WDC_WD10EZEX-75M2NA0_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2
    /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0ATA_WDC_WD10EZEX-75M_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2
    /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD10EZEX-75M2NA0_WD-WCC3F1AEYTNS-part2
    /dev/disk/by-partuuid/a55fd91f-6714-47a4-983a-e7b6f50fb9aa
    /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-ata-1-part2
    /dev/disk/by-uuid/aed8d81b-29bf-405e-9049-29a6c0e702d3

and things should "just work".

So an immediate offhanded (and totally untested) idea is  
to implement a generic function named something like

    get_kernel_block_device_name()

that outputs the kernel block device name (`/dev/sda2` in the above
example)  
for any of its existing names, e.g.

    get_kernel_block_device_name /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-ata-1-part2

would output `/dev/sda2` and in particular

    get_kernel_block_device_name /dev/sda2

would also output `/dev/sda2`.

So the idea behind is to still use the kernel block device name  
as the ultimate value that is finally used when calling commands  
because the kernel block device name is the only one that must exist  
but it should not matter when another compatible name for that thingy  
is used elsewhere for example in config files.
