Please test if it works for you when you use  
our current ReaR GitHub master code.

See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how you can try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
without conflicts with your already installed ReaR version.

In general I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code  
because the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things  
and if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

Hello, I suspect this is a duplicate of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)
that should be fixed by \#2675
