This is a way to do an automatic recover.

@Florent38 This looks fine by me. Beware though that at this time USB
syslinux and isolinux use different logic (and therefor have this
configured in their own scripts). You may want to update both to make it
work in both cases, see *30\_create\_extlinux.sh* !

There was the intention to merge both pieces of work at one point, but
it did not happen. Can't remember why :-/

@Florent38 Also, what happens after the recovery completes ? Do you get
a login-prompt, or the shell-prompt ? It could be useful to check the
return-code of rear and provide some guidance to what should happen
next.

E.g. if the recovery ended succesfully, note that a reboot is required
(or maybe some checks can be performed on the prompt). If the return
code is non-zero, provide some information one how to continue (or maybe
the error output is already clear enough and a shell prompt is ok).

When the recovery completes, I test the return code of ReaR : 0 -&gt;
reboot, others start a tty without the welcome text ("Welcome to
Relax... Run rear recover to restore your system").

I will now work on the usb support.

@Florent38 I don't know if we want to reboot by default. Maybe we would
like to offer the user to make some checks before rebooting (especially
in case there are known problems with e.g. GRUB installation). Maybe
verify to see if there are any errors in the log. So I would prefer a
message, rather than a mandatory/forced reboot.

Another option is to provide a menu (like the other menus inside
Relax-and-Recover) to offer to look at the log-file, go into a shell, or
reboot. I prefer the second, but leave it up to you ;-) The automatic
recover is a good addition though !

I add a menu with 3 options (log, Shell, and reboot) ;)
