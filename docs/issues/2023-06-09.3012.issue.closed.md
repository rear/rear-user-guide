-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

There are two problems with the initial `rear recover` menu that I've
become aware of in my testing of rear's support for md RAID.

It would seem to me that rear doesn't support (auto)resizing of md RAID
arrays? In that case `rear recover` shouldn't offer the user the
"Confirm disk mapping and continue rear recover" option (which I think
should be renamed to "Confirm disk mapping and configure recovery
options." as discussed in my previous ticket) in the first
`rear recover` menu if the rear image uses RAID because it will fail
with the error
`Cannot autoresize RAID /dev/md0 (autoresizing is not supported for RAID level 'raid 10')`.
I have attached a log of it failing to get beyond the first
`rear recover` menu because of this.

The other problem is that when `rear recover` is run in debug mode
(`rear -D recover`) the "Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed
without manual configuration" that does usually work (in non debug mode)
is supposedly unavailable, option 2 being labelled "n/a". If I quit rear
after running it in debug mode and run it without the debug option,
option \#2 remains n/a. The option reappears after a reboot, if run
without debug mode.
