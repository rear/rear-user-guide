-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RedHatEnterpriseServer 7

Please consider to make verbose mode as a default behavior.  
Maybe some --quiet option could be there for non verbose output.

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/929](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/929)

The non-verbose mode is intentionally  
since version 1.11.0  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/929\#issuecomment-233609454](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/929#issuecomment-233609454)

But I don't know the reasoning behind why  
it is silent by default.

I guess it is "traditional UNIX style" where  
commands are by default non-verbose.
