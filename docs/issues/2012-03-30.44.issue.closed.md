Currently SELinux is disable for backup and we **have** to fix this.

-   Avoid disabling selinux during backup
    -   add `--selinux` option to tar and testing
    -   `rsync -X` option tests required

-   reminder for myself - should publish the results of my tests done
    last year

I have the SELinux policy set on Enforce and I don't have any
problems.  
The only thing i need to do after the backup (from DP) is restored is  
cd /mnt/local  
touch .autorelabel

Then i reboot...

If I understand the issue correctly, you loose any SELinux contexts that
have manually been modified because neither rsync, nor tar are actually
backing up the additional SELinux metadata. I don't know whether
DataProtector does it, but since you state you have to force
autorelabeling, I doubt DP is doing this correctly either. And you
effectively lost any manual modifications.

It is possible DP does not have SELinux support (or extended
attributes). Maybe we should make the original report a bit more clear
to what is affected and to what extent.

I don't have any real experience with SELinux, I know that it is a
security thingie that is usually enabled by default.  
When I first tested REAR is couldn't get the recovered machine to work
after the reboot.  
I then found that I had to relabel the files to get the recovered system
to work.  
I don't have manually modified anything concerning SELinux so that's why
the force autorelabel is no problem for me.

Not having to do the relabel would be great off course..

@bleyers Don't get me wrong, I value your input. For one it helps us to
clarify what we still need to do, and in some cases (maybe DP ?) we may
as well have to let Rear automatically relabel the filesystem(s) in
order to make it boot. So any feedback to our tickets helps us stay on
track and clarify what is needed (until someone comes around and
implements it ;-))

Relabeling my filesystem took more than 10 minutes, and any custom
labels would have been lost. So this issue need to be fixed if we want
to have fast and seamless restores with SELinux.

Due to time pressure (for new release) and lack of interest of the
community we push this feature forward.
