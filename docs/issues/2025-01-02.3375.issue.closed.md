    **When updating ReaR on OpenSUSE from rear-2.7-2.x86\_64 to
    rear-2.8-3.x86\_64 it fails with:**

> warning: /etc/rear/local.conf created as /etc/rear/local.conf.rpmnew

-   Workaround, if any:  
    I fixed it by
    `sudo mv /usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run /usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run.old`
    but I wanted to let you know about this bug.

I have also hit the same issue when packaging ReaR 2.8 for Fedora. It is
caused by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b838a352136811900511a209d06c809ce552e636](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b838a352136811900511a209d06c809ce552e636)
and according to Fedora packaging docs must be solved on the specfile
level:

Issue is identical on a RHEL 7.9 system when I try to update/install
ReaR 2.8. Error retrieved with `yum install`...:


    Transaction check error:
      file /usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run from install of rear-2.8-3.el7.x86_64 conflicts with file from package rear-2.7-2.el7.x86_64

    Error Summary
    -------------

Edit: Applying the workaround of @thomasmerz is solving the error on my
system as well.

IMO this should be solved in the sources, as otherwise all RPM-using
distributions will have to solve the same problem. Of course we would
then have to invent another solution to the problem that was solved by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b838a352136811900511a209d06c809ce552e636](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b838a352136811900511a209d06c809ce552e636)

Because the root cause is "a known limitation with RPM", cf.  
[https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Directory\_Replacement/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Directory_Replacement/)  
I think it should be fixed in RPM packaging  
(i.e. where the root cause is)  
and not in the ReaR sources  
where we would have to do a ReaR 2.8.1 release  
(I myself won't do the actual ReaR 2.8.1 release process)  
and then all RPM-using distributions would have to  
upgrade from ReaR 2.8 to ReaR 2.8.1 which is probably  
not less work than fixing the existing ReaR 2.8 RPM packaging.

I have a fix almost ready - it installs the problematic symlink inside a
tarball.

@jsmeix I think it is easier for all the distros to pick the new sources
than to apply a fix to their spec file more or less independently
(assuming that distros generally do not use the upstream spec).  
Moreover a "fix" in RPM packaging is more a workaround than a real fix,
because a package downgrade will still be broken (a similar workaround
would have to be applied to the old version back in time), which seems
not ideal to me if the problem is solvable in any other way.

I can do a 2.8.1 release if we agree on it.
