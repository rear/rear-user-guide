Here's a sample of my configs:

local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///test
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4400

default.conf:

    /* all default values with the following exception */
    ISO_DIR=/temp

The issue I'm reporting is that when you define OUTPUT\_URL to a local
directory - for example /test - rear creates an ISO file at /test but
also creates a subdirectory called localhost. Within /test/localhost is
the same ISO file found at /test along with the logfile and text
documents. This behavior is correct based on the current rear settings
but could cause issues if the ISOs are large and there is limited disk
space.

What I'm trying to achieve is create an ISO backup on the local disk and
then manually export this later, but eliminate the redundant ISO created
on the local disk. It appears that ISO\_DIR should be able to be defined
as a blank value - and thus ignored by rear - so that the only local
backup is created at the OUTPUT\_URL defined location.

I have also tried to define OUTPUT\_URL as nfs and point it to an
unknown/unreachable IP address, hoping that rear would create the local
copy based on the ISO\_DIR declaration and then simply ignore the
external copy since it can't route to that IP address, but unfortunately
this causes rear to fault and terminate.

@ctwombly what we could do it when `OUTPUT_URL=file:///dir` is move the
ISO image from `/var/lib/rear/output/rear-$(hostname).iso` to `/dir`
instead of copy it (this way we only have 1 copy instead of 2 copies on
the local system)? Would that work?

Sorry I overlooked the previous email in September. Your proposed
solution  
sounds easy and effective. Thanks for your time and efforts!
