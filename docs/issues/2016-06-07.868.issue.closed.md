Is there a way to specify `restorejob` name via the
`restore/BAREOS/default/40_restore_backup.sh` script?

@aussendorf Hi Maik - see the topic - is this something that we are
currently missing in the restore code or is it something I missed in the
configuration of the setup with bareos?

I guess that case is not handled by rear / Bareos now. Most people just
have a unique restore-job, then bconsole auto-selects that one.

So we need an optional configuration directive like RESTORE\_JOB, then
the bconsole-call needs to be extended by "restorejob=$RESTORE\_JOB", if
that variable is defined.

@aussendorf Indeed I thought so too, but wanted to be sure that it was
not my lack of knowledge of bareos ;-)

Does BACULA need this fix as well? Cc @yontalcar

Sorry, I see now that the problem was in the automatic recovery mode,
which is not implemented for BACULA.
