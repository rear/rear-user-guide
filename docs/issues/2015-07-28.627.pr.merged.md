Hi,  
I've created the initial support for new ppc64 little endian platform,
ppc64le.

##### Supported OUTPUT=ISO / BACKUP=NETFS combination only so far

##### Tested platform (I tested simple LVM / single network/storage path configuration)

PowerVM: RHEL7.1 LE / Ubuntu 14.04.2 / Ubuntu 15.04  
PowerKVM : RHEL7.1LE / Ubuntu 14.04.2 / Uubntu 15.04

##### It includes the general fixes of REAR, I encountered in my test

-   usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh
    -   I got intermittent error in creating filesystem. Need to wait
        device creation with udevsettle
-   usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh
-   usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysinit.service
    -   Need to skip starting udevd in case of systemd-udevd
        environment.
    -   Also need to add dependency sysinit.service after
        systemd-udevd.service

For regression test of general fixes, I confirmed backup and recovery on
RHEL7.1 x86\_64 works correctly.  
Please review the code and let me know any comments.  
(I'm a newbie of github and rear, so please correct me if there are any
wrong parts of github usage and rear coding convention)

@mmitsugi I don't see how the code is specific to RHEL or Ubuntu

@k0da thank you for your comment.  
I just only tested on RHEL and Ubuntu so far, not SLES..  
I believe SLES 12 LE might work without any fix or small fix.  
Once I test the code with SLES 12 LE, I will inform the support of SLES
12 LE.  
Or, if you already have SLES 12 LE environment, it would be helpful to
test it..

@mmitsugi @k0da Ok - I'll commit the pull request - still need to
perform some tests myself it does not break any other code

@mmitsugi I mean, the commit is not about distro suport, not even about
endianess. But about bringing grub2 on power support.

Yes I'm already testing it on openSUSE Tumbleweed

@k0da Thank you for testing the SUSE part.  
Yes, most of my change is related to grub2 on power except the following
changes:

-   Add ppc64le conf for ppc64le platform
-   Exclude /lib\*/firmware from rescue for saving the size of initrd
-   Add hvc console settings to systemd getty service
-   General fixes I mentioned in the above comment
