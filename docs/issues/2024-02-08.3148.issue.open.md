Support for the SUSE specific 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' partitioning scheme  
(see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544)
what that is)  
should be dropped in ReaR because  
the SUSE specific patches for 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' in parted were  
removed in March 2016 for SLES12 SP2 so 'gpt\_sync\_mbr'  
is no longer supported by SUSE since 2016.

This issue is triggered by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3145](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3145)  
therein in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3145\#discussion\_r1481388431](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3145#discussion_r1481388431)  
that reads (excerpt)

    I think you can safely ignore the 'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning.

    Details:

    I found https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/519107
    where the SUSE specific patches to parted were removed
    that implemented the 'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning.
    The comment therein (excerpt)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    clean-up regarding pMBR handling to sync with SLE12-SP*
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    indicates that the 'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning
    was no longer supported since some SLES12 service pack.

    Further investigation with the openSUSE build service
    tool 'osc' shows
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    # osc search parted | grep '^SUSE:SLE-12'
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP1:GA                       parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP1:Update                   parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:GA                       parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update                   parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:GA                       parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update                   parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP4:GA                       parted
    SUSE:SLE-12-SP4:Update                   parted
    SUSE:SLE-12:GA                           parted

    # osc cat SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:GA parted parted.changes

    - Drop (SUSE specific) support for hybrid pMBR (gpt_sync_mbr
      label) (fate#317849)
      - remove: parted-gpt-mbr-sync.patch
      - remove: libparted-ppc-prepboot-in-syncmbr.patch
      - refresh patches
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    SUSE:SLE-12-SP1:GA parted parted.changes does not contain that.

    So the SUSE specific patches for 'gpt_sync_mbr' were removed
    for SLES12 SP2.

    This means a SLES12 system that was installed with SLES12
    before SLES12 SP2 could have 'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning.
    Subsequent system upgrades to further service packs only
    upgrade RPM packages but leave the partitioning unchanged.
    I think that one can also upgrade from SLES12 to SLES15
    without new partitioning (i.e. without installing from scratch)
    so there could be even SLES15 systems with old inherited
    'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning.

    If issues appear in ReaR because of an old inherited
    'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning, it is SUSE's problem

Because there could be recent SLES15 systems  
with old inherited 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' partitioning  
users with such systems should get an obvious information  
that 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' support is deprecated in ReaR  
so we at ReaR upstream cas see if there are really  
users with old inherited 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' partitioning.

In particular I never again tested a system  
with 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' partitioning since the time  
when I had implemented basic support for it  
in November 2015 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681)

FYI  
and for the fun of it some "forensics":

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544\#issuecomment-120913214](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544#issuecomment-120913214)  
the root is  
[https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=220839](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220839)  
and according to its  
[https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=220839\#c42](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220839#c42)  
the SUSE specific 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' partitioning scheme  
was introduced in July 2008.

In November 2015 I implemented basic support for it in ReaR.

In March 2016 the SUSE patches for 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' were removed  
for SLES12 SP2 which was released in November 2016, cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE\_Linux\_Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise)

Now in February 2024 support for 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' in ReaR  
will get shown as deprecated via ErrorIfDeprecated.

Let's wait and see how long it will take until the last system  
with old inherited 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' partitioning has gone ;-)
