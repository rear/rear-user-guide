@jsmeix @gdha I'm not completely satisfied with this because we still
include too many binaries.  
I had a customer try including only the necessary binaries (the ones in
netbackup initscript + bprestore), but with that only, bprestore was
failing and I wasn't able to find out why, unfortunately.

@rmetrich  
from my point of view the final root cause of such kind of issues is
that  
we do not have sufficient contributors from third-party backup makers  
e.g. from Symantec NetBackup in this case here, cf.
