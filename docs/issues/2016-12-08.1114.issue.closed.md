Hi!  
I know that this error has been mentioned in another thread befor but
sadly the solutions didn't help me.  
I'm quite new with rear and am trying to creat the USB Stick, which is
not working. It's failing with the error above.

From log:

    2016-12-08 11:01:09 Copied kernel and initrd.cgz to rear/NOS-C10056279/20161208.1100

I have formated the stick with rear, as suggested in the documentation
with ext3.

As I said... I'm completly new with rear and hoping for any helpfull
adivce! Thank you!

Hi @Flummifloh ,

Can you try to edit
*usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh* and
add `sleep 2` before this code:

    usb_filesystem=$(grep -E "^($USB_DEVICE|$REAL_USB_DEVICE)\\s" /proc/mounts | cut -d' ' -f3 | tail -1)

so it looks like:

    sleep 2
    usb_filesystem=$(grep -E "^($USB_DEVICE|$REAL_USB_DEVICE)\\s" /proc/mounts | cut -d' ' -f3 | tail -1)

And rerun `rear mkbackup` ?

If it does not work please post content of */etc/rear/local.conf
/etc/rear/site.conf* and log from `rear -d -D mkrescue` (should be
located in /var/log/rear)

Thanks

V.

Hi and thanks for the fast reply

Sadly it didn't work.

Content of` local.conf`

### write the rescue initramfs to USB and update the USB bootloader

OUTPUT=USB

### create a backup using the internal NETFS method, using 'tar'

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

### write both rescue image and backup to the device labeled REAR-000

BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

I wasn't sure about the site.conf so I don't have it at the moment. Do I
need it fÃ¼r USB?

Maybe you can try to update your *local.conf* according
[documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-usb-device-with-backup-to-usb):

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

Log you've posted is far from being complete.  
Can you upload full version?

USB\_DEVICE instead of OUTPUT\_URL doesn't work either. I already tried
when readingthrough this:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/579](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/579)

For the log you are right... my fault! Please see attached

It should be working just fine, however it is not ...

Can you do following on NOS-C10056279:

    mkdir -p /mnt/rear_test
    mount /dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000 /mnt/rear_test
    cat /proc/mounts

And paste output here?

To do the clenaup:

    umount /mnt/rear_test
    rmdir /mnt/rear_test

Don't wonder... It's not sdf anymore because I had a restart.

That is exactly what I need to see :-)  
I need you to mount USB drive and post content of */proc/mounts* while
mounted ...

I'm a bit confused because... isn't it mounted? It's /dev/sdb1  
May I'm a bit dumb at the moment... too much thinking today ;-) But I'm

Lucky you that you only a bit confused :-)  
In the debug log I can see you have
*/home/support/rear-1.19/etc/rear/site.conf* with:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdf1

and */home/support/rear-1.19/etc/rear/local.conf* with:

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

Does it have any special purpose?  
Maybe you can post here content of all files from
*/home/support/rear-1.19/etc/rear/\*.conf*

Oh! That's an old configuration when trying different things yesterday.
There is no specialy purpose. Actually I thought I deleted the
site.conf!  
I don't mind asking stupid questions because that's a good way to learn
so... does the USB-device have to have a min. size?

You should be careful about things you put in ReaR configuration
directory (etc/rear) because once they have *\*.conf* suffix they might
be sourced during execution. I don't know if reusing configuration
options can be a problem, so I'd say that ReaR's behavior in such cases
is undefined ? ( @gdha @jsmeix and other ReaR elders have much better
overview about possible implications).  
What I would recommend you is to start with single configuration file in
etc/rear (local.conf is the one I like most) and try just a minimal
configuration listed above.

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

Then

1.  `rear --format <your_usb_device>`
2.  unplug and plug &lt;your\_usb\_device&gt; (this is not mandatory,
    but it helped to couple of times with some "strange" behavior
    (especially with systemd)
3.  rear mkbackup

Regarding minimal size of USB I think that there isn't any, you just
need device that is capable of storing backup or your OS.

For exact information what user config files  
ReaR sources see usr/sbin/rear therein  
in particular the code section regarding  
"All workflows need to read the configurations first"  
and therein in particular this piece of code

<pre>
# User configuration files, last thing is to overwrite variables if we are in the rescue system:
for config in site local rescue ; do
    test -r "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" && Source "$CONFIG_DIR/$config.conf" || true
done
</pre>

so that local.conf overwrites existing settings in site.conf.

@Flummifloh

In general regarding how to use the currently  
newest rear GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

@Flummifloh `syslinux` is version 3.71 (quite old) and do you have
`extlinux` installed? And, what is the size of your USB device? DO not
forget to format the USB device, but I guess that was performed as you
used `/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000` (or am I wrong)?

HI @ all  
Thanks again for the suggestions and help. I'm working at home today so
I have the possibility to test via NFS with my own server. It looks like
it's working fine! I have no idea why it's not working with the USB..
the only reason I think could be the size of the USB device, although it
has 30 GB. :/ It's a bit strange!

I assume it works because "no news is good news".
