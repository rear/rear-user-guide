Need to verify what RHEL says about this for their spec --&gt;
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing)  
Seems to be named as **GPLv3** (which is currently used in our spec
file).

FWIW:

I use my own rear.spec for the rear RPM in openSUSE at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear)  
which contains (excepts)

    %bcond_without  use_mkisofs
    ...
    %if %{with use_mkisofs}
    Requires:       %{_bindir}/mkisofs
    %else
    Requires:       %{_bindir}/genisoimage
    %endif

but I have no idea how this magic automatism works  
and to what extent it actually results what is needed.

I suggest to use RPM weak `Recommends` e.g. like

    Recommends: %{_bindir}/mkisofs
    Recommends: %{_bindir}/genisoimage

so that such issues do not cause hard errors  
while installing ReaR.

Using `Recommends` instead of hard `Requires`  
has the additional advantage that the user can  
even use ReaR without mkisofs or genisoimage,  
e.g. when he does not want to make an ISO image  
i.e. when he does not use `OUTPUT=ISO`.

Regading the `License` field and openSUSE's RPM checks:

What openSUSE's RPM checks complain about may depend  
on the openSUSE version (or other distribution version)  
where the package is built on.

On newer versions openSUSE's RPM checks may complain about this  
while on older versions openSUSE's RPM checks complain about that.

It may happen that it is impossible (in practice with reasonable
effort)  
to make a RPM spec file that works cleanly on older and newer  
distibutions.

@jsmeix I agree it would be a good idea to replace the `Requires` with
`Recommends` fields.

@gdha  
is that sufficient or are more such adaptions needed at other places  
e.g. also in the RPM spec files in the OBS packages?

@jsmeix it still does not build for SLES 15Sp1 due to the License error,
but as you mentioned, I don't have an idea yet how to circumvent this.

Hello @gdha

I had maybe similar issue with ebiso.  
I had to change .spec file as follows
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/home:gozora/ebiso?linkrev=base&rev=32](https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/home:gozora/ebiso?linkrev=base&rev=32)

@gozora  
thank you!

Hopefully done via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3e5632d933afc1dc3c343dfed8c8d658109182a8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3e5632d933afc1dc3c343dfed8c8d658109182a8)

Let's see when those OBS guardian scripts let things fail again...
