Dear REAR maintainers,

we have re-arranged the sesam integration into rear in a more sane way  
now, attached you can find the diffs against the current github  
repository, here are the explanations for the changes:

> Makefile | 6 +++---

a short patch to honor the DESTDIR variable during install-bin, so  
REAR can work from a random directory it has been installed to  
(make install DESTDIR=/tmp/installation/)

> usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf | 9 +++++++++

add the default COPY\_AS\_IS\_SESAM values to default.conf

> usr/share/rear/prep/SESAM/default/40\_prep\_sesam.sh | 63
> ++++++++++++++++++++

this will detect a possible SEP Sesam client installation on the system
and will include the sesam components needed to run a sesam client
within the boot image. As SEP Sesam users have the possibility to
either  
install via RPM packages or custom .tar.gz packages it makes no sense
to  
use standard values like tsm or bacula, because the installation paths  
are up to the user (with .tar.gz based SEP Client installation packages)

Auto detecting is done via /etc/sesam2000.ini which contains the paths  
in both cases.

> .../restore/SESAM/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh | 15 +++++

just a short note to the user how to proceed with the restore after  
disk layout has been done.

> .../SESAM/default/90\_create\_missing\_directories.sh | 9 +++

just a copy from the default workflow which helps here aswell.

> .../system-setup.d/59-start-sesam-client.sh

a short script to start the sesam client via init script during boot  
of the iso if it contains the sesam client.
