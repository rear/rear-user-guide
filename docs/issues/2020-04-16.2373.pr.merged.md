-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? on k8s worker nodes using Longhorn

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: To avoid file
    system traces in the disklayout.conf file we need to skip these
    pseudo-devices (build via iscsi). See
    [https://longhorn.io/](https://longhorn.io/) for more in-depth
    details about longhorn itself.
