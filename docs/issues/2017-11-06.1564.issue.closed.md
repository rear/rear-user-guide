#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover
    2.2-git.0.b7927e5.unknown.changed / 2017-10-31
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):
    Ubuntu/17.04/i386
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup
ISO_VOLID="REARISO"
OUTPUT_URL=file:///tmp
MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
</pre>

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? UEFI

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    The EFI Boot Manager cannot be installed when the system has a
    nvme  
    ssd, because the device name is resolved in /dev/nvme0n1p rather
    than  
    /dev/nvme0n1.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    In:  
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/630\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
    the following if statement:

<pre>
if [[ (! -b $Disk) && ( ${Disk/nvme//} != $Disk  ) && ( ${Disk%p} ) ]] ; then
    Disk=${Disk%p}
fi
</pre>

just after line 11 statement:

<pre>
Disk=$( echo ${Dev%$ParNr} ) # /dev/sda or  /dev/mapper/vol34_part or /dev/mapper/mpath99p
</pre>

can be used to check if a nvme device is in use and resolve the device
name correctly

I'm sorry,  
I don't think I can. Not at the moment, at least.  
I didn't get the script through git. I installed a .deb package and
modified the script on the spot.

No rush, take your time.  
If you've found something that can enhance ReaR, it is your right to
open PR and become an contributor.  
I can try to implement your thoughts into ReaR code, but I can't fully
test its functionality as I'm not the proud owner of any nvme device
:-(.

As workaround i added the code below in the file
`/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh`, after eMMC
trailing 'p' block:

    # For NVMe devices the trailing 'p' in the Disk value
    # (as in /dev/nvme0n1p that is derived from /dev/nvme0n1p1)
    # needs to be stripped (to get /dev/nvme0n1), otherwise the
    # efibootmgr call fails because of a wrong disk device name.
    # See also https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1564
    if [[ $Disk = *'/nvme'+([0-9])n+([0-9])p ]] ; then
        Disk=${Disk%p}
    fi

I successfully restored EFI bootloader on a Baremetal server + SSD
Samsung EVO NVMe disk.

I did not read about the details here but I just assume that  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2160](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2160)
merged  
this issue is sufficiently fixed so that I close it hereby.  
If not it can of course be reopened.
