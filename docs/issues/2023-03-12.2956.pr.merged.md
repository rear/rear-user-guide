-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Adds AuthToken generation & disk-unlocking feature into OpalPBA image.  
Nothing fancy atm, just encrypted tokens being stored on/read from plain
linux block device (e.g. USB drive, SDCard, etc)

Supports TPM2-assisted encryption, so tokens can be made pretty much
secure and tightly bound to device/boot environment.  
Supports 2FA authentication (additional password/pin to decrypt token)
with basic brute-force protection.  
Allows for unattended cold booting optionally restricted to
SecureBoot-active environment only.

@kernins  
thank you for your contribution to enhance ReaR!

For now I added only some comments what I spotted in general  
by a quick look at the code changes in this pull request.

I am not a TCG Opal disk user so I can  
neither check what the code does  
nor can verify how far it works.

The OPAL\_PBA code was implemented by @OliverO2  
Perhaps - as time permits - he may have a look here.

Thanks guys for all your comments & review  
I'll go through your suggestions more closely when the time allows

As of now I deployed this on both of my laptops (960Pro & 990Pro nvmes),
both working fine with USB & uSD (mmcblk) medias acting as AT

@kernins  
could you tell us when you are done with your code improvements  
so we know when you think this pull request is ready to be merged?  
No rush - take your time.

In general your code is OK when your code follows  
how the already existing code for Opalpba is implemented.

For the time being I'm done with this part

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it next Monday (27. March) afternoon  
unless there are objections.

@pcahyna  
if your time permits I would appreciate it  
if you could have just a quick look at the code.  
Perhaps you might spot something that is obviously  
a real problem where things could actually go wrong.

@kernins
