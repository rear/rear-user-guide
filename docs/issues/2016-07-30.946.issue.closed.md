Hello @jsmeix  
As discussed in couple of threads here related to **GRUB\_RESCUE**
functionality, I maybe found way how to check correct prefix (/boot or
/) for rear-initrd and rear-kernel.  
It looks to be rather simple. If you have **/boot** as separate
mountpoint, initrd and kernel uses **/** as prefix.  
If you don't have **/boot** separated (part of root (/)) initrd and
kernel will be prefixed with **/boot**. which is only logical if you
think of it :-)

Could you please test if this new modification is working for you, and
maybe check for some regression here and there ;-) ?  
I didn't create pull request for it yet as there are still couple of
things I need to think about.  
You can find draft
[here](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/fa965fef8bc47bbaff608e962ad72dcbcf187532).

P.S. I've found out that **GRUB\_RESCUE** does not work correctly on my
EFI Debian 8.4, as it looks like Debian uses /boot/grub/grub.cfg as
config file.  
So assumption in *94\_grub2\_rescue.sh (line 47)*:

    if is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER ; then
        # set to 1 means using UEFI
        grub_conf="$( dirname $UEFI_BOOTLOADER )/grub.cfg"
        ...

will not be that fortunate ..

Only a minor issue at first glance:

You had my

<pre>
echo "          echo 'Loading kernel $boot_kernel_file ...'"
...
echo "          echo 'Loading initrd $boot_initrd_file (may take a while) ...'"
</pre>

changed to

<pre>
echo "          echo 'Loading kernel $grub_rear_menu_entry_linux_value ...'"
...
echo "          echo 'Loading initrd $grub_rear_menu_entry_initrd_value (may take a while) ...'"
</pre>

I had intentionally not used the GRUB2 menue entry value  
for the message but the actual file name so that the message  
shows what actual file name GRUB 2 loads and not the  
meaningless GRUB2 internal menue entry value.

In other words:  
When GRUB 2 loads /boot/rear-kernel but the  
GRUB2 internal menue entry value is only /rear-kernel  
I want the message that is shown to the user to be

<pre>
Loading kernel /boot/rear-kernel ...
</pre>

because that is the actual files that is loaded  
and not

<pre>
Loading kernel /rear-kernel ...
</pre>

because actually there is no such file on the disk.

@jsmeix heh, this was the exact reason why I've changed it. I thought it
would be better to see what is grub actually loading instead of content
of /boot after system is up ...  
When you are in grub shell it is kind of different world.  
But no problem to to return it back to original.

Ah!

It seems - only a blind assumption for now - things  
start to make sense for me:

When /boot/ is on its own partition  
i.e. a filesystem on /dev/sdaN  
that will be under LInux mounted as /boot/  
then GRUB uses the filesystem on /dev/sdaN directly  
and in that filesystem there is no such thing as /boot/  
so that for GRUB the files are in '/' on that filesystem.

Now the question is what we like to tell the user  
with that GRUB message:  
The name of the file from GRUB's point of view  
(i.e. so that it is meaningful in the GRUB shell)  
or the name of the file from Linux' point of view  
(i.e. so that it is meaningful when Linux was booted).

I think I have to meditate on it...  
;-)

Regarding the find\_kernel\_initrd\_prefix() function:

I think when a function is only used in one single script  
I would prefer to keep such local things local.

Why not have directly in 94\_grub2\_rescue.sh

<pre>
local grub_boot_dir=$boot_dir
if mountpoint $boot_dir ; then
    # When /boot is on its own partition
    # i.e. a filesystem on /dev/sdaN
    # that will be under Linux mounted as /boot
    # then GRUB uses the filesystem on /dev/sdaN directly
    # and in that filesystem there is no such thing as /boot
    # so that for GRUB the files are in the root of that filesystem:
    grub_boot_dir=""
fi
grub_rear_menu_entry_linux_value=$grub_boot_dir/$kernel_name
grub_rear_menu_entry_initrd_value=$grub_boot_dir/$initrd_name
</pre>

FWIW:  
I think my variable names grub\_rear\_menu\_entry\_linux\_value  
and grub\_rear\_menu\_entry\_initrd\_value got too long (as a result  
of my ignorance of filenames from GRUB's point of view).  
Now - provided my above understanding is right - one could use  
proper names for them like grub\_kernel\_file and grub\_initrd\_file

Yes, or flip coin :-)

Ok, will make it local ...

Did you had time to do some testing? I'm just curious whether it works
for you as well ...

I did not yet test it  
and today I have to leave early.  
I think your changes are a good improvement  
so that you should do a pull request.  
I think I can test it tomorrow.

By the way:  
I noticed your '@\#$%\#$^$$%' - if I understand it correctly  
you also do not like Linux distribution specific deviations  
too much - and yes they are a maintenance nightmare!

Ok, I'll prepare it then ...

Yes, that "special" condition was there to make this work on Debian as
well. It will not be part of pull request (yet).

I'm working currently on some way how to identify UEFI/legacy boot +
boot loaders version + boot loader config files reliably, so we don't
have to guess any more.  
Aim is to get rid of code like this in the future:

    if [[ $OS_VENDOR = "Debian" ]]; then
             LogPrint "Debian special test case ..."
             grub_conf=$( readlink -f $boot_dir/grub/grub.cfg)
    fi

\#948 was created. For me it worked fine, but as always testing is more
than welcome...  
UEFI based systems (like my SLES12 SP1) do still need manual
intervention in grub shell to boot from this entry, mostly due secure
boot :-(. I'll try to address this later.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/948](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/948)
merged  
I consider this issue to be fixed.

UEFI issues should be handled in a separate issue.

@gozora  
as always many thanks for your valuable contribution!  
You helped me to understand a crucial part of GRUB

No problem.
