    All variables that are currently set in conf/GNU/Linux.conf
    are also set in conf/default.conf (some to empty values).
    ...
    In general I do not understand why some are set both
    in default.conf and additionally also in conf/GNU/Linux.conf.

    well back in 2006 @schlomo and @gdha were very optimistic
    that ReaR could also work on BSD style systems

    +1 for getting rid of GNU/Linux.conf (and similar)
    as ReaR in any case only works on Linux as of now.
    When somebody wants to support other OS
    they will reorganize the configuration as necessary.

I won't do that.  
I have no time for cleanup without an actual benefit for the user.  
I might do it when the current mess actually hurts us.
