Do not show experimental workflows in help workflow  
namely layoutonly and finalizeonly and let the  
help workflow exit with zero exit code, cf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1089\#issuecomment-266984698](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1089#issuecomment-266984698)

Additionally suppress some messages in usr/sbin/rear  
in case of the help workflow namely the verbose  
LogPrint whereto the log file gets copied  
"Saving $RUNTIME\_LOGFILE as $LOGFILE"  
and the final LogToSyslog.

After sleeping over it it still looks o.k. for me  
so that I will merge it soon of there are no objections.
