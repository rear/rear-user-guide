ReaR 2.7

When doing automatic restore vs Manual restore using the bootable ISO,
there is no output written to the screen to indicate some kind of
progress or status.

I've tested this via a straightforward rsync backup/restore, with the
manual steps, once you finish the network and disks, you can see the
rsyncing working, and then rear final steps of kernel & grub, with the
automated install, everything happens as expected, however, the only way
to know what happens is to login into the server via ssh and tail the
log file.

This is intended behavior or I am missing something here?

Thanks!

This is not normal but sounds like a console misconfiguration of the
rescue system.

Please kindly provide:

-   VM/hardware description
-   ReaR config
-   output of `rear dump`
-   logs of `mkrescue` and `recover` or screenshots / videos whatever
    you manage

and anything else that might help us to see something. Like this you
might agree that there is nothing for us to respond to...
