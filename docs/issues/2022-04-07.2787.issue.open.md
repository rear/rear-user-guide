#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    rear 2.6

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    RHEL8

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR):

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT"):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

It's related to the issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786)

To reproduce the issue, change the UUID of the UEFI partition:

disklayout.conf before the change:

    fs /dev/vda1 /boot/efi vfat uuid=ACC0-624F label= options=rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=winnt,errors=remount-ro

fstab before the change:

    UUID=ACC0-624F          /boot/efi               vfat    umask=0077,shortname=winnt 0 2

Then change the label:

    mlabel -N 12345678 -i /dev/vda1 ::

Then, the cron.d job (or new systemd job) will recreate the rescue iso
because the layout changed:

    30 1 * * * root test -f /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf && /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

New disklayout.conf:

    options=rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=winnt,errors=remount-ro

But the /etc/fstab file that will be used during the recover, and that
should be patched, is still the one in the backup, thus the old one with
old UUID.  
And the patch will fail ... (without a warning :D).  
And the system will not boot.

-   Workaround, if any:

A rescue ISO should not be built if the required data in the backup is
not updated also.

The recover of the system layout should rely on the data in the rescue
ISO and not on the backup.  
Thus all the files that should be patched to update the UUID should be
embedded in the rescue.

Thanks !

Problem summary as far as I see it:

What should ReaR do when UUIDs in restored files like /etc/fstab  
do not exist on the recreated system?

Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785\#issuecomment-1091773765](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785#issuecomment-1091773765)  
(excerpt):

    When the filesystems get recreated with the UUPDs from disklayout.conf
    old and new UUIDs are the same in FS_UUID_MAP (which is the usual case)
    so finalize/GNU/Linux/280_migrate_uuid_tags.sh won't change anything.

So the recreated UUIDs are normally consistent with what is in
disklayout.conf  
but they can be inconsistent with what there is in restored config
files.

So comparing UUIDs in disklayout.conf with the actually recreated
UUIDs  
(e.g. via FS\_UUID\_MAP) won't help to detect that inconsistency.

My immediate idea is a simple test as a start:  
When a actually recreated UUID does not appear in a config file  
it could indicate that something is fishy with this particular UUID  
or all is well because that kind of UUID is never used in a config file.

Whether or not there is a cron job doesn't actually matter here  
i.e. it doesn't matter how "rear mkrescue" got launched.

The issue is that there can be inconsistencies between  
what gets recreated according to disklayout.conf  
and what gets restored from the backup and  
currently ReaR cannot detect that because the current  
FS\_UUID\_MAP stuff only detects when there are inconsistencies  
between what is in disklayout.conf and what was actually recreated  
(i.e. different UUID recreated than what is in disklayout.conf) so  
**currently ReaR cannot migrate restored files from the backup**  
in most cases because nowadays filesystem UUIDs are normally  
successfully recreated with the UUIDs in disklayout.conf

If the backup is taken after `mkrescue`, one can detect the problem, by
running `checklayout` before taking the backup.  
But if the backup is taken before `mkrescue` (and that's the case of the
cron job that triggered the problem here), I don't see how to detect it
easily.

I got distracted by other things and now weekend is almost there...

My primary intent is not to let ReaR automatically fix such
inconsistencies  
but to only detect them which is what @bwelterl intends with his  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2786)

For internal backup methods we may run what `checklayout` does  
during `mkbackuponly` to avoid that an inconsistent backup  
is taken with `mkbackuponly` after `mkrescue`.

When an inconsistent backup is taken with an external backup method  
after `mkrescue` there is nothing we can do to detect or avoid that.

When an inconsistent backup was taken before `mkrescue`  
there is nothing we can do during `mkrescue` because we cannot know  
if a backup was taken before and what there is in the backup.

So all we have during `rear recover` is what there is in
disklayout.conf  
and what is actually recreated versus what there is in the restored
files.

So all what we can do after the backup was restored during
`rear recover`  
is to compare what there is in disklayout.conf and what is actually
recreated  
versus what there is in the restored files, cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787\#issuecomment-1091793474](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787#issuecomment-1091793474)

This are currently only offhanded ideas in my head.  
I will have to try out something and play around with it  
to get some better understanding how things really behave.

@pcahyna @bwelterl @rear/contributors  
I wish you all a relaxed and recovering weekend!

I think it is no bug in ReaR that things in the recovery system  
must be consistent with what there is in the backup.

In some cases we may avoid inconsistencies  
e.g. avoid that an inconsistent backup is taken with mkbackuponly after
mkrescue  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787\#issuecomment-1092853451](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787#issuecomment-1092853451)  
but I think in most cases we cannot do anything in ReaR to avoid  
inconsistencies between recovery system and what there is in the
backup  
so it is mostly up to the user to keep recovery system and backup in
sync.

I have been thinking about how to help the user to avoid such
inconsistencies.

We can advise the user to run `checklayout` before (and possibly after)
their external backup procedure to imitate what the internal backup
would do.

> When an inconsistent backup was taken before mkrescue  
> there is nothing we can do during mkrescue because we cannot know

This case is a more difficult one. It could be solved by saving the
layout at the time `mkbackuponly` is executed to some place under
`/var/lib/rear` and have a special variant of `checklayout` that would
check the current layout not against the layout saved by `mkrescue`
(under `/var/lib/rear/layout`) but against the layout saved by
`mkbackuponly`. In essence have two saved layouts, one by `mkrescue`,
the other by `mkbackuponly`, and when each of the two commands detect a
difference from the layout saved by the other command, it is an
inconsistency, thus abort.

Another option would be to embed some files in the rescue image:

> Rear is checking some files to update the UUID during the recovery,
> these files should be embedded in the rescue ISO.

and restore them from the rescue image instead of from the backup. This
of course opens a potential can of worms: one could then gradually embed
all the system in the rescue image, and we would not have a separate
backup anymore (that's the approach we don't want to take in general, I
suppose). But embedding only files that need to be edited in the
recovered system could be an acceptable and well-defined subset.

@pcahyna  
yes, we must make it very clear to the user that he is responsible  
to keep his backup in sync with his ReaR recovery system and  
that he can and should use "rear checklayout" to check it.

In general he should make an up-to-date backup  
when he made a new ReaR recovery system to be  
on the safe side or that he should in general make the  
backup and the ReaR recovery system at the same time  
in one single run to be on the safe side.

Simply put  
he should use "rear mkbackup" to be on the safe side  
or the equivalent for external backup tools i.e.  
"rear mkrescue && make a new external backup".

Some external backup methods are executed from ReaR : looking at
`usr/share/rear/backup`, that's at least `BORG`, `DUPLICITY`, `TSM`.
Although it depends on the choice of terminology: maybe you consider
backups that are triggered from inside ReaR internal and leave the term
"external" only for backups that are taken completely outside ReaR.

I used the term "external backup" in a sloppy way when I basically  
meant that the backup is made outside of ReaR.

Regarding TSM backup via "rear mkbackup":  
I guess this is not often used by TSM users.  
I think most TSM users use a native TSM method to make their backup.  
I assume most TSM users have TSM integrated in whatever bigger stuff  
so they do their backups via that bigger stuff (e.g. whatever backup  
management solution or something like that).  
So I think that in most cases a TSM backup is made outside of ReaR.  
But I am not a TSM user so this is only a guess and I could be wrong.

I think in customer solution, TSM is used to backup data, and rear the
system (what is expected), but then rear is using TSM also to save the
rear backup.  
I think there is no solution to restore an OS in TSM like rear.

Sure, but the question was, is the TSM backup of system files made by
invoking `rear mkbackup(only)`, or outside of ReaR's control?

> then rear is using TSM also to save the rear backup

Now I don't understand what you mean, is TSM used to save the recovery
media (ISO image)? Or what is "the rear backup" in this context, do you
mean the backup of system files?

I am not a TSM user either, so I am interested in @bwelterl 's (or
@rmetrich 's) opinion, in case they know some representative sample of
ReaR + TSM users. Is the above true? As a counterexample, issue \#2762
is from a user who found that he needed to modify
`usr/share/rear/backup/TSM/default/500_make_TSM_backup.sh`, so
presumably he is using ReaR to take TSM backup.

@xslima00 is my understanding correct that you take TSM backups of the
system by running `rear mkbackup` or `rear mkbackuponly` ?

@pcahyna

Hello,

TSM backups can be triggered by Rear or outside of Rear control. In both
cases is backup incremental. So in case it´s triggered outside and
`rear mkbackup` in next hour (we use it like this) it will simply build
backup ISO and another incremental backup which finish within seconds
(just new ISO is uploaded to TSM server and very few files). Problem of
standalone TSM backup is you cannot boot from it. That´s why we use
Rear. In case of crash TSM admin restore ISO to some location, I will
boot from it and make rear restore (via TSM client).

[issue 2762](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2762) - in standard
situation there is no need to modify scripts. But we want to backup TSM
server itself to another TSM server. That´s why was necessary perform
workaround I described to force TSM client backup to correct server.

beween  
basic system files in the backup and what is stored in the recovery
system  
i.e. detect inconsistencies early between "rear mkrescue" and "rear

and not detect inconsistencies (possibly too) late during "rear

I believe we should leave this issue open. \#2795 introduces detection
of inconsistency at recovery time, when it is a bit too late. The proper
fix would be to avoid inconsistency before it bites, by detecting it
during `mkrescue` & `mkbackuponly` and ideally introducing a
`savelayout`-like command that one could use for consistency enforcement
when an external backup method is used instead of `mkbackuponly`.  
EDIT: which is basically what you wrote.

    Created disk layout (check the results in /var/tmp/rear.sbMwPY4tMjELAQ0/tmp/backuplayout.conf)
    Running 'backup' stage ======================
    ...

so it creates a current disk layout in .../tmp/backuplayout.conf  
because of

    DISKLAYOUT_FILE=$TMP_DIR/backuplayout.conf

in lib/mkbackuponly-workflow.sh  
but as far as I see on first glance it does not compare  
the current disk layout in .../tmp/backuplayout.conf  
with an existing disk layout in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

I have no idea why "rear mkbackuponly" creates a disk layout at all  
but when it creates one anew which does not match an existing one  
in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf it indicates that something  
is wrong so "rear mkbackuponly" may error out to be on the safe side.

In my case both are same except comments with dates:

I believe this is needed to determine what gets included/excluded in the
backup.

yes, this is a good idea and probably easy to do. Doing the opposite
(detecting at `mkrescue` time if we are consistent with what we saved
during `mkbackuponly`) is more difficult. I outlined a possible approach
above:

The fact that `mkbackuponly` saves the layout under `$TMP_DIR` makes it
easier (we need to let it save to a persistent location and extend it).
