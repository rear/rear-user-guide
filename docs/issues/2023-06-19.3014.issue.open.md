@lzaoral and @antonvoznia have created a fully automated test that
performs a backup, boots in to the rescue environment, recovers the
system, and reboots into the recovered system. The test can be triggered
on all pull requests, using Packit (the service that currently merely
rebuilds RPMs).

The test scripts are currently in @antonvoznia's repository:
[https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear-testing](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear-testing)
. I would like to enable the tests on the main ReaR repository and run
them on all PRs. The test structure is such that the scripts are assumed
to be in a separate repository and in the main repository itself there
is merely a some configuration (test plan) that describes which tests to
run. If we are to keep the structure, we should import the scripts into
a repository under our organization (if we run them by default, they
should be under our control and not in some private repo).

We then need to choose a name for the test repository. `rear-testing` or
`rear-tests` or whatever seems to me a bit too generic - one may have
different kinds of tests (there is already a `tests` subdirectory with
different tests, although they are not much used AFAICT). The
distinctive feature of the new tests is that they are described using
the TMT (Test Management Tool,
[https://github.com/teemtee/tmt](https://github.com/teemtee/tmt) )
metadata. For this reason, I would like to call the new repository
`rear-tmt-tests` or similar. If tests written using a different
framework appear, they would go into a different repo to keep things
organized.

Thoughts?

If there are no objections, I would like to import and enable the new
test quite soon - in a week or so.

If anyone is interested in technical details of this test, it is
described in @antonvoznia 's diploma thesis -
[https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/107238](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/107238)
, which has already resulted in our ShellCheck configuration ( \#2976 ).

@pcahyna  
Thank You!  
An automatic backup and restore test is very much needed.  
I have no objections to import and enable the new test soon.

As far as I read in  
[https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/107238/F3-DP-2023-Voznia-Anton-dip\_thesis-2.pdf](https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/107238/F3-DP-2023-Voznia-Anton-dip_thesis-2.pdf)  
"Chapter 4 ReaR testing in infrastructure"  
the code (in particular all those 'rl...' functions) in  
[https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear-testing](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear-testing)  
seem to be from  
[https://github.com/beakerlib](https://github.com/beakerlib)  
but - at least at first glance - I don't find documentation there  
so currently for me this is mostly a "black box"  
where I cannot review anything.

I have a question:  
At least at first glance I could not find how the original system  
and the replacement system are configured?  
I mean in particular  
how to specify the storage layout on the original system  
and the disks with their sizes on the replacement system  
so that we could test recovery of various storage layouts  
on various more or less identical replacement systems.

Yes, Beakerlib is the test framework used by the test script.
Documentation is here:
[https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib/wiki/man](https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib/wiki/man)

This would be part of the hardware requirements, i.e. one would request
a machine with e.g. multiple disks using the test metadata. One then
could also add some storage preparation steps before the test itself,
e.g. to create another Volume Group and filesystems on the additional
disks. Unfortunately, support for additional hardware in the public
infrastructure used to run the tests (Testing Farm) is little or
nonexistent, but I am confident it will improve. So far, the
configuration is very basic - only one disk, I think it even lacks LVM.

Providing a different replacement system to test stuff like migration
mode is an intriguing idea. So far I have not attempted anything like
that, because the original machine is used also as the machine to be
recovered. Doing this would basically require reserving two machines,
with access to some shared storage for the backup.

It is perfectly right to start with what is currently available  
(i.e. a simple system with recovery on the original machine)  
and later try to enhance things step by step  
as far as possible with reasonable effort.

Ah!  
Nowadays documentation may no longer be in 'doc' but in 'wiki' :-)

Strange:  
I cannot find a link to  
[https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib/wiki/man](https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib/wiki/man)  
anywhere on  
[https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib](https://github.com/beakerlib/beakerlib)  
Am I blind?

Strange indeed. Since I have Beakerlib installed, I just type
`man beakerlib` when I need to read the manual page - it has also the
link to the online version. I suspect this is the case for most
beakerlib users and that's why they have not cared so much about
accessibility of the online docs.  
@sopos would there be a place for a link to the docs somewhere where it
would be easy to discover, please?

Right, there's no link from the README.md, there's a "tab" Wiki on the
top, however. Moreover, we are in process of moving it to the
*readthedocs* so I plan to make some updates including links, anyway.

By the way:  
there is already a repository for integration tests,
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests).
its description reads: "The purpose of this project is to create Ansible
playbooks to perform automated backup and restore tests for different
Linux distributions." The purpose seems similar to what we are doing,
but the approach is very different - these tests use a VM that they
create, spawn and control from outside. It is all written as an Ansible
playbook:
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/blob/master/os/centos7.yml](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/blob/master/os/centos7.yml)
. This approach is more flexible, but is not suitable for automated
testing in CI, because the machines that we get from available CI
infrastructures do not support virtualization ( although this may
change,
[https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/183](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/183)
), so one can not spawn and control a test VM this way.  
The repository also has tests written in Beakerlib by my colleagues
(similarly to the proposed backup and restore test) in the "tests"
directory
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/tree/master/tests](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/tree/master/tests),
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/pull/2](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/pull/2)
. The tests do not seem to have anything to do with the original scope
of the repository (they are pure backup tests, not full backup and
recovery) and are not integrated with the Ansible playbooks in any way.

Given that there is already a repository that contains Beakerlib tests,
maybe I should import the new test there, rather than creating a new
repository? In the future this would allow us to enable the other
Beakerlib tests under
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/tree/master/tests](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/tree/master/tests)
quite easily if we find them valuable.
