CrowdStrike Falcon could make "rear recover" fail

I noticed a SUSE internal issue where a customer reports that  
running CrowdStrike Falcon (used as AV solution) results  
that "rear mkrescue" created a ReaR recovery system ISO  
but with that ISO "rear recover" failed to recreate the system.

After disabling the AV the ISO is working as intended.

So running CrowdStrike Falcon somehow conflicts with ReaR.

I don't know any more details.  
I neither know how "rear recover" failed  
nor how CrowdStrike Falcon conflicts with ReaR.

I report it only FYI  
that running CrowdStrike Falcon could be a reason  
for whatever failures during "rear recover".

I got a "rear mkbackup" log file from this customer case  
with a short text what had happened:

    Here is a rear log claiming to successfully create the recovery image,
    but the iso is not usable. The logs complains about not being able
    to umount the tmp rear working path due to be still in use.
    Once falcon agent is disabled, this error shows no more
    and the resulting iso is valid.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908)  
for OUTPUT=ISO  
and also for OUTPUT=USB the same kind of issue is known as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3397)  
where both should be fixed by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408)

For some background summary what I think about it see

As far as I can see currently I think that failed umount  
is not related to a CrowdStrike Falcon conflict with ReaR  
because I fail to see how that failed umount could  
make the ISO unusable.

What I could imagine how a running CrowdStrike Falcon  
could make the ISO unusable is that perhaps  
CrowdStrike is accessing the files of the ISO  
e.g. for virus scanning or whatever things and perhaps  
CrowdStrike may even somehow modify files of the ISO  
e.g. to protect against (possibly falsely) detected  
viruses in the files of the ISO or things like that.

From my current point of view the issue seems to be  
a support question how to deal with CrowdStrike Falcon  
when ReaR should be used because I think we should not  
even try to work around or against CrowdStrike Falcon in ReaR.  
In particular not because - as far as I know - CrowdStrike Falcon  
works basically on kernel level (via some special additional  
CrowdStrike Falcon kernel modules - as far as I know)  
so CrowdStrike Falcon's realm shoud be treated sacrosanct  
for user programs (even if running as 'root' as ReaR does).

Set "Dedicated Priority Support" by me for SUSE as long as  
the SUSE internal issue for a SUSE customer is moving forward.

Maybe a timing problem? ReaR tries to umount and remove the `vfat` image
before the Crowdstrike Falcon agent finishes examining it, so that the
agent accessing it prevents the `umount` from going through?

Didn't we once have a `fuser` or `lsof` call there in the error message
to show what prevents umounting?

We have 'fuser' output in  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
since Mar 22, 2023 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b40513187752c0dfc2fb467f097812dbd03a17d2](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b40513187752c0dfc2fb467f097812dbd03a17d2)  
from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2909)  
for ReaR 2.8  
that moved into the umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy() function  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3408)

But we do not have 'fuser' output in ReaR 2.7  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh\#L47](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh#L47)  
which is what the SUSE customer uses because  
ReaR 2.7 is currently the latest ReaR version for SLE15  
that is officially provided by SUSE for SLE-HA customers.

By the way a side note FYI:

Currently I am working on providing ReaR 2.9  
as new RPM package 'rear29a' for SUSE customers, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#SUSE\_support\_for\_Relax-and-Recover](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#SUSE_support_for_Relax-and-Recover)

In this case the trailing 'a' in the RPM package name  
means again that it will not be the pristine ReaR 2.9 release  
but some (reasonable) later state, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#rear\_/\_rear116\_/\_rear1172a\_/\_rear118a\_/\_rear23a\_/\_rear27a](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#rear_/_rear116_/_rear1172a_/_rear118a_/_rear23a_/_rear27a)

In particular I want to provide my new

    TRUSTED_OWNERS and TRUSTED_PATHS protection
    against code injection via 'source'

to SUSE customers so ReaR behaves more secure for them,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424)

Currently I don't know for what specific SLE products  
it will be officially provided (and supported) by SUSE,  
these are ongoing management decisions...
