I basically have the same problem as issue \#50
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/50](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/50)

I was able to bypass the issue by doing the following:

1.  booting on my USB drive to recovery
2.  copied
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/
3.  rear recover

My OS installed is Oracle Enterprise Linux 5.6 (very similar to RHEL
5.6).

Here is output from dump:

    Relax-and-Recover 1.13.0-git201207121301-git201207121301 / 2012-07-12

Dag,  
could it be that our lsb replacement code did not recognised this
correctly?

@gdha What lsb replacement code ? The snapshot RPM packages (and those
from RPMforge) drop in an */etc/rear/os.conf* file to stuff the required
information so that the lsb-release package is no longer necessary. But
it does not seem that this package in fact was using an
*/etc/rear/os.conf* at all. And I think the lsb code has not been
changed for a long time (or at least I was not aware).

PS I see two issues:

-   Relax-and-Recover 1.13.0-git201207121301-git201207121301
-   OS\_VENDOR = EnterpriseEnterpriseServer

Not sure where both are coming from :-/

Any feedback for this issue ? Can we get more information from this
installation ?
