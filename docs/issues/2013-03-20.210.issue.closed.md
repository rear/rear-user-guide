hi,

while trying to recover a SLES11 x64 system with REAR everything went
well but the system was unable to boot. GRUB installation was reported
as beeing succesfull but in the detailed logging it failed:

GUB version 0.97 (640K lower / 3072K upper memory)

\[ Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word,
TAB  
lists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists the
possible  
completions of a device/filename. \]  
grub&gt; device (hd0) /dev/sda  
grub&gt; root (hd0,1)  
Filesystem type is reiserfs, partition type 0x83  
grub&gt; setup --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 --prefix=/grub (hd0)  
Checking if "/grub/stage1" exists... no

Error 15: File not found  
grub&gt; quit

it seems the --prefix option did confuse it some kind of a way, with a
simple:

setup --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 (hd0)

everything went well.

the system did not have a dedicated boot partition, i think it went
wrong because of this, according to the script the prefix stays /grub if
no seperate disk is found:

finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh

    bootparts=$( (find_partition fs:/boot; find_partition fs:/) | sort | uniq -u )
    grub_prefix=/grub
    if [[ -z "$bootparts" ]]; then
        bootparts=$(find_partition fs:/)
        grub_prefix=/boot/grub
    fi

i think defaulting to /boot/grub as the prefix makes sense anyway?

do you mean /boot is not mounted by default?

yes, there is no seperate partition for /boot, it exists on / however:

@dagwieers knows this better. I was just sitting idly next to him when
we wrote than and all I did was just nod when he asked a question :-)

But if I look at it, I think we want our initial search fot `$bootparts`
to return nothing, then the prefix is set to `/boot/grub`. I don't know
why we also search for fs:/ and do the sort and uniq there.

Had/have the same issue. Did the workaround another way by creating a
symlink /grub -&gt; /boot/grub on the System before doing the backup  
But I think the script should get /boot/grub as prefix, when no separate
boot partition is found

hi guys,

anything new on that? I just ran into the same troubles again and i
think the fix is quite straight-forward :)

Some background info (which is important to understand the why's I
guess)

From the mail archive I found the following (from @dagwieers ):  
Re: \[rear-users\] mbr broken after recover

Anyway, the reason there is a distinction between `/grub/stage1` and  
`/boot/grub/stage1` is related to the fact that it could be on a
separate  
filesystem, in that case `/grub/stage1` is correct (in fact in most
cases  
this is what is happening). So apparently it now fails for cases where
it  
should be using `/boot/grub/stage1`.

The reason the grub installation code is more complex is because we had
to  
support this second possibility. Why it now fails, I don't know. We
did  
test it when we wrote it ;-)

So how did we do this ?

To know exactly what devices are involved with the boot partition, we  
search for the dependencies of fs:/boot and we remove any dependencies
we  
find for fs:/ as shown below:

     bootparts=$( (find_partition fs:/boot; find_partition fs:/) | sort | uniq -u )

If in this case bootparts is empty, it means that `fs:/boot` and `fs:/`
share  
the same partition(s). In which case we need to use `/boot/grub` as  
grub\_prefix.

The reason we have this complexity is because if you have software
raid,  
you need to be sure both disks are being updated, so we find more than
one  
partition ! This explains the complexity, otherwise we could just
compare  
the partition of `fs:/` and `fs:/boot`.

Once we know the boot partition(s) and we have the correct grub\_prefix,
we  
can go and look for the disks that relate to these partitions and
install  
grub on these.

So how to proceed to debug the problem ? Enable debugging and check
what  
Rear reports for `find_partition fs:/boot` and `find_partition fs:/`,
that  
should give an indication to what is going on.

PS: we're talking about code from
`finalize/Linux-i386/21_install_grub.sh` and/or
`finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh`

@gdha I am sorry, I should have replied to the bug report, instead of
the mailinglist :-/

hi,

i tried to reproduce, the strange thing is:

after recovering the data to /mnt/local and exiting the rear&gt; command
prompt with "exit" it does not show any error, the grub failure however
is reported to the logfile

if get back into the recovery mode again, skipping the disk
partitioninig it then complains correctly about  
missing the boot partition:

rear&gt; exit  
Did you restore the backup to /mnt/local ? Are you ready to continue
recovery ? yes  
exit  
Updated initramfs with new drivers for this system.

I think the error is maybe also caused by the situation that /dev/sda1

I think I get it now, although I don't know why. Look at this piece of
code:

        # Find exclusive partitions belonging to /boot (subtract root partitions from deps)
        bootparts=$( (find_partition fs:/boot; find_partition fs:/) | sort | uniq -u )
        grub_prefix=/grub
        if [[ -z "$bootparts" ]]; then
            bootparts=$(find_partition fs:/)
            grub_prefix=/boot/grub
        fi
        # Should never happen
        [[ "$bootparts" ]]
        BugIfError "Unable to find any /boot partitions"

If in your case `/boot` is in the root partition, we expect to get from
find\_partition foor both fs:/ and fs:/boot to get the same partition
back (/dev/sda2). This means that "sort | uniq -u" removes non-unique
entries:

    echo -e "/dev/sda2\n/dev/sda2" | sort | uniq -u

And so `bootparts` is expected to be empty, but in this case it isn't
empty and that's the real problem. From your code I cannot tell what is
going on (not enough copy&pasted).

Let me do this on my own running system (this is a good way to debug the
code BTW:

    [root@moria ~]# LAYOUT_DEPS=/var/lib/rear/layout/diskdeps.conf
    [root@moria ~]# LAYOUT_FILE=/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf 
    [root@moria ~]# LAYOUT_TODO=/var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf 
    [root@moria ~]# source /usr/share/rear/lib/array-functions.sh 
    [root@moria ~]# source /usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh
    [root@moria ~]# find_partition fs:/
    /dev/sda2
    [root@moria ~]# find_partition fs:/boot
    /dev/sda1
    /dev/sda2
    [root@moria ~]# ( find_partition fs:/; find_partition fs:/boot )
    /dev/sda2
    /dev/sda1
    /dev/sda2
    [root@moria ~]# ( find_partition fs:/; find_partition fs:/boot ) | sort
    /dev/sda1
    /dev/sda2
    /dev/sda2
    [root@moria ~]# ( find_partition fs:/; find_partition fs:/boot ) | sort | uniq -u
    /dev/sda1

This is to be expected in my case (/dev/sda1 is the */boot* partition).
In your case it should return nothing. Which means / and /boot are the
same device.

Ok, I got it:

    [root@moria ~]# find_partition fs:/
    /dev/sda2
    [root@moria ~]# find_partition fs:/usr

So the find\_partition only works for mountpoints :-(
