-   Description of the issue:

`rear opaladmin changePW` (when used without any extra argument or with
multiple arguments) is meant to change the disk password on multiple
self-encrypting drives in a single invocation. However, it stops after
successfully changing the password on the first drive. The password of
subsequent drives remains unchanged.
