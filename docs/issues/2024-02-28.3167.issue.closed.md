Since we set in default.conf TMPDIR to /var/tmp (if unset) via

    export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/var/tmp}"

programs that are called by ReaR use by default /var/tmp  
for their temporary files.

Programs may not carefully clean up their temporary files  
or may leave temporary files in case of program aborts  
when programs (falsely) rely on the system default /tmp  
that usually gets automatically cleaned up relatively fast  
e.g. via something like systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service  
or at least via reboot when /tmp is a tmpfs in RAM.

In contast to /var/tmp for programs that are called by ReaR  
ReaR cleanes up its own temporary stuff in BUILD\_DIR  
carefully and completely via the function  
cleanup\_build\_area\_and\_end\_program()  
in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

Perhaps it would be good when /usr/sbin/rear  
sets TMPDIR to $TMP\_DIR (TMP\_DIR=$BUILD\_DIR/tmp)  
if TMPDIR was initially unset when 'rear' was called  
so that programs that are called by ReaR use  
by default $BUILD\_DIR/tmp for their temporary files?

An addedum regarding confidentiality,  
here in particular about confidentiality of temporary files  
from programs that are called by ReaR:

Currently we do in /usr/sbin/rear

    BUILD_DIR="$( mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX || Error "Could not create build area '$BUILD_DIR'" )"
    ROOTFS_DIR=$BUILD_DIR/rootfs
    TMP_DIR=$BUILD_DIR/tmp
    mkdir -p $ROOTFS_DIR || Error "Could not create $ROOTFS_DIR"
    mkdir -p $TMP_DIR || Error "Could not create $TMP_DIR"

without any special 'umask' or 'chmod' for confidentiality  
so we rely on sufficiently safe 'mktemp -d' behaviour

    '-d'
    ...
    The directory will have read, write, and search permissions
    for the current user, but no permissions for the group or others

as described in  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html\_node/mktemp-invocation.html\#mktemp-invocation](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/mktemp-invocation.html#mktemp-invocation)

So when programs that are called by ReaR use $BUILD\_DIR/tmp  
their temporary files are sufficiently safe via 'mktemp -d'  
against unwanted access by non-root users.

@pcahyna  
please have a look here (as time permits).  
I really appreciate your feedback here.

@jsmeix that's an interesting point. After reading it, I have only one
remark (I may find other stuff later):

> Perhaps it would be good when /usr/sbin/rear  
> sets TMPDIR to $TMP\_DIR (TMP\_DIR=$BUILD\_DIR/tmp)

Why only "if TMPDIR was initially unset when 'rear' was called" ? This
condition complicates the whole logic, and is also unhelpful. If we were
to do this change, I would do it unconditionally. If an user sets and
exports `TMPDIR=/some/big/file/system` before calling ReaR, it would be
nice to do the automatic cleanup for them as well, just as we would do
for the default `/var/tmp`.

@pcahyna  
you already helped me a lot with your first remark!

I falsely thought when we set in default.conf TMPDIR  
to /var/tmp only if TMPDIR was unset that then I also  
need to set TMPDIR to $TMP\_DIR only if TMPDIR was unset  
when 'rear' was called.

When it is better to set TMPDIR to $TMP\_DIR in any case  
implementation is much simpler and straightforward for me!

@pcahyna  
because I am looking right now at usr/sbin/rear

    # Save the current value to detect changes.
    saved_tmpdir="${TMPDIR-}"

I am wondering why you use `${TMPDIR-}`  
and not simply `$TMPDIR` because  
TMPDIR is set in default.conf if it was unset  
and default.conf was already sourced before.

@jsmeix I have not realized this. Thank you for pointing this out, but I
would not want to rely on such long-range interactions anyway.

@pcahyna  
"sorry" for delivering bad news but tons of things in ReaR  
depend on long-and-even-longer-range interactions ;-)

Meanwhile while implementing it via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168)  
I came to the conclusion that it is better  
(at least for now to be on the safe side for the initial
implementation)  
to set TMPDIR to $TMP\_DIR (TMP\_DIR=$BUILD\_DIR/tmp)  
only if TMPDIR was initially unset when 'rear' was called.

See my thoughts  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168\#issuecomment-1997014841](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168#issuecomment-1997014841)

and my comment in the code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168/commits/7e278f3329fe52edaa9527dfde1816e74ea5cd5a](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168/commits/7e278f3329fe52edaa9527dfde1816e74ea5cd5a)

    # We set TMPDIR to ReaR's TMP_DIR only when TMPDIR was not set
    # before ReaR was launched by the user via export TMPDIR="..."
    # to provide final power to the user so that a specific TMPDIR can be specified
    # e.g. for certain third-party backup tools that may need a specific TMPDIR

Therein "provide final power to the user"  
is the crucial part which outweighs (at least for me)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3167\#issuecomment-1969031794](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3167#issuecomment-1969031794)

@jsmeix setting `TMPDIR` to a subdirectory of the user-specified
`TMPDIR` should not be a problem because the temporary files will still
be under a directory that the user has specified. The user should not
assume what file or directory structure under the TMPDIR that they have
specified will the tool use. After all, even now, we don't put temporary
files directly into TMPDIR, but under $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXX and possibly
some directories in between, and it has not been a problem.

Changing `TMPDIR` to something that would *not* be under the
user-specified `TMPDIR` would certainly be against "final power to the
user", but that's not what you are doing here.

Your examples of third-party backup tools show that when such a tool
needs a specific `TMPDIR`, it does not obey what the user has specified
- the code specific to the tool must set `TMPDIR` to the "right" value
itself, in any case.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your explanation!  
I will think about it over the weekend.  
My current gut feeling is that you are right.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3168)
merged  
this issue should be reasonably solved.

What is missing is proper handling of TMPDIR in RECOVERY\_MODE  
in particular for the "chroot /mnt/local" case, see
