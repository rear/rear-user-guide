Now it behaves perfectly - as far as I can see.

@gozora  
a general comment regarding specific variables  
for specific backup program option settings:

I think you could completely remove  
BORGBACKUP\_COMPRESSION  
and support instead two generic  
BORGBACKUP\_CREATE\_OPTIONS=()  
BORGBACKUP\_EXTRACT\_OPTIONS=()  
where the user can specify any options he wants  
for "borg create" and "borg extract".

This way you would be automatically future-proof and  
avoid an possibly endless sequence of user requests  
to support this and that and those further specific Borg  
backup program option settings.

@jsmeix actually I was thinking about such setup, but decided to go
different way. Thinking of it now, it really could be easier.  
I'll check that, thanks!

@gozora  
FYI regarding how to use and implement multiple  
program options settings via an array variable  
you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/912](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/912)

I think I vaguely remember that quoting with " as in

<pre>
COMMAND ... "${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}" ...
</pre>

could be crucial, cf.

@jsmeix thanks for hint!

Now I maybe know why I've abandoned this idea.

It would require to add 5 different variables for each type of Borg
operations (init, create, prune, list, extract). The code I've wrote
relies on some options in use (I did not tested what would happen if
some options are omitted).  
As an example let's have a look on `borg create` and `borg prune`.  
I've used variable *BORGBACKUP\_ARCHIVE\_PREFIX* to define archives that
have been created by ReaR. So every time you run `rear mkbackup`,
archive with name `BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX_<incremented_archive_id>`
is created in Borg repository. User can add arbitrary new archives to
this repository (and do restore from then with `rear recover`), but with
such naming convention we will know which archives has been created
using ReaR. This property is used e.g. during `borg prune` (which cleans
repository according user defined settings) to avoid removing of user
created archives. (ReaR will prune only archives with prefix
`BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_PREFIX_`).  
To cut the story short, from my point of view, current code is more
straight forward to configure, easier to maintain and easier to look for
a bugs ...  
Let us just wait for first users to report some issues and flat down the
code after we have some feedback from actual <s>testing</s> use.
