Hereby I implemented basically my proposal  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327\#issuecomment-296672094](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327#issuecomment-296672094)  
and additionally now dd is used as generic fallback in any case.

I tested it on SLE12 with wipefs in the recovery system  
and also without wipefs in the recovery system  
(i.e. for me also the dd fallback works).

Details:

With wipefs in the recovery system  
I get in diskrestore.sh

<pre>
# Using wipefs to cleanup '/dev/sda2' before creating filesystem.
wipefs --all --force /dev/sda2 || wipefs --all /dev/sda2 || dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1 || true
</pre>

and in the "rear -d -D recover" log file

<pre>
+ source /usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_script.sh
...
+++ echo -e 'Creating filesystem of type ext4 with mount point / on /dev/sda2.'
+++ wipefs --all --force /dev/sda2
+++ mkfs -t ext4 -b 4096 -i 16377 -U 46d7e8be-7812-49d1-8d24-e25ed0589e94 /dev/sda2
</pre>

Without wipefs in the recovery system  
I get in diskrestore.sh

<pre>
# Using dd to cleanup the first 512 bytes on '/dev/sda2' before creating filesystem.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1 || true
</pre>

and in the "rear -d -D recover" log file

<pre>
+ source /usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_script.sh
...
+++ echo -e 'Creating filesystem of type ext4 with mount point / on /dev/sda2.'
+++ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1
1+0 records in

@gdha @gozora  
I added you as reviewers here mainly FYI.

If there are no furious objections I will "just merge" it soon  
because from my point of view it is a noticeable improvement  
even if it is not yet the ultimate solution, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327\#issuecomment-297014255](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327#issuecomment-297014255)  
versus  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327\#issuecomment-297964501](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327#issuecomment-297964501)  
and the generic missing functionality  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)

But it follows the traditional Unix philosopy "Worse is better"  
that is basically "simplicity outweighs all", see  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\_philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)  
and  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse\_is\_better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better)

@gozora  
yes, I know, you are right, the current code is not nice.  
The 'wipefs\*' variables should be renamed to something  
like 'cleanup\_disk\*' and the whole current wipefs/dd code  
should be cleaned up - but I have no time for that now.  
So for now I only did some kind of "quick addon hack"  
to make "rear recover" working a bit better in practice,  
see the comments in my code (I mention "Dirty hacks" ;-)

I removed the "cleanup" label from this pull request  
because it really does not cleanup the code  
(but it better cleans up the disk now ;-)
