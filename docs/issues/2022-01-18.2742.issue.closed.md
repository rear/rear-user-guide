      chroot: failed to run command '/bin/bash': No such file or directory

so this looks as if there is no '/bin/bash' in the recovery system.

which looks rather wrong that 'apache' is owner of '/bin/bash'  
so this looks as if something may have gone rather wrong on the original
system?

@GreasyMonkee  
to inspect what your ReaR recovery system actually contains,  
see the description about "KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR"  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf that is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L163](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L163)

I.e. inspect what your recovery system in
/tmp/rear.72nSC6tc1CdkreF/rootfs  
actually contains in your case and test things therein via  
`chroot /tmp/rear.72nSC6tc1CdkreF/rootfs`

@jsmeix

Thanks, that explains it - I will need to roll back to the last
backed-up version to recover the original system.

Cheers.

@GreasyMonkee  
I am not a Fedora / Red Hat user so what I wrote  
are only assumptions from what I noticed in your ReaR log file.  
Perhaps your original system is not totally broken  
and could be somehow fixed without a roll back.

Because this issue does not look like a bug in ReaR I close it.  
Nevertheless further comments can be added here as needed.

Understood, I have reloaded from the backup, problem solved and have
done a  
further successful backup.

Many thanks for your quick and helpful response.

Cheers  
Garth.

@GreasyMonkee  
thank you for your feedback that it had worked for you.

I appreciate explicit positive feedback because it makes clear the
issue  
is actually solved (instead of only assuming "no news is good news").
