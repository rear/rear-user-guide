Currently onyl FYI so that you can have a look  
my first attempt to implement BOOTLOADER support, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-288349895](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-288349895)

Currently it is not tested.

I think there could be some missing alignment between  
prep/default/500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
and  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh

When someone uses the grand new "FancyBoot" bootloader,  
setting BOOTLOADER="FancyBoot" in default.conf won't help him  
as long as there is no support for that in ReaR.

But setting BOOTLOADER is not meant this way.

Setting BOOTLOADER is only meant so that the user  
can - if needed - (i.e. when autodetection fails for him)  
enforce ReaR to set up during "rear recover" one of  
the supported bootloaders i.e. one of what is listed in  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh

Currently BOOTLOADER is intentionally  
not yet described in default.conf.

I did some very first tests and it seems to work o.k for me.

@gdha  
wow!  
You just merged it.  
I think it should be o.k. regardless that I did only some very first
tests.  
If issues or even regressions appear because of it  
I will fix them of course!

ReaR fails perfectly well with an unsupported BOOTLOADER value:

<pre>
# grep BOOTLOADER etc/rear/local.conf
BOOTLOADER="grubby"

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue
...
ERROR: 
====================
BUG in /root/rear/usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh:
'Unknown bootloader (GRUBBY) - ask for sponsoring to get this fixed'
...
</pre>

Surprisingly it even works on my SLE12 system  
where I actually use Grub2  
with a false BOOTLOADER="grub":

<pre>
# grep BOOTLOADER etc/rear/local.conf
BOOTLOADER="grub"

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
...
Using specified bootloader 'grub'
</pre>

but during "rear recover" it does automatically "the right thing"

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear -d -D recover
...
Skip installing GRUB Legacy boot loader because GRUB 2 is installed (grub-probe or grub2-probe exist).
Installing GRUB2 boot loader
Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.
RESCUE e205:~ #
</pre>

and the recreated system boots fine.

Of course it also still works for me on SLE12 with Grub2 and BIOS  
with the empty default BOOTLOADER="" so that I now think  
this pull request really looks o.k. (at least as far as I can see).
