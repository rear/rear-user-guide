-   Brief description of the issue: I am trying to take the rear locally
    and restore through remote server by source of NFS. But I am not
    able to mount the file systems while running rear recover because of
    wrong fstype and umount helper was not found. I have searched in
    /sbin directory and I did not find mount.nfs and umount.nfs in the
    rear iso taken locally. But I am able to find those in the rear iso
    taken in to remote server through nfs. Please let me know how can we
    fix this.

-   Work-around, if any: as of now NOthing from my side.

@Ram4Linux According the error message "*Using backup archive
'/rearBKP//isxl1042/backup.tar.gz'*" the
following`BACKUP_URL=file:///rearBKP/` was in use, but somewhat later it
seems to have used `BACKUP_URL=nfs://isxl1041/rear/backup` according the
mount problem? Were you mixing 2 BACKUP\_URL settings?  
As the NFS mount failed I guess the **file://** setting was the actual
setting used during the `rear mkbackup`  
I would say please retry with a consistent `local.conf` - thanks.

HI Gdha,  
Thanks for the reply. I am sorry for the wrong out put given above.
Please find the correct output as below.

Step 1:  
I am taking rear backup locally under /rearBKP.

Step2:  
Copying the all rear files under /rearBKP folder  
to isxl1041 server /rear/backup.

Step3:  
changing the rear configuration in local.conf  
(commenting Backup\_URL-file:///rearBKP/ and  
uncommenting BACKUP\_URL=nfs://isxl1041/rear/backup)  
so that recovery will try to access the isxl1041 server.

Error as below

I have tried another rear backup copying to a remote server directly and
compared to local rear . I found mount.nfs and umount.nfs were missing
in rear taken locally. only these two are missing and every other are
copied to iso. Below are the details.

Rear to remote server through NFS

<pre>
RESCUE isxl1042:/sbin # ls -lrt | grep mount

Sorry i am missing anything. Please forgive the mistakes  
and help in fixing the problem

@Ram4Linux  
what gets automatically included in the ReaR recovery system  
depends in various ways on the settings in /etc/rear/local.conf

In general the ReaR recovery system is minimal.

In this case it means with BACKUP\_URL=file:///...  
while you run "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
stuff for NFS mounting is not needed  
so that this or that is not automatically  
included in the ReaR recovery system.

For special use cases as yours you can specify anything  
what you need in addition to what is automatically included  
in the ReaR recovery system via the config variables

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS
REQUIRED_PROGS
LIBS
MODULES
MODULES_LOAD
FIRMWARE_FILES
</pre>

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

@Ram4Linux You could include the following in your `local.conf` file:

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" showmount mount.nfs umount.nfs )
    MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" nfs )
    PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT="systemctl start rpcbind.target"

Then, you will always have the required binaries and daemons present for
using NFS (anywhere)

I think any kind of `systemctl` does not work on "SUSE 11 SP4"  
but the general idea of using a PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
is right.

Furthermore `MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" nfs )` alone  
might be insufficient, see my MODULES description  
in default.conf in particular the therein mentioned issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355)  
and my own experience with mounting an ISO  
from within a default ReaR recovery system in
