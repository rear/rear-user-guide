[\#325 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/325) `merged`: SEP Sesam rear integration: code cleanup
====================================================================================================

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2013-11-07 13:54](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/325):

Hi,

some more changes to the Sesam module integration:

usr/share/rear/build/default/99\_update\_os\_conf.sh

Make sure os.conf is created in the right place if REAR is not installed
in default path

usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh

Move over the config parsing part to a common place and source it from
the scripts needing it.

usr/share/rear/prep/SESAM/default/40\_prep\_sesam.sh

Use the common script above, do not include sesam init scripts and
various executables anymore

usr/share/rear/skel/SESAM/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/59-start-sesam-client.sh

start sesam client directly, do not use the init script.

Thanks! :-)
