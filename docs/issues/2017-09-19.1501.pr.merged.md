In confidential mode (via '-C') the UserInput function  
does to not log possibly confidentia data which means  
neither the actual user input nor the default input  
nor the choices values are logged.  
The confidential UserInput mode is in particular  
intended to be used in

@OliverO2  
please provide feedback whether or not the current  
confidential user input mode is as you need it.  
I can further enhance it as you need.

Of course in ReaR debugscripts mode  
(via 'rear -D' that runs all scripts with 'set -x')  
arbitrary - also possibly conffential stuff - gets logged.  
If this is not acceptable I could further enhance the  
confidential user input mode to switch off 'set -x'  
during the UserInput call and re-enable it afterwards.

I am against hinding passwords in debug mode. Users won't use that in
production and it will help us to understand bugs. Adding extra
obfuscation here will only add complexity and be a nice source for bugs
that are hard to catch.
