The only "chroot ... bash --login" call that is left is in  
finalize/Debian/i386/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

<pre>
  chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "/usr/share/mdadm/mkconf >/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf"
</pre>

because of the stdout redirection.

Do not merge it!  
It does not yet work.  
This one is RFC 1925 (8): "It is more complicated than you think."

Now it works for me on SLES12:

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear -d -D recover
...
Restoring finished.
...
Running mkinitrd...
Recreated initrd (/sbin/mkinitrd).
Installing GRUB2 boot loader
Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.
</pre>

FYI:  
I need in local.conf

<pre>
OS_MASTER_VENDOR="SUSE_LINUX/i386"
</pre>

(or something else like that) because otherwise  
finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
is not sourced.  
Whether or not a rebuild\_initramfs script should be sourced  
in any case is a different issue - I never had issues with the  
initrd on my test systems so that a rebuild\_initramfs script  
seems to be not really mandatory.

@gdha  
could you please review whether or not  
it still works for you with my changes in  
finalize/Fedora/i386/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

FYI:  
By the way I found a chroot call in  
finalize/Linux-i386/220\_install\_grub2.sh  
where I think that cannot work:

<pre>
chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT $grub_name-mkconfig -o /boot/$grub_name/grub.cfg
</pre>

because $grub\_name evaluates to "grub2" or "grub"  
but chroot requires usually a full path to be executed like

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # chroot /mnt/local ifconfig
chroot: failed to run command 'ifconfig': No such file or directory

RESCUE e205:~ # chroot /mnt/local /sbin/ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 52:54:00:25:A4:49
...
</pre>

finalize/Fedora/i386/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

@gdha  
many thanks for your careful review!

FYI regarding who the 'I' actually is:  
To find out who made what in a file I use usually  
the git command "git log -p --follow file.sh".  
For the 170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh files  
that command shows as the oldest entry always

It is the same commit

so that I think the 'I' could be Peer Heinlein  
and Schlomo only comitted his changes?

@schlomo  
many thanks for the information!

I will do a separated pull request  
where I let ReaR show same kind of warning  
as near the end of the code about  
"Cannot create initramfs"  
if the udev requirement is not fulfilled.

Regarding LogPrint messages like

<pre>
WARNING:
Cannot create initramfs
...
Check the recreated system (mounted at /mnt/local)
and decide yourself, whether the system will boot or not.
</pre>

@schlomo  
because I know what you think about warning messages:  
Schould I remove the word "WARNING:" from those  
messages and make it a plain information?

Thanks @jsmeix for your consideration.

One one hand the warning is justified as it really means "I don't know".

On the other hand we should try to give the user even more information
here. For example, which systems don't have udev nowadays? Maybe we can
say that ReaR 2 actually requires udev and fails without? Then you could
get rid of this warning.

Another thought: Maybe we should expand this to be a generic feature and
collect such warnings in a list of `RECOVERY_NOTICE[@]` which we display
at the end. In an automated recovery having a non-empty list of recovery
notices would be an error, in a manual recovery it would be printed as
user info.

I have to think a bit more about it.  
I think the idea behind something like a RECOVERY\_NOTICE array  
is related to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1134](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1134)  
because also in an automated recovery proper exit codes  
could be used to signal something to the user.  
In other words:  
If in an automated recovery a RECOVERY\_NOTICE  
would be an error, rear should exit with an appropriate  
non-zero exit code in this case to singal the user:  
Not a fatal error (e.g. after calling the Error function)  
but also not a clean recovery.

It seems using no login shell for chroot calls  
causes more issues that it solves, see
