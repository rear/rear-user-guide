-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

After recover the system many programms with are using python3  
are not working anymore.

    # yum list
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dnf/crypto.py", line 35, in <module>

I tried different rear version but it's the same with all versions.  
RedHat Version 7 is working fine.  
I tested as well a Version 8 server about 1 year ago  
with rear 2.61 and it was working without problmes  
(no error at testprotocol).  
Mybee you have an idee, why the python programms has such errors.

-   Workaround, if any:

@RolfWeilen  
I know nothing at all about Python runtime stuff  
so only an offhanded blind shot in the dark:

Do those programms which are using Python3  
still work after a reboot of your original system?

Caution:  
If those programms which are using Python3  
do no longer work after a reboot of your original system  
you may be left with a broken original system  
and then you would need ReaR to restore it  
but that also fails so you may finally end up  
with an ultimate disaster of your original system.

My reasoning:  
I guess that the root cause is not the ReaR recovery  
but that it works by luck in the running original system  
(in particular with what is in its main memory, e.g. caches)  
while it would not work whith only the files on the disk  
of the original system so it fails when the original system  
is restarted from scratch (i.e. rebooted with only what  
there is in its files on its disk).

@pcahyna  
because this issue is about RHEL  
could you have a look here  
as far as time permits?

That's a strange problem. Note that restoration of the Python files (or
any other files) is not directly ReaR's job, but the backup program's
job (TSM here, given that BACKUP=TSM is being used). Could there be
something wrong with the TSM backup, or its restoration? I am afraid I
won't be able to offer much help, as I don't know anything about TSM.
But I would recommend extracting the TSM backup to a subdirectory on
some working system, chroot to that subdirectory, and running the same
command that is failing.

If something went wrong with TSM backup restore  
I expect that the `dsmc_exit_code` handling code in  
restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
shows appropriate messages to the user.

so all mounted filesystems were restored "correctly"  
(according to what TSM reports).

Perhaps the TSM backup might be incomplete  
e.g. some Python3 related files were not included?  
But that would not be ReaR's problem because  
the user is responsible to include in his backup  
all what is needed to recreate his system as he needs,  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in

Hi  
I will investigate it further.  
But all files are include in the backup. As well the backup and restore
has no error.  
On RHEL 7 System (same filesystems) the restore with rear works.  
As well i think it's not a problem of rear itself, because the system is
booting without problems after recover.  
We have now the newest RHEL Version 8.6. I try to do a restore with
previus Version of RHEL.

Keep inform you

@RolfWeilen When I look at the source of the python script:

    [/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dnf]#
    #-> more crypto.py
    from __future__ import print_function
    from __future__ import absolute_import
    from __future__ import unicode_literals
    from dnf.i18n import _
    import contextlib
    import dnf.pycomp
    import dnf.util
    import dnf.yum.misc
    import io
    import logging
    import os
    import tempfile

    try:
        from gpg import Context
        from gpg import Data
    except ImportError:
        import gpgme

I noticed that in your case the script fails when trying to import
`gpgme` which it should do in the first place. Can you confirm that the
directory `/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dnf` was properly restored?
In my case I see:

    #-> ls
    base.py      comps.py  crypto.py  drpm.py        history.py   lock.py           module        plugin.py    query.py     rpm          subject.py         util.py
    callback.py  conf      db         exceptions.py  i18n.py      logging.py        package.py    __pycache__  repodict.py  sack.py      transaction.py     yum

Hi  
I have found a missmatch between restored and new system. There are some
missing files.  
No idee why there are missing.  
But it has nothing to do with rear.  
I will inform you when i know what happend.  
Thank a lot for your support.

regards  
Rolf

Hi  
I have found the files where are missing. Not all Files are in the
backup and as a result there was no restore of those files.  
We can close the case.  
Thanks for your input and best regards

thank you for the info what the actual reason was.
