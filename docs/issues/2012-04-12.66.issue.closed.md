The code exits with error on systems with vlan network:

    # rear -v -D mkbackup
    Relax and Recover 0.0.825 / 2012-03-16 18:37:24 +0100
    Creating disk layout
    Excluding RAID md2.
    Excluding Volume Group lvlocal
    Excluding Volume Group vgbackup
    Excluding component fs:/backup
    Excluding component logicaldrive:/dev/cciss/c0d0
    Excluding component logicaldrive:cciss/c0d0
    Creating root FS layout
    ERROR: Relax and Recover does not yet support 802.1q, please sponsor it!
    Aborting due to an error, check /tmp/rear-usssapl6.log for details
    Finished in 26 seconds
    Terminated

Would be nice if we can build the rescue image, even without vlan
reconstruction ability (such that we could e.g. rescue system from the
non-network targets)

In your opinion,

1.  should we just allow building a rescue system that won't have  
    networking and hope that the user knew what they where doing
2.  should we try to guess if recovery needs networking or not and
    allow  
    this only if recovery does not require networking
3.  should we add a new config option IGNORE\_UNSUPPORTED\_VLAN which
    needs  
    to be set in order to convert this error into a warning

well, we do it very directly :) :

(vlan\_) continue ;;  
\#(vlan\_) Error "$PRODUCT does not yet support 802.1q, please sponsor
it!" ;;

cleanest probably would be indeed option 3, like
IGNORE\_UNSUPPORTED\_FEATURE

In issue \#3 we already discuss how Rear can become a lot smarter in
handling network-related recovery.

Obviously if it detects known MAC addresses it can assume that it is a
restore to the same system and can continue with configuring the network
setup exactly as it was. But in case this is not the case, there are a
few things it could do (which we can do identically for VLAN tagging).
After configuring an interface it could *test* whether the configuration
in fact works (e.g. arping the gateway) if that does not work we have to
ask the user to what interface to map.

Obviously with LACP this is not going to be easy, since doing a
bruteforce on every combination of interfaces might be problematic (but
we could opt to only test/run with a single interface for LACP. But
during recovery we don't need HA.

What is needed is similar to what we implemented for the storage layout,
i.e. writing out an abstraction of the configuration that is active on
the system and then restoring the configuration from that abstract
network configuration file. And that network configuration file should
have dependencies between "interfaces" as well as support for bonding
(LACP or other), VLAN tagging and possible other stuff...
