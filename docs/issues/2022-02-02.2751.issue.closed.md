The last ReaR versions had been released about once a year, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

    Version 2.6 (June 2020)
    Version 2.5 (May 2019)
    Version 2.4 (June 2018)

so the upcoming ReaR 2.7 release will be somewhat later than usual  
but not too late because nowhere is stated we release once a year.

Therefore I would like to suggest  
to start with preparations towards a ReaR 2.7 release.

The ReaR release process is described at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

I never did the whole ReaR release process myself  
so I would need probably a lot of help.

I marked some issues where I personally think they should be fixed  
before ReaR 2.7 can be released with the "blocker" label:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ablocker](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ablocker)

Also, when you are testing the pre-2.7 release make a note in our WIKI
page:

I will prepare the release notes on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation)  
i.e. create a new release-notes-2-7.md there and update it,

I have set the due date for the ReaR v2.7 milestone to 2022 April 15.  
That current due date mid April 2022 is only a tentatively estimated
intended date.  
It is not at all meant as a date where ReaR users could currently rely
on.

@jsmeix for me that's a good timeframe, I would like to contribute to
the release effort in March (i.e. not in the upcoming two weeks).

@rear/contributors

Because I added the milestone ReaR v2.8  
and already assigned issues and pull requests to it, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22ReaR+v2.8%22](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22ReaR+v2.8%22)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A%22ReaR+v2.8%22](https://github.com/rear/rear/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A%22ReaR+v2.8%22)  
I wonder about the following:

Shouldn't we allow also patch/bugfix versions if needed  
e.g. a ReaR 2.7.1 to fix bugs in ReaR 2.7 before ReaR 2.8?

We had major.minor.patch version numbers in ReaR 1.x  
but since ReaR 2.x we do no longer have them, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

    Version 2.6 (June 2020)
    Version 2.5 (May 2019)
    Version 2.4 (June 2018)
    Version 2.3 (December 2017)
    Version 2.2 (July 2017)
    Version 2.1 (June 2017)
    Version 2.00 (January 2017)
    Version 1.19.0 (October 2016)
    Version 1.18.0 (March 2016)
    Version 1.17.2 (August 2015)
    Version 1.17.1 (June 2015)

I don't know the reason why we do no longer have major.minor.patch  
but only major.minor

@rear/contributors  
is there a reason why major.minor.patch causes problems for ReaR?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) commented at [2022-02-16 11:10](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2751#issuecomment-1041376315):

I honestly doubt that anybody has the time (or motivation) to back port
fixes so that I would expect users of our Open Source tool to simply
upgrade to the latest.

That is also the reason why (in my opinion) we don't have and don't need
a minor version. We simply create a new minor version if we make a new
release that fixes problems or adds features and a new major version if
we believe that we changed so much that we are not sure about the
general compatibility of previous configurations.

So for me there is no need for a patch version.

If a commercial vendor would like to spend the effort then of course
they are welcome to do so, maybe they would have a business case (e.g.
paying customers) for that. Of course ReaR developers working for such a
vendor are welcome to host the patch release branches here in our main
repo.

What do you think?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-02-16 11:37](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2751#issuecomment-1041398255):

I don't mean any backporting (of course I have no time for that  
here at upstream - at SUSE we do some backporting for our  
rear23a RPM in SLE-HA as specifically needed).

I meant if we need to release a subsequent ReaR version  
after ReaR 2.7 of the current GitHub master code  
to get some reasonably serious bugs or issues fixed  
that we solved up to that point in time  
then we would currently release it as ReaR 2.8  
regardless that some issues that are assigned to the  
ReaR v2.8 milestone would not yet be solved at that point in time.

I see now that this is not a real issue.  
Before we release ReaR 2.8 we would create a new milestone ReaR v2.9  
and move those ReaR v2.8 milestone issues that are not yet solved  
to the new ReaR v2.9 milestone.

So also for me there is no need for a patch version.

> I don't mean any backporting (of course I have no time for that).

I think a patch version would make sense only with backporting. I.e. a
version that has only fixes for known bugs and no new features and
overhauls (that risk introducing new bugs and incompatibilities).

FYI regarding the risk introducing new bugs and incompatibilities

because I never did the whole ReaR release process myself

So it seems by working through  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
I released ReaR 2.7 right now.

In particular `make obs OFFICIAL=1` did more than I expected:

ReaR 2.7 packages got built in openSUSE build service  
for the same Linux distributions as ReaR 2.6 is built  
from the source `rear-2.7.tar.gz` archive that is there  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7)

The built ReaR 2.7 packages are available under  
[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/)

There is now a new GitHub branch 'rear-2.7'  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/rear-2.7](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/rear-2.7)  
so the GitHub 'master' branch  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master)  
is free for further development.

There are also `rear-2.7` and `2.7` tags, so the release is done from
the version control POV. (The duplicate tag has been there also for the
older releases.) Thanks for taking care of this!

I close this issue to get  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestone/18](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestone/18)  
done.

I also closed  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestone/18](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestone/18)

So ReaR 2.7 should now be done - at least regarding GitHub.

@rear/contributors  
if this or that things are missing outside of GitHub  
please tell me.

@jsmeix thank You so much for the effort and time spent to build this
release and of course to all contributors of this project. Happy
birthday to ReaR 2.7. :-)

@jsmeix A job well done! I can relax now...

@hpannenb @gdha  
thank you for your plaudits!

Let's wait and see and hope that ReaR 2.7  
actually does work well for our users  
in practice out there in the wild.

I am a bit nervous because we did so many fixes and  
enhancements for ReaR 2.7 (two years since ReaR 2.6)  
that there might be accidentally introduced regressions  
which we couldn't foresee but which are severe for our users  
so I will wait some weeks until I can relax.
