This intends to implement what is described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530\#issuecomment-337526810](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530#issuecomment-337526810)  
and subsequent comments.

This removes "out-of-the-box" support in ReaR for  
other secure shell software like CentrifySSH  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836)  
but it does not make OpenSSH mandatory for ReaR  
so that the initial problem in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836)  
should not re-appear.

In default.conf it is now described how to set up ReaR  
with a secure shell software other than OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1  
basically via

<pre>
SSH_FILES='no'
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" my secure shell software files )
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" my secure shell programs )
</pre>

Currently I have not yet tested it.

FWIW:

At least I cannot maintain code in ReaR that supports  
non OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1 like "third-party" secure shell software  
so that I would appreciate it to clean up and simplify  
SSH support in ReaR to only support OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1.

The original issue in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836)  
is back because in rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh

<pre>
grep -h 'sftp' /etc/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/ssh/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/openssh/sshd_co[n]fig
</pre>

hangs up if none of the files exists because plain

<pre>
grep -h 'sftp'
</pre>

endlessly waits for input on stdin.

@OliverO2  
now I have in rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh

<pre>
local files_for_grep=( /etc/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/ssh/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/openssh/sshd_co[n]fig )
...
... grep -h 'sftp' ${files_for_grep[*]} 2>/dev/null
</pre>

I wonder if /etc/sshd\_config or /etc/openssh/sshd\_config  
can actually happen when ReaR only supports  
OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1 with its default directories.

On my SLES10, SLES11, and SLES12 systems  
I have only /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.

According to the

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh
</pre>

output

<pre>
grep sftp /etc/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/ssh/sshd_co[n]fig
</pre>

is there since the beginning and was enhanced to

<pre>
grep sftp /etc/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/ssh/sshd_co[n]fig /etc/openssh/sshd_co[n]fig
</pre>

unfortunately - as often - with a comment that only  
tells about the WHAT but not about the WHY.

I could also see directly in the code WHAT was changed  
so that a comment that tells about WHAT is useful  
but not strictly required.

In contrast leaving out the WHY could be a reason  
to assume there is no longer a reason behind so that  
we might clean up (i.e. remove) such inexplicable stuff?

At least for me it seems it may have become obsolete  
nowadays bacause I have only /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.

Not really: Having `/etc/sshd_config` or `/etc/openssh/sshd_config` with
OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1 would be a deviation from the original distribution
layout. In theory, of course this could be done, but why would a package
maintainer want to do this?

I'd treat the above directories as obsolete and safe to remove after all
these years.

I think it also makes sense to remove the previously existing sketchy
support for Centrify SSH files, as (if I am correct) Centrify SSH
binaries are not copied to rescue media. Otherwise ReaR would run the
risk of exposing an additional set of Centrify-specific secrets by
accident, though Centrify SSH would be unusable on a rescue system
anyway.

There is no longer any 'centrify' (ignore case) in the code

Things work still well for me so that I will "just merge" this one  
so that also others test it in the GitHub master code because  
in case of issues I need issue reports soon to be able to fix  
things before the ReaR 2.3 release.

With this pull request merged there is now  
only support for OpenSSH 3.1 and later with its default directory  
/etc/ssh/ for keys and config files and its default sshd config file  
/etc/ssh/sshd\_config for the SSH setup of the recovery system.  
I removed support for non-standard directories  
like /etc/openssh or non-standard sshd config files  
like /etc/sshd\_config or /etc/openssh/sshd\_config.  
I documented in the SSH\_\* section in default.conf  
how to manually set up ReaR with a secure shell  
software other than OpenSSH &gt;= 3.1.  
I removed the incomplete support for CentrifySSH  
but did not make OpenSSH mandatory for ReaR  
so that the initial problem in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/836)  
does not re-appear (in particular not with SSH\_FILES='no').

@jsmeix  
I have looked at all the individual commits since my last review of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530).
Also looks good to me.

I have also tested the very latest master commit on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
with the default configuration plus `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`. Everything was
working fine.

Thank you for lots of hard work, looks pretty complete now! Hope there
will be some other test results coming in from people running ReaR on
other supported platforms.

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your careful review and continuous testing  
and even more thanks for your helpful comments that  
I needed so much to be able to implement things  
where I am not at all an expert.

You really helped a lot to make ReaR both more secure  
and even better usable at the same time because now  
the SSH config is much more user-friendly:

Unexperienced users just need to set

<pre>
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
</pre>

to get remote access to the recovery system  
(via a fallback RSA key that is generated during recovery system
startup)  
and  
experienced admins can now specify in detail  
what exactly they want regarding SSH.

@jsmeix  
Tonight - with some time to let all the details settle - I have again
looked at the final result of all SSH changes and it still makes sense
to me. The code covers all the important use cases and allows further
customization via standard ReaR mechanisms.

It is my impression that the options are pretty simple to use, although
the current documentation in `default.conf` suggests otherwise as it
contains more than 100 lines. So I've tried to extract my understanding
of how configuration alternatives are meant to be used:

#### SSH configuration

-   This configuration only affects the rescue system. A system restored
    by ReaR will receive its SSH configuration entirely from its backup.
-   ReaR by default supports OpenSSH versions &gt;= 3.1 and SSH files at
    standard locations.
-   For a rescue medium free of secrets, just use the default
    configuration:
    -   You can access the rescue system's root account via SSH via
        public/private key if that was permitted on the original system
        (via `authorized_keys`).
    -   Accessing other systems from the rescue system via SSH would
        require entering a password (as there are no private keys on the
        rescue medium).
-   To support added functionality on the running rescue system is
    possible at the price of having the rescue medium contain secrets:
    -   To access the rescue system with a password, set
        `SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`.
    -   To access other systems via root's passphrase-protected SSH
        private keys present on the original system, set `SSH_FILES=y`.
    -   To access other systems via root's protected and unprotected SSH
        private keys present on the original system, set `SSH_FILES=y`
        and `SSH_UNPROTECTED_PRIVATE_KEYS=y`.
-   For special needs, you have these options:
    -   You can specify the SSH configuration files individually by
        setting `SSH_FILES` to an array, whose elements are the file
        paths. Elements of this array receive special key protection if
        configured.
    -   You can use `COPY_AS_IS` to copy more files (without special
        treatment).
    -   You can use `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE` to exclude any SSH file from
        being copied.

Is that correct and sufficiently complete or did I miss something
important?

Maybe the documentation could be streamlined a bit. Hopefully some
reasoning that led to the current functionality could be left out. And
standard ReaR functionality, such as using REQUIRED\_PROGS and LIBS to
possibly add support for other SSH versions, could also be left out
here. If you think that some details are important, maybe these should
go into some kind of migration guide or into the release notes.

plus
