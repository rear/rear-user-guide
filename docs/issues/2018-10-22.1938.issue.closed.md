#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.4-git.3115.507837a.unknown /
    2018-10-16

-   OS version: CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core)

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=TSM

-   Hardware: BareMetal

-   System architecture: x86

-   Firmware: BIOS

-   Storage: Local Disks

-   Description of the issue: The UUID is not being updated properly
    after performing a restore.

-   Work-around, if any: Manually editting /etc/fstab prior to system
    reboot

We have two servers that are identical in their configuration which we
were using to test DR. One is running Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / 2018-06-21
which comes with CentOS 7.5 and the other is the version provided above.

When we perform the install on the 2.4-git.3115.507837a version the UUID
is not being updated properly and system will not boot. To resolve the
issue I had to manually update the UUID in /etc/fstab post restore.

@MogiePete  
both your rear-osn02.log and rear-2018-10-17T14%3A47%3A25-0400.log  
do not contain debugging information (i.e. via `rear -D recover`)  
so that I cannot see how they actually differ.

Can you provide logs with full debugging information?

Additionally I need each of the two disklayout.conf files  
of the two servers.

Without debugging information (i.e. a `rear -D recover` log file)  
there is nothing I can do.
