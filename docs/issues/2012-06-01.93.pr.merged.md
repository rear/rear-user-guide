I worked over the ebuild in /usr/share/rear/contrib to make it Gentoo
compliant as stated on
[http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/index.html](http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/index.html)

The ebuild went through several reviews and has received Gentoo
developer approval for being ready-as-is for portage tree. I deleted
obsolete functions and variables, fixed the ebuild header, adjusted the
image creation (ebuild image != rear image) and added a use-flag for
installing the udev rule to leave it to user's choice. The installation
of any documantion is missing in the current ebuild, which I fixed as
well.

As long as no additional directories will be added to rear's root
directory, this ebuild should work for any future releases, as well.

If you decide to merge this into master I will go ahead and start
writing a Gentoo overlay XML. Opposed to the current Sunrise Overlay we
can announce an own overlay and host the rear.ebuild directly through
github without me having to go through an approval process for every
version bump, as I currently do on Sunrise.

Regards,  
Brian

Looks ok, for what I can understand of it. Thanks for your contribution

For some reason, not clear to me as I cannot seem to trace it, the
rear.ebuild disappeared. So I am going to get the contents from this
pull-request and add it again.
