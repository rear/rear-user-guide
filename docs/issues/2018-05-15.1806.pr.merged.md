Using 'vgcfgrestore' to restore Thin LVs doesn't work, because there  
isn't the metadata in the configuration file.  
To be able to use Thin LVs, upon failure of 'vgcfgrestore' (or
migration),  
traditional 'vgcreate/lvcreate' are used instead.

This approach is sub-optimal because it requires to know all the  
possible options to 'lvcreate', which is hard/impossible to do.  
Nonetheless, this is better than nothing since the issue with
'lvcreate'  
options was already there in case of migration.

The code using 'lvcreate' only runs upon 'vgcfgrestore' failure, which  
typically happens only with Thin LVs (IMHO). Hence, on most setups,
the  
optimized code will still run, preventing any regression to happen.

PLEASE TEST MORE.

I tested as follows:

-   regular system with 1 VG, no thin pool
-   system with 1 VG, and root filesystem on thin pool + some special
    LVs (mirror, raid1, raid5, etc).

I plan to test tomorrow on a system with 1 VG, no thin pool but some
special LVs (mirror, raid, etc) to verify that `vgcfgrestore` also works
with special LVs.

The proposed code does the following:

1.  During backup

-   Collect additional LV properties

    origin: originating LV (for cache and snapshots)  
    lv\_layout: type of LV (mirror, raid, thin, etc)  
    pool\_lv: thin pool hosting LV  
    chunk\_size: size of the chunk, for various volumes  
    stripes: number of stripes, for Mirror volumes and Stripes volumes  
    stripe\_size: size of a stripe, for Raid volumes

-   Skip caches and snapshots (not supported)

1.  During restore

-   If in Migration mode (e.g. different disks but same size), go
    through the vgcreate/lvcreate code (Legacy Method), printing
    Warnings because the initial layout may not be preserved (because we
    do not save all attributes needed for re-creating LVM volumes)

-   Otherwise, try "vgcfgrestore"

-   If it fails

    -   Try "vgcfgrestore --force"
    -   If it fails, use vgcreate/lvcreate (Legacy Method)
    -   Otherwise, remove Thin pools (which are broken due to --force
        flag)
    -   Create Thin pools using Legacy Method (but do not create other
        LVs which have been succesfully restored)

@gdha  
I am currently too busy with other stuff so that I cannot have a look
here right now.  
Is this enhancement useful for ReaR 2.4 or can it be postponed to ReaR
2.5?

Thin pools are widely used along with docker.  
The code has been implemented to prevent any regression when not using
thin pools (the vgcfgrestore should just work). When in migration mode,
the code should enhance the recovery, but this requires some testing (I
tested with Thin pools, Linear volumes and Raid/Mirror volumes).

Hello @rmetrich at first glance it looks good to me. I'm however not
that good in reading plain code :-/ ...  
But I can run couple of tests during this weekend if needed ...

@rmetrich End of next week I can do some automated tests - this weekend
is occupied (marriage of my daughter and other work duty unfortunately).
Beginning of next week I take a few days off to really relax (in Germany
and Luxembourg).

Additional note: **ReaR 2.4** is OK for me as my main customer is also
struggling with these kind of stuff (with docker containers). *And, I
believe RedHat had plans to replace there 2.0 version with the latest
2.4 if I'm not mistaken.*

üëç Perfect!  
We have indeed plans to rebase to 2.4 asap (RHEL7.6), but it's not
committed.

@rmetrich  
only a side note FYI in general  
regarding what you wrote in your initial comment

<pre>
This approach is sub-optimal because it requires to know all the
possible options to 'lvcreate', which is hard/impossible to do.
</pre>

You may have a look at my general opinion about such cases  
e.g. in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513\#issuecomment-332123766](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513#issuecomment-332123766)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204\#issuecomment-282252947](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1204#issuecomment-282252947)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242\#issuecomment-288349895](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1242#issuecomment-288349895)  
and in the latter follow the links to the other issue comments.

But I know basically nothing at all about Thin Pool/Volume or even
docker  
so that I don't know if it could make any sense in this particular
case  
to implement config variables where the user could - if needed -
specify  
his particular settings for his particular Thin Pool/Volume setup.

@rmetrich  
another side note FYI in general regarding "when in migration mode":

When in migration mode it is perfectly fine to ask the user  
via the UserInput function for needed values and/or let him  
check and confirm something before it gets actually set up.

Only when not in migration mode "rear recover" should normally  
run unattended - but even if UserInput is also needed in this case  
the user could predefine UserInput values to get it run unattended,  
cf. the USER\_INPUT\_... variables in default.conf

@rmetrich,  
I tried your patch on a sles11sp4 (POWER arch). I got the following
error during `rear recover`

    No code has been generated to recreate fs:/ (fs).
        To recreate it manually add code to /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh or abort.
    UserInput -I ADD_CODE_TO_RECREATE_MISSING_FSFS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/600_show_unprocessed.sh line 33
    Manually add code that recreates fs:/ (fs)
    1) View /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
    2) Edit /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
    3) Go to Relax-and-Recover shell
    4) Continue 'rear recover'
    5) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '4' timeout 10 seconds)

FYI, the layout is LVM sles11 default:  
/boot in a partition  
/ in LVM

I don't have time to look at the reason why ... but just to be sure I've
tested several time. I also confirm that I don't get any problem with
the current master branch on this system.

I attache the log file of `rear -D recover` in debug mode  
[rear-rear-sles11-144.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2019653/rear-rear-sles11-144.log)

I'm gonna test on other system (SLES12 / RHEL7 / RHEL6 and ubuntu)

@schabrolles From the Debug log, I do not see any `create_lvmvol()`
call, causing the issue.  
Can you provide the Debug log for the rescue creation, it's likely there
that the issue is.

The issue is on /dev/mapper/rootvg-lvroot which has no `lvmvol`

This is due to my new code (me--) which seems to not work with your LVM

I prefer the default behaviour with non-squashed commits  
(i.e. keep the individual commits in a pull request as they happened  
to keep the history of how something was implemented)  
because the final merge commit that merges a whole pull request  
into the ReaR upstream master code is such a squashed commit.

the individual commits "inside" the pull request

Alright, not touching anything then. I also prefer having the history.

I noticed that REAR was not backing up physical device thin pools,
today...  
Not lost anything, just noticed on recovery the old data was still in
the thinpool

However.....  
Just thinking of a case recently.(this week)

I had a "thinpool" that was mapped to a BLOCK FILE ,then remounted on
loop, and REAR obviously dealt with it correctly because it was a
physical file on /dev/sda ,in the directory tree.  
REAR is capable of this case since it sees a file in a directory, the
config for LVM is something separate.

So possibly we may need to be careful, since in this case LVM "sees" a
thin pool, but actually it is a "lie." it's actually a raw image mounted
as loop.

We may get into a situation where "REAR" backs it up correctly, as a
general file , BUT then backs it up AGAIN as an LVM thin pool, in this
situation how would it re-create the physical device  
or not get confused it is actually a file mounted as a "block device"?
