Rear v2.7 was released in July 2022 (2 years ago), therefore,  
the time has come to start on the preparations of a new major release
v3.0.

The ReaR release process is described at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

We could add a "blocker" label on the issues we think that should/must  
be included in the v3.0 release. This means we should check all
current  
issues with the label "ReaR v2.8" and make a decision.  
Other issues, with a label "ReaR v2.8" that can wait must be relabeled
with  
a "ReaR v3.1" (or "ReaR Future") label.

Also, when you are testing the pre-3.0 release make a note in our WIKI
page:

@rear/contributors  
because we already had some discussions about ReaR 3.0:  
What about releasing what is currently labeled ReaR 2.8  
as ReaR 3.0?

As usual I will make the release notes for ReaR 3.0  
i.e. a new  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-3-0.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-3-0.md)  
from which a new  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
will be made as described at

    Convert the release notes from the ReaR web pages into a simple text file

in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process\#preparation](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process#preparation)
