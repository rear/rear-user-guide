We search for an option to actively set NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY
to no.

Reason: We have one volume which we need to backup using DD instead of
tar. Therefore we have a two step rear backup where we do the following:

`/sbin/rear mkbackup && /sbin/rear -C luks mkbackuponly`

We would like to rename the latest backup to ".old" when we start to
create a new backup. But our issue is that the backup will be renamed a
second time when we run the backup of our luks volume.

It would be nice if we can set NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY = n in our
luks.conf.

NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY is a boolean variable  
that behaves as described in default.conf

    # Boolean variables can be set to anything
    # as we only check whether the variable is not empty
    # so that both VAR=yes and VAR=no evaluate to boolean 'true'.
    # To set a boolean variable to 'false' set it to an empty value.
    ...
    # Keep an older copy of the backup
    # (mv $NETFS_PREFIX $NETFS_PREFIX.old before we copy the new version)
    # empty means only keep current backup:
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=

So `NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=''` in your luks.conf should help.

@dragon299  
thank you for your prompt feedback.  
It helps us a lot to also get explicit feedback when things work.
