@schlomo @pcahyna  
feel free to do with this pull request what you like.  
In foreseeable future I will not find the time  
to implement a proper fix.

@schlomo  
thank you for your review and for merging it as is!

Of course I am not happy with such dirty hacks  
but I have several other things I want to get done  
which I consider more important in practice for our users.
