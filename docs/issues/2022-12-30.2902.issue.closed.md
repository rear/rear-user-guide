-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Creating a rescue/recovery environment does not include IPv6 only
NICs.  
In our case there is an IPv6 only NIC to access the AVAMAR backup
service.  
Without this NIC no recovery can take place.  
Due to the following line

    for network_interface in $( ip r | awk '$2 == "dev" && $8 == "src" { print $3 }' | sort -u ) ; do

currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/973e102cc14db0126e1a4cb029feb339bacae49f/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh\#L961](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/973e102cc14db0126e1a4cb029feb339bacae49f/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh#L961)  
just IPv4 routing NICs are chosen  
which restricts preparing the rescue/recovery networking.  
The issue is reproducible with ReaR 2.4 and 2.7.

-   Workaround, if any:

To get all NICs included I changed the above line and simplified it to

    for network_interface in $( ls /sys/class/net/ | sort -u ) ; do

Since the network interface setup will checked on if they are UP,  
have an IP and are linked to a pyhsical device I selected to go  
with the "raw" output of network devices first.

@hpannenb ReaR has knowledge of `AVA` (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/966d10e9b862f7f005983b6dc81fc0905915edba/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2194](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/966d10e9b862f7f005983b6dc81fc0905915edba/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2194)),
however, you seem to use `AVA00` -&gt; what is the difference? Do we
need an update of the complete `AVA` code? If yes, why not prepare of PR
for it?  
Have a nice 2023.

@gdha I know there is an AVA implementation. The Avamar usage is quiet
new to me in the company I am working for; AVA00 seems to be a slightly
modified workflow I currently have to use. I first need to drill into
the new setup to decide on PRs in the AVA area. :-)

@jsmeix In this issue I would rather concentrate on the IPv6 only NIC
problem/bug which I could work around for my environment. I also tried
in a CentOS7 VM at home and could reproduce the situation; it is all
about the line of code I already point to which excludes IPv6 only NICs:

Happy New Year!

@hpannenb  
I am wondering why you need `sort -u` because  
I think `ls /sys/class/net/` cannot show duplicates  
because duplicate filenames should not happen here \[\*\]  
and `ls` output should be sorted alphabetically.

The code

    # Use output of 'ip r' to keep interfaces with IP addresses and routing only
    for network_interface in $( ip r | awk '$2 == "dev" && $8 == "src" { print $3 }' | sort -u ); do

was added by @rmetrich in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/15567ede425401b008e5b1680db36a2c62752b8f](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/15567ede425401b008e5b1680db36a2c62752b8f)  
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1574)  
so I would like to let him have a look at your proposed changes here.

In particular because I fail to see his reason behind  
why he only keeps interfaces with routing.  
I guess it is meant to exclude interfaces like `lo`  
(i.e. to only keep "normal" interfaces for real outer networks)  
but I am not a sufficient networking expert  
to fully imagine the actual reason behind.

For example on my homeoffice laptop I have  
(the laptop has WLAN hardware but intentionally I do not use it  
because for homeoffice security reasons I use wired ethernet  
and the virbr0 is for KVM/QEMU virtual machine networking):

    # ip -4 r
    default via 192.168.178.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100 
    192.168.122.0/24 dev virbr0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.1 linkdown 
    192.168.178.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.178.45 metric 100 

    # ip -4 r | awk '$2 == "dev" && $8 == "src" { print $3 }' | sort -u
    eth0
    virbr0

    # ls -l /sys/class/net/
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan  2 08:59 eth0 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.5/0000:03:00.0/net/eth0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan  2 08:59 lo -> ../../devices/virtual/net/lo
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan  2 09:00 virbr0 -> ../../devices/virtual/net/virbr0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan  2 08:59 wlan0 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.6/0000:04:00.0/net/wlan0

    # ip -6 r
    ::1 dev lo proto kernel metric 256 pref medium
    2001:a61:2a96:1801::/64 dev eth0 proto ra metric 100 pref medium
    2001:a61:2a96:1800::/56 via fe80::7eff:4dff:fe5d:42b1 dev eth0 proto ra metric 100 pref medium
    fd00::/64 via fe80::7eff:4dff:fe5d:42b1 dev eth0 proto ra metric 100 pref medium
    fe80::/64 dev eth0 proto kernel metric 100 pref medium
    default via fe80::7eff:4dff:fe5d:42b1 dev eth0 proto ra metric 100 pref medium

Perhaps it might be better to call both `ip -4 r` and `ip -6 r`?

In particular because I don't know how far `ls /sys/class/net/`  
works backward compatible for all those old and older  
Linux distributions that are still supported by ReaR, cf.  
"ReaR 2.7 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems"  
at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L3830](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L3830)

On the other hand when `ls /sys/class/net/` works sufficiently  
backward compatible I would prefer it because it is simpler and  
more straightforward than `ip ... | awk ... | sort ...`  
cf. "Code must be easy to read"  
and "Code must be easy to understand" in

@rmetrich  
could you have a look here - as far as time permits?

@hpannenb  
proposes to change in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
the lines

    # Use output of 'ip r' to keep interfaces with IP addresses and routing only
    for network_interface in $( ip r | awk '$2 == "dev" && $8 == "src" { print $3 }' | sort -u ) ; do

to something like

    # Use the "raw" output of 'ls /sys/class/net/'
    # since the network interfaces are checked
    # if they are UP, have an IP,
    # and are linked to a pyhsical device:
    for network_interface in $( ls /sys/class/net/ ) ; do

because `ip r` lists only IPv4 network interfaces  
but @hpannenb has IPv6 only NICs which get ignored.

@pcahyna  
in particular because @hpannenb uses RHEL  
I would like when you could have a look here.

1.  I left `sort -u` in my workaround due not not knowing if there would
    be any further implications on using this approach.
2.  E.g. `lo` interface is anyway kept out since there is no real device
    connected to it; see
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/973e102cc14db0126e1a4cb029feb339bacae49f/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh\#L153](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/973e102cc14db0126e1a4cb029feb339bacae49f/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh#L153)
3.  To me the usage of `ls /sys/class/net/` looks "compatible enough"
    since it is in use within ReaR for quiet some time (ref. to
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/07c0385e931ffad1a79d7ea841a6d3f978f0bea9/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31\_network\_devices.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/07c0385e931ffad1a79d7ea841a6d3f978f0bea9/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31_network_devices.sh)).
4.  IMHO there are new user options available for NICs (i.e.
    `EXCLUDE_NETWORK_INTERFACES=()`) giving the user enough power to
    excluded unwanted NICs instead of implicitly filtering them
    elsewhere.

I could test my PR on several RHEL7 VMs in lab and production VMWare
based environment. This showed no flaws or constraints having hybrid
IPv4/6 and IPv6 only NICs. Also on my CentOS 7 based VM at home I did
not find an issue.

It would be appreciated if others could test this PR in their
environments as well.

@jsmeix @pcahyna : I do not see any further issues due to the PR's
minimal invasive change to the current code.

With

@hpannenb  
thank you for your issue report,  
your analysis what the root cause is,  
and for your fix that improves ReaR  
to be usable also with IPv6 only NICs!
