While working on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2364](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2364)  
I found (excerpts):

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS='
    ...
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/410_restore_backup.sh:
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --selinux"
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --xattrs"
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --xattrs-include=\"*.*\""
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --exclude-from=/tmp/restore-exclude-list.txt "

    usr/share/rear/backup/YUM/default/500_make_backup.sh:
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --selinux"
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --xattrs"
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS --xattrs-include=\"*.*\""

Those must be fixed to

    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS+=( additional elements )

@N3WWN  
I have a question:

It seems support for BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED  
(and its related config variables) is missing in  
backup/YUM/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
while it seems to be there in  
restore/YUM/default/410\_restore\_backup.sh  
and in  
restore/YUM/default/405\_recreate\_users\_and\_groups.sh

I don't see something about backup encryption in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/14-ZYPPER-and-YUM.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/14-ZYPPER-and-YUM.adoc)

How is backup encryption meant to work with BACKUP=YUM?

all `YUM` scripts that use `BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS`

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS' | grep YUM

    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/405_recreate_users_and_groups.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/410_restore_backup.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/YUM/default/500_make_backup.sh

should now be fixed regarding using BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS as string  
while actually it must be used as an array.

@jsmeix That's a very good question! ;)

I have never used encryption with my backups and suppose I didn't catch
that it was partially implemented.

Not seeing an issue for this, should I open one and either implement
backup encryption or remove it entirely?

How would you prefer I proceed.

Thanks!

@N3WWN  
right now I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2374](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2374)  
so the issue is described and false usage is now prohibited via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0c4c49cbdfb58899390c82f5c6bd8a86790db411](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0c4c49cbdfb58899390c82f5c6bd8a86790db411)

Because BACKUP=YUM is a rather special backup method  
there is no current need to implement support for  
BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED  
but of course it would be nice to have it supported.

If you like to add support for BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED  
see the other scripts where that is currently used in particular  
backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh and  
restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh and copy its code.  
In particular note the special coding that is mandatory to avoid  
that secret values show up somewhere (e.g. in the log with `set -x`).
