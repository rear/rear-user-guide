It would be nice if Synology would ship with something that would enable
it out-of-the-box to be used in a standardized way with
Relax-and-Recover. What do others think ?

Yes, that would be nice. Since Synology is a NAS I would guess that
NFS/CIFS-based backups with PXE boot would be a feasable thing. Most
likely a Synology already includes all the server components (NFS, CIFS,
DHCP, TFTP) so that the ReaR module would only have to tie them together
with useable configuration.

Another thing could be that we don't do PXE but USB-based booting. Then
the user should be able to put a USB stick into the NAS box and use a
GUI function to create a bootable USB stick for a target system.

BTW, in [ReaR Server
Proposal](//www.slideshare.net/schlomo/rear-server-proposal-10) I once
collected some thoughts on how to build a ReaR server.

Indeed a good idea! Perhaps [http://drlm.org/](http://drlm.org/) could
be dumped on it? However, it still need tweaks at the client side as
well.  
On the other, the NAS box can already be used as a NFS storage location,
and as such it already supports rear out-of-the-box, no? To use more
fancy things, like becoming a PXE boot server then it needs some more
configuration...

Right, my idea was something more integrated. Or in the worst case a
section in the documentation of how to configure it in a secure way. NFS
is not the most secure solution (unless you have complete control of the
infrastructure), I'd much rather prefer something like RBME myself :-)

Since I would like to set this up at home, let me think about it and
figure something out to discuss...

Synology is easy to configure via the command line to become a NFS
server or RSYNC server. As there is no-one interested for sponsor this I
close it for the time being.
