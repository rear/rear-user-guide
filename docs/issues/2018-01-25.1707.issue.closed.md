-   Brief description of the issue: Unable to restore from Netbackup
    getting standard policy restore error  
    We have installed rear package through redhat 7 repo and configured
    the local.conf to integrate the rear backup with netbackup.

Netbackup team successfully take OS full backup and we successfully
create ISO with rear mkrecover command.

We boot the server with ISO and seletct first option "Recover
"Hostname"" which leads to start the restoration after asking the
username and 2 times enter to take default option (Hostname and last
full backup) but it went fail with standard policy restore error.

We have checked with network there is no firewall or port blocked
between netbackup servers and test servers.

Could you please guide us to resolve this issue.

-   Work-around, if any:

@shail1774

I do not use any of the third-party backup tools  
so that I can neither reproduce any issue nor fix or  
enhance things that are related to third-party backup tools.

In general regarding third-party backup tools and ReaR see  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Perhaps there is another ReaR user here who uses  
BACKUP=NBU stuff (Symantec/Veritas NetBackup)  
who could help you with BACKUP=NBU specific issues.  
If not you would have to debug this issue on your own.

@shail1774 As we do not have the required equipment and tools I've added
the label "needs sponsorship" Perhaps, someone can help you with an
in-depth NBU knowledge?

@shail1774 if you have a RH subscription contract you could open a
support case at RH for further assistance as you are using the rear
version from RHEL7 repo.
