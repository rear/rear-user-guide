-   How was this pull request tested?

With

    { BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY='my_backup_crypt_key' ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

in local.conf  
I get

    # usr/sbin/rear dump | egrep 'BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY|OUTPUT_LFTP_PASSWORD'

    [no output]

versus

    # usr/sbin/rear -e dump | egrep 'BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY|OUTPUT_LFTP_PASSWORD'

      BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY="my_backup_crypt_key"
      OUTPUT_LFTP_PASSWORD=""

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/dump-workflow.sh  
do not show the value of variables  
which could contain secret values  
unless sbin/rear was called with --expose-secrets.

To implement this in a generic way  
a new array SECRET\_VARIABLES gets set in default.conf  
which contains the names of those variables  
which could contain secret values, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967\#issuecomment-1497382823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1497382823)

If needed the user can add more names to this array.

The only thing which really matters here is  
the name of the new config variable

    SECRET_VARIABLES

because we cannot easily change the user interface.

Anything else is ReaR internal which can be changed  
as needed at any time later as we like.
