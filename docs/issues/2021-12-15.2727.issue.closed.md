-   Description:  
    `MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' 'other_module' )` causes only loaded
    modules to get included as soon as `loaded_modules` is in the array.
    I think it would be more usefull to have a mode for including loaded
    modules and some other modules in addition.  
    For example loaded modules normally guarantee the system is working
    on the same machine if it was working before. On recover however you
    may need to configure network interfaces a bit different e.g. with a
    vlan. Then you need a additional module for the vlan.

I suggest introducing a new key like `loaded_modules_plus` for this
functionallity so old config does not get broken. In case breaking is
okay I suggest to change the current `loaded_modules` to this behaviour
and add `loaded_modules_only` in addition.

see build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh

-   Workaround, if any:  
    `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`

@DEvil0000  
could you describe why the default `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`  
does not work for your specific use case?

The reasoning for the default `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`  
is explained in default.conf - currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1440](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1440)  
with links to issues that show some more details and examples  
why `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` is basically the only reliably working
way  
when migrating to different hardware.

An exception is when one does manual tests in advance  
what exact kernel modules are needed on each kind of different
hardware  
so that one has exact lists of kernel modules that one can specify as  
MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' ... )

Because currently MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' ) also adds  
those in MODULES\_LOAD another workaround could be  
to specify additionally needed kernel modules via MODULES\_LOAD  
but then those kernel modules would get loaded during  
recovery system startup in any case.

By the way regarding different networking hardware:  
Some NICs require firmware upload so one may have to  
also care about FIRMWARE\_FILES when one does not  
use the default here.

When I understand why the default MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
is not sufficient for this or that specific use cases,  
I would prefer to enhance it so that  
`MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'loaded_modules' 'moduleY' )`  
includes all loaded modules plus moduleX and moduleY.

Hmmm...  
default.conf reads (excerpts)

    # An empty MODULES=() setting means that the currently loaded
    # kernel modules get included in the recovery system
    ...
    # MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' ) where additional kernel modules
    # can be specified to be included in the recovery system
    # in addition to the ones via an empty MODULES=() setting.

but as far as I see from plain looking at the code in
400\_copy\_modules.sh  
neither MODULES=() nor MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )  
includes the currently loaded kernel modules  
so it seems we have a bug here...

`MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` just increases the size quite a bit (which
increases creatin time, storage needed, bandwidth used and boot time -
especially over a slow network with pxe boot) this is why I am looking
into this.

`MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )` may not include some modules which may
still be needed later like the vlan module.

`MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )` maintaining a long list is a option
but not exactly readable and a lot of work. So my idea was to use
something like this `MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'loaded_modules' 'moduleY' )`
as a good path in between.

I am aware of the firmware 'issue' but I know that I only need one
specific rtl firmware and nothing else so I maintain a list for those. I
can recommend

The initial request in this issue here is its title

    [MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' ) only loading loaded but no additional modules

asks for an enhancement.

That current behaviour is documented in default.conf

    # The setting MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' ) results that
    # only those kernel modules that are currently loaded
    # get included in the recovery system.

Note the 'only' therein.

Not sure how I should understand your documentation change and comment.
Do you want to implement this at some later point?  
I would still like to have this feature. Loaded modules would not work
reliably for me since some modules may not be loaded all the time.

In current ReaR it is now explicit in default.conf that  
MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' 'additional\_module' )  
is not supported.

This issue is an enhancement request  
for a future ReaR version after the  
upcoming ReaR 2.7 release.

@DEvil0000  
I think there could be a (currently untested) workaround for

    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' 'additional_module' )

because also for `MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )`  
the kernel modules that should be loaded  
during recovery system startup  
i.e. the ones in MODULES\_LOAD  
get copied into the recovery system.

So instead of the unsupported

    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )

you may use

    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )
    MODULES_LOAD+= ( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )

But then 'moduleX' and 'moduleY'  
are not only copied into the recovery system but also  
explicitly loaded during recovery system startup via  
/etc/modules in the recovery system and the startup script  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
which is /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
inside the recovery system.

So this workaround would not help if those additional modules  
should not be loaded during recovery system startup  
but then I wonder why they are added when they are not needed?

See also the MODULES\_LOAD description in default.conf

Stupid me!  
A nice example how a specific question could narrow my mind  
thinking about a specific solution for the specific problem  
while an existing generic solution does not come to my mind.

We do have generic methods in ReaR  
how to include arbitrary things in the recovery system and  
how to exclude arbitrary things from the recovery system:

    COPY_AS_IS+=( ... )
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( ... )

This is also a solution for special cases like this one.

For example to include the kernel modules in

    /lib/modules/.../kernel/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi

except the kernel modules that match

    lib/modules/.../kernel/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl81*

one can use in etc/rear/local.conf

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi )
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE+=( lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl81\* )

This is only a theoretical example.  
I tested that the thereby specified modules are in the recovery system  
but I did not test if only those thereby specified modules are  
sufficient to make that kind of hardware work in practice, cf.

in addition to the currently loaded modules when  
MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' ) is specified.

I myself will not implement support for

this functionality could be added to ReaR.
