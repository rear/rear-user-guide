The current code related to the find\_duply\_profile function  
and the DUPLY\_PROFILE\* variables looks rather messy.

At least at first glance I cannot make sense of it.

@rear/contributors  
it should be verified before the ReaR 2.8 release  
if third party code could be sourced here  
or if all is reasonably safe.

Duply is a wrapper around duplicity.  
It is up to the end-user to enter his/her password in the configuration
file of duply. We advise **never** to write passwords in plain text
files, but rather use secure key pairs.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2244545130](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244545130)  
I wrote

    I won't try to mitigate that now
    based on guesses about a software
    that I neither have nor know about
    i.e. DUPLICITY with BACKUP=DUPLICITY.

So I won't make a decision here whether or not  
BACKUP=DUPLICITY may source third party code  
because I won't reverse engineer code  
where I never had something to do with and  
where I neither have nor know about the software  
that is used by that code.

When we have obscure code in ReaR that deals with  
third-party (backup) software which we do not have  
and/or where we do not know about,  
i.e. when we have code in ReaR where we do not or cannot  
understand with reasonable effort what it actually does,  
i.e. when we have code in ReaR which we cannot  
maintain with reasonable effort,  
then  
I would rather remove that code to keep ReaR maintainable  
instead of keeping unmaintainable (old) code in ReaR,  
in particular when such code could be a security issue.

In this case it would mean to deprecate BACKUP=DUPLICITY  
(unless someone can and does maintain its code in ReaR).

Maybe we should introduce a list of backup methods with maintainers and
others who "care" about it, or are knowledgable. Based on that we can
then also declare a maturity for every backup method, or a level of
support and commitment to it.

I'd not deprecate and remove it just because it sources something, as
that problem affects only user of Duplicity and not everybody. I'd
remove code where we have no way to know if it works and where we can't
find anybody to care about it.

For that "find somebody to care" we could add a shoutout for help to
`BACKUP=DUPLICITY` to give users of that a chance to come to us and
help. ATM that seems the only way to contact our users (and yes, this is
almost like a useless warning, but maybe OK in this case)

I do care about BACKUP=DUPLICITY. I have it running on clients' servers.

I do not yet understand the problem that's being discussed here or
[there](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244545130).

Do you have something specific you'd like me to run down or to test?

@loyeyoung  
great that you responded!

FIY first my generic "boilerplate"  
regarding third-party backup tools:

    In general regarding third-party backup tools:

    Usually we at ReaR upstream do not have or use
    third-party backup tools so usually we cannot
    reproduce issues with third-party backup tools
    (in particular not if a third-party backup tool
    is proprietary software).

    In case of issues with third-party backup tools
    we at ReaR upstream can usually do nothing
    but totally depend on contributions and help
    from those specific users who use and know
    about each specific third-party backup tool.

This case here is one specific case  
of the generic issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259)

I fail to understand what the BACKUP=DUPLICITY code  
which I mentioned in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2244545130](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244545130)  
actually does.

I think the intent of that code is to read  
all or some needed values from DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE.

I think this is done by executing DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE  
via 'source' as `source $CONF`.

So any command in DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE gets executed  
as 'root' (because usr/sbin/rear runs as 'root').

This means any user who can modify DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE  
can get any command executed as 'root' when  
'root' runs usr/sbin/rear with BACKUP=DUPLICITY

So we need to carefully check if  
executing DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE is really needed  
of if it is possible to improve security  
by only parsing it (without executing it), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3292](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3292)

@loyeyoung  
when you can test if ReaR with BACKUP=DUPLICITY works  
for your particular use case, you could help me a lot  
because then I could try to clean up and improve the  
current "read DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE" code in ReaR  
and you would test and verify that my modifications  
don't break things - at least not for your particular  
use case - which is very much more than no test at all.

@jsmeix I just remember about an old blog
[https://www.it3.be/2015/09/02/rear-using-duply/](https://www.it3.be/2015/09/02/rear-using-duply/)
which showed an example of DUPLY\_PROFILE usage.

For ReaR 2.8 I will now clean up things with  
sourcing DUPLY\_PROFILE\_FILE for BACKUP=DUPLICITY  
to get that code reasonably simple and straightforward  
which will make that stuff reasonably secure to use  
and by the way may make it reasonably maintainable.

I expect to be able to test the changes @jsmeix makes.

> code reasonably simple and straightforward

Much appreciated.

> reasonably secure to use

Methinks the issue is not so much root privileges as
[orthogonality](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/orthogonality-in-software-engineering/).

Bare metal backups require root privileges, both for ReaR and for
whatever third party solution is used for encryption, rotation, etc. So
duply/duplicity will always need root privileges anyway, and sourcing
the config file does not escalate privilege.

However, because the duply and duplicity configuration files are sourced
directly, bash will treat any line in those config files as a command
and try to execute. Because the duply/duplicity developers (and perhaps
end users) are not considering any implications the config file will
have on ReaR, we cannot have any assurance that the duply/duplicity
config file will not cause a problem for ReaR.

It seems that it should be possible to run duply/duplicity without
directly sourcing its config file. I hope to dive into the setup of
duply/duplicity and figure out if ReaR needs to source the config file
at all. (@jsmeix's cleanup of the code will make that analysis much
easier!)

Sourcing files in ReaR does not escalate privileges  
because usr/sbin/rear runs already as 'root'.

But sourcing files in ReaR that are not trustworthy  
to be executed by 'root' is the problem, see the section  
"Protecting Against Code Injections" in  
[https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture](https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture)

Best is to not source files in ReaR that do not need  
to be executed (e.g. ReaR itself needs to source  
its own scripts to get ReaR's own code executed).

Whether or not third-party (backup) software (config) files  
need to be executed is an issue that is on our  
todo list for the next ReaR major version 3.0, see  
[https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture](https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture)

For the current next ReaR version 2.8  
that we want to get released rather soon  
(the last release 2.7. was more than 2 years ago)  
we prefer to keep things working backward compatible  
as far as possible with reasonable effort.

In this case here I do not know what the syntax of the  
duply profile is - I am not a duplicity or duply user.  
Is it full bash syntax (e.g. with "if then else fi")  
or is is restricted to only simple (how simple?)  
bash style varaible assingnments of the form

    NAME=fixed_literal_value

and what quoting characters are allowed  
or is indirection allowed like

    THIS='string of words'
    THAT="prefix $THIS suffix"

and whatnot?

So for now for the 2.8 release I cannot replace  
the possibly insecure sourcing/executing of the  
duply profile with e.g. only 'grep' the needed values  
out of it.

Therefore I decided to enforce that the user must  
explicitly specify his correct and fully trusted  
DUPLY\_PROFILE, see my explanation in default.conf in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3345/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3345/files)

This is a needed backward incompatible change  
to get things reasonably secure right now  
as far as possible with reasonable effort and  
this backward incompatibility is sufficiently easy  
to be solved by the user.

my DUPLICITY code changes are in GitHub master code  
so for testing it you do no longer need to do a

    git checkout jsmeix-source-DUPLY_PROFILE

cf.

instead you can test with GitHub master code directly  
as described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in
