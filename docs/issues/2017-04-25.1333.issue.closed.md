Hi,  
I've been able to use mkbackup to store our backups onto a data domain
cifs share but its been painfully slow, typically around 700 KBps. These
backups are around 200+GB and its taken over 4 days to archive these
backups to the share. I have a couple SLES 12 SP1/2 machines that act
the same.

I have added the REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION=fast which did help a little
bit, maybe ~100KBps but still no where near an acceptable timeframe.  
I have also added the BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=( -I 'gzip -1 -n
-c' ) which didn't have any effect on the speed.

Any other thoughts on how to speed up backups to a cifs share with gzip?

Well CIFS ...

Doing some backups over CIFS gave me (from one virtual machine to
another) ~3MB/s.  
I really don't think that ReaR is troublemaker here.  
Did you try just to transfer some large files to your server using
`mount.cifs` or `smbclient`? How was the performance?

Maybe you have some curious antivirus/firewall/other type of security
<s>malware</s> sofware running on your samba server?

Why are your OS backups over 200GB ?

@jiphen  
in general when you output your (backup) data via network  
(BACKUP=NETFS) ReaR cannot do anything regarding  
data transmission speed in your particular network.

Regarding BACKUP\_URL=cifs://

I am not at all a CIFS user but as far as I see  
the code in ReaR related to using CIFS  
is primarily the mount\_url() function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh

<pre>
mount_url() {
    ...
        (cifs)
            if [ x"$options" = x"$defaultoptions" ];then
                # defaultoptions contains noatime which is not valid for cifs (issue #752)
                mount_cmd="mount $v -o rw,guest //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
            else
                mount_cmd="mount $v -o $options //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
            fi
            ;;
</pre>

Perhaps you could somehow tweak that via special mount options  
to get a faster data transmission speed to your remote CIFS share?

Regarding "backups are around 200+GB":

In general regarding huge backups see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1006\#issuecomment-248862040](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1006#issuecomment-248862040)

In particular regarding how to split huge backups  
into a primary part that is needed to recreate  
the basic system after a disaster happened and  
other parts for application data and things like that see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

In general regarding issues with the backup:

Relax-and-Recover is meant as disaster recovery tool  
to recreate the basic system after a disaster happened, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Relax-and-Recover is neither a backup software nor a  
backup management software and it is not meant to be one, cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think the question is sufficiently answered  
so that I close this issue.

@jiphen  
you can still add comments even when the issue is closed.  
If you find out how one could mount a remote CIFS share  
with special mount options so that data transmission speed  
is faster, please report it here so that we could enhance ReaR  
to use those special mount options by default for CIFS.
