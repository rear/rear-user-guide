CI will test it - see the `testing-farm:` runs

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Add a test plan
([https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/plans.html](https://tmt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/plans.html))
defined using the TMT
([https://tmt.readthedocs.io/](https://tmt.readthedocs.io/)) metadata
format. The test plan currently runs one test:
make-backup-and-restore-iso from
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests)
(see
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/pull/3](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests/pull/3)).
The test plan is executed by Packit using the Testing Farm
infrastructure on the Packit RPM builds for CentOS 8 Stream, CentOS 9
Stream, Fedora 37 and Fedora 38 (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017)
for the reason why not on newer Fedora versions yet).

Since Packit gets triggered on PRs and builds RPMs from the code in the
branch of the PR (more precisely, it merges the PR branch with the
target branch before building,
[https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/\#merge\_pr\_in\_ci](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#merge_pr_in_ci)),
this will serve as a CI test for every newly proposed change.

For those interested in technical details of this test, it is described
in @antonvoznia 's diploma thesis -
[https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/107238](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/107238)
, which has already resulted in our ShellCheck configuration (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2976](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2976)
).

@rear/contributors I think this change is not particularly
controversial, so I would like to merge it soon (ideally this week).

@antonvoznia @pcahyna  
thank you for this enhancement!  
I think such a test (regardless how simple it is)  
helps us a lot to see immediately when very basic things  
would go wrong because of changes in a pull request.

@jsmeix I suggest to rebase open PRs on top of this merge - they will
then benefit from the new test.
