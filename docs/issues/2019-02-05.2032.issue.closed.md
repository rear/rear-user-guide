I'm testing with rear 2.4 on CentOS 7

I'm using the following config:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://10.79.101.135/Backups 
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/cifs"
    BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
    FULLBACKUPDAY="Sun"

On the network share i have:

    05.02.2019  03:34      234780672 rear-test.iso
    05.02.2019  03:34            278 VERSION

    05.02.2019  03:34       43008403 2019-02-05-0333-I.tar.gz

When i try: rear -v recover  
Rear always use archive backup.tar.gz.  
?  
For example use 2019-02-03-0311-F.tar.gz ?  
How use incremental backup file ( 2019-02-05-0333-I.tar.gz ) for recover
system ?  
Sorry for my bad english.

@blagodarno

perhaps incremental and/or differential backup  
does not work for `BACKUP_URL=cifs...`  
(I never tried that - I use only `BACKUP_URL=nfs...`)

See "man rear" e.g. online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and/or usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf e.g. online at  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
that read (excerpt)

    Incremental or differential backup is currently
    only known to work with BACKUP_URL=nfs

but you use `BACKUP_URL=cifs...`

I think one of the scripts that need to be adapted and enhanced  
to support incremental and/or differential backup also for other  
BACKUP\_URL schemes is  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
that is a symlink to  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh

See the sections "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"  
and "How to adapt and enhance Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
for generic info what you could do to adapt and enhance ReaR  
to support incremental and/or differential backup also for other  
BACKUP\_URL schemes.

I.e. run ReaR in debugscript mode with `-D` and inspect what happens  
while the 070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh script runs.

You do not understand me.  
Incremental backup for `BACKUP_URL=cifs...` works well and is
expected.  
The question is in the recovery process.

1.  How to recover on a certain date having a incremental backup ?
2.  What options should i use to recover not from default backup.tar.gz
    but other full backup archive ( for example 2019-02-03-0311-F.tar.gz
    ) ?

@blagodarno  
Hello, there isn't an option to restore to or from an specific date for
the normal internal backup routine of ReaR.  
The same question i mentioned a long time ago too.

I think this issue is sufficiently answered by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2032\#issuecomment-477164692](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2032#issuecomment-477164692)  
and we do not intend to enhance ReaR's internal backup methods  
in this way because ReaR's internal backup methods are not meant  
as a real backup solution, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
that reads (excerpt)

    For demonstration and special use purposes Relax-and-Recover
    also includes an internal backup method, NETFS, which
    can be used to create a simple tar.gz archive of the system.
    For all permanent setups we recommend using something
    more professional for backup ...
