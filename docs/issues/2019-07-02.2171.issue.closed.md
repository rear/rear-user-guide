-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When trying to create a rescue disk on USB, if we pass in a raw device,
ala /dev/sdk ... we're unable to confirm it via udevadm in
usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350\_check\_usb\_disk.sh since this
returns "block"

    TEMP_USB_DEVICE=$(basename $(dirname $(my_udevinfo -q path -n "$REAL_USB_DEVICE")))

-   Workaround, if any:

Simplest way to fix this is to modify the aforementioned script... since
RAW\_USB\_DEVICE won't be set, we can assert it in the third
conditional... since the udevadm info will actually return "sdk" for
example.

@sidrew  
thank you for your explanatory issue report and your fix!

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2172\#issuecomment-508201529](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2172#issuecomment-508201529)  
it seems the root cause of this issue was that  
"rear mkrescue" with `OUTPUT=USB` was called  
without having done "rear format" before, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2172\#issuecomment-508376871](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2172#issuecomment-508376871)

@sidrew  
is my above assumption right?  
If yes, do things work for you after you did "rear format" once  
before you call "rear mkrescue"?

FYI:  
I think I never used `OUTPUT=USB` with `BACKUP_URL=nfs://...`  
(at least I cannot find an older issue where I had used that).  
I had only used `OUTPUT=USB` with `BACKUP_URL=usb://...`  
and for `BACKUP_URL=usb://...` a "rear format" is mandatory.

No, I had already formatted it...

Actually, no... I had formatted the drive... the workflow just takes
USB\_DEVICE and assumes it's a partition on which to install the rescue
disk... from what I can tell. My pull request modified the script that
determines what to assign to RAW\_USB\_DEVICE, in order to figure out
where to put the bootloader, but otherwise uses USB\_DEVICE for putting
rescue and other backup data.

@sidrew  
thank you for the explanation.

As time permits I will have a look and try to reproduce your use case  
but no promises that I will work on that stuff soon  
"quick response is not guaranteed with free support", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

@sidrew  
of course we would appreciate more pull requests from you that  
make OUTPUT=USB work with BACKUP\_URL=nfs://... and  
with a whole disk like USB\_DEVICE=/dev/sdc

I never used a whole disk like USB\_DEVICE=/dev/sdc

For me things had worked with

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdb1
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1532\#issuecomment-339625278](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1532#issuecomment-339625278)

A side note:

That OUTPUT=USB stuff drives me nuts - I already spent so much time  
on various weird issues with that USB stuff. The root cause is that  
the whole USB stuff is basically some kind of "add-on hack" for a
special  
use case that is not well integrated with how the rest of ReaR works,  
see in particular
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1164)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166\#issuecomment-272868388](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166#issuecomment-272868388)

The more I work on OUTPUT=USB issues the more I wished I could  
implement a new OUTPUT=DISK that cleanly works in compliance  
with how rest of ReaR works and afterwards remove the old  
OUTPUT=USB stuff, cf.

Only a short notice for now:

`OUTPUT=USB` together with `BACKUP_URL=nfs://...`  
does not work for me but I did not find time for an analysis.

I guess with current ReaR `OUTPUT=USB` may be only  
meant to be used with `BACKUP_URL=usb://...`

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2172](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2172)  
is only a first step to make `OUTPUT=USB` work with a whole disk
`USB_DEVICE=/dev/sdc`
