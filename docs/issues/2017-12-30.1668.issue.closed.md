-   Brief description of the issue:

<!-- -->

    Creating duplicity archives on 'rsync://root@server//root/backup'
    GPG_OPT =  --gpg-options "--cipher-algo AES" 
    EXCLUDES =  --exclude /proc --exclude /sys --exclude /run --exclude /var/lib/ntp/proc --exclude /root/.cache --exclude /tmp --exclude /var/tmp --exclude /app --exclude /var/app

    Removing the old stuff from server with CMD:

    Enter 'duplicity --help' for help screen.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    If we execute the duplicity by hand we see the real error message:

<!-- -->

    ....
    GPGError: GPG Failed, see log below:
    ===== Begin GnuPG log =====
    gpg: 7581A802: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
    gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: Unusable public key
    ===== End GnuPG log =====

Resolution:
[https://www.hagen-bauer.de/2013/07/gnupg-there-is-no-assurance-this-key-belongs-to-the-named-user.html](https://www.hagen-bauer.de/2013/07/gnupg-there-is-no-assurance-this-key-belongs-to-the-named-user.html)  
And, seems to be correct as we see:

    # gpg --edit-key A1A86DCB

### Perhaps is something we should verify as well in the prep phase?

PS: my GPG keys are generated automatically during the
[rear-automated-testing](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing)
runs. With other words these are worthless to you.

Solution to make the GPG key trusted is as follows:

    [root@client default]# echo $(gpg --list-keys --fingerprint | grep A1A86DCB -A 1 | tail -1 | tr -d '[:space:]'| awk 'BEGIN { FS = "=" } ; { print $2 }' ):6 | gpg --import-ownertru
    gpg: inserting ownertrust of 6
    [root@client default]# gpg --edit-key A1A86DCB

    [ultimate] (1). Root <root@localhost>

Afterwards, by hand the `duplicity` command given above works fine.  
The rear run still fails with
`Command line error: Expected 2 args, got 3` error.

The problem comes from `GPG_OPT= "--cipher-algo AES"` when we leave it
empty it seems to work. Must be the quotes somehow?  
PR 9670264 fixed this.

with `duply` the above problem was fixed by defining in the `conf` file:

    GPG_KEYS_ENC="$(cat /root/root.gpgkey)"
    GPG_KEY_SIGN='disabled'

If you insist of using the GnuPG signing key `duplicity` uses the
**sub** key during the restore
