ReaR 27a, the latest one, on SLES 15.5.

Since output dir is created with 700 permission, I was testing for a
customer `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` a workaround to change permissions for
data in output dir (let's ignore that worl-readable is bad here).

Using `(set -o posix; set)` in my `POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT` I found out that
important ReaR variables are not available inside my script (eg.
PXE\_CONFIG\_URL, BACKUP\_URL etc...).

I workaround that passing the ReaR vars as argument to my script but IMO
having them available by default would be much more helpful.

Any thoughts, comments? Thank you.

Works for me with  
(excerpts from my etc/rear/local.conf on a test VM with rear27a)

    BACKUP_URL=file:///other/
    POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT=( 'echo $BACKUP_URL >/tmp/POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT.stdout' )

After "rear mkbackup" I got

    # cat /tmp/POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT.stdout
    file:///other/

To explicity export specific variables  
you may call `export` as needed in etc/rear/local.conf  
because etc/rear/local.conf is executed as a bash script  
via `source`, cf. the comment in the current  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)

I assume it is sufficiently answered because "no news is good news".  
(If not, reopen it with continuative information.)
