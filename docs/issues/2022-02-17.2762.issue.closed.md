-   Issue description  
    Hello, I´d like to ask if it´s possible to force rear to use
    additional parameters to identify TSM server. On classic machine it
    looks OK but in our case we have few TSM servers where "dsmc"
    command must be used with additional parameter -se=SERVER name.

Example:

-   Will not work as expected

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [root@XXXXXXXXX-503 ~]# dsmc q fi
    IBM Spectrum Protect
    Command Line Backup-Archive Client Interface
      Client Version 8, Release 1, Level 13.2

    Node Name: XXXXXXXXX-503
    Please enter your user id <XXXXXXXXX-503>:

-   We need following parameter:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [root@XXXXXXXXX-503 ~]# dsmc q fi -se=XXXXXXXXX-41
    IBM Spectrum Protect
    Command Line Backup-Archive Client Interface

      2     02/16/2022 17:00:42     XFS     /boot

-   Is it possible to force this parameter in rear configuration or some
    workaround has to be created from our side?

@xslima00 Use `rear dump` to see all possible TSM parameters available,
or check the `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` file if something could
fit your needs. If that is not the case you could try to add it and
propose a pull request to the team.  
Try the command `rear -s mkrescue | grep TSM` to retrieve all TSM
related scripts (that might help you to get started).

TSM\_DSMC\_RESTORE\_OPTIONS looks promising,  
cf. in our GitHub master code currently at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2006](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2006)

In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:  
Usually we at ReaR upstream do not use third-party backup tools  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.  
Nevertheless we try to help as good as we can from plain looking at the
code.  
In this case the code that does the restore with TSM is mainly in  
usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
in our GitHub master code currently  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400_restore_with_tsm.sh)

@xslima00  
you use ReaR 2.4 which is dated June 2018, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
so it is rather old.

I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code because  
the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things  
and if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@gdha @jsmeix Thanks for the hints guys. I was checking TSM scripts used
by rear and found I have to actually modify following:  
/usr/share/rear/backup/TSM/default/500\_make\_TSM\_backup.sh  
/usr/share/rear/output/TSM/default/950\_dsmc\_save\_result\_files.sh  
/usr/share/rear/output/TSM/default/960\_dsmc\_verify\_isofile.sh  
/usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh

Basically all those where command dsmc is used. It was necessary to add
to the end (-se=SERVER1) like in this example:

    grep dsmc /usr/share/rear/output/TSM/default/950_dsmc_save_result_files.sh
    LC_ALL=${LANG_RECOVER} dsmc incremental "${TSM_RESULT_FILES[@]}" -se=SERVER1 >/dev/null
    LC_ALL=${LANG_RECOVER} dsmc archive -archmc="$TSM_ARCHIVE_MGMT_CLASS" "${TSM_RESULT_FILES[@]}" -se=SERVER1 >/dev/null

For some smart reason this command line argument has to be always in the
end so `dsmc q fi -se=SERVER1` works while `dsmc -se=SERVER1 q fi` ends
with error.

I was also checking that rear use automatically default configuration
file /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.opt so I believe my issue would
be solved if it would possible to define which opt file should be used
in local.conf.

Meanwhile I have used following workaround which force rear to use
server parameter:

    #create fake dsmc
    echo '/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmc "$@" -se=SERVER1' > /scripts/dsmc
    chmod 555 /scripts/dsmc

    #crontab entry
    cat /etc/cron.d/rear
    PATH=/scripts/:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin
    00 14 * * 5 root /usr/sbin/rear mkbackup >/dev/null 2>&1

    #local.conf entry
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/scripts/*' )
