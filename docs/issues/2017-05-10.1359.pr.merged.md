Do not yet merge it.  
This is only a very first attempt mainly FYI  
so that you could have a very first look.  
For now I only tested that the current default behaviour  
did not change for me (on SLES12), nothing else is tested yet.

Hi.  
I am new to this git stuff and I don't know if this is the correct place
for this comment.  
I have noticed that if I create a rescue disk on a headless system (no
keyboard or screen) and then I have to do a restore the usb keyboard
doesn't work. So if I need to enter anything on the screen I can't.  
I got around this problem by using a computer without a usb keyboard.  
Once I restored the system I plugged a USB keyboard into the restored
system and then created a rescue disk and then I tested that rescue disk
and the usb keyboard worked. I could enter things via keyboard.  
So my question is how can I insert the modules for a usb keyboard into
the rescue disk?  
Maybe have the usb modules for keyboard loaded by default?  
Other than that problem the restore worked well.  
Thanks

@ubeaut  
please use a separated GitHub issue  
to report things with USB keyboards.  
In general when reporting issues see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
In particular regarding USB keyboards have a look  
at the comments in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1244](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1244)  
Do you use current ReaR GitHub master code?

@schlomo

I agree that MODULES=( 'all' ) should mean  
all modules that match $KERNEL\_VERSION  
because no other kernel exists in the recovery system.

Regarding the ResolveModules and ModulesCopyTo  
functions: For my very first attempt I do all directly  
in the script. Later I will see to what extent it helps  
to extract things into separated functions. Then  
I may adapt linux-functions.sh appropriately.

Regarding the artificial 'for' loop:  
Depending on the particular case I prefer it  
over lengthy global 'if elif else fi' or 'case' constructs  
which add unnecessary levels of nesting and indentation.  
The artificial 'for' loop is my general way to make an  
arbitrary code block wherefrom I can jump forward  
and out at any place.  
It is my way to implement 'goto' as it is normally used  
in C to jump straight forward usually to some kind of  
"finishing" or "cleanup" code at the bottom, cf.

Now EXCLUDE\_MODULES are removed in any case,  
also for MODULES=( 'all' ) and MODULES=( 'loaded' )  
so that the user has the final power.

@jsmeix, I think that goto doesn't lead to clean code so that I would  
really prefer an if construct here. If the blocks are too long for
your  
taste then this is rather a sign that you should extract the block into
a  
function instead.

@schlomo  
I think we need to agree that we disagree here  
because from my point of view that 'goto' usage  
leads to cleaner code (of course "from my point of view"  
because otherwise I would not implement it this way).  
Perhaps there is a more obvious way in bash  
how to "jump out and straight forward"?  
I think it is a matter of taste who understands  
some kind of coding patterns better than others.

I noticed that I have in "rear -d -D mkrescue" log  
things like (excerpts):

According to

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/230_storage_and_network_modules.sh
</pre>

it seems  
rescue/GNU/Linux/230\_storage\_and\_network\_modules.sh  
was falsely fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d6d1ff253a244dde4dbf5e0b5676150d028f1cf7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d6d1ff253a244dde4dbf5e0b5676150d028f1cf7)  
that reads

<pre>
dropping find error messages
</pre>

but implements it by adding '2&gt;&1' that results

<pre>
..._DRIVERS=( $( find ... 2>&1 | sed ... ) )
</pre>

which adds the find error messages to the module arrays.  
I really appreciate the commment in that commit that tells what  
it intent is so that I can now easily fix it (without blind guessing  
what might have been actually meant with strange looking code).

FYI: This is still work in progress and  
under somewhat heavy development  
but I think I make good progress towards  
more reliable, predicatable, and configurable  
kernel modules inclusion in the recovery system.

At first glance the current code seems to work too good for me  
(on my SLES12 test system) - so that I believe there must be  
at least one evil regression hidden somewhere ;-)

On my SLES12 test system "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
and "rear recover" work for the default and  
for MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
and MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' )  
and MODULES=( 'no\_modules' ).

Even with MODULES=( 'no\_modules' ) my recovery system  
comes up somewhat successfully to some extent but  
e.g. there is no networking because there is no network  
driver module (and things like that - as expected).

FYI:  
on my SLES12 test system I get  
those recovery system ISO sizes  
by default: 77M  
with MODULES=( 'all\_modules' ): 94M  
with MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' ): 64M  
with MODULES=( 'no\_modules' ): 61M

I made the recovery system ISOs  
with gzip default compression  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1142)  
and with FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'No' )  
cf.

Now I use those more explicit special MODULES values  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'no\_modules' )  
and I adapted my last comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1359\#issuecomment-300829232](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1359#issuecomment-300829232)  
accordingly.

My current code works so well for me that I will merge it  
so that also others can test it and report if there are issues  
or even regressions which I will of course fix.

Please make sure to also test the negative code flows, e.g. if a
module  
cannot be found.

I had tested MODULES=( 'qqqq' ) and got  
in "rear -d -D recover" log

<pre>
++ echo -e 'Copying kernel modules'
++ for module in '"${MODULES[@]}"'
++ module=qqqq
++ module=qqqq
++ modinfo qqqq
++ continue
++ for module in '"${MODULES[@]}"'
++ module=nfs
++ module=nfs
++ modinfo nfs
+++ modprobe --ignore-install --set-version 4.4.21-69-default --show-depends nfs
</pre>

i.e. the non-existent module qqqq is silently ignored  
which is backward compatible - i.e. it matches the  
behaviour in ResolveModules

<pre>
        for module in "$@"; do
            ...
                # Check if the module actually exists
                if ! modinfo $module &>/dev/null; then
                        continue
                fi
</pre>

Now I did a more evil test (on my SLES12 system):

<pre>
# modprobe --dry-run --show-depends lp
insmod /lib/modules/4.4.21-69-default/kernel/drivers/parport/parport.ko 
insmod /lib/modules/4.4.21-69-default/kernel/drivers/char/lp.ko

insmod /lib/modules/4.4.21-69-default/kernel/drivers/char/lp.ko 
</pre>

I have set in local.conf  
MODULES=( 'qqqq' 'lp' )  
and did with the old code

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue
...
Copying binaries and libraries
Copying kernel modules
Omit copying files in /lib*/firmware/ (FIRMWARE_FILES='No')
</pre>

No error about the missing 'parport' modules.

I got same bahavior with my new code

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue
...
Copying binaries and libraries
Copying kernel modules
Omit copying files in /lib*/firmware/ (FIRMWARE_FILES='No')
</pre>

so that I am sufficiently backward compatible  
but I wonder if such errors should better be detected  
and at least reported to the user via LogPrint?

@schlomo  
regarding your above question  
"Why do we need to support old distros seemingly forever?  
IMHO we should be able to draw a line and say that old  
distros stay on old ReaR versions."

In general see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1173](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1173)

I do fully agree and SLES10 is already "out of support", see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
at about line 1328:

<pre>
Rear-2.00 dropped officially support for the following
Linux based operating systems:
  o Fedora <22
  o RHEL 3 and 4
  o SLES 9 and 10
  o openSUSE <11
  o Debian <6
  o Ubuntu <12
</pre>

Unfortunately in this particular case I detected the crappy  
old modinfo behaviour by "bad luck" while playing around  
with the modules stuff also on my SLES10 system (just to  
get some experience how things work in a traditional way)  
but since I knew that misbehaviour I could not "just ignore" it  
so that I tried to make code that should behave reasonably  
even for the crappy old modinfo because I do not want  
to break SLES10 support knowingly as long as I can keep  
it working even on SLES10 (with reasonable effort) and  
perhaps also on whatever other "elderly" systems  
that may also have that crappy modinfo and  
might be even still "supported" by ReaR  
(I don't know what there is on RHEL 5 or CentOS 5).

Next time I will not play around on SLES10 ;-)
