@kodiss

1.  to use another IP address then the original:

-   see FAQ
    [http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq)
    topic IP migration
-   or, you can set it manually once booted via the rescue image
-   or, you can force dhcp with `USE_DHCLIENT=1` in the local.conf file
-   or, while booting the rescue image interrupt the kernel from booting
    and append the following commands to kernel:
    `ip=x.x.x.x. gw=x.x.x.y nm=255.255.255.x`
-   or, while booting the rescue image interrupt the kernel from booting
    and append the following commands to kernel: `dhcp`

1.  rear recover \[file to restore\] - rear purpose is to restore the
    complete base OS, not just one specific file.
2.  recover manual: sorry - we know this is a gab, and we would love to
    write it, but as working on rear is mostly a unpaid job we cannot
    afford the time. However, nothing stops you of asking for it via
    [http://www.it3.be/rear-support/index.html](http://www.it3.be/rear-support/index.html)  
    We will be giving a workshop at
    [http://osbconf.org/workshops/](http://osbconf.org/workshops/) -
    nothing stops you for coming
