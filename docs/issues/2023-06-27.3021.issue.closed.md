Backup (`rear -v mkbackup`) reports that a necessary file is missing. I
don't understand ...

-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.7 / Git
-   OS version: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
-   ReaR configuration files: (attached)
-   System architecture: x86\_64
-   Storage layout: (attached)
-   Description of the issue:  
    I am not sure if this is a `rear` issue yet I cannot find any useful
    information elsewhere. (I've tried!) During backup, I get the
    following message ...

I am not a Debian user  
so I cannot reproduce Debian specific issues.

In general when things are missing in the ReaR recovery system  
you could manually add what is needed via something like

    LIBS+=( /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-shared-252.so )

or

    LIBS+=( /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/*.so* )

in your etc/rear/local.conf file.

See the descriptions about LIBS and COPY\_AS\_IS  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

I see a similar message on Fedora 37:

A quick run of
`ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-252.so` did
report that `libsystemd-shared-252.so` was missing. This is damned
odd.  
I took my question to the [Debian

here what I discover.

Similar on Fedora 37:

libsystemd-shared-251.14-2.fc37.so is actually in /usr/lib/systemd .

I guess that the RequiredSharedObjects function in ReaR  
does not get called for libsystemd-core-252.so  
so libsystemd-shared-252.so is not automatically  
included into the ReaR recovery system.

RequiredSharedObjects is called in  
build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
for all existing programs in PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
and for all libraries in LIBS via

    local all_libs=( "${LIBS[@]}" $( RequiredSharedObjects "${all_binaries[@]}" "${LIBS[@]}" ) )

and RequiredSharedObjects is called in  
build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
for all executable files in COPY\_AS\_IS via

    for required_library in $( RequiredSharedObjects "${copy_as_is_executables[@]}" ) ; do

So when libsystemd-core-252.so is not specified in LIBS  
but gets included into the recovery system via COPY\_AS\_IS  
and when libsystemd-core-252.so is not an executable file  
then RequiredSharedObjects is not called for libsystemd-core-252.so  
so libsystemd-shared-252.so gets not automatically included  
and when libsystemd-shared-252.so is not explicitly  
specified to be included into the recovery system  
then libsystemd-shared-252.so is missing in the recovery system.

@pcahyna  
Ah!  
It seems the library configuration on the original system  
(i.e. things like `ldconfig` and so on)  
could be incomplete when `ldd` does not find it.

FYI:

On my current openSUSE Leap 15.4 system  
I have systemd-249.16 which contains only  
/usr/lib/systemd/libsystemd-shared-249.so  
and I noticed no issues with that in ReaR.

After "rear -D mkrescue" I get:

    # find /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs | grep libsystemd

    /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs/usr/lib64/libsystemd.so.0
    /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs/usr/lib64/libsystemd.so.0.32.0
    /var/tmp/rear.Dw2DUk0fyAfXiN6/rootfs/usr/lib/systemd/libsystemd-shared-249.so

and my var/log/rear/rear-HOSTNAME.log contains

    + source /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh

As far as I see in particular in  
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/280\_include\_systemd.sh  
and in usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
it seems that  
libsystemd-shared-249.so and libsystemd.so.0  
are not specified in LIBS  
but get included into the recovery system  
via executables in COPY\_AS\_IS or  
via programs in PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
which should normally be the preferred way  
according to my reasoning in

I found [this
post](https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/703825) that
offered some "solutions." Even though the question was asked for Ubuntu,
I found it helpful for Debian.

TL;DR

One-off solution:

`sudo bash -c "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-shared-252.so" rear -v mkbackup`  
(untested)

... OR ...

create an file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d`  
(This is the method I chose.)

I created `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libsystemd-core.conf`  
... into which I put `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd`  
I then ran `sudo ldconfig`

A run of `ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-252.so`
now resolves `libsystemd-shared-252.so`

I rebooted for good measure and ran a straight `rear -v mkbackup` -- it
ran flawlessly.

I suppose why `libsystemd-core-252.so` has this issue is a question for
the distro and subsystem teams.

This solution from @LiamFry worked -- but on Debian should do
`sudo ldconfig` instead.

Thanks for the correction! I updated my "potential solution," above.

TLDR;

Had to edit /usr/sbin/rear and add

    export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-253.10-1.fc38.so

as other solutions did NOT work.

This is a confusing thing.

Tried ... for Fedora 38:

    echo "/usr/lib/systemd" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libsystemd-core.conf
    sudo ldconfig

Then reboot.

Yes, the solution from @LiamFry works in the sense of building a rescue
system without errors. BUT ... has anyone successfully booted the system
with another device than the original? I have 2 identical servers (one
as a cold stand-by) each only with one nvme-ssd and I'm not able to boot
'the other one' with the rescue system (simulating a ssd crash and its
replacement). Same env like LiamFry (Debian 12, ReaR 2.7) and same
settings for rescue medium like in its local.conf. I tried Debian
installations with Legacy and UEFI boot, OUTPUT=USB and OUTPUT=RAWDISK -
each try to boot the other one results in hanging after 'Booting rescue
system' (UEFI) resp. after 'Probing EDD (edd=off ..) ok'. (Legacy) with
no errors but only power reset helps. However, the server where the
rescue medium was created boots both (USB and dd'ed RAWDISK). So I
suspect there is something on the original device that is needed for
booting the rescue medium, that would be worse in case of a real crash.
I only have this problem in Debian 12, f.i. in Ubuntu 22.04 ReaR works
like expected but I don't want to switch ...

only as a side note FYI regarding

    hanging after 'Probing EDD (edd=off ..) ok'

Check your ReaR recovery system kernel command line arguments  
with your Debian 12 versus with your Ubuntu 22.04  
and look for "console=..." settings.

E.g. for BIOS you can get the  
ReaR recovery system kernel command line arguments  
by selecting in the ReaR recovery system boot menue  
the topmost entry of the form "Recover HOSTNAME" and then  
pressing the \[Tab\] key which shows the kernel command line.

@ufreier how old is ReaR that you are using? Is it the released 2.7, or
current development code from GitHub? With the current code,
USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE='no' should not be needed in most cases (after

I believe I was having the same problem and the code in git as of now
(rear-2.7-1.git.2.0fd8a77a.master) works far better than 2.6 on Fedora
39. I look forward to this being picked up by Fedora's repositories. :)

Hi:  
I don't know if systemd is meant to be "Special library files" as
described in the default.conf. since systemd is used by most
distributions, every user will need to handle that. I just thought if
distribution packager or rear itself can do something so users won't
need to take care of systemd issues in the future.

As said, the only thing fixing it for me was to edit the rear script and
add  
`export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-253.10-1.fc38.so`

After playing around for a bit, the only way I was able to remove the
error was using a file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d`. Adding entries to `LIBS`,
`COPY_AS_IS` and others didn't work. I believe that's because even when
the files exist in the correct path, the test and subsequent ISO-booted
system doesn't know to look there.

On my Fedora system, an `ldd /usr/lib/systemd/systemd` shows:

    # ldd /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd42e1f000)
        libsystemd-core-254.7-1.fc39.so => /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-254.7-1.fc39.so (0x00007f8e19600000)
        libsystemd-shared-254.7-1.fc39.so => /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-254.7-1.fc39.so (0x00007f8e19200000)
       ...

But the systemd executable is only added to the `initrd.cgz` file when
the file referencing `/usr/lib64/systemd` is present in
`/etc/ld.so.conf.d`.

I hope this helps.

It seems like a possible "root cause" could be the fact that our way of
checking for hidden library dependencies with `cd` and `ldd` doesn't
work in all cases  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/58d6ec23941557af097def87ea25b13d340f834a/usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh\#L179](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/58d6ec23941557af097def87ea25b13d340f834a/usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh#L179)

Maybe a solution would be to search for all `lib*` directories in the
rescue system and use them as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`? Or is that too extreme?

I think that there is value to removing such false warnings as they tend
to confuse or scare users. And they make it so much harder to pick up
real errors.

@rear/contributors I think that this problem is somewhat specific to
Systemd after a certain version, at least 252 and later show this. The
general problem is "hidden" libraries and we won't be able to solve it
in a generic fashion.

For quite some proprietary backup software we already added support for
a "custom" `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and I would suggest extending that
mechanism to also include a customer `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for Systemd to
satisfy our `ldd` validation. It won't affect the rescue system if we do
it only in ReaR itself for the validation of libraries.

Maybe in the future we will meet more "special" standard software that
needs a custom library path, and then we should again accomodate it.

Fedora 41 (Rawhide) using libsystemd-256-rc2-1 has the same behaviour.

Applied Liam Fry's fix of creating
`/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libsystemd-core.conf` ... into which I put
`/usr/lib64/systemd` I then ran `sudo ldconfig` has given a clean
creation of the Backup image.

Many thanks for the whole team here for their contributions.

Cheers,  
Garth.

Thank you @GreasyMonkee for the test on Rawhide. I think that we should
note that the `libsystemd-shared` library is *private* to systemd and
therefore not part of the regular library search path. ReaR shows an
error because ReaR checks all binaries for library dependencies and we
need to extend that mechanism to also properly handle private libraries.

As a workaround I think it is OK to modify/hack ReaR - I'd caution
against modifying the system in a way that works against the systemd
design of keeping this library private. Maybe it has no negative side
effect, but maybe it can do more harm somewhere else where you didn't
expect it.

Yes, agreed. I will be keeping an eye on how things behave over the
coming months, if any issues crop up, shall let you know.

By chance I needed to try out ReaR on a Fedora 40 system, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-2163116469](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-2163116469)  
and subsequent comments therein and see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3247](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3247)

So I experienced this issue here myself.

What I found out:

With some recent systemd version  
'rear -D mkrescue' shows something like:

    Testing each binary with 'ldd' and look for 'not found' libraries within the recovery system
    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so requires additional libraries
        libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so => not found
    ReaR recovery system in '/var/tmp/rear.nHDN0gSTgC8zE80/rootfs' needs additional libraries, check /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-linux.log for details

But

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/lib64/systemd/ )

does not help because those libraries  
get already automatically included via  
('rear -D mkrescue' log file excerpts)

    + source /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh
    ...
    ... Adding required library '/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so' to LIBS
    ... Adding required library '/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so' to LIBS

So one gets them in the ReaR recovery system

    # find /var/tmp/rear.nHDN0gSTgC8zE80/rootfs/ -type f | grep libsystemd-

    /var/tmp/rear.nHDN0gSTgC8zE80/rootfs/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so
    /var/tmp/rear.nHDN0gSTgC8zE80/rootfs/usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so

Also something like

    NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY='systemd/libsystemd-core'

does not help to silence the message because  
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
has a comment that explains

    # Only for programs (i.e. files in a .../bin/... or .../sbin/... directory) treat a missing library as fatal

So - at least for now - a message like

    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.4-1.fc40.so requires additional libraries
        libsystemd-shared-255.4-1.fc40.so => not found

can only be ignored.

It is some kind of "false positive" but currently  
I have no good idea how to avoid that without  
breaking the intent of that verification step  
i.e. without the risk of getting "false negatives"  
which would be worse that this "false positive".

Here "positive" and "negative" are meant  
regarding the test to report missing libraries, i.e.  
"positive" means it correctly reported a missing library  
"negative" means it correctly did not report a library  
that can be found in the ReaR recovery system.

Only a totally untested offhanded idea  
how to possibly solve such issues generically:

The crucial part here is that  
libsystemd-shared is needed by libsystemd-core  
but libsystemd-shared cannot be found as usual (i.e. by 'ldd')  
regardless that libsystemd-shared exists in the  
ReaR recovery system.

So my basic idea is to add a verification step  
that tests whether or not a library that is needed  
but cannot be found by usual means (i.e. by 'ldd')  
exists nevertheless in the ReaR recovery system.

When it exists nevertheless in the ReaR recovery system  
we may sufficiently safely assume that things are OK  
and not report that library as missing.
