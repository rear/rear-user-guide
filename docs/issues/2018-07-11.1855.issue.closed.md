    Please revert all overriden changes (BuildRoot & %clean removal).

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Basically, it means we should remove the list of
    `%if 0%{?suse_version}` clauses in the `rear.spec` file. However, we
    already moved this code to `init/default/005_verify_os_conf.sh` and
    `build/default/990_update_os_conf.sh` so we can remove these lines
    if there are no objections from the team

The `rear.spec` in  
[https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/rear/c/1b0370180d627d4c63b51fac0f31073af9935e9d](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/rear/c/1b0370180d627d4c63b51fac0f31073af9935e9d)  
is not the one of our ReaR upstream respository  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)  
so that I think this issue is not a ReaR upstream issue.

I do not mind what `rear.spec` is used at Fedora or at Red Hat  
or at other Linux distributions particular repositories  
so whatever each particular Linux distribution requests for  
their particular `rear.spec` in their particular repository is o.k. for
me.

For example I use my own `rear.spec` for the official `rear` RPM in
openSUSE at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear)

As far as I see our `rear.spec` from our ReaR upstream respository  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)  
is used for our ReaR upstream RPMs at  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear)  
so that our ReaR upstream `rear.spec` should be first and foremost  
in compliance with the requirements of the openSUSE build service  
(and not with Fedora's or Red Hat's or any other Linux distribution's
requirements  
if the different requirements conflict with each other).

@gdha  
provided you agree that this issue is not a ReaR upstream issue,  
can we close it or do you need it to be open for some time?

@jsmeix I would not close this one as the creation of the `os.conf` file
should not be handled by the spec file, and, we already have code in
place whose does this. Therefore, IMHO I think we can remove this part
from the spec file without breaking ReaR.  
This must be tested of course.

@gdha  
but as far as I see in our ReaR upstream rpm.spec  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)  
we do not create `os.conf` - or I fail to see how.

yes we do:

    $ grep -r 'os.conf' .
    ./lib/config-functions.sh:'$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf' and verify that your setup actually works.
    ./lib/config-functions.sh:            test "$OS_VENDOR" || Error "Failed to detect OS_VENDOR. You may manually specify it in $CONFIG_DIR/os.conf"

was a PR which removed the `os.conf` creation from the `rear.spec` file.

ReaR 2.4 and higher are already fixed. Fedora was referring to ReaR 2.3
so we are good.

Seems we overlooked 2 lines added by Fedora people where they are still
complaining about:

    + BuildRoot: %(mktemp -ud %{_tmppath}/%{name}-%{version}-%{release}-XXXXXX)
    and
    + %clean
    + %{__rm} -rf %{buildroot}
    + 
      %files

I close it because it is "fixed/solved/done".

In

that is

both the disabled BuildRoot and the disabled defattr  
need to be reenabled to make it build again on SLES11 RHEL 5 CentOS 5

    Removing the BuildRoot tag would violate
    the "openSUSE:Specfile guidelines"
