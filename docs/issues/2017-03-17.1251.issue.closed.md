I will implement a proper 'init' stage to clean up  
the currently contradicting implementations how  
ReaR initializes itself during usr/sbin/rear startup  
versus what the current 'init' scripts do.

During the discussion in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1229](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1229)  
it became clear that the current 'init' stage is  
basically a quick and dirty retroactively working hack  
to make things like RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL and  
DRLM\_MANAGED somehow work but currently it works  
basically against how ReaR operates by default.

My current untested offhanded idea what kind of scripts  
there should be in the 'init' stage is:

I think that in usr/sbin/rear basically all between

<pre>
# Include default config ...
</pre>

and

<pre>
# Check for and run the requested workflow:
</pre>

should be moved into the 'init' stage.

Accordingly I am thinking about to have basically  
the following scripts in the 'init' stage:

init/default/120\_include\_basic\_functions.sh  
init/default/140\_source\_default\_and\_init\_config.sh  
init/default/160\_start\_logging.sh  
init/default/180\_set\_basic\_exit\_tasks.sh  
init/default/220\_prepare\_update\_server\_access.sh  
init/default/240\_update\_rear\_directories.sh  
init/default/260\_update\_recovery\_system.sh  
init/default/280\_close\_update\_server\_access.sh  
init/default/320\_include\_standard\_functions.sh  
init/default/420\_prepare\_config\_server\_access.sh  
init/default/440\_download\_remote\_config.sh  
init/default/460\_install\_downloaded\_config\_files.sh  
init/default/480\_close\_config\_server\_access.sh  
init/default/520\_source\_config\_files.sh  
init/default/620\_check\_for\_mandatory\_stuff.sh

The current RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL stuff  
would happen via the init/default/2nn\_\* scripts  
and the current DRLM\_MANAGED stuff  
would happen via the init/default/4nn\_\* scripts.

@jsmeix why not rename the scripts to more precise meaning for which
part or external software these are meant for?

My currently - perhaps overoptimistic - idea is  
that I can make the scripts generically usable  
so that specific external software like DRLM  
only needs specific values for generically usable  
config variables.

But let's try to not discuss implementation details too much  
as long as I did not do any coding here.

First I need the new DRLM stuff from @didacog  
so that I can better understand what DRLM needs,  
then I will meditate on it (which could take infinitely ;-)  
and afterwards I will do some initial coding and get  
feedback from @didacog if I do it in the right way.

Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1229\#issuecomment-287004509](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1229#issuecomment-287004509)

<pre>
I will implement it in a way so that it is useful
on its own (which I can test on my systems)
and also so that it is in particular useful
for DRLM_MANAGED=y
(which @didacog needs to test on his systems).
</pre>

I won't do that.  
I have no time for cleanup without an actual benefit for the user.  
I might do it when the current mess actually hurts us.
