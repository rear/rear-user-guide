Reported by Shabahang Elmian on the mailing list.

If disks of source and destination are not same, script switches to
manual mode, and asks to map disk. if there are lots of available disks
(special files) , the choices will be a long list and only the last
lines can be displayed on screen. Seems that it needs formatting on
output(eg. less the output)
