Insert an SD card into /dev/sdb such that it appears populated with a

@mdbr000  
did you test and verify with a previous ReaR version  
that "rear recover" actually does work for you  
when you have no SD card in /dev/sdb ?

This error exit is new since my recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2804)  
therein this new tests

    # Ensure syntactically correct 'disk' entries:
    # Each value must exist and each value must be a single non-blank word so we 'test' without quoting the value:
    test $devname || Error "Invalid 'disk' entry (no disk device name for '$disk')"
    test $devsize || Error "Invalid 'disk $devname' entry (no device size for '$devname')"
    test $disktype || Error "Invalid 'disk $devname' entry (no partition table type for '$devname')"

in particular the last test which is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh\#L409](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh#L409)

It tests based on the "Disk layout file syntax" description in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
which reads (excerpts)

    Angle brackets "<" and ">" delimit a value ...
    ...
    Square brackets "[" and "]" indicate an optional parameter.
    ...
    Disks

      disk <name> <size(B)> <partition label>

None of the values is specified as optional there  
so - in theory - it should be right to error out  
but - in practice - perhaps `<partition label>` is optional?

I will have to thoroughly inspect the code  
that consumes those values to find out  
if `<partition label>` is mandatory or optional.

When there are missing mandatory values in disklayout.conf  
things go arbitrarily and badly wrong during "rear recover".

If "rear recover" actually did work for you  
even when you have no SD card in /dev/sdb  
with a previous ReaR version  
you may as a workaround for now remove the line

    test $disktype || Error "Invalid 'disk $devname' entry (no partition table type for '$devname')"

from your  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
script.

@jsmeix  
Thanks much for the response and helpful information. I was indeed able
to run `rear mkbackup` successfully after reverting to the commit just
prior to your \#2804 PR when no memory card was present in /dev/sdb.

It sounds like this might be a change/fix that you'll want to make in
mainline. For now, I will compile a version that comments out the `test`
line you call out above.

I am still having issues with recovery, but that is a separate topic.

Again, thank you.

@mdbr000  
please attach your recent var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
because I need to know how all entries related to `sdb`  
look therein in your particular case.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-05-30 13:07](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810#issuecomment-1141138162):

I did a test with a manually modified  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
as follows (excerpt):

    disk /dev/sda 12884901888 gpt
    disk /dev/sdb 5368709120

i.e. I removed the partition type label `gpt` from `sdb`  
and I also removed any other entry for `sdb` so

    disk /dev/sdb 5368709120

is the only entry related to `sdb` in  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

Then I did a "rear -D recover" which worked.

Except from var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  
regarding `sdb`:

    if create_component "/dev/sdb" "disk" ; then
    # Create /dev/sdb (disk)

    #
    # Code handling disk '/dev/sdb'
    #

    ### Disks should be block devices.
    [ -b "/dev/sdb" ] || BugError "Disk /dev/sdb is not a block device."

    Log "Stop mdadm"
    if grep -q md /proc/mdstat 2>/dev/null; then
        mdadm --stop -s >&2 || echo "stop mdadm failed"
        # Prevent udev waking up mdadm later.
        # Reasoning: At least on RHEL6 when parted created a raid partition on disk,
        # udev (via /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules) wakes up mdadm which locks the disk,
        # so further parted commands with the disk will fail since the disk is busy now.
        # The /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules detects anaconda (the Red Hat installer),
        # and if it find itself running under anaconda, it will not run.
        # Accordingly also for other installers (in particular the ReaR installer)
        # this rule should not be there (and other Linux distros probably do not have it)
        # which means removing it is the right solution to make ReaR work also for RHEL6:
        if [ -e /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules ] ; then
            rm -f /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules || echo "rm 65-md-incremental.rules failed"
        fi
    fi
    Log "Erasing MBR of disk /dev/sdb"
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1
    sync

    # Make sure device nodes are visible (eg. in RHEL4)
    my_udevtrigger
    my_udevsettle

    # Clean up transient partitions and resize shrinked ones
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones

    #
    # End of code handling disk '/dev/sdb'
    #

    component_created "/dev/sdb" "disk"
    else
        LogPrint "Skipping /dev/sdb (disk) as it has already been created."
    fi

So it works in the special case when there is  
only a 'disk' entry without partition type label value  
but nothing else for this disk exists in disklayout.conf

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545)  
we do no longer error out when there is no partition label type value  
for a 'disk' entry in disklayout.conf because "rear recover" works  
in a special case without partition label type value when there is  
only a 'disk' entry but nothing else for this disk exists in
disklayout.conf  
which can happen when /dev/sdX is an empty SD card slot without medium.

@mdbr000  
I would appreciate it if you could test our current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code, see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

With our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
you should get the message

    No partition label type for 'disk /dev/sdb' (may cause 'rear recover' failure)

because usually a missing partition label type value  
will cause a 'rear recover' failure.

Here "'rear recover' failure" also means when a disk gets  
partitioned with a fallback partition type via the code in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
when the original disk partition type was different  
but somehow not detected/stored in disklayout.conf.

Interesting - when testing \#2804 & \#2803 I tested cases with drives
without partition tables, but not drives with missing media. I wonder
how to test this without a physical drive that supports removable media?

I was also wondering how I could somehow reproduce  
the behaviour that is described in this issue here.

I am not a SD card user (I don't have a SD card medium).  
My homeoffice laptop has an (empty) SD card slot  
but I see no block device node for it.

So I guess the SD card reader in this issue here  
is some unusual hardware that shows up as block device  
even when there is no medium so its block device node  
is basically useless and misleading.

I played around with an artificial "dangling" block device node

    # mknod /dev/sdq b 8 99

    # file /dev/sdq
    /dev/sdq: block special (8/99)

    # find /sys/block/
    /sys/block/
    /sys/block/dm-1
    /sys/block/sr0
    /sys/block/dm-0
    /sys/block/sda

    # lsblk /dev/sdq
    lsblk: /dev/sdq: failed to get sysfs name: No such file or directory

    # blockdev --report /dev/sdq
    RO    RA   SSZ   BSZ        StartSec            Size   Device
    blockdev: cannot open /dev/sdq: No such device or address

and /dev/sdq was just ignored by "rear mkrescue" (as it should).

So I manually modified a 'disk' entry in disklayout.conf  
in the ReaR recovery system before "rear recover"  
to be able to at least partially reproduce this issue here.

The difference with a "dangling" device node is that opening it will
report `ENXIO` "No such device or address", while an existing but empty
device reports `ENOMEDIUM` "No medium found". I don't think the device
is necessarily "useless and misleading" - the physical device (card
reader) is here, only its slot is empty. This is the usual behavior with
removable media devices like floppies or optical media (not USB flash
"disks" though, because in their case you remove the entire device, not
only the medium).

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-05-31 11:55](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2810#issuecomment-1142036377):

With "basically useless and misleading" I meant how it behaves  
in practice in particular compared to "normal" disks.

With a "normal" disk when e.g. /dev/sda is there  
one can access "the whole disk data" via /dev/sda

In contrast removable media devices behave different because  
when e.g. /dev/sdb is there it does not necessarily mean  
one can access "the whole disk data" via /dev/sdb  
but only when a medium is inserted.

I wonder for what /dev/sdb could be useful without medium?  
My offhanded guess is that a removable media device  
without medium is as useful as a "normal" disk device where  
its built-in medium was mechanically removed by a technician  
or as useful as a USB mass storage device that is disconnected.  
But I am not at all an expert here so I only do some  
offhanded thinking from an ignorant end-user point of view.

In the end for ReaR this issue means:  
We will have to implement special case handling  
for removable media devices in ReaR.

> I wonder for what /dev/sdb could be useful without medium?

You can ask for its manufacturer and capabilities, for example. With the
device node, it is easier to map what devices you have. If the device
has a loadable tray, you can also issue commands like open/close the
tray and load the medium (this is the case for optical and similar
media), which would be difficult without a device node.

It seems that the empty DVD drive behaves similarly to the empty SD card
reader, but that's probably not so useful for ReaR testing, because I
suppose that ReaR ignores CD/DVD drives (would it help to create a
symlink `/dev/sdb` -&gt; `/dev/sr0`?)

@pcahyna  
thank you for your explanation  
for what /dev/sdX is useful without medium  
e.g. to open/close a tray and things like that  
i.e. what is needed to load or unload a medium.  
Now I understand.

I am trying to create `/dev/sdq` with the same device major/minor
numbers as `/dev/sr0` (`cp -a /dev/sr0 /dev/sdq` does the job) and trick
ReaR into believing that it is a disk, but so far I have not been
successful.

looking at the output here, `/dev/sdb` is a USB mass storage device. I
remember having seen (external) USB card readers, but it was a long time
ago. Some laptops apparently have built-in memory card readers on USB,
so one might be successful with some of those, but I currently do not
have one. @mdbr000 what device is it? (I think a `lsusb` output would
help.)

@pcahyna  
thanks for trying with an artificial /dev/sdq device node  
with same major/minor numbers as /dev/sr0.  
That would have been my next attempt for today.

FYI:  
My built-in SD card reader is:

    # lspci -k
    ...
    05:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
     RTS5227 PCI Express Card Reader (rev 01)

            Kernel driver in use: rtsx_pci
            Kernel modules: rtsx_pci

I have nothing about 'rtsx' in `dmesg` - there is only

    # dmesg | egrep -i '05:00\.0|mmc'

There is no device node for it (neither /dev/sd\* nor /dev/mmc\*)

    # udisksctl status

    MODEL                     REVISION  SERIAL               DEVICE

    hp       DVDRAM GU70N     U703      M49CBQG2454          sr0     

I assume this is expected because I do not have a SD card.

@jsmeix I have a similar device and it behaves the same way. I decided I
will not try further to emulate an empty `sd` drive with an empty `sr`
drive, because it seems that the code is smart enough to distinguish
between CD-ROM drives and usual SCSI disks. I now prefer reproducing the
issue with the actual problematic hardware.

@mdbr000 can you please send the `lsusb` output identifying your card
reader?

I postponed this issue to ReaR 2.8 because  
it does not need to be solved for ReaR 2.7  
because since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0a1d634ed15500bb21f37ac1bbb11c8a4bb11545)  
"rear mkrescue" works again even when there is  
no partition label type value for a 'disk' entry in disklayout.conf

Because I have no removable media device  
I cannot do anything actually useful here  
so I leave this issue closed.
