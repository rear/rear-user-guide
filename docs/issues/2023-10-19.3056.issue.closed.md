Currently  
`https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot`  
shows only old and outdated stuff:

    Name                 | Changed
    ---------------------+-----------------
    rear                 | 12 months ago
    rear-github-master   | over 2 years ago
    rear-manual-snapshot | over 1 year ago

At least I don't have time to continuously maintain it.

When there is noone who can continuously maintain it,  
then I prefer to better remove old and outdated stuff  
than to let it rot even longer.

In particular I do not want to ever get a user issue report  
because someone uses this old and outdated stuff by mistake.

In our
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com)
sources  
I did not find 'Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot' mentioned:

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com.gi
    ...

    # cd rear.github.com

    # find . -type f | xargs grep -i 'snapshot'
    [only lists ./documentation/release-notes*.md files
     and ./download/index.md
     and the latter only mentiones 'Archiving:Backup:Rear']

Furthermore ./download/index.md reads

    ### Master branch snapshot
    The latest development snapshot is available via the
    [GitHub download rear-master.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/master.zip)
    button.

(see online at
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/))  
which works well (at least for me)  
because via

    # wget https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/master.zip

    # unzip master.zip

I get our current GitHub master code  
in a `rear-master` sub-directory.

So now after 'Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot' was removed from  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
we could do the next logical step and finally also  
remove 'Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot' from OBS.

I changed the 'Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot' description at  
`https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot`  
to

    Relax-and-Recover snapshot packages (old and outdated)

    Do not use packages from Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot.
    Instead use stable ReaR versions from Archiving:Backup:Rear
    or see http://relax-and-recover.org/download/
    how to get the latest development snapshot at GitHub
    or the current GitHub master sources via "git clone".
    The packages in Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot are old and outdated.
    Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot is no longer actively maintained.
    Unless someone volunteers to actively maintain it,
    Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot will be removed,
    see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3056

Let's wait and see if the already built RPMs below

Next week (unless there are objections)  
I will remove the source packages at

@jsmeix I have never used these build or the OBS, so I don't have any
particular opinion on it.

Generally speaking, Packit-as-a-Service builds some RPM packages in
every PR (see for example
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3057/checks](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3057/checks)
- the koji-build and rpm-build jobs). And there is also a GitHub
workflow that creates snapshot packages after each PR is merged, see for
example
[https://github.com/rear/rear/actions/runs/6612852833](https://github.com/rear/rear/actions/runs/6612852833)
. The workflow
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/160ae839c17adc06a473d196e616e686b0febb2f/.github/workflows/build-packages.yml](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/160ae839c17adc06a473d196e616e686b0febb2f/.github/workflows/build-packages.yml)
was created by @schlomo , I don't know the details on how to use the
results, but I suppose it could replace the OBS builds.

@jsmeix I guess you are the only one left here who actually knows how to
use OBS.

With the per-commit snapshot builds here on GitHub I don't see any need
for OBS snapshot builds beyond what you might need for SUSE-internal
purposes.

For releases I see more value, especially for release builds targeting
distros that don't include ReaR themselves or via one of their extended
repo ecosystem.

If and when we will be doing more regular releases I'm sure that we will
be revisiting this question again, till then I'd suggest to follow the
past of least effort.

Oh, and big thanks @jsmeix for all the cleaning up you keep doing, I
notice and see it and appreciate it very much!!!

@schlomo  
thank you so much for your kind words!  
It makes me happy that my cleanup efforts are recognized.

In particular because cleanup does not produce some-"thing",  
in contrast cleanup makes some existing things disappear  
so after cleanup it is invisible what had been done.

The OBS Project Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot is gone now.

I made copies of its packages as  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/Archiving-Backup-Rear-Snapshot-rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/Archiving-Backup-Rear-Snapshot-rear)  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/Archiving-Backup-Rear-Snapshot-rear-github-master](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/Archiving-Backup-Rear-Snapshot-rear-github-master)  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/Archiving-Backup-Rear-Snapshot-rear-manual-snapshot](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jsmeix/Archiving-Backup-Rear-Snapshot-rear-manual-snapshot)  
to keep the package sources for some time  
(perhaps something might be needed at a later time)  
but nothing gets built or published there.

Personally I see no reason for Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot

I never used RPMs from Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot

For testing current development things I use "git clone".

For reproducing SUSE customer issues I use our  
official SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) packages, cf.  
"Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) RPM packages for disaster recovery" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

For SUSE customers and openSUSE users who like to try out  
our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code, I recommend  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
because "git clone" does not conflict with their  
normally installed ReaR version via RPM package.

For SUSE customers and openSUSE users who like  
to upgrade to a later or to the latest ReaR release  
(without official SUSE support), I recommend  
RPMs from the OBS Project Archiving:Backup:Rear
