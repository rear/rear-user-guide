Improvement of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1408](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1408)  
therein in particular for the one second delay for automated input  
to avoid possibly tight loop of endless retrying UserInput calls:  
Now a read call with at least one second timeout is used  
where the user can interrupt the automated input  
or where the read timeout delays the automated input.

Now (at least from my current point of view) the  
UserInput function should be really feature-complete  
but cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1408\#issue-242719587](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1408#issue-242719587)  
;-)

I like to have the UserInput function ready in ReaR v 2.2  
so that for ReaR v 2.3 I can replace existing read and  
select user input by the UserInput function, cf.
