#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.4 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    CentOS 7 (RedHatEnterpriseServer 7)

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    local.conf =  
    BACKUP=BACULA  
    OUTPUT=ISO

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    Dell Precision Tower 3620

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    BIOS

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Does not work with bacula-enterprise-client - specifically
    bacula-enterprise-client-8.8.6-1.el7.x86\_64  
    Looking for binaries and config files in the wrong location.  
    Perhaps these are for open-source Bacula.  
    I will check that out.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Multiple file edits.

I checked and found the alternate file paths in CentOS - bacula-client
and bacula-console

So my guess appears accurate. Open source bacula and bacula enterprise
put things in different locations.

What would be easier ?  
Making a separate BACKUP type like ENT\_BACULA  
or  
adding code to BACULA to look in two locations ?

I do not use Bacula or any other third-party backup tools.  
Therefore I can neither reproduce such issues  
nor can I verify what could actually fix it.

@gdha  
do you perhaps know someone who could help  
with issues in case of `BACKUP=BACULA`  
(ideally a Bacula developer from Bacula.org)?

@linuxdan  
my offhanded preference is to add code to BACULA to look in two
locations  
because I think in both cases it is basically "the same Bacula
software"  
where only the files are installed at different locations.

I think a separate BACKUP type like ENT\_BACULA would only make sense  
if the bacula-enterprise-client software would behave substantially
different  
compared to what is currently implemented for BACKUP=BACULA.

I would prefer a generic future-proof solution with additional config
variables  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf where Bacula directories are
specified,  
for example something like

    # For bacula-enterprise-client use BACULA_CONF_DIR="/opt/bacula/etc"
    BACULA_CONF_DIR="/etc/bacula"
    # For bacula-enterprise-client use BACULA_BIN_DIR="/opt/bacula/bin"
    BACULA_BIN_DIR="/usr/sbin"

or even with automated setting of the right values like

    BACULA_CONF_DIR="/etc/bacula"
    # bacula-enterprise-client uses /opt/bacula/etc
    test -d "/opt/bacula/etc" && BACULA_CONF_DIR="/opt/bacula/etc"
    BACULA_BIN_DIR="/usr/sbin"
    # bacula-enterprise-client uses /opt/bacula/bin
    test -d "/opt/bacula/bin" && BACULA_BIN_DIR="/opt/bacula/bin"

You can run code as you like in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
because in ReaR also config files are sourced and executed  
as bash scripts, e.g. see how REAL\_MACHINE is set in default.conf

@jsmeix I have no knowledge of any Bacula user ( is over 10 years ago I
used it ). Indeed the proposed solution with the BACULA\_BIN\_DIR
setting looks the correct way to go for. Preferably automatically

That's a typo. Sharp eyes.

I am willing to give it a try.  
I have already identified all the places BACULA\_BIN\_DIR and
BACULA\_CONF\_DIR are needed.  
All I need is a clue or three about how to set up a prep script.

Can it wait that long ?

@linuxdan  
no worries - no rush - it can wait as long as you need.  
Apparently you are currently the only one  
who uses ReaR with bacula-enterprise-client.

@gdha  
regarding

    Preferably automatically detected via a prep script

in your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2152\#issuecomment-498244676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2152#issuecomment-498244676)

If we do the automated settings directly in default.conf as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2152\#issuecomment-498201997](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2152#issuecomment-498201997)  
the whole code is simpler because default.conf is sourced before  
etc/rear/local.conf so that the user can enforce his own settings.

If we do the automated settings in a prep script  
e.g. at the beginning of the existing BACULA specific  
usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/400\_prep\_bacula.sh  
the code gets more complicated because the prep script  
is sourced after both default.conf and etc/rear/local.conf  
were sourced so that special stuff is needed to be able to  
distingush the default case where automated settings should happen  
from the case where the user had specified the values in
etc/rear/local.conf  
so that no automated settings should happen in the prep script  
(ReaR must obey what its user has explicity specifed).

The usual way how to distingush the default case  
from the user specified case is that by default  
config variables are set to an empty value.

So we would have in default.conf

    # If empty BACULA_CONF_DIR and BACULA_BIN_DIR
    # are automatically set in
    # prep/BACULA/default/400_prep_bacula.sh
    # Usually BACULA_CONF_DIR is "/etc/bacula"
    # but for bacula-enterprise-client it is "/opt/bacula/etc"
    # Usually BACULA_BIN_DIR is "/usr/sbin"
    # but for bacula-enterprise-client it is "/opt/bacula/bin"
    BACULA_CONF_DIR=""
    BACULA_BIN_DIR=""

and in prep/BACULA/default/400\_prep\_bacula.sh  
something like

    if ! test $BACULA_CONF_DIR ; then
        BACULA_CONF_DIR="/etc/bacula"
        # bacula-enterprise-client uses /opt/bacula/etc
        test -d "/opt/bacula/etc" && BACULA_CONF_DIR="/opt/bacula/etc"   
    fi
    if ! test $BACULA_BIN_DIR ; then
        BACULA_BIN_DIR="/usr/sbin"
        # bacula-enterprise-client uses /opt/bacula/bin
        test -d "/opt/bacula/bin" && BACULA_BIN_DIR="/opt/bacula/bin"
    fi

or better in compliance with "Try to care about possible errors"  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
in 400\_prep\_bacula.sh something like

    if ! test -d "$BACULA_CONF_DIR" ; then
        test -d "/etc/bacula" && BACULA_CONF_DIR="/etc/bacula"
        # bacula-enterprise-client uses /opt/bacula/etc
        test -d "/opt/bacula/etc" && BACULA_CONF_DIR="/opt/bacula/etc"   
    fi
    test -d "$BACULA_CONF_DIR" || Error "No BACULA_CONF_DIR"
    if ! test -d "$BACULA_BIN_DIR" ; then
        BACULA_BIN_DIR="/usr/sbin"
        # bacula-enterprise-client uses /opt/bacula/bin
        test -d "/opt/bacula/bin" && BACULA_BIN_DIR="/opt/bacula/bin"
    fi

Sorry i see.  
If it's possible to continue here I try to explain the problem because
it's  
connected with community edition too.  
According to this manual  
[https://www.bacula.org/whitepapers/CommunityInstallationGuide.pdf](https://www.bacula.org/whitepapers/CommunityInstallationGuide.pdf)
community  
version is installed to /opt/bacula, so it could be two places where
config  
and bin files live. For RPM version 5 default path was /etc/bacula but  
current RPMs compiled differently. Of cource I can compile the new
custom  
RPM with /etc/bacula to comply rear.

That is a completely different issue that this one.  
I would have to re-investigate the source code.  
Is anyone planning to help see this issue reaches a fix ?

That guide is dated 2018 and refers to apt commands for installing. I am
working with CentOS/RHEL systems. The community RPM installs to
/etc/bacula

Try installing it on a CentOS system or just look at the contents of the
CentOS RPM.
