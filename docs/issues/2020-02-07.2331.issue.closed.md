ReaR have on multiple places hard-coded home directory of *root* user.
This is OK most of the time, but I've came across multiple servers that
had home directory of root user relocated (for various reasons) to
different locations (e.g. */root/home/root*).  
Since ReaR requires to be launched under *root* user, I think that we
should replace static string *root/.ssh/\** with *$HOME/.ssh/\** to
reflect real home directory of *root*.

What do you guys think?

If there are no objections I would prepare PR ...

I am wondering what the officially right home directory for the root
user is.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem\_Hierarchy\_Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)  
tells

    /root    Home directory for the root user.

so on first glance according to plain reading only that piece of text  
it seems the "officially right home directory for the root user"  
could be indeed hardcoded `/root`.

On the other hand "Dirty hacks welcome" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
reads

    it is more important that the Relax-and-Recover code works
    than having nice looking clean code that sometimes fails

I fear there are cases (e.g crazy admins or whatever ;-)  
where `/root` exists but for the root user $HOME  
is set to a different directory so we cannot make  
a hardcoded decision in our code if hardcoded `/root`  
or the root user's $HOME value is the right place.  
In this case the usual way out of "\*nix diversity hell"  
is to have just another config variable in default.conf

    # According to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
    # the home directory for the root user has to be '/root'
    # cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
    # but you may set it as needed like ROOT_HOME_DIR="$HOME"
    ROOT_HOME_DIR="/root"

and use its value in our scripts.

What scripts I found where a hardcoded `/root` is used  
for the home directory of the root user:

Hmm, I'd prefer to have ROOT\_HOME\_DIR=$HOME as default because home is
wherever $HOME points to :-), and use "/root" as reasonable fallback
when $ROOT\_HOME\_DIR is empty/unset or non existing.

Any reasonable default is o.k. for me  
but it should be sufficiently fail-safe e.g. like

    test -d "$HOME" && ROOT_HOME_DIR="$HOME" || ROOT_HOME_DIR='/root'

because I think it is not impossible that $HOME migt be unset  
or false set at the time when "rear" is run.

sorry for my weisenheimer comment - I had not read that you

`test -d "$HOME" && ROOT_HOME_DIR="$HOME" || ROOT_HOME_DIR='/root'`
looks good.

Do you think it could be verbatim used in *default.conf*

I would say the usual idiom is  
`ROOT_HOME_DIR="${HOME:-/root}"`

Also, is the intent to let the user set it? If not, it probably should
not be in default.conf because it serves as documentation of what are
all the supported user-settable variables.

Hello @pcahyna,

> I would say the usual idiom is  
> ROOT\_HOME\_DIR="${HOME:-/root}"

That look handy, I'll certainly consider using it.

> Also, is the intent to let the user set it?

As far as I know, everything in default.conf can be overridden by
local.conf/site.conf.

@pcahyna  
thank you for the much simpler code.

The intent is that the user could specify ROOT\_HOME\_DIR  
to anything as needed in even special exceptional cases  
(cf. "final power to the user") regardless that I assume

    ROOT_HOME_DIR="${HOME:-/root}"

does the right thing in 99.999999% of the cases.

One possible problem with this approach is if one wants to run ReaR as
not-root user (it would have to be a user which is granted some special
capabilities). In that case, does one really intend to use the $HOME of
that user? If so, this approach is fine. OTOH if one really means the
home directory of root, it could be better to use ~root. (Executing as
non-root is currently not supported, but should not be prevented in the
future.)

IMO it is also necessary to distinguish the original system - where rear
mkrescue or rear mkbackup is being executed and where root may have a
non-standard $HOME (so this concern is valid), and the rescue ramdisk,
which is created by us and we can hardcode /root, because we know where
we put it.

I'm intending to change only hard coded values only for original system
(where mkbackup or mkrescue) is launched, ReaR recovery system should
remain unchanged.

This is a good point, although I'm not sure if anybody ever tried to
launch ReaR just with capabilities, but to be on safe side `~root`
should be more suitable than *$HOME*. Even further, how about reading
root home directory from */etc/passwd* to avoid possible problems with
`~root` (I'm not sure how fail safe `~root` is, despite I'm using it
quite often).

@gozora this is more a discussion point, in fact `$HOME` might be
entirely appropriate (one might prefer to copy the invoking user's ssh
keys instead of root's ssh keys - assuming that recovery will be
executed as the same user).

Concerning ~root, if root's home is indeed intended, I think ~root is
preferable to parsing of /etc/passwd, the latter seems more error-prone.

I'm looking here for replacing */root/* with actual **root** home
directory so I think that additional complexity with "invoking user"
should not be messed with. So let's stick with `~root` for now.

Makes sense, the transition to $HOME where appropriate can be made
separately.

I think currently it is totally unsupported to run ReaR as non-`root`
user  
like a user with effective user ID 0 that is not named `root`.  
I.e. I would not be surprised if the user name must be `root`.

But I never even tried to run ReaR as non-`root` user  
except by accident where I was exited at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L288](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L288)

    # ReaR must run as 'root' (i.e. abort if effective user ID is not 0):
    if test "$( id --user )" != "0" ; then
        echo "ERROR: $PRODUCT needs 'root' privileges (effective user ID is not 0)" >&2
        exit 1

According to what  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)  
reads (excerpts)

    git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
    cd rear/
    sudo usr/sbin/rear format /dev/sdb
    sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue
    sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup

it seems ReaR works when a normal user calls it via `sudo`  
which seems to be sufficient at least as far as `sudo` works  
on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system:

    johannes@host:~> sudo bash -c '( set -x ; pwd ; echo $HOME ~root ~ ; id )'
    [sudo] password for root: 

    + pwd
    /home/johannes
    + echo /root /root /root
    /root /root /root
    + id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

so it seems `sudo` behaves more like `su root` than `su - root`  
but it seems for ReaR `sudo` and `su root` are sufficient.
