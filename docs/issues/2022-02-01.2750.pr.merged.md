##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   How was this pull request tested? On RHEL8 with Upstream ReaR

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The current code excluding multipath devices is broken when a device
being excluded matches other devices.  
This leads to excluding wanted devices.  
This happens when having custom alias for multipath devices *or* there
are more than 26 multipath devices and 'mpatha' is getting excluded,
which leads to excluding all 'mpathaX' devices are well.

See example below:

-   have /boot on a dedicated multipath device 'mpathba'
-   have / on a dedicated multipath device 'mpatha' and LVM vg 'rhel'
-   have a dedicated multipath device 'mpathb' and LVM vg 'data'
-   tell ReaR to only include 'rhel' VG (and not 'data' VG)
-   tell ReaR to not auto-exclude multipath devices (otherwise
    everything  
    gets commented out)

With original code:

    $ rear mkrescue
    $ grep -v ^# /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf | grep "mpathba"
    --> device excluded even though it hosts /boot

With the fix:

    $ rear mkrescue
    $ grep -v ^# /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf | grep "mpathba"
    fs /dev/mapper/mpathba1 /boot xfs ...
    multipath /dev/mapper/mpathba 5368709120 msdos /dev/sda,/dev/sdb
    part /dev/mapper/mpathba 1073741824 1048576 primary none /dev/mapper/mpathba1

The root cause behind this is ReaR excludes 'mpathb' (hosting the
'data'  
VG) through using a non-word matching *grep* command, which causes  
'mpathba' (hosting /boot) to be excluded as well.

looks good, `grep -w` is already being used at other places, so it
should be safe. I am actually wondering how many other places do not use
`-w` when they should, given that grep is fairly widespread in layout
code.

@pcahyna  
personally I do not use `grep -w` when I grep in disklayout.conf  
because the word separator characters in `grep -w` are different  
than the word separator characters in bash (i.e. $IFS)  
according to how I understand "man grep"

    -w, --word-regexp
      Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
      The test is that the matching substring must
      either be at the beginning of the line,
      or preceded by a non-word constituent character.
      Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line
      or followed  by a non-word constituent character.
      Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.

therein in particular the last line so word separator characters in
`grep -w`  
are all characters except letters, digits, and the underscore.

To grep for a keyword of an active line in disklayout.conf I use

    grep '^keyword '

with a trailing space character.  
To grep for a value in the middle of a line in disklayout.conf I use

    grep ' value '

with a leading and a trailing space character.  
Preferably I get one whole line into a bash array  
and pick the intended array element like

    # disk_device="/dev/sda"
    # disk_entry=( $( grep "^disk $disk_device " $LAYOUT_FILE ) )
    # disk_size=${disk_entry[2]}

because this works same as

    # disk_device="/dev/sda"
    # read keyword disk_device disk_size disk_label < <( grep "^disk $disk_device " $LAYOUT_FILE )

which is the usual method when we iterate over several entries in
disklayout.conf

Accordingly there are some more issues in  
layout/save/default/335\_remove\_excluded\_multipath\_vgs.sh

    done < <(grep "^#lvmdev" $LAYOUT_FILE)
    ...
    done < <(grep "^multipath" $LAYOUT_FILE)

should be

    done < <(grep "^#lvmdev " $LAYOUT_FILE)
    ...
    done < <(grep "^multipath " $LAYOUT_FILE)

i.e. each with a trailing space.

In

        # ... - an entry looks like:
        # #lvmdev /dev/h50l050vg00 /dev/mapper/360060e8007e2e3000030e2e30000449f2 Nn3ew5-Wkve-FpSY-mgng-3T0l-rSz1-EEvPrE 502288384
        # We need to 'cut -c1-45' (third arg) to grab the full multipath device and not only a partition
        # Remember, multipath devices from a volume group that is "excluded" should be 'commented out'
        device=$(echo $mpdev | cut -c1-45)

there is no check that $mpdev has the form `/dev/mapper/...`  
so any `<device>` of any commented `#lvmdev ` line in disklayout.conf  
will be used regardless if that `<device>` has the expected form
`/dev/mapper/...`

thanks for noticing that, indeed that does not sound good. It is easy to
imagine that someone would use a dash in a device name, for example.

I think that keywords are fairly safe, because they come from a
well-known set of possibilities, unlike values, which can be virtually
anything. Unless someone introduces two keywords where one is a
substring of the other, like "lvm" and "lvmdev" or "multipath" and
"multipathcomponent", hmmm.

Right, not good enough then. Let me confirm this doesn't work with
custom aliases even with the fix.

I think usually `grep -w "$value"` is good enough because:

    echo "beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend" | grep -w 'foo'
    beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend
             ^^^

finds only the "foo" in "foo-bar"  
but usually one does not search for a substring of a value but for a
whole value so

    # for v in beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend ; do echo "beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend" | grep -w "$v" ; done
    beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend
    ^^^^^^^^
    beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend
             ^^^^^^^
    beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend
                     ^^^^^^^
    beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend
                             ^^^^^^
    beginfoo foo-bar foo_baz foo1.2 fooend
                                    ^^^^^^

finds each specific value at its exact place.

Regarding grep for keyword without trailing space:

Currently we have `disk` and `opaldisk` officially documented in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

But since my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7a944cf059135a044940408bbdc9c0c77c299322](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7a944cf059135a044940408bbdc9c0c77c299322)  
we also have `raid` and the new `raiddisk` which is not yet officially
documented  
because I am not yet finished with the RAID autoresize code so I like to
be able  
to rename the new `raiddisk` if I need.  
So `grep ^raid $LAYOUT_FILE` would find `raid` and the new `raiddisk`.  
I checked the RAID code that it is safe.  
I cannot rename `raid` to `raidarray` because the user could use his  
specific $CONFIG\_DIR/disklayout.conf see  
layout/prepare/default/010\_prepare\_files.sh  
so we must keep things backward compatible in disklayout.conf  
On the other hand we did change things in disklayout.conf  
so we should document that $CONFIG\_DIR/disklayout.conf  
must be adapted by the user when he updates/upgraded ReaR  
and then I could rename `raid` to `raidarray`.

`grep -w` isn't safe indeed, tested with `/boot` on
`/dev/mapper/custom-boot` device and data VG on `/dev/mapper/custom`
device: `/boot` was getting excluded as well.

Ah! Yes - it fails when the whole value1 in `grep -w value1`  
is a substring of another value2  
where value2 contains value1 as a word for `grep -w`

To make it officially documented what the de-facto syntax in
disklayout.conf is  
I added in doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc  
in the "Disk layout file syntax" section that in disklayout.conf  
keyword and the values are separated by single space characters via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b1ccb948bdfd83dc904937a74ae4d3d13ecb8963](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b1ccb948bdfd83dc904937a74ae4d3d13ecb8963)

This is needed because we depend on it at many places in the code  
that keyword and values are separated by space characters.

I prefer spaces over `\s`, for three reasons:

-   `\s` is hard to read, as @jsmeix has pointed out
-   spaces are consistent with the current style (and if we weant to
    change the style and eventually change the current occurrences, the
    code will become even harder to read)
-   `\s` is unneeded: the format of the file is under our control, we
    make sure that there spaces and not tabs.

with / being on `mpatha-a` and excluded LV being on `mpatha`.

The system was installed with `mpatha-` as the original multipath
prefix.  
This can be achieved using `alias_prefix mpatha-` in
`/etc/multipath.conf` when installing  
(use

    sed -i.orig -e '/user_friendly_names/a\\
    alias_prefix mpatha-' /etc/multipath.conf
    systemctl restart multipathd

in kickstart `%pre`)

Note that the code still looks fragile. Is it guaranteed that
`/dev/mapper/...` can appear only in a disklayout field where we expect
it, and not in some other field? And will `cut -c1-45` always work? But
let's worry about it later.
