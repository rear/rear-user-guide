My basic reasoning for my changes to use `${array[*]}` instead of
`${array[@]}`  
is that here the array elements are single words (kernel module names)  
so we can "simply" use the simple `${array[*]}` form everywhere here.

FYI:  
I think we use often arrays where simple strings would be sufficient,  
in particular when the array elements can be only single words.

I agree with using `${OLD_INITRD_MODULES[*]}` here, but my reasoning is
different. The reason to use this form is because it occurs in a longer
string. For example. as
`"Original OLD_INITRD_MODULES='${OLD_INITRD_MODULES[@]}'"`. This way, if
OLD\_INITRD\_MODULES is for example `( a b c )`, the resulting string
will be expanded into three strings:

    "Original OLD_INITRD_MODULES=a'"
    "b"
    "c'"

which is not what is intended, although in the special case of `Log` it
is harmless, because `Log` concatenates its arguments back together.  
Try it:

    $ for i in "Original OLD_INITRD_MODULES='${OLD_INITRD_MODULES[@]}'"; do echo $i; done
    Original OLD_INITRD_MODULES='a
    b
    c'

It should have no effect, according to `bash(1)`:

> Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless
> the  
> `expand_aliases` shell option is set using `shopt`

... and unless bash is in POSIX mode (item 6 in
[https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/POSIX](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/POSIX)
).  
I suspect the author of this code was debugging the script in an
interactive shell and needed this unalias command because of having a
conflicting alias defined, and did not realize that in the final code it
is useless.

You are welcome! It would be a huge amount of work to do a 100% audit of
the shellcheck warnings in the current code, I agree (also depending on
whether one wants simply to silence ShellCheck or rather to make
meaningful improvements to the code - I strongly prefer the latter! My
experience with such mass cleanups is not very positive, it can result
in tons of changes that merely silence the tool, without fixing the
actual bugs when they are present and sometimes introducing new bugs
when the original code was fine.)

That's what I did indeed some time ago when my aliases were not working
in my shell script :-)

Regarding ShellCheck:  
I fully agree with you.  
This is why I am currently against an automated/enforced ShellCheck
because  
it puts pressure on us and our contributors to "just get that annoyance
silent"  
instead of actually searching the root cause and fix things properly.  
What I currently do regarding ShellCheck is only to look after  
what ShellCheck considers to be an "error", cf. at the end of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1062945160](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1062945160)

E.g. the 571 of `SC2168: 'local' is only valid in functions`  
are likely all false positives because

    shellcheck -s bash -S error path/to/script.sh

cannot know that we source scripts within our Source() function.

In contrast the other SCnnnn that ShellCheck considers to be an
"error"  
relatively often point to real issues in our code that I like to get
cleaned up.

Then we can run for all our scripts

    shellcheck -s bash -S error -e SC2168 path/to/script.sh

and should no longer get anything reported.

Then we may even run this command in an automated way  
but this would be strictly optional for me.

does the current code in this pull request now look OK to you?

@jsmeix I added one more comment, otherwise it looks fine. It is not
pretty that the code starts with arrays and then switches to
whitespace-separated strings in the middle, it is inconsistent. But
since your goal was to fix ShellCheck warnings, I don't think it is
necessary to do larger cleanups of the code unrelated to the original
goal.

I would prefer to postpone a general overhaul of this code to a later
time  
because otherwise I could never finish it in foreseeable future.  
But now the code should be at least "clearly inconsistent"

    # Concatenate the old and new modules into a string

so it would be much easier to overhaul it later if needed.  
Before it was rather hidden that it switched from arrays to strings.

@jsmeix I completely agree. What matters is that the code increases
monotonically in quality, i.e. new changes do not make it worse. One
does not have to solve all existing issues at once.
