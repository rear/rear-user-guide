    Hello,  
    Upgrading to Red Hat 7.6 updated ReaR from
    rear-2.00-7.el7\_5.x86\_64 to rear-2.4-2.el7.x86\_64.  
    Running a backup worked with no issues, OS recoveries failed:

Here are the messages from the ReaR recovery console:

    ERROR:

Hi @John-Leone , since you are a Red Hat customer, we should work on
this in the Red Hat ticket you opened recently.

@gdha Issue resolved. We believe rear was running while the package got
updated, causing updated scripts to be packed into ISO with content
(disklayout.conf) computed from older scripts.
