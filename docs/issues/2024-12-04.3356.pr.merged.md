-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

coreutils 8.16 was released in 2012 so the '-r' option  
should be supported since more than 10 years  
so it is unlikely that someone is actually hit by it  
BUT  
some older Linux distributions with rather old coreutils  
may still be in use somewhere so it is good to care about  
this possible error because when 'ln' fails here, the  
consequence is severe (recovery system startup fails)  
and it shows up (too) late (at "rear recover" time)  
AND  
this issue is introduced in ReaR 2.8 by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3206](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3206)  
so it could be considered as a regression in ReaR 2.8

and subsequent comments

-   How was this pull request tested?

Tested on SLES11-SP4 where 'ln' from coreutils 8.12  
does not support the '-r/--relative' option  
which is supported since coreutils 8.16

Also tested on a system where 'ln' supports '-r'  
i.e. on SLES15-SP6 with coreutils 8.32

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
failsafe symlinking of VAR\_DIR and SHARE\_DIR  
and error out if symlinking fails because  
with non-default VAR\_DIR and/or SHARE\_DIR  
(e.g. when running from checkout)  
it is mandatory that in the ReaR recovery system  
all ReaR files are accessible via the default  
/var/lib/rear and /usr/share/rear directories,

@rear/contributors  
provided there are no objections,  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon

Just merged "bona fide" without further testing  
(that all CI tests passed indicates it is OK)  
so I had only tested the initial changes

I adapted
