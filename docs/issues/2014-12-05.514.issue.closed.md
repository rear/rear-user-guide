Please could you fix that so NFS can be used to restore automatically
without having to start manually rpcbind and rpc.statd processes (like
on the live system running RHEL).

@bobbysch could you a bit be more precise with which RHEL version do you
have issues? Could you paste the exact error message you saw in the
rear.log?

Actually the problem occurs on Oracle Linux 5, 6 and 7. It's a clone
from RHEL so i'm sure RHEL will have the same.  
Here is the logs from

Beside that, can you fix also the error
`/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/07_set_backup_archive.sh: line 13: [: ==: unary operator expected`

Note that right after it failed, I could do nslookup and ping my NFS
server hounetapp2 and of course rpcbind and rpc.statd processes are not
running as expected.  
Need to add sleep somewhere in the scripts?

Additionally here is the logs when I launched manually "rear -v recover"
after the automatic recovery failed.  
It's slightly different but claims that rpc need to be there:

@bobbysch see issue \#158 for a work-around. NFSv4 support will be added
in the future (when time permits), or faster (with sponsoring)

This issue made me wonder how to tell rear to recover from a non
original source use for backup.  
In my case I used NFS to backup, but since I have this issue, how can i
transfer the backup files to a different place and tell rear to use the
new place and not the original one?

This is definitively very useful and flexible if rear can do it.

rear can talk to a remote NFSv4 server, but in NFSv3 mode. Therefore,
use `BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"` in the `local.conf` file

@bobbysch *This issue made me wonder how to tell rear to recover from a
non original source use for backup* just change the BACKUP\_URL variable
before doing the recover.  
Can this issue be closed?

Yes you can close it!  
Thanks for this wonderful product!
