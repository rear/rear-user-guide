On a first glance

does not look promising...

@schabrolles  
because it happens on PowerVM LPAR with MPIO SAN device  
perhaps you might be able to guess what happened here  
(even without details).

@gsasidharan  
you use Relax-and-Recover 2.00 which is a bit old, from January 2017,
cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)

Try out if a more current version works better for you, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

See  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)  
what has changed from ReaR 2.0 to the current ReaR 2.4.  
There are some possibly backward incompatible changes.

I would also recommend to try out our current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code as follows:

Basically "git clone" our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
into a separated directory and then configure and run ReaR  
from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).

If the issue also happens with current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
please provide us complete ReaR debug log files of both  
"rear -D mkbackup" and then "rear -D recover"  
plus your 'var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf' file  
so that we can have a look how it behaves in your particular
environment  
cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If it works with the current ReaR 2.4 or our current ReaR upstream
GitHub  
master code we would really appreciate an explicit positive feedback.

For SUSE Linux Enterprise there should be official "rear23a" RPM
packages  
that contain ReaR upstream version 2.4 plus some later ReaR upstream
commits,  
see the section "rear / rear116 / rear1172a / rear118a / rear23a" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Thanks for your quick response...  
already tried version 2.4 and got failures for SUSE.  
RHEL worked perfectly fine.  
will retry with below steps and confirm the status.

When things fail for SLES but work for RHEL my blind guess is  
that you use SLES with its default btrfs structure which requires  
special settings in your /etc/rear/local.conf for btrfs.

When you use SLES with its default btrfs structure  
use a well matching \*.btrfs-example.conf file from  
/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ as a starting point,  
cf. the ones in our current ReaR upstream master code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)  
and read  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368\#issuecomment-302410707](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368#issuecomment-302410707)  
because for SLE12 there are several different  
incompatible btrfs default setups where each one  
has its own specific \*.btrfs-example.conf file.

@jsmeix looking at those examples I wonder why we don't include the
snapper and other tools by default? Wouldn't that make ReaR work on all
SLES versions without "special" configuration?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2018-11-20 12:36](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1973#issuecomment-440258471):

@schlomo  
as far as I see SLES12 with its several different incompatible default
btrfs structures  
will always require an experienced admin who knows what specific kind
of  
SLES12 btrfs structure there actually is on his particular system  
so that he can specify the right things in his etc/rear/local.conf  
that match his particular kind of SLES12 btrfs structure.

Of course in theory with unreasonable effort it might be even possible  
to let ReaR autodetermine what specific kind of SLES12 btrfs structure  
there actually is on a particular system but at least I won't implement
that  
unless I am forced by SUSE who is convinced by one or more customers  
who pay us for all those efforts ;-)

I think in practice it is more reasonable to leave it as it is now  
in particular because at least for now it seems things have reasonably  
stabilized since SLE12-SP2 because I am not aware of any new different  
incompatible default btrfs structures after SLE12-SP2.

SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf also works on SLE12-SP3 and SLE12-SP4  
and it should also work on SLE15 (at least it worked for me for my
tests).

AFAIKT the only really relevant parts of that example configuration are
the `REQUIRED_PROGS`, `COPY_AS_IS` and `POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT` variables.
The `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDES` seems extremely specific as it mentions
MariaDB.

As it took me 3 times going over that example before I noticed those
relevant variables I can imagine that our users also will struggle with
that. Therefore I suggest to merge the `REQUIRED_PROGS` and `COPY_AS_IS`
fragments into the SLES specific configuration and to convert the
`POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT` to a SLES specific script that checks if the
system is recent enough to need that treatment.

Wrong? Why? I'd like to know specifically.

@gsasidharan sorry for highjacking your issue with this general
discussion.

Team..  
pls share if you have the SLES12-SP3-PPC64.CONF file...  
able to use rear 2.4 now and beleive the conf file is my issue now.  
i use the default partitioning for filesystems .  
my os version is SLES 12-SP3 for Power platform.

@gsasidharan  
I do not understand what you mean with  
`pls share if you have the SLES12-SP3-PPC64.CONF file`

There is no SLES12-SP3-PPC64.CONF file in our ReaR upstream files,  
e.g. what I get right now in a new git clone:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd /root/rear.github.master

# find . | grep -i SLE
./usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf
./usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf
./usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf
./usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf
./usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf
</pre>

but I do not run SLES 12-SP3 on POWER platform.

Hi John,  
for Sap Hana purposes we are using SLES V12SP3 in power platform.  
this is not available below samples given.  
Will try below suitable one and revert back.

@gsasidharan  
in general regarding SAP HANA with SLES 12 SP3 on IBM Power  
you may also have a look at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1925](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1925)  
perhaps something therein could be also of interest for you.

I installed rear 2.4 on my Power E880, running SLES 12.3, and it allmost
restored flawless.  
at first, I had the same errors with the disk layout.

During recover I had to edit /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf,
exchanging all 'p1' with '-part1' and so on:

    :g/p1/s//-part1/g
    :g/p2/s//-part2/g
    :g/p3/s//-part3/g

here's my rear dump:

@hejharald  
your

    had to edit /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf,
    exchanging all 'p1' with '-part1'

reminds me of things like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796\#issuecomment-386632589](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796#issuecomment-386632589)  
and the resulting  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1802](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1802)  
which is included in the ReaR 2.4 release  
so that this issue here could be a new kind of  
"multipath partition naming convention" issue.

For a detailed analysis we need

-   your `var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` file
-   the ReaR log file with debug output of `rear -D mkrescue`
-   the content of your `/etc/multipath.conf` file
-   the output of `ls -l /dev/mapper/`

See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796\#issuecomment-386996844](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796#issuecomment-386996844)  
what the usual multipath partition naming in SLES12 should be  
and subsequent comments about `kpartx` and `storix` in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796\#issuecomment-387461461](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1796#issuecomment-387461461)  
and storix' evil udev rule /etc/udev/rules.d/99-storixmpath.rules  
that changed multipath partition naming in unexpeced ways.

Perhaps in your case there is also something unexpected  
that changed the usual SLES12 multipath partition naming rules  
in unexpeced ways?
