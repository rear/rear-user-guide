Hello @gdha,

Yes it's working now, we've made the .deb and installed it ok.
Backup/Restore using DRLM seems to work as expected too.

@gdha  
I think such issues are more an enhancement than a bug  
because it enhances ReaR for newer Linux distributions.  
Strictly speaking incompatible changes in newer distributions  
can never ever be a bug in existing ReaR code because  
we cannot foresee them.
