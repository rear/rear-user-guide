-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): master git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): centos 7.3
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I find it rather strange when running `rear mkrescue` that we see
    the following message:

<!-- -->

    # rear -vd mkrescue

I know it since a long time.  
It is because same stuff is run for "mkbackup" and "mkrescue".  
I had a look but found no time to properly clean it up.  
Things are too much interwoven for a quick and clean fix.

The root cause is that both WORKFLOW\_mkbackup  
and WORKFLOW\_mkrescue need to run the 'prep' stage  
and the 'prep' stage contains  
prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh

Or in other words:  
Creating the backup is implemented intermixed  
with creating the rescue/recovery system  
but actually creating the backup happens  
usually after creating the rescue/recovery system  
except for WORKFLOW\_mkbackup on USB where  
things are additionally intermixed in another way.

@jsmeix Thanks Johannes for your review. I will try to fix this one
later this month.

Nothing that needs to be done for ReaR 2.3  
so that I set the milestone to ReaR 2.4

    mkbackuponly-workflow.sh:    SourceStage "prep"
    mkbackup-workflow.sh:   SourceStage "prep"
    mkopalpba-workflow.sh:  SourceStage "prep"
    mkrescue-workflow.sh:   SourceStage "prep"

are the workflows using the **prep** phase

This needs a more careful analysis whether or not  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/810\_prepare\_multiple\_iso.sh  
still works o.k. when the variable backuparchive is no longer set in  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
in case of the 'mkrescue' workflow.

usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/810\_prepare\_multiple\_iso.sh  
that describe the above described interdependency between  
prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh and  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/810\_prepare\_multiple\_iso.sh  
that exists except for the mkrescue workflow.
