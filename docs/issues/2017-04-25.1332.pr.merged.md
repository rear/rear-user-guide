Thanks @jsmeix,

Can we then rename `calculate` =&gt; `float_calculate` (or maybe
calculate\_float)?  
Another option would be to have one calculate function and control type
of calculation with function parameter, like:

    calculate ("int")
    calculate ("float")

?

float\_calculate (or calculate\_float) are misleading  
because the result of that function is not float.

I do not know a meaningful name for a function that  
calculates internally with basically unlimited precision  
and only output its result as integer.

Therefore I avoided possibly misleading additions  
of data types in the function name and leave it  
to the poor programmer to find out on his own  
what that beast actually does ;-)

@gozora your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332/commits/5f61f1a553da6df778774794fb105b199e919451](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332/commits/5f61f1a553da6df778774794fb105b199e919451)  
is a good example why one cannot "just always"  
use the calculate function and this shows that  
the generic name "calculate" is inappropriate  
because it makes that function look as if it  
could be "simply used".

Therefore I think a non-generic name is needed  
to make programmers aware to have a closer look  
because there is something special with that function.

Hereby I propose a name that is more specific  
but without any data types in the function name:

precision\_calculate

The name is derived from what "man bc" shows topmost:

<pre>
NAME
    bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language
</pre>

I agree with your proposal and adding mine ;-).

Another name that could make programmer to "stop and think" before use
could be:  
**mathlib\_calculate ()**

Derived from `bc -l`:

           -l, --mathlib
                  Define the standard math library.

@gozora  
I agree with you: mathlib\_calculate ()  
makes it even more obvious that this one  
is not "just normal integer calculation".

Could you perhaps also add some explanatory comment  
to the mathlib\_calculate function code, in particular this  
example here that mathlib\_calculate "7 % 4" results 0  
instead of the integer calculation remainder 3.

Using mathlib\_calculate for things like

<pre>
start_mb=$( mathlib_calculate "$start / 1024 / 1024" )

seems to work o.k. because

How will be define "simple" calculations ?  
Like: `+; - ; *` ?  
In other words where floats can't be result ?

@gozora  
what do you think:

Should mathlib\_calculate be used everywhere where possible  
or should bash arithmetic still be used when no multiplication  
happens?

Simple sums and differences bash can calculate up to 2^63 - 1  
which is sufficient for disks up to 8 EiB minus one byte.

Only when a multiplication happens  
the values are limited in practice up to 2^31 - 1  
(i.e. then it fails for disks with 2 GiB and more).

@gozora  
with "simple calculations" I meant only sums and differences.  
mathlib\_calculate must be used when there is at least one
multiplication.

In my opinion we should unify ALL calculations (or all new calculations
at least) except modulo under mathlib\_calculate ().  
That would avoid lots of problems with limitations of `awk` or bash
arithmetic expansions, or I don't know what else.

FWIW:  
I really dislike code like

<pre>
end="$(($end-1))B"
</pre>

that changes the data type of a variable by the way  
which results some additional "WTF" while wondering  
"WTF does that 'end' thingy actually contain"...

Apart from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332\#issuecomment-297371922](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1332#issuecomment-297371922),
it will be easier to define development guideline like:  
"For all computations except modulo use mathlib\_calculate()"  
is better then  
"For sums and differences use mathlib\_calculate()".

The first one looks more clear to me ...

Yes, I've noticed

    end="$(($end-1))B"

code, but as I did not had time to study it deeper, I just did lazy
transfer to new function ...

@gozora  
I fully agree with you so that I "just merged" it now.

Many thanks for your patience with this  
unexpectedly complicated issue!

Isn't it the most primitive use case for a computer  
to "just calculate" (correctly?)  
;-)

@gdha, @jsmeix, @schlomo, @dagwieers, @jhoekx  
Would anybody mind if I add to following to [ReaR
wiki](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#relax-and-recover-functions):

    For all mathematical calculations except modulo (%) use mathlib_calculate()
    (see #1332 for more details)

?

@gozora  
in general fine with me.  
But I would not use the strict "all ... except modulo"  
because I think there are other valid exceptions.  
I would keep it more neutral like  
the description in global-functions.sh  
already is - something like

<pre>
* mathlib_calculate()
  For mathematical calculations use mathlib_calculate()
  unless strict integer calculation is required, see
  usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh how to use it.
  For example instead of using bash arithmetic
    result=$(( 2**32 * 2**32 ))
  that fails because numbers get too big for bash use
    result=$( mathlib_calculate "2^32 * 2^32" )
</pre>

@gdha In my opinion this is not a quality merge.

Because of a bug in a speed optimised variant (`mawk`) of a generic
tool, the generic (`awk`) tool is ditched completely and replaced by a
completely different tool. Not knowing which new issues that will be
introduced.

Better revert to the old `awk` code, rename that to limit running only
`gawk` (because GNU awk hasn't got these large integer calculation
issues), and catch the remaining issues (for example an `mawk` only
source OS) with additional code/tools/new dependencies.
