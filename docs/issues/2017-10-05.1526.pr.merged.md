See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1517](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1517)

Now usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh contains only  
those functions (and dependantfunctions and variabes)  
that are called by the usual ReaR scripts and all  
what is needed for DHCP setup in the recovery system  
by the recovery system startup scripts in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default is split from network-functions.sh  
into the new skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
that is sourced by skel/default/bin/dhclient-script  
and skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

For me a quick test via "rear mkrescue"  
and "rear recover" still worked  
but that does not mean very much.

I still get the 'MASKS readonly variable'  
reported during recovery system startup  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1524](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1524)  
because the 'MASKS readonly variable' is  
both left in lib/network-functions.sh and in the  
new skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
which are both sourced - I will fix that later.

@gdha @schabrolles please have a look  
if you find immediate issues with that.

@gozora please have a look because of

I renamed MASKS into NETMASKS in dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
and into NETMASKS\_DECIMAL in network-functions.sh and  
both without 'readonly' as a quick fix to avoid  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1524](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1524)  
because there are zillions of things in ReaR that should  
better not be arbitrarily overwritten without being 'readonly'  
so that - at least for now - one more should not really matter.

I also overhauled the remaining old functions in  
usr/share/rear/lib/network-functions.sh.

Now "rear mkrescue" plus "rear recover"  
works well for me without 'readonly variable' messages.

Hello @jsmeix,

I've just add `LANG=C` back because it was present in original code. I
don't have explicit knowledge what is it good for :-(, I just didn't
want to break anything.

Searching the code, this function was introduced by
38d5bd280654dd4e05a8a408daad8e08925c3ab0 authored by @gdha so maybe he
know more ...

V.

As far as I see that 'LANG=C' exists also originally  
in that old fedora-14 dhclient-script which is now mostly in  
skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh  
where I kept is as is (as some other 'LANG' stuff too).  
I think in lib/network-functions.sh it is really not needed.

If there are no strict objections I will merge it tomorrow  
so that we have at least a first step to further proceed.
