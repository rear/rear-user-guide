An image created on a VMware guest with VMware-Tools installed, creates
a 140MB ISO image. The breakdown of the big diskspace consumers are:

    15M     /bin/
    66M     /lib/
    11M     /lib64/
    292M    /usr/

breaking this further down to the most detailed/relevant view:

    28M     /lib/firmware/
    37M     /lib/modules/
    23M     /usr/lib/vmware-tools/lib32/
    27M     /usr/lib/vmware-tools/lib64/
    215M    /usr/lib/vmware-tools/modules/

So I guess instead of including the complete /usr/lib/vmware-tools/, we
need to look at being a bit more smart about it. I think we can exclude
/usr/Lib/vmware-tools/modules/ completely. An RPM based installation of
VMware-Tools might also be better than the example manual installation
:-/

The inclusion of the complete /usr/lib/vmware-tools/ directory inflates
the rescue image greatly. I want to understand the goals of including
this complete directory:

prep/GNU/Linux/28\_include\_vmware\_tools.sh:

    #  $Id$
    # 
    #  recent vmware tools (or maybe it is just open-vm-tools on SUSE) keep their modules
    #  outside the /lib/modules path. To cope with that we add the vmware-tools if vmxnet
    #  is loaded but modinfo cannot find it.

    if lsmod | grep -q vmxnet ; then
            if ! modinfo vmxnet >&8 2>&1; then
                    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib*/vmware-tools )
                    Log "Including '/usr/lib*/vmware-tools'"
            fi
    fi

As I don't see a good reason to include the complete VMware-Tools, but
also don't want to add the complete VMware-Tools modules directory
(containing modules for all sorts of kernels for all sorts of
distributions) is there not a better solution for this situation ?

Either move the modules (and dependencies) directly into
/lib/modules/... or something even better ?

PS On RHEL6 the VMware modules are part of the kernel shipped by Red
Hat. So I doubt we even need this directory at all.

I think this was added by Schlomo? We better wait until he is back...to
understand the background of it.

The reason why it fails on RHEL6 is because the VMware network module is
called vmxnet3, and so the first match works, but the second fails (as
if the module is not in the normal modules directory). But even if I
correct this for RHEL6, the reported problem still exists for those
distributions using vmxnet as part of VMwareTools.

@dagwieers can this issue be closed? Or are we still waiting on
feedback?

This is something we should improve IMO. It makes no sense to include
everything under the sun, if we only need to have the modules for our
specific kernel. So I would keep this issue open until this improvement
is implemented.

I moved it to the "Rear future" milestone since it's not blocking us,
but if someone interested in fixing this he can find the cause and
understands the what and the why. I could implement what I think is
required, but have no means to test it myself, so I prefer to not do it
myself.

On my testsystem it looks good - so the task can "finally" closed ? ;)

+1: we also have no impact of the vmware-tools
