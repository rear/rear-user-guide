Need to rebuild initramfs after restoring to a new Hardware.  
I copy the script file from
finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh to
finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/50\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh to limit my change
to ppc64 architecture only.  
But I think we could put this script directly under finalize/SUSE\_LINUX
as it is the same mkinitrd command for all the HW architecture.

It seems we need to change the order from 17\_ to 50\_ to avoid failure
during mkinitrd command.

@schabrolles there is no possibility I can test this enhancement,
therefore, I hope it was properly tested by you? I accept the pull
request for 1.19 (as an exception).
