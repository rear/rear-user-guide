#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Pull Request Template

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested with ReaR 2.3 under RHEL7.4 on a HP DL360 Gen9 with SPP
    2017.10 installed.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This change is required because in HP's SPP (Service Pack for
    Proliant) the hpacucli/hpssacli is now (recognised with Version
    3.10) called "ssacli" and the installation directory's name has been
    renamed as well.

@hpannenb  
could you provide all changes that are needed to fix one same issue  
in one same pull request so that we can more easily see  
what things belong together and how that pieces work together.  
Also later after things were merged other users can then understand  
when looking at a particular merge commit what things belong together  
and how that pieces work together to solve a particular issue.

Hi, Johannes.

Sorry for the inconvenience but I added both the pull requests "straight
forward" online @ github.com instead of using my devel environment. I am
not the expert if or how these can be merged into one pull request.

Regards,  
Holger.

@hpannenb  
FYI what the best description from my point of view is  
how to work with GitHub pull requests in general,  
see in the "Contributing" section at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
the
`see also this article for an illustrated guide to keep your forked repo in sync`  
where `this article` links to  
[https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/](https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/)
