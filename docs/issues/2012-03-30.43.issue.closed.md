This item comes from the old TODO file.

@gdha Not sure if this is still an open issue ?

We search for dhclient, dhcpcd, dhclient6, dhcp6c and what-ever the user
defines for DHCLIENT\_BIN or DHCLIENT6\_BIN.  
Therefore, I believe, we're covered here.  
Are there still complaints from out user-base? Otherwise, I think it is
fair to close this issue.

I was not sure if the TODO items were still valid, so please reopen if
you find this is still an issue.
