[\#3206 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3206) `merged`: Portable recovery
===============================================================================

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101384?v=4" width="50">[schlomo](https://github.com/schlomo) opened issue at [2024-04-09 21:52](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3206):

Add `OUTPUT=PORTABLE` and `--portable` command line option to faciliate
using ReaR in truly portable mode.

The portable archive contains **only** ReaR, nothing else.

Tested with an OL9 restore via SystemRescueCD

I'll do some more testing both of portable usage and regular usage to
ensure that this change doesn't hurt us.

Implements \#3190 and should be merged after \#3205, where I extracted
the unrelated fixes. To review you can simply look at the last commit
here.

I miss some documentation here. Is it possible to add it?

@gdha I added a short manual

@jsmeix the help workflow had bad indentation which I of course fixed,
besides that I reduced the whitespace changes.

My goal at the moment is to get feedback on this and do some more tests.
There will be a second phase of development with further optimisations
(for example, I want to see if I can skip the `build` stage entirely to
speed things up).

Aaargh, now I get also

because the `TMPDIR` is set for portable mode. Which means that I need
to extend \#3168 to not touch the temp dir for portable mode.

About dracut not showing errors in the ReaR log, I could redirect the
output to properly capture it.

I did not have a look here (no time yet)  
so the following is only an offhanded thought:

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3206\#issuecomment-2047273428](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3206#issuecomment-2047273428)  
dracut and portable mode:

Currently we have in sbin/rear

    test -e "/etc/rear-release" && RECOVERY_MODE='y' || RECOVERY_MODE=''
    readonly RECOVERY_MODE

and we do not change TMPDIR in RECOVERY\_MODE

        if ! test "$RECOVERY_MODE" ; then
            # We set TMPDIR to ReaR's TMP_DIR only when we are not in RECOVERY_MODE

so I think you need to enhance how RECOVERY\_MODE is set  
so that RECOVERY\_MODE is also set for "rear recover"  
in "portable mode"?

@jsmeix about the dracut not showing errors problem I figured out what
is going on:

In normal (non-debug) ReaR mode stderr goes to `$STDOUT_STDERR_FILE` and
the `Error` function can then quote from that. However, our code
surrounding dracut doesn't use the `Error` function but instead only
does a `LogPrint` suggesting to look into the `$RUNTIME_LOGFILE`, and
that is the reason that the logfile doesn't contain useful infos.

How should we solve this? Maybe extract the "pull last lines from
stderr" into a function that can then be used? Or add a `LogPrintError`
function that will also show last errors if exist?

I'm not solving this here but I think it is important to keep in mind
and fix so that users can get an info about the problem for errors
without running ReaR again in debug mode.

I found a bug in this code, it doesn't work when used from a dist
install :-(

I'll keep debugging then.

It's the `Makefile` patching the main script, so I'll improve the
Makefile for this, too.
