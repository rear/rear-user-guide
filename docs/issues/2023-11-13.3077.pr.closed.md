In layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh  
also read NSR server name from var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr\_server  
by using the same code snippet as in
verify/NSR/default/400\_verify\_nsr.sh

@hpannenb @viper1986  
could you please have a look here  
and ideally could you test  
if things still work for you with this changes  
as you need it in your particular use cases?

@rear/contributors  
could you please also have a look here  
perhaps you could spot some obvious mistake?

As far as I currently see  
from plain looking at the NSR related code  
I think the curent changes here still do not set  
NSRSERVER properly in 650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh

Reason (a far as I see):

`$VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server` is written in  
rescue/NSR/default/460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh via

    echo "$NSRSERVER" > $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server

which is (as far as I see) the only place where  
`$VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server` is written.

But during "rear mkrescue"  
layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh  
is run before  
rescue/NSR/default/460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh  
(the 'layout' stage runs before the 'rescue' stage).

So  
for the very first run of "rear mkrescue"  
`$VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server`  
would not exist  
and  
if the NSR server name changes then  
layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh  
would read an old/outdated NSR server name  
in `$VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server`  
from the previous run of "rear mkrescue".

Looking at this whole code area again I'm starting to wonder what we are
trying to achieve there. Most other `layout/save` additions for backup
software actually only go and extend the `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` variable
with the configuration directories of the backup software, for example
like this:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/e035d18034137b30b7b47fe2863fb578f0e9933d/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GALAXY11/default/400\_check\_galaxy11\_configuration.sh\#L3](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/e035d18034137b30b7b47fe2863fb578f0e9933d/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GALAXY11/default/400_check_galaxy11_configuration.sh#L3)

Can we maybe clarify why we try to do much more for NSR? Why do we need
to verify the client or server configuration or the existence of backups
*in* NSR during the `checklayout` workflow? I'd expect this to happen
during the `mkrescue` workflow, if at all.

Maybe the actual "fix" would be getting rid of this all together?

As far as I understand what @tomglx requested in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/653](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/653)  
is basically that the checklayout workflow  
should be enhanced to also check if the backup still exists.

It think this is (as far as I understand it) bad  
because is mixes up to check the disk layout  
with checking the backup  
so it implements RFC 1925 item (5)

    It is always possible to aglutenate [sic]
    multiple separate problems into a single
    complex interdependent solution.
    In most cases this is a bad idea.

Thanks @jsmeix for finding it, I apparently wasn't part of the
conversation back then.

Looking at it again I'd like to either

-   remove this functionality as it is actually not really part of the
    ReaR job
-   make it optionally behind a configuration flag
    `NSR_CHECKLAYOUT_CHECK_BACKUPS` that is *off* by default
-   maybe add `CHECKLAYOUT_CUSTOM_COMMANDS` to simplify running extra
    code as part of `checklayout` workflows.

My reasoning is that ReaR `checklayout` main purpose is alerting for the
need to re-create the rescue image because the *layout* of the local
system changed. Using it to monitor the backup software is in my opinion
another problem that ReaR cannot fulfil well, as it depends on a lot
more context than what ReaR typically has.

therefore I'd like to make backup monitoring at least optional, and
simplify integrating custom code for this purpose.

WDYT @rear/contributors ?

@schlomo  
I fully agree with your reasoning  
but I would not even make that optional,  
at least not in the check\_LAYOUT\_ workflow  
because check\_BACKUP\_ tasks do not belong there  
so if at all a well separated checkbackup workflow  
might be implemented if someone implements it.

So I vote for

    remove this functionality as it is actually not really part of the ReaR job

I described my personal reasoning in the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think we should try to be nice to our users, which is why I suggest to
remove the functionality from `checklayout` and add a new feature to run
custom code during `checklayout`.

It seems that for users it is simpler to refer to a custom script or put
custom code in ReaR config compared to plugging their script into the
ReaR filesystem hierarchy to be executed as part of a workflow. That was
the original idea of ReaR extensibility that apparently doesn't find
much acceptance from users.

@schlomo  
I can confirm that at least certain customers  
do not want to add own scripts into ReaR directories  
or adapt existing ReaR scripts as they need it  
but only can specify things in config files.  
I never got a reason or even an explanation why.  
My blind guess is that they perhaps in general  
do not want or cannot touch what is installed as RPMs?  
I guess perhaps because of issues with RPM package updates  
or issues with support for "touched" software ('rpm -V' checks)?  
So it seems at least for certain customers the whole idea of  
"enhance and adapt the software as needed"  
does not fit?  
Perhaps actually many customers appreciate it that they can  
"enhance and adapt the ReaR scripts as needed"  
but I never hear something from them?

I'd guess that it mostly an aversion to go and patch 3rd party software,
even though it is intended to be used that way.

Adding a file into the ReaR directories will *not* break RPM or DEB
validation, which is why I proposed it as the original way of extending
ReaR (via a `custom-rear` package that ships some files to extend ReaR
and depends on the `rear` package to bring in ReaR)

Anyway, would you like to rework this PR as discussed here?

No, I cannot.  
Reason:  
In general there is nothing what I could do  
in case of issues with third-party backup tools  
because I do not have such software  
so I can neither test nor reproduce anything.
