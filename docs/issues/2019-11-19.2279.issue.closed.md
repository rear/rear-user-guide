This is to continue a discussion about whether to extend the
functionality of `COPY_AS_IS` with respect to detecting and/or
automatically adding missing shared libraries.

This is a starting point of former postings:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#discussion\_r347488398](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#discussion_r347488398)

> To verify my assumption I ask you to do the following test:

I did some tests on a production development system (equipped with SSDs
in a RAID 1 configuration). I've used `rear mkopalpba` as this was where
the libraries were missing. I'm reluctant to post complete logs publicly
from such a system but I nevertheless tried to capture all the relevant
information.

#### Console output

These common lines appeared at the top of each run and were stripped
from output below for better readability:

    Cannot include default keyboard mapping (no KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY specified)
    Cannot include keyboard mappings (neither KEYMAPS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY nor KEYMAPS_DIRECTORIES specified)
    Broken symlink '/bin/vim' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target
    Symlink '/usr/share/misc/magic' -> '/usr/share/file/magic' refers to a non-existing directory on the recovery system.
    It will not be copied by default. You can include '/usr/share/file/magic' via the 'COPY_AS_IS' configuration variable.
    Symlink '/var/lib/rear' -> '/var/lib/rear' refers to a non-existing directory on the recovery system.
    It will not be copied by default. You can include '/var/lib/rear' via the 'COPY_AS_IS' configuration variable.

#### Log excerpts

-   Log excerpt from configuration no. 4:
    [4.log.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3864220/4.log.txt)

#### Remarks

-   Checking each and every file (no. 2) takes about 20 additional
    seconds (+50%) on a seemingly rather fast system.
-   Including just shared libraries into the search required almost no
    additional time (below measurement precision).
-   Configurations no. 3 and no. 4 limit the check to executables and
    shared libraries conforming to Linux conventions (cf. [Shared
    Libraries](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html)).
-   Configuration no. 4 limits the check to all reasonable directories
    containing executables according to the [Filesystem Hierarchy
    Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard).
    (As this uses find with  
    multiple starting points, stripping `$ROOTFS_DIR` from paths could
    not be done via `-printf`, so sed was used.)
-   To choose an option, there are some conflicting goals to consider:
    -   Fast runtime -&gt; shorter testing cycles for ReaR developers
        and users -&gt; more contributions, better product quality
    -   More complete checking -&gt; catching remaining errors early
        -&gt; better operational quality
    -   Safer checking -&gt; reducing the attack surface -&gt;
        protecting privacy, avoiding financial losses
-   Keeping in mind that all of the above alternatives would improve the
    current situation: If we cannot have everything, which goal do we
    value more?  
    We'd have to judge the likelihood and risks involved. Would we go
    for finding problems in obscure places or would we prefer higher
    security?
-   In my view, as ReaR is a program that runs regularly with root
    privileges, I'd favor security over catching errors in obscure
    situations. Note that chroot doesn't help here as root can easily
    break out of it (cf. [Is chroot a security feature? - Red Hat
    Customer
    Portal](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975883)).

For completeness and easier readability  
a copy of the relevant posts about this topic here  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278)

A copy of

Now I am wondering if there could be ever a use case  
to have a shared object (library) in the ReaR recovery system  
but not also all of its dependant required other shared objects?

I think a shared object (library) can not at all work  
without its dependant required other shared objects  
so I think

-   either have a shared object with all its required other shared
    objects
-   or do not have the shared object at all because it is useless

Or could a shared object be useful in any way  
without all its required other shared objects?

No. It just won't load. So it is a non-functional trap waiting for
someone to step into. ;-)

And I'd like to object, as least a bit: While ReaR is not that high on
(even developer-oriented) usability, it is not that bad: ReaR has so
many little functions included that try to auto-detect and/or
auto-correct stuff which would be hard to get right the first time. So
it just works in many cases, which makes it get usability points. ReaR
also includes considerable effort to spot problems and provide useful
information in logs, which makes it get additional points.

So maybe improving COPY\_AS\_IS to inspect shared libraries would be a
good idea. Currently, it lets ldd look at every shell/python/whatever
executable script, so why not make it inspect shared libraries? The only
problem would be the naming. It's not just *.so or *.so* (as this would
include syslog.socket) or lib*.so\*. You could have:

-   libSegFault.so
-   libacl.so.1.1.0
-   pam\_gdm.so

Maybe something like \*.so plus *.so.\[0-9\]* would do...

My reason behinf my question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#discussion\_r347445136](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#discussion_r347445136)  
is exactly what you propose in your reply  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#discussion\_r347458656](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#discussion_r347458656)

improving COPY\_AS\_IS to inspect shared libraries would be a good idea

but I would try to go even further and try to  
improve COPY\_AS\_IS to inspect all regular files  
because as far as I know ldd won't run amok  
for files that it cannot work with  
e.g. on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system

    # ldd /etc/fstab 
    ldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for `/etc/fstab'
            not a dynamic executable

    # ldd /boot/vmlinuz-4.12.14-lp150.12.82-default
    ldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for `/boot/vmlinuz-4.12.14-lp150.12.82-default'
            not a dynamic executable

    # ldd /dev/sda
    ldd: /dev/sda: not regular file

which may result in the end to inspect all regular files  
in the recovery system, i.e. to enhance first and foremost  
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
to check all files if they have all required libraries  
actually accessible inside the recovery system.

A copy of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#discussion\_r347495018](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#discussion_r347495018)

All files would probaby be a bit too much. I've tested a bit and found
that this one would get me all shared libraries:

    find / -mount \( -name \*.so -o -name \*.so.[0-9]\* \) -print

But some caution from
[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html)
seems advisable:

        Security

        Be aware that in some circumstances (e.g., where the program speci‐
        fies an ELF interpreter other than ld-linux.so), some versions of ldd
        may attempt to obtain the dependency information by attempting to
        directly execute the program, which may lead to the execution of
        whatever code is defined in the program's ELF interpreter, and per‐
        haps to execution of the program itself. (In glibc versions before
        2.27, the upstream ldd implementation did this for example, although
        most distributions provided a modified version that did not.)

        Thus, you should never employ ldd on an untrusted executable, since
        this may result in the execution of arbitrary code. A safer alterna‐
        tive when dealing with untrusted executables is:

        $ objdump -p /path/to/program | grep NEEDED

        Note, however, that this alternative shows only the direct dependen‐
        cies of the executable, while ldd shows the entire dependency tree of
        the executable.

So if someone configured ReaR to include user-writable directories in
COPY\_AS\_IS, executables lying around there might be executed with root
privileges. This could already happen currently, so it would probably be
a good idea to limit executable examination to safe paths only.

It is not clear from the above statement whether a shared library would
be considered an executable, too (in most respects, it is). So if
COPY\_AS\_IS were to be extended, it would probably be safer to limit
automatic examination of shared libraries to safe paths only (such as
/lib and /usr/lib) as well.

I still think that extending COPY\_AS\_IS would be a good idea and might
even save you some support headaches later on.

A copy of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#discussion\_r347813267](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#discussion_r347813267)

I know about the security issues with ldd  
which is another reason behind why I think  
I should first and foremost enhance 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
to inspect all regular files of the recovery system with ldd  
because 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh is unning ldd within the  
recovery system build directory via chroot $ROOTFS\_DIR ... ldd  
so that things happen within a separated chroot environment  
and not directly on the original running system.

I think if 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh would have checked all regular files  
with ldd you would have got a notification about the missing  
libraries in your particular recovery system.

To verify my assumption I ask you to do the following test:  
Change in your build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh the line

    for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable -printf '/%P\n' ) ; do

to

    for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -printf '/%P\n' ) ; do

(i.e. remove the -executable to find all regular files)  
and run "rear -D mkrescue" but without your

    OPAL_PBA_LIBS+=( /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/plymouth/*.so )

and attach your rear debug log so that I can have a look  
how things behave then in your case.

I tested it on my rather fast computer on plain command line  
where testing all regular files in a /tmp/rear.XXXXXX/rootfs  
means testing about 16 times more files  
(11769 regular files instead of 732 executables)  
which needs about 14 times more time  
(about one and a half minute instead of 6 seconds):

    # ROOTFS_DIR=/tmp/rear.lASNytXC8KICp3f/rootfs

    # find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable -printf '/%P\n' | wc -l
    732

    # find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -printf '/%P\n' | wc -l
    11769

    # time for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable -printf '/%P\n' ) ; \
     do chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "cd $( dirname $binary ) \
     && ldd $binary" </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'not found' \
     && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary" ; done

    real    0m5.534s
    user    0m3.964s
    sys     0m3.096s

    # time for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -printf '/%P\n' ) ; \
     do chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "cd $( dirname $binary ) \
     && ldd $binary" </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'not found' \
     && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary" ; done

    real    1m17.684s
    user    0m55.042s
    sys     0m41.441s

I think one or two minutes more time during "rear mkrescue"  
do not matter in practice because I assume there is plenty of time  
when the admin runs "rear mkrescue" (or even "rear mkbackup")  
and it results a more reliably working recovery system  
which could save the admin hours of later work  
when the recovery system does not work.

The only case I know where time matters for "rear mkrescue"  
is the broken by design 'udev' workflow, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)

I also tested "rear mkresue" with a modified 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh

    -for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -executable -printf '/%P\n' ) ; do
    +for binary in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -printf '/%P\n' ) ; do
    ...
    -    # Redirected stdin for login shell avoids motd welcome message, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2120.
    -    chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "cd $( dirname $binary ) && ldd $binary" < /dev/null | grep -q 'not found' && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary"
    +    # Redirected stdin for login shell avoids motd welcome message, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2120
    +    # and redirected stderr avoids tons of ldd warning messages in the log like 'ldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for ...'
    +    # cf. https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html
    +    chroot $ROOTFS_DIR /bin/bash --login -c "cd $( dirname $binary ) && ldd $binary" </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'not found' && broken_binaries="$broken_binaries $binary"

That modified 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh needed only about 40 seconds  
during "rear mkrescue" in my case.

The reason is that kernel modules are not tested, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh\#L99](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh#L99)  
and from the 11769 regular files in my recovery system  
there are 3935 kernel modules

    # find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f | wc -l
    11769

    # find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f | grep '/lib/modules/' | wc -l
    3935

so only about two-thirds of the regular files  
are actually tested with ldd.

The whole "rear mkrescue" took one minute and 15 seconds  
with testing all regular files that are no kernel modules.

I noticed that I use FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'no' ) (as I always do)  
which is not the default.  
Without it (i.e. by default) I get about 2000 firmware files  
in the recovery system where running ldd also does  
not make sense so I also skip ldd for firmware files

    -    # so we 'grep' for '/lib/modules/' anywhere in the full path of the binary:
    -    grep -q "/lib/modules/" <<<"$binary" && continue
    +    # so we 'grep' for '/lib/modules/' anywhere in the full path of the binary.
    +    # Also skip the ldd test for firmware files where it also does not make sense:
    +    egrep -q '/lib/modules/|/lib.*/firmware/' <<<"$binary" && continue

which saves me about 6 seconds for useless ldd for firmware files.

A copy of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#discussion\_r347854647](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#discussion_r347854647)

I was thinking about if it could be sufficient  
to run ldd only for the regular files in some  
"well known" directories in the recovery system.

I did a quick test to see in which directories in the recovery system  
ldd found regular files that are dynamic executables  
i.e. in which directories in the recovery system there are  
files where running ldd makes sense:

    # ROOTFS_DIR=/tmp/rear.c3mdOvGKSRIkH8L/rootfs/

    # for d in $( for f in $( find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f -printf '/%P\n' ) ; \
     do ldd $f 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'not a dynamic executable' \
     && echo $f is a dynamic executable ; done \
     | grep 'is a dynamic executable' | cut -d ' ' -f1 ) ; \
     do dirname $d ; done | sort -u

    /bin
    /lib64
    /usr/lib/dracut
    /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/99kdump
    /usr/lib/perl5/5.26.1/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/CORE
    /usr/lib/systemd
    /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators
    /usr/lib/udev
    /usr/lib64
    /usr/lib64/rsyslog

Accordingly files where running ldd makes sense  
can appear in arbitrary directories in the recovery system  
so it is not sufficient to run ldd only for the regular files  
in some "well known" directories in the recovery system.

@OliverO2  
thank you so much for your valuable input.  
It helps a lot and it is much appreciated!

On first glance I like your item 3. most of all

    find $ROOTFS_DIR -type f \( -executable -o -name '*.so' -o -name '*.so.[0-9]*' \) -printf '/%P\n':

because it is simple and straightforward  
and it is reasonably complete  
(libraries without a '.so...' suffix are considered "unreasonable")  
and it still runs fast.

By the way:  
I don't know if the much simplified directory structure  
in the recovery system is still in compliance with the FHS  
so by gut feeling I prefer a generic method (as in your item 3.)  
over a method that depends on compliance with a standard  
(perhaps currently it is in compliance with FHS but  
should we depend and rely on that for the future?), cf.

constructs"

@OliverO2  
if you like you could test

@jsmeix  
The FHS is pretty broad, so with respect to this issue ReaR is
sufficiently compliant. I'd say that find configuration no. 4 would
almost never miss a single executable or library. I'd be surprised if
any of the supported operating systems or ReaR itself were deviating
from the directories covered by no 4.

I would not expect problems own my own if you'd not limit the directory
list. But I'd be unhappy if some admin by accident configured something
like `/home/hugo/testing` into `COPY_AS_IS`, forgets about it later, and
then some scary executables make it into that user directory, having
code execute with root privileges on the next (automatic) run of
`rear mkrescue`. The common policy for privileged executables is to do
only what's absolutely necessary with root privileges and drop
privileges as soon as possible.

I'll do.

Have tested it with `mkopalpba`, successfully. Made me even find another
set of libraries with one additional missing dependency. Pushed another
commit to correct this.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2280](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2280)
merged  
this issue should be fixed for now.

I would like to do a mitigation of the ldd security issue  
with things like `COPY_AS_IS+=( /home/JohnDoe )`  
in a separated pull request, cf.

@OliverO2  
I would appreciate it if you could have a look at my subsequent pull
request  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286)

merged  
the mitigation of the ldd security issue  
with things like `COPY_AS_IS+=( /home/JohnDoe )`  
is implemented.

@OliverO2  
because since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286)  
the ldd test is skipped for files with untrused owner  
it can now happen that executables with untrused owner  
do not work in the recovery system when there are  
missing libraries for executables with untrused owner  
and "rear mkrescue" would not error out in this case  
but the user is at least informed, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286\#issuecomment-559757716](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2286#issuecomment-559757716)

My next step is to use TRUSTED\_FILE\_OWNERS to check  
all files before they are copied into the recovery system  
or directly after they were copied into the recovery system  
(depending on what works better or is simpler to implement)  
which will be done via a separated pull request (as time permits).
