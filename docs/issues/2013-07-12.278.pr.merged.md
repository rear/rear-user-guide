[\#278 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/278) `merged`: Backup in ISO feature
=================================================================================

As discussed in \#264, I implemented that feature by moving the output
phase after the backup creation but only when it's needed to integrate
the backup in the ISO.  
In this way, they won't be any regression for other output type such as
ODBR.  
It wasn't possible to keep the current order because it implies to much
changes in output and a lot of code duplication, especially for the ISO
copy to OUTPUT\_URL.

As Dag suggested, I implemented a new iso scheme for BACKUP\_URL which
avoid a new option.  
For instance, BACKUP\_URL=iso://my\_backups will copy backups in a
subdir called my\_backups inside the ISO image.  
But, to use this feature, OUTPUT\_URL needs to be defined to another
location.
