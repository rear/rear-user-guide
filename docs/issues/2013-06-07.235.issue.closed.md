Hi,

I would appreciate it if rear would recreate initrd for all kernels that
are listed in /etc/grub.conf while recovery, not only for the running
one. This could avoid kernel panics if one boots a recovered server with
a different kernel whose initramfs hadn't been recreated. This can
easily happen, if the server runnig mkrescue has a newer kernel version
installed than it is running and usually the "default=" in
/etc/grub.conf is 0.

thanks and best regards  
Tim

This is a fair suggestion and should not be very difficult to implement.

Are you willing to contribute such a script ?

@goldzahn please share your problems you have seen during your tests...
I'm afraid the code could be half-broken? want to be sure...

@gdha sorry for delay. The problems I saw were caused by my changes. Now
it seems to work, I will file a pull request soon.

@goldzahn does it still work after you merged pull request? If positive,
then we can close this case I guess?
