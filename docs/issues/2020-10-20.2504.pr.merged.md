Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **New Feature** / **Enhancement** / **Other?**  
    Enhancement.

-   Impact: **Low** / **Normal** / **High** / **Critical** /
    **Urgent**  
    Normal.

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2204](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2204)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Quite thoroughly. I've run many backup followed by recover tests on
    Fedora 32, RHEL 8.2 and Fedora 25 (because there is LUKS1 by default
    on f25). I didn't notice any issues when I used default encryption
    during install of the system. I've also tried various
    ciphers/key-sizes/hash variants to ensure that values given by
    luksDump parsing on LUKS2 are meaningful and to recreating LUKS1 on
    system where LUKS2 is default and vice versa.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    a) it adds new parameter 'type' to 'crypt' keyword used in
    disklayout.conf. Using this parameter allows to recreate the same
    version of LUKS that was on the system  
    b) it adds LUKS version detection, parsing depending on version and
    usage of 'type' parameter have been added to  
    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/260\_crypt\_layout.sh

I'm aware that this is useful mainly for basic LUKS2 setup (let's say
similar to LUKS1), but I believe that even so it could be sufficient for
many users.

And I wonder... wouldn't be better to backup and restore complete LUKS
header instead of taking values from luksDump and creating new one? That
would simplify things a lot and, for example, users won't lose keys from
additional keyslots, ...

@gdha  
please could you add a new initial `release-notes-2-7.md` to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation)  
so that I could adapt the "Supported and Unsupported Operating Systems"
section  
for ReaR 2.7 right now?

I've tested and your changes and it works fine, no problem there. But
I've found different issue that emerged when multiple keys were defined
in LUKS header (this is not done by system installer by default, that's
main reason why I've missed it before). I fixed that with additional
commit.

@vcrhonek  
thank you for adding initial LUKS2 support to ReaR!

Regarding your question in your initial entry (excerpts)

    backup and restore complete LUKS header
    users won't lose keys from additional keyslots

In general the ReaR recovery system must be free of secrets  
except the user has explicitly configured something different,  
cf. the reasoning about SSH\_UNPROTECTED\_PRIVATE\_KEYS in
default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1523](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1523)

I don't know about LUKS internals so I don't know if complete LUKS
headers  
in the ReaR recovery system could contain secrets or could be used  
by someone to extract keys relatively easily (e.g. like getting
/etc/shadow  
from a host so one could do long running cracking attempts to get
passwords).

@jsmeix  
You're welcome, thank you for your review and improvements!

I see. I don't know much about LUKS internals either. Most of the header
is encrypted, but I'm afraid that if someone has copy of it, keys from
the header could be used to access the data even if these keys are no
longer valid (were removed in more recent version of header). I can ask
LUKS experts.

I was thinking to introduce LUKS\_HEADER\_RESTORE variable that would
(when explicitly configured by user) cause usage of
luksHeaderBackup/Restore instead of calling luksFormat. I did few tests
and it seems to work fine. Please let me know if you think that it would
be beneficial, I can contribute the code.

Regarding `cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup` and
`cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore`  
the cryptsetup man page (from cryptsetup-2.0.6 in my case) describes it
perfectly:

    luksHeaderBackup <device> --header-backup-file <file>

    Stores a binary backup of the LUKS header and keyslot area.
    Note: Using '-' as filename writes the header backup to a file named '-'.
    WARNING:
    This backup file and a passphrase valid at the time of backup
    allows decryption of the LUKS data area, even if the passphrase
    was later changed or removed from the LUKS device.
    Also note that with a header backup you lose the ability to securely
    wipe the LUKS device by just overwriting the header and key-slots.
    You either need to securely erase all header backups in addition
    or overwrite the encrypted data area as well. The second option
    is less secure, as some sectors can survive, e.g. due to defect
    management.

I appreciate to introduce a new LUKS\_HEADER\_RESTORE config variable  
that is well described in default.conf (including the information about
possible  
security issues with header backup files in ReaR recovery system ISOs or
media)  
and which of course must not be enabled by default.

So I look forward to your subsequent pull requests to further improve
LUKS support in ReaR.

@vcrhonek  
it seems for me the current LUKS2 support does not work as intended.  
Currently I use cryptsetup version 2.0.6 on openSUSE Leap 15.1.  
For my LUKS2 volume `cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda8` shows

where the currect code cannot determine the `key_size` value  
because nothing matches `grep -m 1 "Cipher key"`  
and therefore I get in my disklayout.conf

    crypt /dev/mapper/luks2test /dev/sda8 type=luks2 cipher=aes-xts-plain64 key_size= hash=sha256 uuid=3e874a28-7415-4f8c-9757-b3f28a96c4d2

I think in my case the right command would be

    # cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda8 | grep -m 1 "Key:" | sed -r 's/^.+:\s*(.+) bits$/\1/'
    256

The actual problem with the current code is not that it fails  
to parse particular kind of `cryptsetup luksDump` output.

The actual problem with the current code is that it does not care  
when it failed to parse the `cryptsetup luksDump` output.

This is a general problem with so much code in ReaR  
(in particular almost all older code in ReaR is made this way)  
that it more or less carelessly and blindly proceeds and does not care  
about possible errors, cf. "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

In this particular case one would have to check what option values  
of the `crypt` entries in disklayout.conf are needed and for those  
there must be basic tests that check whether or not the values  
are at least of basically right syntax - e.g. the `key_size` value  
should be a positive integer (that is a multiple of 8),  
cf. "man cryptsetup"

    --key-size, -s <bits>
    Sets key size in bits. The argument has to be a multiple of 8.
    The possible key-sizes are limited by the cipher and mode used.
    See /proc/crypto for more information.
    Note that key-size in /proc/crypto is stated in bytes.

I think it is over the top to verify the `key_size` value with
/proc/crypto  
and even a test that it is a multiple of 8 is probably not really
needed  
to check if the `key_size` value seems to be OK.

But I think at least something like

    is_positive_integer $key_size || Error "..."

should really be added to avoid bad surprises for the user.

This is all based on the assumption that with the code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160\_include\_luks\_code.sh

            case "$key" in
    ...
                key_size)
                    cryptsetup_options+=" --key-size $value"
                    ;;

a command like `cryptsetup ... --key-size --hash ...` with empty
key-size value  
would let disaster recovery with ReaR fail for the user during "rear
recover".

I get both 'Key' and 'Cipher key' in header with identical values no
matter what I pass to luksFormat. I wasn't able to find good description
of the fields so I've chosen the second one. It seems your command is
better choice.

Yes, I agree with you, adding checks for correctness of parameters is
really needed.

And this example is a good reason why
`cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup / luksHeaderRestore`  
has advantages (for the price of being possibly less secure depending on
the user's environment).

@jsmeix I was very happy to see the merge for LUKS2 support and
installed the git version of rear to give it a try yesterday.

Got sidetracked, but will set aside some time to give it a try :)

@mannp  
depending on what cryptsetup version you run you may need  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b49a4fc88eeb5a2f065c1109c9219d2fcf76e749](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b49a4fc88eeb5a2f065c1109c9219d2fcf76e749)  
which is in the GitHub master code of today.

So I would recommend to better update again to our current GitHub master
code.

Perhaps you even use a cryptsetup version where my

does not work and then we would like to know such issues better sooner
than later  
so that we could make LUKS2 support working with all usual cryptsetup
versions.

And on top of that via

I made nicer error message texts that contain the LUKS version (i.e.
'LUKS1' or 'LUKS2').  
Why not provide info to the user when it is there in ReaR.  
It can help him to better distinguish possibly various LUKS volumes that
he may have.

and test on a spare machine, so it will take me some time to get
together :)

I previously was using this on my main machines -&gt;

@jsmeix I've looked on recent updates and it looks good and works fine
on my test machines, thanks!

Have you considered omitting missing values instead of reporting error?
Because luksFormat doesn't require any of {cipher, key-size, hash} and
if omitted default value is used. Maybe it could omit missing option
value and print warning? I'm not saying that I think it would be better,
I guess that depends on situation and user preferences.

I was also thinking about 'Key:'/'Cipher key:" issue for second time. If
only 'Cipher key:' was present in luksDump, parsing would fail again. I
have no idea whether that can happen, to be honest. If that happens, we
can match both and use first found like
`grep -m1 -i "key:"  | sed -r 's/^.+:\s*(.+) bits$/\1/'`.

But overall, it looks good to me now and I'm looking forward to see
results on other setups and distributions.

I don't know about whatever third-party ReaR packages.  
You would have to ask the third-party what their package provides.

@vcrhonek  
thank you for your sugestions how to further improve the LUKS code in
ReaR!

Currently LUKS support (both LUKS1 and LUKS2) is under step by step
enhancement  
i.e. none of my changes is meant to be an ultimate final state.

I just proceed little step by little step where each little step should
keep things working  
i.e. I try to not introduce regressions that let things fail that had
somehow worked before.

Because at any time a more important issue (e.g. a severe security issue
with SUSE  
software that I maintain) could appear that gets in my way to move
forward with ReaR  
so that I can enhance ReaR only little setp by little step where I can
pause at any time.

E.g. as long as the LUKS recreation code in
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/  
and usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/ depends on cryptsetup option
values  
we must error out when the usr/share/rear/layout/save/ code fails to get
such values.

When the LUKS recreation code in layout/prepare/ was enhanced as a
precondition  
that it does no longer fail when certain optional cryptsetup option
values are missing  
then we could no longer error out when the layout/save/ code fails to
get such values.

Currently I have time to enhance the LUKS code so I will do some more
enhancements  
based on your suggestions (but again: only little step by little step).

Right now I see the documentation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
in the section about "Disk layout file syntax" the "LUKS Devices" part
is plain wrong  
(excerpts - long lines wrapped here):

    Square brackets "[" and "]" indicate an optional parameter.
    They can be excluded when hand-crafting a layout file line.
    ...
    LUKS Devices

    crypt /dev/mapper/<name> <device> [type=<type>]
     [cipher=<cipher>] [key_size=<key size>] [hash=<hash function>]
     [uuid=<uuid>] [keyfile=<keyfile>] [password=<password>]

Actually with the current LUKS recreation code in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160\_include\_luks\_code.sh  
only `keyfile=<keyfile>` and `password=<password>` are optional.

Fortunately nobody reads documenation so such errors are  
totally unimportant in real world practice out there ;-)

regarding your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2504\#issuecomment-720341023](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2504#issuecomment-720341023)  
therein (excerpt)

    luksFormat doesn't require any of {cipher, key-size, hash}
    and if omitted default value is used

Accordingly currently in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2506](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2506)  
the cryptsetup options `type=<type>` and `uuid=<uuid>`  
are still mandatory but I wonder if that is really needed.

How I did set up a LUKS2 volume on a test VM was using plain

    cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 --force-password /dev/sdb2

    cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb2 luks2test

    mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/luks2test

    mkdir /luks2test

    mount /dev/mapper/luks2test /luks2test

I need `--force-password` only because I use weak test passwords.

According to "man cryptsetup"

        luksFormat <device> [<key file>]

the `<device>` is the only mandatory parameter for
`cryptseup luksFormat`.

So I think we should handle all options optionally in `crypt` entries in
disklayout.conf  
except `/dev/mapper/<name>` and `<device>`  
because `<device>` is mandatory for `cryptsetup`  
and `/dev/mapper/<name>` is mandatory for `mkfs`.

@jsmeix Yes, I agree that `type` can be optional (still, we probably
want to pass it to `crypt` as we  
should be able to get it in layout/save and lately with `rear recover`
we want to recreate the same version of LUKS  
that actually was on the machine). But from the point of `crypt` and
`cryptsetup luksFormat` it is optional.

I'm not sure about `uuid` though. I didn't try to omit it. It's true
that it's not needed by `cryptestup luksFormat` itself,  
but I really don't know ReaR code enough to be sure that it's not needed
because of something else (for example, this particular  
uuid is referred somewhere else, in some config file or something...).
I'm sure you know better:)

I did try to edit disklayout.conf just before I ran `rear recover`
yesterday and replaced  
`crypt /dev/mapper/luks-d3...5b /dev/vda2 type=luks2 cipher=aes-xts-plain64 key_size=512 hash=sha256 uuid=d3..5b`  
with `crypt /dev/mapper/luks-d3...5b /dev/vda2 uuid=d3...5b` (using
original code in layout/prepare, without your latest changes applied).
The system recovered as expected.

I'll try to save some time tomorrow and look at your recent updates.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2506](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2506)  
I will change the code so that `type`and `uuid` are optional  
and try out how things behave for me without any of the optional
options.

My primary intent behind is not that "all will just work well"  
even without any of the optional options, in particular I think  
to recreate a system as if was before all those options should be there.

My primary intent is to not let "rear recover" needlessly fail  
if it could have somehow succeed to set up things with default/fallback
values.  
I think such a "graceful degradation" behaviour could help the user  
in case of an emergency disaster recovery more in real world practice.
