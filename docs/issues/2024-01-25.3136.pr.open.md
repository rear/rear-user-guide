-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   `touch /boot/grub2FAIL` full backup and recovery. Original code
        fails to recover: "Installing GRUB Legacy boot loader:  
        ERROR: Cannot install GRUB Legacy boot loader because there is
        no 'grub' program." New code works.
    -   `touch /boot/grub2FAIL && shopt -s nullglob && rear -d mkrescue && find /*/tmp/rear.*/rootfs /tmp/rear.*/rootfs -name grub\*-\* -executable`  
        original code: nothing  
        new code:

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:
    -   Do not detect GRUB before including GRUB tools. When there was a
        file matching `grub*` in `/boot` (e.g. `/boot/grub2FAIL`), the
        code got confused by the glob pattern intended to match
        `/boot/grub` or `/boot/grub2` and subsequently the rest of the
        script was skipped, as `grubdir` got assigned something like
        `"/boot/grub2 /boot/grub2FAIL"`, which does not exist, so
        `grubdir` was set to `/boot/grub`, which does not exist either,
        and `grub-probe` fails.  
        As a result, the GRUB tools were not included in the recovery
        image.  
        The code have been proceeding anyway when neither `grub-probe`
        nor grub2-probe was found, so the tests have not been very
        useful.  
        Fix and simplify by not checking for the existence of GRUB and
        just trying to include the GRUB tools always.
    -   Don't create `$VAR_DIR/recovery/bootdisk` in `prep`. This file
        is unused and creating it in prep stage is against the guideline
        in prep/README:

<!-- -->

    You should not put scripts into this 'prep' stage that modify things
    in ROOTFS_DIR or in VAR_DIR/recovery and VAR_DIR/layout because
    scripts for ROOTFS_DIR belong to the 'rescue' stage and scripts
    for VAR_DIR/recovery and VAR_DIR/layout belong to the 'layout' stages.
