Added support for a new variable MESSAGE\_PREFIX  
that is by default empty so that by default nothing changes  
but the user can set it e.g. to MESSAGE\_PREFIX="PID$$: "  
to get the messages of ReaR output functions  
prefixed with ${MESSAGE\_PREFIX}.

Added support for a new variable PROGRESS\_MODE that  
can be PROGRESS\_MODE="ANSI" (default/fallback behaviour)  
or PROGRESS\_MODE="plain" which outputs the same messages  
as in default 'ANSI' mode but without ANSI escape sequences.

Added support for a new variable PROGRESS\_WAIT\_SECONDS  
that specifies the number of seconds between progress messages  
that are aoutput while a longer task (usually backup or restore) runs.  
The default/fallback is 1 second to keep the current behaviour.

Setting at least MESSAGE\_PREFIX="PID$$: "  
and PROGRESS\_MODE="plain" is needed to get  
still usable (i.e. meaningful) output when multiple  
"rear mkbackuponly" or "rear restoreonly" run in parallel.

Optionally setting PROGRESS\_WAIT\_SECONDS="5"  
results much less progress messages but at the same time  
it delays continuing after the task (e.g. backup or restore)  
had finished by half that time on average up to at most  
the whole amount of PROGRESS\_WAIT\_SECONDS.
