-   In case ROOTFS\_DIR would, by an accident, was set empty or not to
    set at all, then system  
    level configuration files would be overwritten then.

Actually there are quite a lot more occurrences like this. I guess I
could look at it. Let me know if you are ok to change all of those or
not.

@jstourac In general this is a great idea to make ReaR more robust. Can
you please let us know why you started from this particular script? Is
there some context for this choice?

In \#700 we discussed making ReaR work under `set -eu` and came to the
conclusion that this is nearly impossible at the moment.

Instead of fixing this one script I can imagine to add a more generic
script somewhere else that will ensure that certain variables are set,
like an assertion:

    : ${ROOTFS_DIR:?must be set}

That way all scripts would be protected, not just this one.

Hi @schlomo,

reason I started with this one script is because I suspected that my
configuration of sshd on my RHEL6 testing machine was modified by
execution of {{/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue}},
used ReaR was in version of 1.17.2. Although, I was not able to
reproduce and neither I could not find out how that would be possible
after I briefly looked in the source code.

Anyway, I think that such check is useful to prevent potential
modifications of system files, that is why I proposed this MR to start a
discussion.

I see. What do you think about adding assertions somewhere higher up or
earlier in the script execution flow?

As nobody is complaining about this in the past I'm pro closing this PR
without further implementation.
