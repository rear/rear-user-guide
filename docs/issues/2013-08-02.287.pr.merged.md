====================================================================================================================

As backups can now be included inside the ISO image, it can be usefull
to split them onto several ISO images. (eg: burn to CD or DVD)  
I introduced the ISO\_MAX\_SIZE option (default unset, so feature
disabled) which will be the maximum size of the backup in any ISO
image.  
The first ISO image name isn't changed. Additional ISO images are called
with the same name but with a number as suffix.  
All ISO images are pushed to the OUPTUT\_URL as before.  
A file called backup.splitted is generated and is used to know if a
backup is splitted or not. This file also contains several informations
about generated images.

About restore, it's a bit more complex. I use a fifo pipe to be able to
restore backup from multiple DVD/ISO without interrupting the restore
process. About the wait for next DVDs, a loop is used to detect
automatically when a new DVD is inserted (by volid). When integrity
check is enabled, backup checksum are checked when each new DVD is
inserted as it isn't possible to do that at the beginning of the
recover.

As this feature introduced a lot of new code, it has been checked in a
lot of configuration and is, according to all my tests, regression free.
