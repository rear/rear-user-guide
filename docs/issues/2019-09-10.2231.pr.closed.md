##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2197

-   How was this pull request tested? Manual

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: cosmetic fix
    to prevent the error message
    "/sys/class/net/eth0/name\_assign\_type: Invalid argument" -
    however, the return code is 1 (with the fix, but also with the code
    untouched). Therefore, it is a cosmetic fix only.
