-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

v 2.7

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

Rocky Linux 9.2

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=cifs://192.1.1.12/rocky-dd  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/creds,vers=2.1"  
USE\_RAMDISK=0  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}"
'/home/timeshift' )

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR):

Dell T7910

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

x86

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

BIOS. GRUB.

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

Local HDD.

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT"):

RAID 5 (mdraid)

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Every time I reboot my server, it goes to the Rear recovery boot screen.
It never used to do this. In order for booting to proceed, I have to
select "boot next device". If I wanted the Rear recovery screen, I would
boot from a USB drive.

This just started happening recently. How do I make it go away and boot
directly?

-   Workaround, if any:

Select "boot next device."

The only reason I can currently imagine  
is that in the BIOS of your Dell T7910  
the device with the ReaR recovery system  
is the first one that can be booted.

So you would have to change the boot ordering  
in the BIOS of your Dell T7910 to make the harddisk  
the first boot device - or at least have the harddisk  
before the device where the ReaR recovery system is.

My blind guess is that the first boot device  
in the BIOS of your Dell T7910 is (perhaps by default)  
a CDROM drive or a USB disk or something similar  
i.e. a device where now the bootable ReaR recovery system is.

When before the CDROM drive or USB or similar  
did not contain something that can be booted,  
the BIOS skips it and proceeds with the next device  
according to the boot ordering in the BIOS  
until it reaches the harddisk  
wherefrom it boots the normal system.
