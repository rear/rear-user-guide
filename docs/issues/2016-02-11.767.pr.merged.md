fixed third time all remaining bash 3.x errors in
31\_network\_devices.sh  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/758](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/758)
plus heavy syntax cleanup that I needed to understand that code at least
to the extent that (hopefully) enables me to fix the bash 3.x errors
correctly - i.e. without breaking the functionality of the code.

I would very much appreciate it if someone with proper networking
knowledge can verify if the functionality of the code is still o.k.
