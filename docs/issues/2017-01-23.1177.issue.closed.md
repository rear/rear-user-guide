#### Network interface *em1* does not start properly in rescue-system (CentOS 7.1)

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)

I am trying to get rear to work with CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611
(Core) and Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2. It seems to have problems
establishing the network connection in the rescue-system, thus failing
to connect to the nfs-share where the backup is stored.

There seems to be a problem with the interface or the DHCP-client. When
starting the rescue-system I get an error message in the udev-script
that says „grep write error“, which does not concern the program much as
it executes the rest of the scripts.  
The DHCP-script then fails, telling me that a DHCP-client is already
running. Rear then continues to execute the rest of the start up
scripts, including number 60, which should -as I understand it-
configure the network interfaces.

When the rescue-system is booted I can see that there is no network
connection. However, I can establish it via:

    chmod a+x /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh
    /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

When I start the recovery process now, it runs as expected.

Why does it not establish a connection when the system boots, but when I
execute it manually?

I do not get a DHCP request from the server in question while it is
booting. Is there maybe a problem with the name of the interface (em1)?

I tried setting the interface address in
/etc/rear/mappings/ip\_address:  
`em1 dhcp`

or

`em1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

Both did not work. Please tell me what further information you need to
solve this problem.

Output of recovery when network connection ***not*** established
manually:

@DaveMcBrave Did you do a cloning? How does the original interfaces look
like (`ip a`), and what was found on the recover image after booting?
Are you using a mix of static and dhcp IPs perhaps? If that is the case
try adding `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y` to the `local.conf` file?

@DaveMcBrave  
as a workaround for a special case you may use  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
so that you can define in /etc/rear/local.conf whatever  
commands you need for networking setup in the  
ReaR recovery system, see  
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
how NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
is meant to work and for some examples how it works see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960\#issuecomment-239448861](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/960#issuecomment-239448861)

If you found a general/generic problem  
you may adapt and enhance the scrip  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
to add missing support for your particular use case.  
In this case please do also a GitHub pull request  
with your changes so that we can see what is needed  
to make it work for your particular use case, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
and see the section about  
"How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding "Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2":  
The current version is 2.0.  
Please try out if it works better with the current version.  
In particular any adaptions and enhancements must be  
based on the current Relax-and-Recover version.

How to test the currently newest rear GitHub master code  
independent of an already installed ReaR software:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and then  
configre and run it from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

(note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/").

Regarding debugging issues in the start up scripts  
that are run in the ReaR recovery system:

The basic idea behind is to not let those start up scripts  
run automatically and mostly silently but manually  
one after the other with 'set -x' bash debugging mode.

Add 'debug' to the ReaR kernel command line  
when booting the ReaR recovery/rescue system.

In the ReaR recovery/rescue system boot menue select  
the topmost enty of the form "Recover HOSTNAME"  
and press the \[Tab\] key to edit the boot command line  
and append the word ' debug' at its end and boot that.

You may found yourself stopped at a blank screen.  
In this case press \[Enter\] which runs the very first of the  
start up scripts (/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00functions.sh).  
There is some bug that the initial message is not always  
printed so you may need to type the very first \[Enter\] blindly.

The further start up scripts are run one by one  
each one after pressing \[Enter\].

In 'debug' mode the start up scripts are run with 'set -x'  
so that this way you can better see what actually goes on  
in each of the start up scripts.

@gdha  
Thanks for the quick reply! Adding `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y` to
`local.conf` did help. The automatic recovery did work fine. I am using
just one network interface and it is configured via DHCP. The only other
interface configured is infiniband. You think this can cause problems?  
Before and after recovery are the same:

@jsmeix  
I have another identical server with the newest version of rear cloned
from git

    # rear --version
    Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git

where I encounter the same problem. I will check in later when I tried
your suggestions.

From doc/rear-release-notes.txt (excerpts)

<pre>
Release Notes for Relax-and-Recover version 2.00
...
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y, will cause
statically configured network settings to be applied
even when USE_DHCLIENT is in effect
...
Version 1.19.0 (October 2016)
...
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING now really
overrides USE_DHCLIENT (issue #964)
...
Version 1.17.0 (March 2015)
...
Add a new config option USE_STATIC_NETWORKING
(issue #488)
</pre>

From default.conf

<pre>
# Most variables can be set to an empty value VAR=
# which means that this setting is off
# or set to some automatic mode.
...
# Say "y", "Yes" (or any not empty string)
# to enable the DHCP client protocol
# which lets the rescue/recovery system
# run dhclient to get an IP address
# instead of using the same IP address as the original system:
USE_DHCLIENT=

# Say "y", "Yes" (or any not empty string)
# to enable static networking (overrules USE_DHCLIENT):
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=
</pre>

With the empty defaults of USE\_DHCLIENT  
and USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING you get  
"some automatic mode" which does not restult  
the right behaviour in your particular case  
so that you must explicitly specify appropriate values.

But before ReaR 2.0 it did not work fully  
correct when you specified explicitly e.g.  
USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=y

Since ReaR 2.0 with USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=y  
you should not get anything regarding the DHCP client protocol.

And when even USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=y  
(or USE\_DHCLIENT=y ) does not result what  
you need in the ReaR recovery system, you can  
enforce exactly only your intended networking setup via  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS

@jsmeix

-   Using Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
-   My `local.conf` looked like this:

<!-- -->

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/srv-it/admin/rear“

I started the rescue system with ‚debug' mode activated. Somehow script
58 (dhcp) chose interface em3 as a suitable interface to try dhcp with.
I can confirm this as I can see the correlating log entries in the
booted rescue/recover system:

There is no cable plugged…

While executing the other scripts I can see no errors. Maybe I am
interpreting the output wrongly? In the running rescue system I execute
`ifup em1`just to see what happens: nothing

    Jan 24 13:20:30 beegfs-sf-07 ifup: not implemented (em1)

When I execute script 60 manually I get a connection:

When I set `USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=y`, I get what I want. There is no
output mentioning DHCP and the rescue system is able to pull the backup
from the nfs share.

Adding  
`NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 134.107.217.17/23 dev em1' 'ip link set dev em1 up' 'ip route add default via 134.107.217.254' 'return' )`  
to the `local.conf` does also enable networking properly.

Thank yo very much for your advice, but I am still curious, why it
chooses em3...

@DaveMcBrave  
I am not at all a sufficient networking expert  
to be able to imagine why recovery system network setup  
does not automatically work as you need it in your case.  
In your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1177\#issuecomment-274788881](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1177#issuecomment-274788881)  
I see that your network setup looks "not really simple"  
so that I assume you must - at least for now - manually  
tell ReaR your intended recovery system network setup.

Thanks, to both of you. You really helped me and I consider my Problem
solved, as I can recover my servers automatically now.

Thank you for the feedback and  
have a nice (and relaxed ;-) weekend.
