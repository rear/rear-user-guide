-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 2.3 and higher
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL, SLES
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): BACKUP=BAREOS
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue: When using PXE to recover unattended
    with BAREOS we get a prompt after a successful restore if we want to
    continue or inspect with shell? That is not the desired state we
    expected.
-   Work-around, if any:  
    Problem is found in script
    `/usr/share/rear/restore/BAREOS/default/400_restore_backup.sh:if [ "$ISO_DEFAULT" != "automatic" ]`
    where the variable ISO\_DEFAULT is not the correct one. It should
    have been ISO\_RECOCER\_MODE and PXE\_RECOVER\_MODE

@gdha  
which exact "prompt after a successful restore if we want to continue or
inspect with shell"  
do you get?

Is it the `rear_shell "Did the backup successfully restore ..."` in  
usr/share/rear/restore/BAREOS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
or is it perhaps the new UserInput RESTORED\_FILES\_CONFIRMATION  
in the new usr/share/rear/finalize/default/020\_confirm\_finalize.sh  
from my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758)

In the latter case the actual reason is that you are in
MIGRATION\_MODE  
and then the UserInput RESTORED\_FILES\_CONFIRMATION  
is intentionally there.

In the former case that too simple
`rear_shell "Did the backup successfully restore..."`  
should be replaced by a UserInput() call so that the user can
predefine  
a user input value in this case (i.e. so that there is no longer a
hardcoded  
disruptive break into the rear\_shell).

@jsmeix I reran the test and saw MIGRATION\_MODE being turned off
because I was using *unattended* mode. Therefore, I think what I thought
above is correct. Will make a PR and we can retest it once available.

Yes, in `unattended` mode MIGRATION\_MODE is usually turned off via  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/270\_overrule\_migration\_mode.sh  
see the comments in that script when MIGRATION\_MODE is not turned off  
even when in `unattended` mode.

@jsmeix It was switched off -

To Keep Separated Issues Separated (KSIS )  
I could after
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1763](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1763)
was merged  
enhance the `rear_shell "Did the backup successfully restore..."`  
by a UserInput() call.

After having a bit closer look at the code in  
usr/share/rear/restore/BAREOS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
I (as a non-bareos user) will not touch that code  
because that code is too obsuce for me.

I think with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1763](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1763)
merged  
this issue can be closed as fixed.
