Force Loading multipath modules when `BOOT_OVER_SAN` is True. (\#1295
re-open)

Before this changes, multipath module was loaded only if multipath
devices were present in `LAYOUT_FILE`.  
So, if you migrate from virtual machine (non-multipath) to
`BOOT_OVER_SAN` system (usually multipathed), multipath is not loaded
during recover/migration.

I propose to automatically the load of multipath modules during recovery
when `BOOT_OVER_SAN` is True.

I also add /lib\*/multipath which where missing when creating rescue
image with `BOOT_OVER_SAN=y`

@gdha regarding:

    if ! is_true "$BOOT_OVER_SAN" ; then 
      return 
    fi

I want the script exit when `BOOT_OVER_SAN` is `false` or `not set`,
that's why using `is_false` is not enough.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1309\#issuecomment-294474190](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1309#issuecomment-294474190)  
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212\#issuecomment-283698753](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1212#issuecomment-283698753)  
and see the comments for the is\_true and is\_false functions in  
lib/global-functions.sh

I.e.

<pre>
is_true "$BOOT_OVER_SAN" || return
</pre>

returns  
if BOOT\_OVER\_SAN is explicitly a 'false' value  
and also when BOOT\_OVER\_SAN is empty  
or unset or has another vale like 'foo'  
while in contrast

<pre>
is_false $BOOT_OVER_SAN && return
</pre>

returns  
only if BOOT\_OVER\_SAN is explicitly a 'false' value  
but not when BOOT\_OVER\_SAN is empty  
or unset or has another value like 'foo'.

Ok, I like this one :

    is_true "$BOOT_OVER_SAN" || return

I'm gonna send an update for review

@jsmeix just guessing here: If the backup would restore a
`/etc/multipath.conf` then `mkrescue` should have picked it up already,
so that we wouldn't need to create it.

@gozora Just for your info - perhaps you want to add something useful as
well (as experienced administrator)?

You are absolutely right.

-   This is what would happen when you restore the backup on the same
    machine.
-   But imagine you have to migrate from a machine (not multipathed,
    like a VM) to a real baremetal server or PowerVM with Boot\_on\_San
    (multipathed) ... You will have to enable the multipath and create a
    default `multipath.conf` (for rhel) to detect the NEW disk in
    multipath before partitioning recreation.

@schabrolles Yes, I also didn't see right away that we talk about the
"migrate to SAN boot" use case here. Of course you are right, maybe
worth to hint with comments to the background context.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1309\#issuecomment-295309240](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1309#issuecomment-295309240)  
also @schlomo approves it so that I will merge it  
soon if there are no objections...
