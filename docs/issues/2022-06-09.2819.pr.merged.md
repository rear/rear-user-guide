Tomorrow I will try to somehow generate a  
doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
from what I have in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/14](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/14)

Currently  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
tells

    Convert the release notes from the ReaR web pages into a simple text file:

    export LC_ALL=POSIX
    export LANG=POSIX
    w3m -dump -cols 78 http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-xx | iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT | sed -e 's/^      ? /      - /' > doc/rear-release-notes.txt

but this requires to have the ReaR 2.7 release notes  
published on
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/)  
before ReaR 2.7 was actually released which I like to avoid.

I will revert my here added changes of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2816](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2816)  
when that pull request is merged.

I added them mainly because I was confused  
about the failing automated build test  
so I thought I just try to add the changes of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2816](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2816)  
to see how things behave then here.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/c09ee23e5dc715257374853c31631b7c587d0b8c](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/c09ee23e5dc715257374853c31631b7c587d0b8c)  
I created doc/rear-release-notes.txt from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/39e1b83c53a949a357419909295f5c86f2ecb03a/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/39e1b83c53a949a357419909295f5c86f2ecb03a/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md)  
via

    cat release-notes-2-7.md | pandoc -t plain --columns=78 | iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT >rear-release-notes.txt

plus then manual correction of some very long lines  
(i.e. I had to manually wrap some too long lines via `vi`).

I checked for '?' characters that `iconv ... -t ASCII//TRANSLIT`  
may result when characters cannot be transliterated

    # grep '?' doc/rear-release-notes.txt

        shouldn't it [ReaR] restore the [RAID] arrays with the same UUIDs ...?" in
        unix exists but no module file?". Furthermore ensure that kernel modules
        -   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1239009 (f22)
        -   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238843 (rhel 7.2)
    best choice? We have done some tests and published the results. See

In all those lines the '?' characters are correct  
(same text appears in the release-notes-2-7.md input)  
so no characters were not transliterated by  
`iconv ... -t ASCII//TRANSLIT`

I checked that the output is pure ASCII:

    # file doc/rear-release-notes.txt

    doc/rear-release-notes.txt: ASCII text

(for UTF-8 `file` reports "UTF-8 Unicode text").

I added missing http... link URLs  
in doc/rear-release-notes.txt

The above `pandoc -t plain` converts markdown

    [Link text](http...)

to plain text

    Link text

but ignores the link URL `http...`  
so I added the missing link URLs manually  
for what I found in the markdown via

    # grep '](' release-notes-2-7.md

By the way:  
Those link URLs are also missing in our current  
ReaR 2.6 release notes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/60e6d27a32c8b8c8ab5b5af571e097f5c6a198af](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/60e6d27a32c8b8c8ab5b5af571e097f5c6a198af)  
I added Renaud Metrich and pcahyna to the AUTHORS section in
doc/rear.8.adoc  
and replaced some 'please' therein with better wording and made it plain
ASCII  
and then regenerated doc/rear.8 via 'asciidoctor -b manpage
rear.8.adoc'  
so now also rear.8 is plain ASCII.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
reads

    * Convert the release notes from the ReaR web pages
      into a simple text file
      ...

    * Add the list of contributors which did something
      for this new release via
      (in this example the previous release was 2.6):

      git log --format="%aN" $(git merge-base master 2.6)..master | sort -u | sed -e 's/,/, /g'

    * review doc/rear-release-notes.txt for broken lines
      (visual check)

so I guess "Add the list of contributors" means  
to add them to the release notes  
but our current ReaR 2.6 release notes  
do not contain a list of contributors  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
and I don't like to add such a list now there.

So I only updated the AUTHORS section in doc/rear.8.adoc  
and regenerated doc/rear.8

Next week I would like to

    Announce freeze period and ask for community testing

[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

@pcahyna  
such a "freeze period" does not mean  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2781)  
cannot be fixed. Of course we can still do  
all what is required to release ReaR 2.7.

Mainly for my own information regarding

    Announce freeze period and ask for community testing
    on rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org

For ReaR 2.6 and 2.5 I don't find such mails on  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/)

For ReaR 2.4 I only found the "New release ReaR v2.4 announcement"

For ReaR 2.3 I found both the "Pre-ReaR version 2.3 freeze period"

Regarding

    Announce freeze period and ask for community testing
    on rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org

Yesterday I sent the mail below  
but nothing appeared in my mail folder  
and also nothing appeared on  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/)

My sent mail is basically inexplicably lost in nowhere.  
I got no failure notice from a mail server or something like that.

Because we did not send such a mail for ReaR 2.6 and 2.5  
I won't worry if we omit that also for ReaR 2.7.

    Announcement: ReaR version 2.7 release approaching

    To [rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org](mailto:rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org) on 2022-06-21 10:58

    Dear ReaR users and contributors,

    the next ReaR version 2.7 release is approaching.

    The last ReaR 2.6 release was two years ago
    so there are many changes for the new ReaR 2.7.

    See our current ReaR 2.7 release notes at

    https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/jsmeix-release-notes-2-7/documentation/release-notes-2-7.md

    in particular for new features, bigger enhancements,
    and possibly backward incompatible changes.

    The planned ReaR 2.7 release date is end June 2022.

    Until then we will not do bigger code changes
    (except needed fixes for serious issues)
    to keep our ReaR upstream master code stable
    so we can do some basic general testing
    before we release it.

    Because we can only test generic things
    we would appreciate it if you could test
    our current ReaR upstream master code
    in particular if it still works as well
    as the ReaR version that you currently use
    in your specific enviroment.

    Testing ReaR upstream GitHub master code:

    It is possible to have several ReaR versions in parallel
    each one in its own separated directory without conflicts
    between each other and without conflicts with a normally
    installed ReaR version (e.g. via an RPM package).

    Accordingly you can test our ReaR upstream master code
    from within a separated directory to find out if things
    work better or worse with ReaR upstream master code
    compared to the ReaR version that you currently use.

    Basically "git clone" the ReaR upstream master code
    into a separated directory and then configure
    and run ReaR from within that directory like:
    --------------------------------------------------------
    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear.github.master

    # cd rear.github.master

    # vi etc/rear/local.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
    --------------------------------------------------------
    Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

    Please report issues via the [New issue] button on
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues

    Please also provide feedback (e.g. as reply to this mail)
    when you tested our ReaR upstream master code
    and it works without issues for you.


    Many thanks in advance for your testing and
    best regards from the ReaR upstream team!


    Johannes Meixner

    ReaR 2.7 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

    -   Fedora 29, 30, 31, and 32
    -   RHEL 6, 7, and 8
    -   CentOS 6, 7, and 8
    -   Scientific Linux 6 and 7

I can add RHEL 9 to the line about RHEL  
but I don't know about the other Fedora based distributions.

According to  
[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/timeline/lkql2928ems84f0xg1ep1ld9utkp83m.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/timeline/lkql2928ems84f0xg1ep1ld9utkp83m.png)  
RHEL 9 is based on Fedora 34  
so ReaR 2.7 should support Fedora 34  
but what about later Fedora versions?

According to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS)  
there is no CentOS 9  
so there is nothing to change for the CentOS line.

According to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific\_Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Linux)  
there is no Scientific Linux 8 or 9  
so there is nothing to change for the Scientific Linux line.

With my last  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/93155eb60131b3fa8a42d8ae0957f14b6c89b170](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/93155eb60131b3fa8a42d8ae0957f14b6c89b170)  
I have now this text (excerpt):

    ReaR 2.7 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

    -   Fedora 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34
    -   RHEL 6, 7, 8, and 9
    -   CentOS 6, 7, and 8
    -   Scientific Linux 6 and 7

@gdha @pcahyna
