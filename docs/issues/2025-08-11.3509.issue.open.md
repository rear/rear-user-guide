### Platform

*No response*

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

To make the build process less dependent on asciidoc, xmlto we want to
switch from asciidoc format to markdown format for he man-page.  
Perhaps, we will also switch the user guide to Markdown later.

### Describe the solution you'd like

It is possible to perform the switch as we did it already for the
`upgrade-ux` project (both man-page and user guide).

### Describe alternatives you've considered

we can always stick to asciidoc if the result is not good enough.

### Additional context
