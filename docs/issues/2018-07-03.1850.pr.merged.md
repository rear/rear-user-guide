@schlomo @gdha  
I assigned this pull request to you because I cannot merge it  
because currently it shows

If I understand the documentation correctly the button is greyed out
because the commits are not signed (do we have another example of a PR
where the commits are actually signed?).

In this case the correct way would be for one of us to merge the PR on a
client and use that way to sign that commit.

I guess we have to decide between the convenience of merging unsigned
commits in the GitHub GUI and having signed commits in our source code.
Classical security vs. convenience decision :-(

I'd be willing to contribute signed commits in the future. I hope the
[hurdles](https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-commit-signing/)
won't deter others. The node.js folks already had a detailed discussion
on the issue:
[https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/15457](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/15457)

I wonder how this could happen apparently without any maintainer of this
repo actively enabling it...

@OliverO2  
for ReaR this did not happen magically, see

Just as a heads up regarding this PR and \#1846  
Tested by @OliverO2 and myself on CentOS 6,  
by myself on old unsupported debian, and on recent openSUSE. This chunk
of code seems to make the process more robust on a variety of distros.

@GreenBlood Excellent! Thanks for reporting. Did you verify that the
generated rescue system actually works on CentOS 6 and the others? (I
have just tested that it boots.)

@jsmeix I see. Thanks for explaining.

@OliverO2 Affirmative, I started the debian 7, centos6 and openSUSE
rescue system successfully and was able to restore datas onto their
disks.

@GreenBlood  
and after "rear recover" finished  
did the recreated systems even boot on their own  
and perhaps even actually work again?  
;-)

More seriously:  
I wonder if there is a generic way how to find out with reasonable
effort  
if there are noteworthy differences between the original system  
and the recreated system.  
I mean during testing when the original system is still available for
comparison  
(not after an actual disaster when the original system was destroyed).

@jsmeix Haha, yeah of course the systems boots and from what I see it
works as expected :-) The only thing RAWDISK rescue would need at this
stage is auto mapping the disks, because in ISO mode source `sda` is
destination `sda`, as with RAWDISK, `sda` is the rescue system and `sdb`
the first destination disk. But it's another problem

My guess on checking restoration would be to compare package list, or
maybe launched services/open tcp ports. This list could even be included
in the saved data, as a mean to validate, at the end of recovery, that
the system looks like the original one.

@GreenBlood Perfect! :-)

@jsmeix In my view it's mostly the backup tool's responsibility to
ensure accurate restoration. ReaR does the necessary setup that such
restore can actually take place and is responsible for accurately
re-creating the drive and partition setup. So the generic test for ReaR
would be to  
a) verify that restoring a backup actually works, and  
b) comparing the drive and partition configuration.

a) is trivial: If restore works, the test ist successful. For b) I could
envision some script, written independently, not relying on any ReaR
code, generating its own text files describing the configurations (i.e.
not using `disklayout.conf`), which could then be compared. Writing such
a script is probably not trivial given all the possible variants.

@GreenBlood  
regarding your

<pre>
RAWDISK rescue would need at this stage is auto mapping the disks,
as in ISO mode source sda is destination sda,
as with RAWDISK, sda is the rescue system and sdb the first destination disk
</pre>

That sda is the rescue system and sdb the first destination disk  
is the same as the known issue when using USB e.g. like

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
USB_SUFFIX="mybackup"
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)  
and the section about `MIGRATION_MODE` in
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

I would expect that the therein mentioned

<pre>
# There is some basic autodetection during "rear recover" when
# disks on the replacement hardware seem to not match compared to
# what there was stored in disklayout.conf on the original system.
</pre>

also happens during "rear recover" in case of RAWDISK.

That basic autodetection is implemented in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh  
and when MIGRATION\_MODE is set the mappings are done in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh

@OliverO2  
I wonder if
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh  
is perhaps not run in case of RAWDISK or if it is run  
but fails to autodetect an "Ambiguous disk layout" in case of RAWDISK?

@jsmeix I don't see any reason why the system should behave differently
just because of RAWDISK.

Whether the boot device appears as `sda` or something else depends on
<s>how the BIOS reports disk devices</s> **the device's controller type
(SATA, SCSI, IDE, ...) and (in case of multiple controllers of the same
type) the order of initialization (which may change between boots)**.

If you just `dd` the RAWDISK image onto a USB stick, disk naming and
ReaR behavior should be exactly the same as if you created the recovery
image directly via `OUTPUT=USB`. (I always create USB rescue media with
RAWDISK to avoid the formatting step.)

**Edit:** Corrected section on device naming.

@OliverO2  
I also don't *see* a reason why "rear recover"  
should behave differently because of RAWDISK.  
When I have in etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
OUTPUT=RAWDISK
OUTPUT_URL="file://$VAR_DIR/output"
</pre>

and run `usr/sbin/rear -s recover` I get (excerpts)

<pre>
Source layout/prepare/default/250_compare_disks.sh
...
Source layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh
</pre>

which shows that those scripts are executed (sourced) but  
I don't know how the code in those scripts actually behaves  
in case of RAWDISK - this is the reason why I asked.  
E.g. when MIGRATION\_MODE is not set in 250\_compare\_disks.sh  
then 300\_map\_disks.sh is run but it does actually nothing.

@GreenBlood  
can you provide what you get on the terminal plus the debug log  
when you run "rear -D recover" with RAWDISK on one of your systems  
where sda is the first system disk on the original system but during  
"rear recover" sda is the rescue system and sdb is the first destination
disk  
so that I could understand why the "Ambiguous disk layout"
autodetection  
does not work in your particular case.  
Please do it as a new separated GitHub issue.

@jsmeix Being just another output method, the RAWDISK stuff is pretty
much isolated from everything else:

-   Code files:
    -   `usr/share/rear/conf/templates/RESULT_usage_RAWDISK.txt`
    -   `usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/*`
-   Code changes:
    -   `RAWDISK_`-prefixed variables in
        `usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`

That's it. (There is, of course, the `OPALPBA` stuff which makes use of
`RAWDISK` but it's a separate workflow, which is not active here).
