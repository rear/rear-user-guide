For current Git sources "make validate"  
with GNU bash, version 3.1.17 results:

As far as I know it is still intended that rear works with bash 3.x.  
If this is still true, the issue is a bug.

@jsmeix good catch - will you correct it?

I think I could correct it but not before FOSDEM.  
I really must prepare for FOSDEM because  
"You never get a second chance to make a good first impression".  
;-)

If it needs to be fixed before FOSDEM,  
perhaps @pavoldomin and/or @corin33  
could do it?

Hmpf!

It seems bash up to version 3.1 it works when quoting  
of the extended regular expression like

<pre>
# bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release
# UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/path/elilo.efi
# [[ $(basename ${UEFI_BOOTLOADER}) =~ "(shim.efi|elilo.efi)" ]] && echo Y || echo N
Y
</pre>

while in bash 3.2 one must not use quoting:

<pre>
# bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.51(1)-release
# UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/path/elilo.efi
# [[ $(basename ${UEFI_BOOTLOADER}) =~ "(shim.efi|elilo.efi)" ]] && echo Y || echo N
N
</pre>

I cannot fix the bash 3.x error in  
rescue/GNU/Linux/31\_network\_devices.sh  
because I do not sufficiently understand the meaning of the code.

Therefore I suggest @corin33 fixes his code in 31\_network\_devices.sh

My
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/765](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/765)
hopefully fixes  
the second bash 3.x issue (the one in 31\_network\_devices.sh).

Again:  
I may not really properly have fixed the bash 3.x error in  
rescue/GNU/Linux/31\_network\_devices.sh  
because I do not sufficiently understand the meaning of the code.  
Therefore I suggest again that @corin33 at least has a look  
at that code in 31\_network\_devices.sh

After the two above are fixed, a third one appeared  
(one more in 31\_network\_devices.sh):

<pre>
# bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release
# for f in $( find /usr/share/rear -name '*.sh' ) ; do bash -n $f ; done
/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31_network_devices.sh: line 162: unexpected argument `(' to conditional binary operator

/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31_network_devices.sh: line 162: `     [[ $VLANS_SET_UP =~ (^|[[:space:]])$IFACE($|[[:space:]]) ]] && return'
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/767](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/767)
all \*.sh files in usr/share/rear pass the "bash -n" test with bash 3.x
on SLE10:

<pre>
# bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release
# for f in $( find /usr/share/rear -name '*.sh' ) ; do bash -n $f || echo $f failed ; done
[no output]
# bash -n /usr/sbin/rear || echo failed
[no output]
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/767](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/767)
this issue should be fixed.

An addenum FYI:

I only liked to "just fix some" bash 3.x compliance issues  
and what is the final result:

I became the one who is topmost to be blamed when something does not
work in rescue/GNU/Linux/31\_network\_devices.sh regardless that I am
not at all a networking expert:

<pre>
$ git blame -wM usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/31_network_devices.sh | cut -d ' ' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
    187 (Johannes
     61 (Schlomo
     28 (corin
     22 (Jeroen
     19 (Dag
      5 (jezzaaa
      5 (Gratien
      1 (Peter
</pre>

For comparison how it had been before:

<pre>
    130 (corin
    105 (Schlomo
     22 (Dag
     21 (Jeroen
     18 (Gratien

      1 (Peter
