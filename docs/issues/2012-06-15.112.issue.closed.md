When trying to build a RPM on working directory of rear I get

    + cp -pr AUTHORS COPYING README 'doc/*.html' doc/layoutman.txt doc/rear-documentation.txt doc/rear-presentation.txt doc/rear-release-notes.txt doc/rear.8.txt doc/relax-recover-concept.txt /root/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/rear-1.13.0-1.git201206151738.fc17.i386/usr/share/doc/rear-1.13.0
    cp: cannot stat `doc/*.html': No such file or directory
    error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.hN5vqb (%doc)

It tries to copy html files, which aren't there, so it fails. We should
enhance our `Makefile` with the following:

    # diff Makefile Makefile.save
    117c117
    < rpm: dist-git doc

    ---
    > rpm: dist-git

Sorry to be a drag, but then I get an error:

    asciidoc rear-documentation.txt
    ERROR: rear-documentation.txt: line 9: malformed author: Dag Wieers and Jeroen Hoekx
    make[1]: *** [rear-documentation.html] Error 1

I don't really want the html documentation in the rpm. Just the manpage
and the documentation as txt seems enough to me.

Yes, Jeroen disabled the html generation again, while I wanted to have
the html files inside of the tar (and rpm).

This works fine for me and has been since 18 months at least:

    [dag@moria doc]$ asciidoc rear-documentation.txt
    [dag@moria doc]$ asciidoc --version
    asciidoc 8.6.7

Although 18 months ago it was 8.5 IIRC.

Personally I would prefer if we generate the html files and man page
as  
part of `make dist` so that distributions do not need the asciidoc  
toolchain for the packaging.

First item should be fixed (by removing the doc/\*.html reference in the
SPEC file)

make rpm works fine (without html file creation). For the asciidoc stuff
I'll open a new issue.
