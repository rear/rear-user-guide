Installing rear RPM from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE\_Leap\_15.3/x86\_64/rear-2.7-1.x86\_64.rpm](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/x86_64/rear-2.7-1.x86_64.rpm)  
on openSUSE Leap 15.4 (don't we have a Leap 15.4 repo?)  
leads to a broken installation because `pidof` is missing:

    localhost:~ # cat /etc/os-release

Installing the `sysvinit-tools` seems to fix this problem.

@jsmeix can we just add that dependency  
or will this create a problem on other distros?

It is not a 'bug' in a program when the program aborts  
with a meaningful error message when it cannot continue  
because then the issue is properly handled in the program  
(which does not mean the software cannot be 'enhanced' to  
deal better with the underlying root cause - if possible).

In this case it is handled in  
init/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892)

Because noone else reported this issue up to now,  
it seems 'pidof' is normally installed on Linux distributions.

In general we do not have explicit RPM dependencies  
for every program that is usually called in ReaR.  
We have only few RPM dependencies in rear.spec  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)  
In general we assume that "standard programs" are there.

On my openSUSE Leap 15.4 homeoffice system (with Gnome desktop)  
'sysvinit-tools' is a required RPM package

    # rpm -e --test sysvinit-tools
    error: Failed dependencies:
            sysvinit-tools is needed by (installed) insserv-compat-0.1-4.6.1.noarch
            sysvinit-tools is needed by (installed) openvpn-2.5.6-150400.3.3.1.x86_64
            /sbin/pidof is needed by (installed) xdm-1.1.11-150400.23.6.x86_64

so it seems your openSUSE Leap 15.4 installation  
is a very minimal (perhaps even a too minimal) installation?

For my tests on VMs I use small systems without desktop  
and I never had the issue that 'pidof' was missing.

But what I always do is to let the "recommended" packages  
be installed - i.e. what is specified in a spec file as

    Recommends: RPM_capability

because that avoids to get a system where things are missing  
that are "usually just there", e.g. on my Leap 15.4 system

    # rpm -e --test vim
    [no output]

'vi' is not required but nevertheless it is "just there".

In general:  
All explicit RPM dependencies are always a problem because  
every explicit RPM dependency requires manual maintenance  
which is likely different for different Linux distributions.  
Explicit RPM requirements cause trouble in particular because  
when one cannot be fulfilled the package cannot be installed and  
when one is missing the software in the package doesn't work and  
when one is not a real hard requirement some users complain  
that they cannot use the software in a minimal system and so on...

Offhandedly I don't know to generically specify in RPM  
that a program called 'pidof' is required.  
I guess

    Requires: pidof

won't work because (on my Leap 15.4 system)

    # rpm -q --whatprovides pidof
    no package provides pidof

    # rpm -q --whatprovides bin/pidof
    no package provides bin/pidof

    # rpm -q --whatprovides /bin/pidof
    sysvinit-tools-2.99-1.1.x86_64

so it seems I have to specify the program with full path  
but what /path/pidof is generic for all RPM based distributions?

    # type -a pidof
    pidof is /sbin/pidof
    pidof is /bin/pidof

    # file /sbin/pidof /bin/pidof
    /sbin/pidof: symbolic link to killall5
    /bin/pidof:  symbolic link to /sbin/killall5

As time permits I will try to find out  
if it is possible to generically specify in RPM  
that a program called 'sometool' is required.  
When this is possible (also for older RPM based distributions)  
we can add all REQUIRED\_PROGS as such generic RPM 'Requires'  
and all in PROGS as such generic RPM 'Recommends'.

The repository naming in OBS looks inconsistent.  
Perhaps there is some technical reason behind  
but this is in areas that I don't understand.

About the distro RPM repos, maybe all we need to do is update the list
at
[https://relax-and-recover.org/download/](https://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

I was using a Leap 15.4 "Minimal Server" installation to reduce the size
of the ReaR backup during testing. I'd suggest to always use the distro
minimal software selection for validation as that will help us to ensure
that ReaR will work on all "normal" installs, meaning installations that
use the distro installer with its default settings.

The reason I wanted to talk about this package - and I think this issue
should really only be about `pidof` and not about everything, is that it
seems like different RPM distros use different package names:

[https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=sysvinit-tools](https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=sysvinit-tools)
is for SUSE and CentOS 7 only  
[https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=procps-ng](https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=procps-ng)
is for CentOS 8+, Fedora and others

Given that, can we now add it to our `rear.spec` and the respective
distro specific spec files? Given the fact that ReaR won't work without
`pidof` I'd think that this could be reason enough to make it a hard RPM
dependency.

I fully agree with you that we shouldn't have RPM/DEB dependencies on
optional ReaR functionality.

Regarding RPM requirements:

Let me find out if it is possible to generically specify in RPM  
that a program called 'sometool' is required.

I don't want to manually maintain individual RPM requirements  
for RPM package names or specific RPM capabilities that  
are likely different for different Linux distributions  
simply because I don't get paid for that (no SUSE customer  
ever reported an issue about that to me - I guess they help  
themselves when they use minimal systems - or perhaps  
SUSE support helps them and I won't notice that).

In the future RPM and such will go away anyway and  
we all will be happy in total containerized isolation ;-)

I had a bit more thought about this:

In the end, I'd like us to get to the point where a "zypper install
URL-TO-REAR-RPM" would lead to a ReaR installation that works. That
means that whatever programs are required for ReaR to run with the
included **default** configuration must be covered by the RPM
dependencies.

Same for the YUM and DEB ecosystems, of course.

And for that minimum requirements I don't want to rely on package
manager recommendations as we talk about the minimum required programs
for ReaR to run without an error. The motivation for investing our
efforts into this would be to give users a successful out-of-the-box
experience, where they install ReaR and try it out and then it must work
and not fail on a missing program.

But indeed this is only about the bare minimum for the default config
and I agree with you that users need to add required programs themselves
to cover their configuration changes, e.g. adding Rsync if they want to
do a backup via Rsync.

ReaR never gave users a successful out-of-the-box experience.  
My first trial with ReaR was a complete abysmal disaster.  
I never had a worse first impression with a program.  
Meanwhile ReaR works somewhat "sufficiently OK"  
for experienced users (in particular system admins)  
who know what they do and what "disaster recovery" means.  
A successful out-of-the-box user experience is far away,  
cf.

Feel free to implement that - I do fully appreciate it.  
But I won't help because I don't get paid for that.

OK, fair enough. Is `packaging/rpm/rear.spec` still used to generate the
SUSE RPMs? Or do we have a different spec file in OBS? I don't mind
adding that dependency.
