I see in the log file snapshots are included in the backup, those are on
an NFS mount. Why wouldn't that be excluded?

I don't see this error message in the log rear-uq00264q.log . Is the log
complete?

is `/usr/infra/.snapshot` itself on the local disk? If so, I suppose
only the mount points are included in the backup, not the actual file
systems mounted at them (i.e they should show up as empty directories).

The error message "Failed to create recovery/rescue system ..."  
is in pack/GNU/Linux/900\_create\_initramfs.sh  
there at this code place (excerpts)

    case "$REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION" in
        ...
        (*)
            ...
                REAR_INITRD_FILENAME="initrd.cgz"
            ...
            if find . ! -name "*~" | cpio -H newc --create --quiet | gzip > "$TMP_DIR/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME" ; then
                ...
            else

                Error "Failed to create recovery/rescue system $REAR_INITRD_FILENAME"
            fi

so the `gzip: stdout: No space left on device`  
appears for "$TMP\_DIR/$REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME"  
so it seems $TMP\_DIR runs out of space here.

@exfarmer  
see the info about TMP\_DIR in your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

For the ReaR release 2.6 it is online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L44)

For our current GitHub master code it is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L44](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L44)

The size issue with /tmp is fixed.  
Now the issue is the time it takes to run. I’ve attached the last
/var/log/rear/rear\*.log.

I've been running the backups for about a month now, sometimes they
finish in 10 minutes, sometimes they finish in 5-6 hours. The amount of
data on the servers is the same. The storage being written to is the
same.

@exfarmer have you tried increasing the log verbosity (-d or even -D)?
Maybe it would show something happening between 01:30:04 - 04:57:58, -D
should even show the exact command that takes so much time.

@exfarmer  
in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8690141/rear-uq00550p.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8690141/rear-uq00550p.log)  
I dont's see further timestamps between  
`2022-05-13 04:49:54.455875382` and  
`2022-05-13 11:02:50.240385155`  
neither are there messages from called programs  
that indicate something gets delayed.

To find out what takes so much time in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh  
add as very first line in that script

    ( while Log 'TICK' ; do sleep 1 ; done ) & tickPID=$!

and add as very last line to that script

    kill $tickPID

which will log `TICK` with a timestamp each second  
while that script is running.

Then redo a "rear -D mkbackup" or "rear -D mkrescue"  
the latter is sufficient because the delay happens in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh  
so the delay does not happen while making the backup  
but while creating the isolinux configuration  
which belongs to making the rescue/recovery system.

I added the lines to

@exfarmer  
your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8699870/rear-uq00264q.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/8699870/rear-uq00264q.log)  
contains (excerpts):

    + source /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300_create_isolinux.sh
    .
    .
    .
    ++++ find /usr -name menu.c32
    ++++ tail -1
    ++ Log TICK
    ...
    ++ Log TICK
    ...
    ++ Log TICK
    ...

So the delay happens at `find /usr`

As far as I see in the code this is  
the function find\_syslinux\_modules\_dir  
which is called by the function make\_syslinux\_config as

    syslinux_modules_dir=$( find_syslinux_modules_dir menu.c32 )

which is called by 300\_create\_isolinux.sh

The function find\_syslinux\_modules\_dir  
in lib/bootloader-functions.sh does (excerpts):

        if [[ -n "$SYSLINUX_MODULES_DIR" ]]; then
            [[ -d "$SYSLINUX_MODULES_DIR" ]] && echo "$SYSLINUX_MODULES_DIR"
            return
        fi
        ...
            else
                # not default location? try to find it
                # file=/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi32/menu.c32
                # f23: file=/usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32
                file=$( find /usr -name "$1" 2>/dev/null | tail -1 )
        ...
        echo "$syslinux_modules_dir"

So the `find /usr` is fallback code when  
SYSLINUX\_MODULES\_DIR is not set.

To speed up things it should work  
to set SYSLINUX\_MODULES\_DIR in etc/rear/local.conf  
to the directory that contains the SYSLINUX modules  
in particular the SYSLINUX module menu.c32

For example on my openSUSE Leap 15.3 system I get

    # rpm -ql syslinux | grep menu.c32
    /usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32

What is strange is that SYSLINUX\_MODULES\_DIR  
is not mentioned in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

I don't know the reason why it is not in default.conf

Perhaps @gdha may know more because it originated at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7cde528498784a48490feb7cd1fadc4b396db620](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7cde528498784a48490feb7cd1fadc4b396db620)

there is (excerpt)

    ++++ find /usr -name menu.c32
    ++++ tail -1
    +++ file=/usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32
    ++++ dirname /usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32

    +++ syslinux_modules_dir=/usr/share
    +++ is_true

    +++ ((  0 != 0  ))
    +++ echo /usr/share/syslinux
    ++ syslinux_modules_dir=/usr/share/syslinux
    ++ SYSLINUX_DIR=/usr/share/syslinux

so in this case on this server in etc/rear/local.conf

    SYSLINUX_MODULES_DIR="/usr/share/syslinux"

should be the right value to speed up things.

the function find\_syslinux\_modules\_dir  
now tells the user in debug mode what is going on  
(plus a hint one "may specify SYSLINUX\_MODULES\_DIR")  
when the fallback 'find /usr' is run  
to find the SYSLINUX modules directory.

This is likely not a final solution but at least the user is now  
informed (in debug mode) what is going on and what could help.

Hi,

The backups are now running as expected, about 5 minutes.  
The command that was taking so long was $( find /usr )  
That command didn’t have an issue on any of the other servers we have,
only the new RHEL 8 servers. Why would that be?  
I suspect it was looking in all the /usr file systems, they are
basically the same on all our servers.

Hi,

Thank you for getting back to me.  
The no space left on disk was the /tmp file system, took me a while to
figure it out, …  
With all the testing and no deleting the old /tmp/rear.\* file systems
it got filled up.

My issue now is the time it takes to run one of these backups, some are
12 hours.  
I running them with rear -Dv mkbackup, but I’m not seeing what happens
after:  
…  
…  
It will not be copied by default. You can include
'/usr/src/kernels/4.18.0-348.12.2.el8\_5.x86\_64' via the 'COPY\_AS\_IS'
configuration variable.  
Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.7V34l6Nxs8lrHPg/rootfs
contains a usable system  
Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd initrd.cgz with gzip
default compression  
Created initrd.cgz with gzip default compression (435439504 bytes) in 31
seconds

I changed my local.conf file a little:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP\_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://edlusxo001.oneabbott.com/data/col1/usxo\_linux\_bu\_image  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/media'
'/var/tmp' '/var/crash' '/var/log' '/usr/openv' '/srv')  
EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS=( /tmp )  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( 'vgos' )  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=yes

I added the EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS line, thinking it would be better, but
I think that’s already part of the BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE from the
default.conf file.  
I will get with the storage tram, but is there anything you can think of
to speed this up?

Thank you, again

I see in the log file snapshots are included in the backup, those are on
