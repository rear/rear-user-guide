Hi , i have 3.10.9 kernel running with udev 204.  
While running rear recover im getting the following error :


    ERROR: Mount command 'mount /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER /tmp/rear.fbhHW5ocbWdLhET/outputfs' failed

i have 2 block devices detected :


    ls -l /sys/block/ |grep -v "ram\|loop"
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov  9 21:58 sda -> ../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0d.0/ata1/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov  9 21:58 sr0 -> ../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.1/ata4/host3/target3:0:0/3:0:0:0/block/sr0

so it seems kernel was able to detect my virtual disk and
cdrom(virtualbox)

the disk/by-lable is empty :


    ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/
    total 0

Any suggestions on how to solve and where is there is the problem?

Edit:  
Actually no entries were created under /dev for block devices.  
No /dev/sda or /dev/sr0 exists.

I manually created sr0 (mknod b 11 0) and added a link under
/dev/disk/by-lable but i think its shouldn't be like that...

the library script `./lib/config-functions.sh` contains a function
called `SetOSVendorAndVersion` which bails out because it doesn't find
`lsb_release` executable. You could try to create `/etc/rear/os.conf`
file containing something like:

    OS_VENDOR="Gentoo"
    OS_VERSION="(no idea what we need to fill in here)"

If `lsb_release` executable is absent we try to pre-built this via RPM
installation, but Gentoo is working differently, right. Tips are
welcome...

    pluto rear # type lsb_release
    lsb_release is /usr/bin/lsb_release
    pluto rear # which lsb_release

So do i have a problem with packaging this binary while creating a
backup?  
Also for

do you mean installing it on host,if absent, during backup or creating a
package that can be later used during recovery(without installing)?

What I meant is that by creating a /etc/rear/os.conf file you don't need
lsb\_release anymore. The packaging tries to do this for you. I have no
clue what Gentoo requires to achieve the same?

I managed to solve the missing lsb\_release problem by adding it :

    PROGS=(${PROGS[@]} /usr/bin/lsb_release)

to local.conf  
After that i'm getting same error:

@sirtow could you run `rear -vD mkrescue` and put the log on github gist
system for inspection? I wonder if the `isofs` kernel module is
available or loaded when trying to `mount` the ISO image.

I can but i dont think this is the issue. Once i manually populate /dev
as :

    mknod /dev/sda b 8 0
    mknod /dev/sr0 b 11 0
    ln -s /dev/sr0  /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER

Im able to run the recover process. So it seems my kernel knows how to
mount iso image.  
Do you think i still need to test your last suggestion?

If that is the case then the devices should have been created
automatically by udevd. Somehow it must fail, are you sure you didn't
see any error messages while booting the rescue image?

@sirtow would be nice to see a debug session from a recovery
`rear -vD recover` (add this to gisthub)? We have no clue for the

It might be related to \#222. I left a comment there but it seems that
notifications stop working after ticket is closed. So adding it here:  
"The problem is that ext3 module is not loaded if udev is present.
Despite the fact that ext3 module is present in /etc/modules, it's not
loaded in 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh because udev is present. But
udev doesn't load ext3 either."

@astafyev did you found an error about ext3 via e.g. `dmesg` output?

No, there is only 'mount' error. If I load ext3 manually then I can
mount manually too. Also if I change 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh
script to always load modules regardless udev presence then this issue
goes away.  
This issue is reproducible on CentOS as ext3 is compiled as a module.
Fedora doesn't have this issue as ext3 is compiled into kernel.

In my case, the FS is part of the kernel.  
I tend to agree that udevd does not create entires under /dev but the
question is why? Same kernel is being used in my system and the entries
are there.

@sirtow @astafyev have a look at the script
`./build/GNU/Linux/60_verify_and_adjust_udev.sh` - it might be that some
slight adjustment is required for your environment?

Even after patching 60\_verify\_and\_adjust\_udev.sh, I get the same
error during restore. I have a device in /dev/disk/by-label/ called
boot, but not RELAXRECOVER. So udev seems to be working just fine, but
the mount fails. If I create the symlink to /dev/sr1 (my CD device) the
mount works and the recovery completes. On RHELv5.

I have just started looking at "rear" and am testing with a centos 5
64-bit vm on vmware esxi. I just replaced the version from EPEL with
rear-1.16.1-121.git201502062115.el5.noarch.rpm, ran rear -v mkbackup,
copied the resulting ISO to esxi and attached it to a second (empty) vm.
I booted from that ISO and ran rear -v recover. It failed. "ERROR: Mount
command 'mount /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER /tmp/rear.blah/outputfs'
failed". /dev/disk/by-label is empty. Also, in
/var/log/rear/rear-<systemname>.log I see that the line following the
mount attempt shows "mount: you must specify the filesystem type" but I
don't know if that is relevant. My intent is to have the "data backup"
included on the ISO so that recovery is just isolated to using the ISO.
For some of my VM's / servers this is an appropriate approach. From
/etc/rear/site.conf:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://a.b.c.d/some/path/backup
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///backup

This does appear to add my data to the ISO and then copies the ISO to
the nfs server. And, as noted above, if I create the symlink, "ln -s
/dev/hdc /dev/disk/by-label/RELACRECOVER", I can then run "rear recover"
successfully.

I tested ReaR 1.17.2 with different Ubuntu versions (all with latest
updates) and backup to ISO as follows:

-   12.04 =&gt; Recovery works fine.
-   14.04 =&gt; Fails as mentioned (no /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER

-   15.04 =&gt; Recovery works fine.

That is my state. What can I do to debug the situation under 14.04 a bit
better?

was recently modified for module loading (issue \#766). Perhaps it could
fix the issue with Ubuntu 14.04 as well?

Where should the symbolic link be placed? I cannot get the iso to mount
during recovery.

Just ran into this same problem on Redhat 5.11 on 1.17.2 RPM install.
The issue comes because the ISO label isn't being read and aliased into
the /dev/disk/by-name/ directory

I fix it by running

ln -s /dev/cdrom /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER

Isn't there a simple way to fix this by putting an option in to specify
the iso device label in the configuration file, or to specify it at
recover time?

Tried the snapshot. Same issue. There's no link for it in the
/dev/disk/by-label directory.

ln -s /dev/cdrom /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER  
fixes the problem

rear-1.17.2-170.git201603021132.el5.x86\_64.rpm was the RPM I used.

I made the symlink after booting to recovery and opening the shell.

in your case, you'll want to link to sr0 instead of /dev/cdrom. (I
assume you knew that). We're having separate issues possibly because
you're dealing with multiple dvds.

@hardrain47 i am having no luck. Can you send me a sample local.conf
file to see the iso backup format. FYI when my backup was less that 4GB
and a single iso. the restore worked just fine. its only since it has
grown over 4GB that it splits into two and the restore gives the
RELAXRECOVER issue.

I also just use the default output location: /var/lib/rear/output

@DaGSUMan Couldn't test over the weekend with 6.7, but I have some
results for you.

I am on an extremely similar RHEL release 6.7.2.6-32-573.e16.x86\_64

I did a test setup with a 700MB max iso size which split my system into
two isos and tried a restore. I had no problem restoring with multiple
isos. Worked flawlessly. Do you think perhaps it could be your CD drive,
or how you burned your isos? I am using a USB DVD drive with isos burnt
to DVD-RW on windows.

Another thing I thought you might be able to do is do a ctrl-z when it's
asking for that CD and try to mount the filesystem manually. That may be
easier said than done.

Still stuck on 5u11, but I can work around that issue. Going to try it
on RHEL 4

THank you @hardrain47 I'll try it again. Although, fyi I am using VM to
test the restoring and mounting the ISO. It is creating three iso's one
that is 7GB and the other two are like 300K

I was trying to burn them to an DVD but it was too large. It's not
breaking the DVD size equally. My is 7GB from the physical server. That
is why I was trying to restore to VM.

With

this issue should be now fixed in a (hopefully) better way.
