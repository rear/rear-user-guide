-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hello, I would like to use rear in CI and it should be fully
automated.  
OS - Red Hat - 8.4  
OUTPUT = ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=nfs  
I have added some variables  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE="unattended"  
USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT=1  
but it hasn't solved my problem. I still have to manually choose in rear
but menu bwtween:  
Reciver/ Aumatic recover/ Boot First Local Disk etc.

How can I configure it to choose Automatic recover or set Automatic
recover as default option?

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

You can drag-drop log files into this editor to create an attachment  
or paste verbatim text like command output or file content  
by including it between a leading and a closing line of  
three backticks like this:

We have been using ReaR in CI. These settings have worked well for us in
the case of ISO output and BIOS booting:

    ISO_DEFAULT=automatic
    ISO_RECOVER_MODE=unattended
