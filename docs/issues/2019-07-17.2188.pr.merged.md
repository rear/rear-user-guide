-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

When 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh resizes the last partition  
on a GPT disk it leaves 33 LBA blocks at the end of the disk  
so that 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh produces a fully correct  
disklayout.conf file where no further automated adjustments by  
a subsequent script like 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh are done.

In a quick first test things look good to me:  
I do no longer get a `size reduced to fit on disk` message in the log.

I checked the calculations of the new GPT related code  
in 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh and all looks good to me  
so that will merge it soon if there are no objections right now.
