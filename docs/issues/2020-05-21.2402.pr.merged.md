    Remote: bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (rear.UTF-8)
    ...

`Remote: bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (rear.UTF-8)`
message is shown when server site does not have `rear.UTF-8`
available.  
Changing locale name to standard `en_US.UTF-8` will fix this problem.

One can workaround this message by generating `rear.UTF-8` locales on
destination host running Borg.

    # localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US "/usr/lib/locale/rear.UTF-8"

I could reproduce that issue. Fix in this PR looks good to me, and
should be merged/accepted imho.

One other workaround would be to disable the forwarding of the `LC_ALL`
variable in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`:

    # This enables sending locale enviroment variables LC_* LANG, see ssh_config(5).
        SendEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES
        SendEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT
        SendEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL

e.g. change last line to `    SendEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION`, that is remove
`LC_ALL`.

Just finished a recover test with that commit, works as expected for me.
No
`Remote: bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (rear.UTF-8)`
warning appeared.

Yes, I tried it and it worked too.

Editing `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` in the rescue system with removing
`LC_ALL` worked.

And also editing `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` in the original system, then
running rear mkbackup (with the result `LC_ALL` removed also in the
rescue system), worked then of course too.

I have a general question about Borg out of curiosity:

I am not a Borg user so I don't know how Borg actually works.

I wonder why it seems the Borg behaviour depends on the locale.

I would understand that only a backup program user interface  
depends on the locale of the user who runs the program  
(e.g. different language for user dialog messages).

I would expect that things work when a backup program is called  
to make a backup under a different locale than the locale that  
another user uses when calling the program to restore the backup.

I.e. I would expect that Borg can be called under a UTF8 locale  
to make a backup and later Borg can be called under POSIX locale  
to restore that backup.

But it seems the locale when Borg is called to restore must match  
the locale that was used when Borg was called to make a backup.  
If yes, this looks like a plain wrong behaviour of Borg to me.

The borg\_extract function contains a comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh\#L142](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/borg-functions.sh#L142)

    # Scope of LC_ALL is only within run of `borg extract'.
    # This avoids Borg problems with restoring UTF-8 encoded files names in archive
    # and should not interfere with remaining stages of rear recover.

which looks scaring and plain wrong inside Borg because  
file names must be in any case restored byte-by-byte  
exactly same as they have been on the original system  
(same as any file content that must be restored byte-by-byte  
exactly same as it was on the original system).

How file names (and file contents) are restored must never ever  
depend on the locale that is used while the restore program runs,  
cf. the section "Non-ASCII characters in file names"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)  
that contains

    For the operating system a filename
    is a plain sequence of bytes
    without any additional information what
    characters are meant by this sequence of bytes

So any backup program must store file names as a plain sequence of
bytes  
and restore the files with the exact same sequence of bytes as their
name.  
A reason behind is that e.g. different users can use different locales  
and have their own file names in their own different localizations.  
After a backup restore operation all file names must appear  
exactly same for all the users as they have been before.

Was that not already discussed/explained in
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702\#issuecomment-253190651](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702#issuecomment-253190651)?

I know about  
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702\#issuecomment-253190651](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1702#issuecomment-253190651)  
but this did not explain anything to me.  
It even confirms from my point of view that Borg seems  
to mess around with things (user's sacrosanct content)  
that it should not at all touch.

I cannot review Borg related things in ReaR when the reasoning behind  
is some Borg specific exceptional stuff that I do not understand.

If Borg needs dirty hacks in ReaR to make Borg work in ReaR  
it is perfectly fine and much appreciated to have such dirty hacks,  
cf. "Dirty hacks welcome" in

@jsmeix I'm afraid that in terms of Borg I'm just a simple user, without
any deeper background on how and why things work in certain way in Borg.
Same as with majority of Linux programs I use, I just want blindly trust
that authors knows what they are doing, because getting details on every
(or even some) application I'm working with is simply surpasses my
available brain and time capacity ;-) ...
