what is the output of `mount | grep tmp` ? The `/tmp` must be writable
for root.

Ok, did you upgrade rear? If yes, please remove it first and re-install
it again.

with  
dirs?​

Yes I have removed and reinstalled again .. but same issue.  
/tmp has full permission to write the files.

@ocvelux are you sure you can mount
`datashare2v:/export/DATASHARE2/vm_stage/linux_boot_images/` and write
into it as `root`?
