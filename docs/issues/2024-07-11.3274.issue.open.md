The `REQUESTRESTORE` backup method already supports non-interactive
usage via setting both the `REQUESTRESTORE_FINISHED_FILE` and also the
`REQUESTRESTORE_ABORT_FILE` variables.

This facilitates externally managed restore to happen "behinde the
scenes" when `rear recover` is run.

However, there is currently no easy way to know that the recovery
process is ready for the actual restore to happen.

I suggest adding two new variables to facilitate this:

1.  `REQUESTRESTORE_READY_FILE` pointing to a file that ReaR creates to
    indicate that the restore process can start.
2.  `REQUESTRESTORE_READY_COMMAND` to contain a list of commands that
    are run via `eval` to signal that the restore process can start.

Things to fix with this work:

-   expand comments in `default.conf` to explain that both the finished
    and abort files must be set for this feature to work

@schlomo Please rename the variables to names which come closer to what
is meant.

@gdha do you mean something like
ˋREQUESTRESTORE\_READY\_TO\_RESTORE\_FILEˋ and
ˋREQUESTRESTORE\_READY\_TO\_RESTORE\_COMMANDˋ?
