Brief description of the issue
==============================

1.  

2016-02-27 18:48:19 Comparing disks.  
2016-02-27 18:48:19 Disk configuration is identical, proceeding with
restore.  
2016-02-27 18:48:19 No code has been generated to restore device
pv:/dev/mapper/luks-40c4eca5-5b90-48aa-b46b-141cb2574452 (lvmdev).  
Please add code to /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh to manually
install it or choose abort.  
**BUT**  
The disk configuration is absolutely not identical – SSD was formatted
with fat32 – No partitions left on the NVMe. I can continue the process.
In the end It will say  
'2016-02-27 18:48:25 Disk layout created.'... BUT the disklayout hasn't
changed anyway!

\**The diskrestore/disklayout 'resetting' does not function at all on
the NVMe hard drive. \**

1.  

I even tried to replace the NVMe Drive with a Samsung SSD 850 Pro and
tried to restore the system on that SSD. 'The disklayout was not
restored'.

1.  

The diskrestore.sh is empty – beside the fact the disklayout.conf look
great. **Why is that?**  
It would be great to get this issue resolved!

**Thanks to everybody!!!**

P.S.  
I attached disklayout.conf and rear-localhost.log

Device `/dev/nvme0n1` is strange and is not recognized by rear it seems
as there is no disk definition found in `disklayout.conf`. Perhaps, it
would be nice to see the debug out of `rear -vd savelayout` which
produces the `disklayout.conf` file.

Hi,

**thanks for responding that nice and quick!**  
I attached the rear -vd savelayout OUTPUT.

Again, thanks a lot!!!

@GIT-STATA sorry, my mistake I meant `rear -vD savelayout` (captital D
to capture debugging)

Ok I understand the issue now - according
[https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/blog/2014/10/10/finding-your-new-intel-ssd-for-pcie-think-nvme-not-scsi](https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/blog/2014/10/10/finding-your-new-intel-ssd-for-pcie-think-nvme-not-scsi)
it is not a scsi device and currently rear does not recognize it.  
Script `20_partition_layout.sh` must be extended with this type disk.

Hi gdha,

thank you very much for your response. I guess, it must be this part of
the script, which needed to be 'revised'

> Script 20\_partition\_layout.sh must be extended with this type
> disk.&lt;

    for path in "${sysfs_paths[@]}" ; do
        ### path can be: /sys/block/sda/sda1 --> /dev/sda1
        ###              /sys/block/dm-4 --> /dev/mapper/mpathbp1

But still I have no clue what exactly to revise.  
Any Code would be so great! I would test it, of course...

P.S.  
Maybe that is needed?

Hi,

unfortunately it does not work....

**Partition is numbered ''''''. More than 128 partitions is not
supported.'

Here is rear -vD ...

@GIT-STATA could you post `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`? I
think we are on the right track, but noet completely finished yet.

Hi,

sure!

Here we go (disklayout.conf with NVMe SSD)

Thanks!

In the disklayout.conf I noticed the start of the partition is missing:

    # Format: part <device> <partition size(bytes)> <partition start(bytes)> <partition type|name> <flags> /dev/<partition>
    part /dev/nvme0n1 524288000 primary boot  /dev/nvme0n1p1
    part /dev/nvme0n1 255534825472 primary none  /dev/nvme0n1p2

Could you run a debug session of savelayout once more?

Hi gdha,

any new ideas on that issue?  
Thanks a lot!  
Best!

Script `/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/20_partition_layout.sh`
calls:

    +++ local nr_blocks=1024000
    +++ local disk_size=524288000
    +++ echo 524288000
    ++ size=524288000
    +++ get_partition_start nvme0n1/nvme0n1p1
    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/20_partition_layout.sh: line 64: get_partition_start: command not found
    ++ start=
    ++ echo '1 524288000 '

At this moment I have no clue why it doesn't find the function
`get_partition_start` as it is defined in
`layout-functions.sh:get_partition_start()`  
Next week we might have a smarter idea?

Hi,

yes, lets see next week!  
**BUT**  
get\_partition\_start() **is not called in**
/usr/share/rear/lib/**layout-functions.sh**  
I can't find it there!

Thanks!

@GIT-STATA Could you remove rear and re-install it once to double check
this? It must be there (in layout-functions.sh)

The **official stable releases from EPEL does not work**!  
After I used the **Relax-and-Recover sources from Github** and build the
rpm package, I can now confirm that ReaR is working great! I have tested
different scenarios and everything worked as it should! NVMe is now
supported (from my point of view!)

**THANKS A LOT !!!gdha!!!**
