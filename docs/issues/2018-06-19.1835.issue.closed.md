@kodiss

Summary:

This issue is a duplicate of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563)  
which was fixed after the ReaR 2.3 release.

To use a ReaR version where this issue should be already fixed:

I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in
released  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with
reasonable effort)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your ReaR version.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".
