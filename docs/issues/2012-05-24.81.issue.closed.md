When making backups using Rear, we need to make sure that running
applications or deamons write consistent data out to the file system.
This is impossible, except when stopping services this can be guaranteed
in all cases.

For this we would like to add the capability to stop and start services
before and after running the backup.

We need to make sure that:

-   Only effectively stopped services (those that were running) are
    being started again
-   All applications are effectively being started (we can guarantee and
    it's not Rear's problem ! Document this risk !)
-   If Rear fails, make sure we start all services anyway (as exit
    tasks)

The implementation would use an array as a list of services to
stop/start, and by default it would be empty (so this functionality is
effectively disabled).

It is the task of the system administrator to decide what applications
require this and what the effects are of stopping the service and the
resulting downtime.

Currently I use rear-1.10.0 (on a SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 system)
and there I have /usr/share/rear/backup/readme which reads:

00-09: initialization  
10-19: mount NETFS  
20-29: create prefix dir, etc.  
30-39: specials like SELinux (stop)  
40-49: create include/exclude files for backup  
50-59: backup itself  
60-69: specials like SELinux (start)  
70-79: umount NETFS  
80-89:  
90-99:

Accordingly I have in particular those files
/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/GNU/Linux/30\_stop\_selinux.sh
/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/GNU/Linux/60\_start\_selinux.sh

I.e. there is already something implemented at the right time to stop
something before backup and re-start it after backup.

I suggest to only enhance this as follows:

Provide two directories where executables (usually bash scripts) can be
placed by the system admin which are run before the backup and after the
backup.

Why directories?

This way the system admin (or even several system admins) can maintain
separated executables to stop and re-start  
separarted services.

Separated scripts for separated services should be run by default
simultaneously to speed up the overall time untill all services are
stopped and re-started.

If different services depend on each other the system admin must
implement in his scripts that one waits until another one has completed.

Perhaps ReaR could provide functionality to enforce running them one
after the other only if the executable file names have leading two-digit
numbers and all executables with none or same numbers are launched
simultaneously.

It may take a longer time until a service can be stopped in a
reasonable/friendly way in the running system.

Examples:

-   One would let the printing service finish the printout of all
    currently printing jobs before the printing service is stopped.
-   Imagine at 3 o'clock in the night whatever process had submitted a
    200 pages job which is now printing at page 190 when the printing
    service is suddenly stopped. After re-start of the printing service
    it would re-print the whole 200 pages job from the beginning.
-   One would let the mail service finish to receive all mails which are
    currently received before it is stopped.
-   Imagine at 3 o'clock in the night from somewhere a mail with a huge
    5GB data attachment arrives where right now 4GB was already received
    when suddenly the mail service is stopped.

In such cases it would be good if the scripts for the printing and mail
service would run by default simultaneously (and also wait simultaneosly
until the 200 pages print job finished and the huge mail was completely
received).

I think it belongs to the system admin to make appropriate scripts to
stop and re-start his particular services in a way which is reasonable
in his particular environment. In particular only the system admin could
know how long to wait for a service to complete its current active tasks
before the service is forced to stop. Think about an active printing 200
pages job at 3 o'clock in the night where the printer runs out of paper
at page 190.

I think all what ReaR should provide are those directories and the
functionality to run all executables therein but not the actual
executables therein.

Perhaps ReaR might provide example scripts as documentation but no
actual executables in those directories.

How about this approach?

We introduce a new directory `/etc/rear/services`. In here the admin can
place init-scripts. He can either simply symlink his local
`/etc/init.d/*` init-scripts, or write wrappers to these containing any
additionally required logic. I believe, most logic for determining the
local init-daemon already exists within ReaR, thus all we would have to
do is trigger the init-scripts in the according shell-syntax (e.g.
`/etc/rear/services/service start` or `service service start`, etc).

The big advantages I see, is that we would be able to leverage
init-script logic, like start-stop dependencies, start-stop-status
shell-syntax and such, while keeping all these complexities out of rear.
I also believe, that this would be a very intuitive abstraction layer to
the user, making it easy to add and remove backup-safe services for any
particular execution of rear. Writing a separate rear script for every
service one wants to be backup-safe would be (in many cases) reduced to
`ln -s /etc/init.d/service /etc/rear/services`. In case one does require
very special logic while stopping and starting services, he can simply
provide a wrapper to any of his init-scripts or of course any
stand-alone script, as well.

Additionally we could limit rear to only call start/stop on files in
`/etc/rear/services` that are set +x.

Let me clarify the two main opinions in the development team.

1.  We do not want to make Rear more distribution specific and making it
    harder to support Rear correctly. Rear should be a basic tool doing
    the basics right. More specific detailed functionality that's not
    widely needed should be added by end-users/administrators and Rear
    is designed to be modular and extendable... The solution is to make
    use of pre-backup and post-backup scripts and leave it up to the
    administrator to define what is needed.
2.  This functionality is something that administrators should not have
    to invent on a case-by-case basis and we can make it easier for
    everybody if we can provide it for everyone to use. Not enabled by
    default, but integrated with little need to customize by making use
    of the distribution's way of starting and stopping services. It is
    up to the administrator to decide what services need this special
    treatment.

Both views make sense. Nothing has been decided, however one thing is
clear. At this point this is not a priority, so unless someone is doing
the implementation or sponsoring an implementation this is unlikely to
happen in the short term. However, the ability to hook scripts into
different parts of Rear is more generally useful and is therefor more
likely to see the light of day. But that doesn't mean we cannot have
both at some point.

Regarding SysVinit scripts and "leverage init-script logic" and any kind
of "abstraction layer":

Nowadays there is no longer only SysVinit but also systemd so that there
is no longer a single generic way how to stop and re-start services.

This means it becomes complicated if Rear would try to provide some kind
of ready-to-use functionality to stop and re-start services.

I agree with statement of @jsmeix - it is not the task of rear to
stop/start services.  
Remember everything within rear is a script, so anybody can write a
small script (and drop it somewhere in prep directory) to avoid
interruptions of critical services.  
I gonna close this case - it can always be re-opened if there is an
urgent need for it.
