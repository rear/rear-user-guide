Hi  
I'm also trying to get rear up and running for the first time.  
I hope someone can help me.  
Iâ€™ve listed (I hope) all the details requested below.

I've got mkrescue working over a samba network(Version 4.15.13-Ubuntu)  
with two Ubuntu 22.04 nodes.  
I've now got a .iso file saved on the server.

I want to copy the .iso file onto a bootable usb stick.  
The reason for this is that I'm going to be running mkrescue as a cron
job.  
I don't want anyone to have to remember to stick the stick in the
computer,  
so I've saving the .iso to the server and then (trying to) copy the
.iso  
to a stick so I can boot from the stick and recover a crashed system.

Does anyone know how to do this? Is this a reasonable thing to want to
do?  
I've tried using Balena Etcher, but it tells me that the .iso file  
is not bootable and indeed after I've copied it to the usb stick and  
tried to boot from it, it was not recognised as bootable.  
I've also tried to format the usb stick with 'rear format -- --efi  
and then used dd to copy the .iso file to the usb stick,  
but that doesn't work either.

Any ideas anyone?  
I can't think what else to do.  
Thanks in advance for any help.

@Commandante-che  
perhaps
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)  
could be of interest for you here?

Additionally there is the RAWDISK output method, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555\#issuecomment-767451545](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555#issuecomment-767451545)  
but RAWDISK does not support to include the data backup, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555\#issuecomment-769034845](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2555#issuecomment-769034845)

@jsmeix great idea! ideally we could merge `ISO` and `RAWDISK` output
methods so that the resulting file is universally usable as
boot/recovery media.

I guess that this work would require sponsoring.

@schlomo  
I cannot provide actually helpful input here because  
"make a bootable thingy" is not my area of expertise.

I know that we have too many different implementations  
of "making a bootable thingy" where some are rather old  
but I cannot clean up that pile of stuff on my own  
so yes, this would need (massive) sponsoring.

For example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1601](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1601)

Both faded away because noone appeared to implement it.

For testing purposes, I succeeded with RUFUS.  
You could also give Win32 Disk Imager
([https://win32diskimager.org/](https://win32diskimager.org/)) a try
(untested).

@guru4712 can it be that RUFUS actually does ISO **image** booting
similar to
[https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2013/11/magic-iso-image-booting-with-gnu-grub-2.html](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2013/11/magic-iso-image-booting-with-gnu-grub-2.html)?

That would be another approach although personally I really prefer us to
get a proper solution for hybrid ISO/disk boot. I suppose that with
limiting support for UEFI boot only that would be much simpler as we
don't need magic bootloaders for UEFI boot.

@schlomo: My goal was only to test if there is a way to boot a rescue
hardware if the usb-stick intended to boot from is unavailable. I alwas
generate the .ISO, too, and leave it within the data backup.  
I simply took RUFUS in a version dating approx. end of 2022 and
re-created a working boot stick  
(of course burning a cd and booting from it works as well)  
Sorry, I do not remember which options were used, so I cannot really
contribute to your question above.
