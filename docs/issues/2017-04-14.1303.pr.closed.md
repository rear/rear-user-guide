Alternatively look not only look for a `TARGET_DEVICE/boot/efi` mount,
but also for `TARGET_DEVICE/boot` (as long as directory
`TARGET_DEVICE/boot/efi` exists).

Without this fix the recovery will error out after:  
`Patching file 'etc/fstab' `  
with an error like:  
`Empty string passed to get_device_name`

Because in Arch Linux the ESP is mounted at `/boot` (not `/boot/efi`)

There is not need for case-insensitive check in this script. Here I
don't want to change the check for the directory. Here checking of the
real mount point is happening: /boot/efi or /boot in the list of mount
points. Consider merging without changes.

The comment in the code tells different:

<pre>
# check if $TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi directory exists
# case-insensitive because Arch Linux uses /boot/EFI
[[ -d "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi" ]]
</pre>

so that either the comment or the actual code must be fixed.

@jsmeix  
Comment line \#1: general explain why this check is there  
Comment line \#2: in more detail explain why the check needs to be done
case insensitive: otherwise it will break Arch.

Apparently the comments need to be rewritten, but I don't know how to
express myself clearer in this case.

The question is - is the PR still relevant after all these months?

What I meant in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1303\#issuecomment-296149622](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1303#issuecomment-296149622)  
is that I do not see how the actual code

<pre>
[[ -d "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/efi" ]]
</pre>

inplements a case-insensitive test.  
I.e. the actual code seems to contradict the comment.

@jsmeix @gozora Is this PR still relevant as the code around UEFI has
been updated multiple time over the last year?

I close it as "won't fix" because in the foreseeable future I will
have  
no time to fix this pull request so that its changes look o.k. to me.

I am not a Arch Linux user but I assume Arch Linux EFI boot works  
meanwhile because I am not aware of an open issue in this area.
