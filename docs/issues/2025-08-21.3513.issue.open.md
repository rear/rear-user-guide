### Requesting support or just a question

Why is the rsync on rear recover so slow?

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output

    Rsync poor performance (3KiB/s). Please check additional information.

### Additional information

Scenario: trying to recover multiple Red Hat 8.10 virtual machines using
rsync. Here is the /etc/rear/local.conf:

    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /net /vhe )
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=RSYNC
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/backup/images

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( "/backup" )
    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y

    USE_RESOLV_CONF=( "no" )
    FIRMWARE_FILE="no"
    MODULES=()

    EFI_BOOTLOADER="1"
    GRUB2_UEFI="1"
    CREATE_SHIM="yes"
    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi"

Using ReaR 2.6:

    rear --version
    Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / 2020-06-17

This creates the rear.iso and the backup folder, with the OS data, on my
backup server (bkpsrv) at /backup/images/<hostname>. My virtual machines
are running on a different physical host than the bkpsrv. In the case I
need to restore a specific virtual machine, I move the iso image from
bkpsrv to the desired physical host, recreate the VM, attach the iso and
boot.

However, when starting the rsync to the /mnt/local, the speed is limited
to 3KiB/s. I can see that ReaR is using the following command from the
rear log:

`rsync --sparse --archive --hard-links --numeric-ids --stats root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/backup/images/<hostname>/backup/ /mnt/local/`

I have tested the network on both directions and I can transfer files
using rsync quite fast (100MB/s).

On the rear rescue console, if I run the very same command, it goes
really fast:

What am I missing?
