@gdha  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7bacee38c001e879abe91deaf9e85db4774f0a74](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7bacee38c001e879abe91deaf9e85db4774f0a74)

Please test that newest GitHub master code.

I had to enhance it a bit because in case of 'unattended\_recovery'  
there can be a valid MAC\_MAPPING\_FILE nevertheless  
and then MANUAL\_MAC\_MAPPING=true  
or there can be no valid MAC\_MAPPING\_FILE  
and then MANUAL\_MAC\_MAPPING=unattended.

Only in the latter case we can only bindly proceed  
and hope MAC addresses will be right.
