in your rear-debian.log I notice (excerpts):

I guess `grub-install` is right and you need to adapt the partitioning  
on the original system to something that `grub-install` supports.

Or do you perhaps not use GRUB2 (which is used as fallback by ReaR) as
bootloader?  
In this case see the BOOTLOADER variable in default.conf.

@ledj  
I could extract most (but not all) of the basic information from the
log  
but that is tedious work (not really helpful with free support ;-)  
so that the more easy you could make it for us to correctly imagine  
what goes on on your particular system (for example I am not a Debian
user)  
the better things could work out in the end.

In this case I would like to know in particular what the partitioning  
of your original system of the (main) system disk is.  
I.e. what is the (full) output of the command

<pre>
# parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
</pre>

where you may have to replace `/dev/sda` by the actual device node  
of your (main) system disk (probably `/dev/xvda`).

FYI:

In your rear-debian.log I noticed right now (excerpts):

<pre>
Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / 2017-12-20
...
Partition rear-noname on /dev/xvda: size reduced to fit on disk.
...
End changed from 107374190592 to 107374165504.
</pre>

which indicates that on your replacement "hardware"  
(in your case probably a replacement virtual machine)  
you use a replacement (virtual) disk with different size.

Recreation on a bit different hardware is actually a migration.

In case of migration with ReaR I would really recommend  
to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

For ReaR's so called "migration mode" I intentionally made major
changes  
to the partition resizing code in current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
to avoid really bad automated resizing results that had happened before,
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102)

For a summary of that changes see the ReaR 2.4 release notes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-4.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-4.md)  
therein read the section

<pre>
Version 2.4 (June 2018)
...
New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

Major rework and changed default behaviour how ReaR behaves
in migration mode when partitions can or must be resized
to fit on replacement disks with different size.
...
</pre>

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1822\#issuecomment-396492635](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1822#issuecomment-396492635)  
and regarding `size reduced to fit on disk` see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733\#issuecomment-367680598](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733#issuecomment-367680598)

That `End changed from 107374190592 to 107374165504` here  
looks like another "fine" example how ReaR before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6414936ba30d6c13020eee8313e93a4e29debc54](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6414936ba30d6c13020eee8313e93a4e29debc54)  
badly changes partitioning alingment because  
107374190592 = 13107201 \* 512 \* 16 (i.e. originally aligned to a 8 KiB
unit)  
while in contrast  
107374165504 = 209715167 \* 512 (i.e. re-aligned by ReaR to only a 512 B
unit)

@jsmeix

Super thanks! And generally and in this case, I'm trying to find a way
to convert from a KVM based (Proxmox) VM to a XenServer (xcp-ng.org) VM
(back and forth actually as we use both). And you are correct, even
though the disk is set to the same size on original and the migrated,
sizes seem to differ slightly as noticed by rear.

Output of "parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print" on original system is:

<pre>
root@debian:~# parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
Model: QEMU QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 102400MiB

@ledj  
for comparison what I have on one of my  
GPT partitioned systems with BIOS booting  
(it is a SLES15 default partitioning):

<pre>
# parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
Model: ATA QEMU HARDDISK (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 20480MiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags: pmbr_boot

Number  Start     End       Size      File system     Name  Flags
 1      1.00MiB   9.00MiB   8.00MiB                         bios_grub
 2      9.00MiB   12906MiB  12897MiB  btrfs                 legacy_boot
 4      12906MiB  18431MiB  5525MiB   xfs
 3      18431MiB  20480MiB  2049MiB   linux-swap(v1)        swap
</pre>

There is a 8 MiB `bios_grub` partition that is there for GRUB2  
so that GRUB2 can put its second stages there, cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS\_boot\_partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition)

I think without such a BIOS boot partition you may run into  
booting problems out of a sudden at an arbitrary later time.  
Probably for some time it may work when GRUB2 "blindly"  
squeezes its second stages somehow somewhere into the  
hopefully empty "somewhat (depending on the GPT size) less than 1 MiB"
gap  
at the beginning of your disk i.e. after the GPT (where exactly does a
GPT end?)  
and before the first partition starts - but as GRUB2 reports

<pre>
... this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.
Embedding is not possible. GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.
However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged.
grub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.
</pre>

I still think the actual solution is to have such a BIOS boot partition.

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
that would do the annoying legwork for you.

For an example you may have a look at the  
"P2V HP microserver to VmWare" issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943)

But migrating a system onto same hardware only with changed  
partition sizes should be more or less straightforward.

In this case it should be sufficient to edit disklayout.conf  
before you run "rear recover".

When you migrate with ReaR you could manually modify  
the disklayout.conf file and insert such a BIOS boot partition  
to get one on the replacement hardware when there is none  
on the original system.

For an example how a disklayout.conf file with a BIOS boot partition  
looks on my above system (excerpts, only `disk` `part` `fs` and `swap`
entries,  
i.e. leaving out all those btrfs related stuff that should not matter
here):

<pre>

</pre>

When you migrate with ReaR you would need to manually modify  
the disklayout.conf file in the already running ReaR recovery system  
e.g. before you run `rear recover` or while `rear recover` is running  
via the dialog that asks for confirmation of the disklayout.conf file.

It could be laborious and unhandy to manually edit  
disklayout.conf within the ReaR recovery system  
in particular you need to provide the values as byte values.

In this case have a look at RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

For an example how RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL works see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-236547810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-236547810)

When you use the ReaR master code as 'git clone/checkout' see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-237544630](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-237544630)  
what is special about the disklayout.conf file location  
in the ReaR recovery system that you must consider  
to make RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL work.

@ledj  
as a dirty hack you could of course modify ReaR's  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/620\_install\_grub2.sh  
script as you like.  
Perhaps there is a `grub-install` command line option for your  
used GRUB2 to enforce it to be installed by using blocklists.  
My `grub-install` man page shows a `--force` command line option  
but I don't know if that helps in this case.

@ledj  
a note regarding migrating to a "XenServer (xcp-ng.org) VM":  
I don't know about XEN (I only use KVM) but perhaps  
the section "Paravirtualization" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
could be of interest for you.

@ledj  
a note regarding migrating from "this hardware" to "that hardware" and
vice versa  
where "this hardware" and "that hardware" have "basically same" disk
size:

In general I would recommend to leave some reasonable amount  
of unused disk space at the end of the disk where "reasonable amount"  
is the maximum expected variation of the "basically same" disk sizes.

In other words:  
I would recommend to use the disk only up to the minimum  
of the various slightly different available disk space values  
of the various disks of "basically same" size that you have.

Reason:  
This way - provided you use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code
- you  
could re-create your system on each of your disks of "basically same"
size with  
byte-by-byte identical partitioning - provided you specify the right
vaules for  
AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTORESIZE\_EXCLUDE\_PARTITIONS  
AUTOSHRINK\_DISK\_SIZE\_LIMIT\_PERCENTAGE  
AUTOINCREASE\_DISK\_SIZE\_THRESHOLD\_PERCENTAGE  
as appropriate for your particular set of disks of "basically same"
size.

Right now I made RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL hopefully easier to use via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/803db236edd4f081bfd580b6177579e43752544a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/803db236edd4f081bfd580b6177579e43752544a)

The idea is that one can no longer specify it only in
etc/rear/local.conf  
(where one may have to manually edit that file in the recovery
system).  
Now it should also work to individually specify it as needed via
something like

<pre>
export RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://my_internal_server/host123_rear_config.tgz"
</pre>

directly before one calls "rear recover", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1595\#issuecomment-354804481](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1595#issuecomment-354804481)

A precondition for specifying it this way is that it is not also
specified  
in etc/rear/local.conf because that would overwrite the `export`
setting.

Because there are no further comments  
I assume this isssue is sufficiently answered  
so that I can close it hereby.
