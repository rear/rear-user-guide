Attempting a ReaR recover from a host with multiple NIC interfaces. By
default, ReaR starts up eth0 with a dhcp address. Eth1 is required in
order to reach the NFS server holding the restore tarfile. I can
manually configure eth1 using ifconfig, by choosing the option to exit
out to the shell during the ReaR recovery, which then allows the restore
to complete successfully. How can I define the necessary NICs and
associated IP's within my local.conf, such that ReaR will startup the
interfaces automatically? Thanks

I suppose this would be one place to handle this situation, by defining
the necessary ifconfig command within the PRE\_RECOVER\_SCRIPT variable
below:

call this before Relax-and-Recover starts to do anything in the recover workflow. You have the rescue system but nothing else

PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT=

what was the content of
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh`?

Ah...I see now what is happening within the 60-network-devices.sh. My
primary NIC, (eth0), for the boxes I'm testing on use DHCP. However, my
eth1 devices are static, and are part of my "storage" network, (NFS). My
eth1 device doesn't get setup when attempting a rear recover, even
though it is actually defined within the bottom of the
60-network-devices.sh script, because the script exits based on this
logic at the top:

if USE\_DHCLIENT=y then use DHCP instead and skip 60-network-devices.sh
=======================================================================

\[\[ ! -z "$USE\_DHCLIENT" \]\] && return

Even though this causes me to manually ifconfig my interface upon doing
a rear restore, I think this is OK. In a real production-like
environment, servers won't be using DHCP for their primary interface,
and the additional NICs will get properly defined within the
60-network-devices.sh script.

Thanks much for your help.
