Hi

Would someone please help me with restoring a backup. I am in a bit of a
pickle and any help would be greatly appreciated.

I created the backup unsung rear -v mkbackup to a and edited the .conf
as below to an internal hard drive. We now require to restore the
backup. I have copied all the files to a USB and would like to restore
it to a Virtual Machine while we rebuild the real server.

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///directory/

How to I tell REAR on the new server (VM) to look at the files on the
USB drive and restore them?

Thank You  
Richard

what was the content of the original `/etc/rear/local.conf`? Why the
need to move to an USB disk? Rear supports P2V recover.

Hi Gratien

I did not expect a reply from you. I watched your presentation on you
tube at the Linux Tag 2012 when you presented Linux Disaster Recovery
Best Practices: Relax and Recover. Your presentation was the reason I
decided to use REAR.

The original configuration is below (ignore the full stops). I moved the
files to a USB to transfer to our VM Server. I don't know about P2V
recover. It would be great to know what it is and if it might be able to
help in our situation.

    # Sample local configuration 

    # Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
    # OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///media/Backup

Thank you  
Richard...

If the target system is not too much different then the original one you
might be lucky when you mount the USB device as /media before you start
the recover (make sure the path is the same, or adapt it in the
local.conf file).

Hi Gratien

It can be closed. Thank you for your help.

In the end we moved to VMWare for our DR requirements.
