===================================================================================

when `cfg2html` is installed (latest git version - base 6.0) we see in
logging:

    2013-10-04 15:19:03 Including rescue/GNU/Linux/95_cfg2html.sh
    2013-10-04 15:19:03 Collecting general system information (cfg2html)
    mkdir: created directory `/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html'

but no output is generated into this directory. Digger some deeper into
the code:

    ./rescue/GNU/Linux/95_cfg2html.sh:cfg2html -px -o $VAR_DIR/recovery/cfg2html >&8

Ok - the option `-x` doesn't exist anymore.
