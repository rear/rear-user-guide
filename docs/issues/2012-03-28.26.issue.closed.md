Bug reported on SourceForge by Dan Miller as
SF\#[3298288](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3298288&group_id=171835&atid=859452)

Original report
---------------

This appears to be a strange issue with the dos "Carriage Return"
appended to the device names of the hard drive partitions when the
scripts run the mkfs.ext3 on the disk drive partitions. The script will
fail if I run via `rear recover` but if I run them with
`rear -S recover` and step through the scripts everything works. The
script I believe is in question is
*/usr/share/rear/GNU/Linux/31\_create\_filesystems.sh* but I am not 100%
sure since it works when run in "step" mode. The logs show

Sorry for being a newbee with this bug submission. To finish the bug
report if you look at the attached log file (In Linux/Unix) you will see
a ^M appended to the device name in the log on line 81. Additional
digging showed the device name listed as /dev/sda2/^M. If I run the
scripts in the step mode I do not see the ^M anywhere and everythiing
completes successfully. I downloaded this file in a gz format and
unpacked it/installed it on the Linux system. I ran the install script
to install the package.

Did you already found a solution for the "CR"-Problem? I have the same
issue here on one Red Hat Server. On all others the backup and recovery
works.

And it is the same way as you described it. When I use the step mode
everything works fine. But when I use the normal mode with enabled
debugging (-D / -d) I also get the ^M in the log file - the same pattern
as you submitted.

Reto, I still don't have a solution to this issue other than using the  
"Step" mode. This works every time but it would be nice to have a more  
automated approach.

It's a pity.

I was investigating the problem these days and figured out, that the
problem exists on more than one system.

Here some further thoughts concering the problem:

> The strange phenomen is, that the problematic systems all have an own
> partition mounted to /tmp. The servers on which the process works
> don't have such a tmp partition. This is currently the one and only
> difference on the servers.  
> It's really curious. The partitioning process works fine I think,
> because after the error I checked the partitions with fdisk and they
> got created. Due to this I think the problem occurs during the mkfs
> process...  
> Is it possible, that the problem is already on the running system
> where I create the ISO?

Hope anybody knows a way to solve the problem :-).

cheers

you were using rear-1.10.0. Is it possible to download the latest
snapshot version (0.0.669) and give it another try?
