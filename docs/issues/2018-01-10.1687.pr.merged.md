Avamar agent has to be started via "systemctl start avagent" to function
properly, otherwise the Avamar server does not recognize the client
correctly and cannot restore with the function "Restore everything to a
different location" (which is needed to restore to /mnt/local). This
pull request includes the necessary patches, so that the necessary
scripts are included into the ReaR image.

@kai7p As you are the only one knowing how it works we accept your PR as
it is. As before, if something needs to be corrected prepare a new PR.
Thanks.
