-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

rear mkbackuponly

Command included the contents of the directories  
which are listed in "EXCLUDE\_BACKUP" into tarball.  
Consequently, the could NOT be found in "backup\_excluded.log".  
I exspected them to be excluded, which was not the case.

As far as I could find out, "EXCLUDE\_BACKUP" will only be used  
in "./layout/save/default/340\_generate\_mointpoint\_device.sh"  
and for other purposes as exspected.

-   Workaround, if any:

Use "BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE+=( ... ) instead.

I would like to suggest to modify the explanation given  
in "./conf/default.conf" (lines 2677 + 8) for proper usage  
of "EXCLUDE\_BACKUP" or the behavior of that array if used  
to comply with the description given.

Only FYI:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2772](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2772)  
is a related issue

EXCLUDE\_BACKUP is used only in  
layout/save/default/340\_generate\_mountpoint\_device.sh  
but that script creates the file  
$VAR\_DIR/recovery/mountpoint\_device  
(i.e. var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device)  
where things that match EXCLUDE\_BACKUP are not added  
to var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device

Then var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device is used in  
backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
to backup those filesystems that are listed in  
var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device

So as far as I currently understand the code  
things in EXCLUDE\_BACKUP are not enforced  
to be excluded from the backup  
instead things in EXCLUDE\_BACKUP are only skipped  
to be automatically included in the backup.

As far as I see that code parts originated from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1e233be635e047ac5d2777407e3601a713d8fefa](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1e233be635e047ac5d2777407e3601a713d8fefa)

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/341435c25cfb0072084fcd524519825dfe239e03](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/341435c25cfb0072084fcd524519825dfe239e03)  
I fixed right now the false and misleading comment in  
layout/save/default/340\_generate\_mountpoint\_device.sh  
from

    # Generate the list of mountpoints and devices to exclude from backup

to

    # Generate the list of mountpoints and devices to include in the backup
    # via backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh
    # except those where the mountpoint is in excluded_mountpoints:

Later - provided it is possible for me to understand  
what that code actually does with reasonable effort -  
I will document what EXCLUDE\_BACKUP actually does and  
what kind of values EXCLUDE\_BACKUP actually needs  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
