we are using rear + bareos in our data center.  
executing a test recovery revealed that bareos was requesting
/var/run/bareos as a system's directory to exist. We've added it to the
skel and it works now. We like to share this improvement.

@dl5rcw  
what Bareos version do you use?  
I am not a Bareos user but I think ReaR has worked with  
some older Bareos versions without the /var/run/bareos  
directory in the ReaR recovery system.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1148/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1148/files)  
you added not only a  
usr/share/rear/skel/BAREOS/var/run/bareos  
directory but a  
usr/share/rear/skel/BAREOS/var/run/bareos/.gitignore  
file.  
I assume it also works this way but I think  
this is not exactly what you intended.

I am using Bareos obelix-dir 16.2.2 (01May16) compiled from source on
all machines.  
Adding an empty directory to git repo failed. I inserted the .gitignore
file alike the empty directory
`https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/skel/BAREOS/etc/bareos`

@dl5rcw Indeed empty directories do require a `.gitignore` file to be
accepted by git. OK for me to accept.

I even found the explanation about empty directories and git at  
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-can-i-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-can-i-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository)

@gdha  
I see ReaR mostly has empty directories  
with a .gitignore file that contains

<pre>
*
!.gitignore
</pre>

which guarantees that the directory remains empty because  
this way git ignores all files except the .gitignore file  
but  
those .gitignore files are empty  
usr/share/rear/skel/NBU/usr/openv/var/vnetd/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/NSR/usr/lib/nsr/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/run/lvm/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/run/resolvconf/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/run/systemd/journal/syslog/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/run/udev/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/include/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/udev/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/lib/nfs/statd/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/lock/lockdev/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/lock/lvm/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run/systemd/generator/.gitignore  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run/systemd/journal/.gitignore

Should I fix the empty .gitignore files?  
(The directories where they are are empty.)

OK - it won't hurt ReaR ;-)
