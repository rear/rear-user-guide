#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git (9
    oct 2017)
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): ubuntu 16.04
    / redhat 7.3
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS PowerPC
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    On RedHat or ubuntu, cannot connect to the rescue system with ssh
    (sshd is not running on the rescue system after boot).  
    When trying to start it up manually (via console) I got the
    following message

<!-- -->

      (RedHat) Missing privilege separation: /var/empty/sshd/etc
      (Ubuntu) Missing privilege separation: /var/run/sshd

Suse seems to not being affected.  
May be a bug coming from the recent changes around ssh. (\#1513, \#1512)

-   Work-around, if any  
    create the missing directory requested and restart sshd with
    `/bin/sshd -D` in rescue mode

Thanks for reporting this. I already suspected that \#1513 was not yet
done but unfortunately I will only be able to work on this tomorrow or
Sunday.

For information, on the original system, /var/empty/sshd is chmod 711
(for RedHat)

    (RedHat) drwx--x--x. 2 root root 6 May 22 15:44 /var/empty/sshd/

@schabrolles  
many thanks for your careful testing!  
I will have a look.

I also think SUSE seems to not being affected  
because for my use case it still "just works"  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513)
merged.

FYI:  
Currently I am working on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512)

@schabrolles  
I need more precise information which exact directory  
or directories are missing in the recovery system.

On my SLES12 system I have only

<pre>
# find /var | grep sshd
/var/lib/systemd/migrated/sshd
/var/lib/sshd
</pre>

@jsmeix As I said previously

      (RedHat) Missing privilege separation: /var/empty/sshd/etc
      (Ubuntu) Missing privilege separation: /var/run/sshd

If I create the missing dir (chmod 711 for /var/empty/sshd/etc rhel), I
can run `/bin/sshd -D` without error and connect to the rescue system
via ssh

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530)
I added  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530/commits/3958aa4adc6bbe297155d358f95e7bcdae0b3fc8](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1530/commits/3958aa4adc6bbe297155d358f95e7bcdae0b3fc8)  
so that I get now in the recovery system:

<pre>
# find /tmp/rear.Abflj1IRPkWj2FD/rootfs/var -ls | grep 'sshd'
141315    4 drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root         4096 Oct 10 16:38 /tmp/rear.Abflj1IRPkWj2FD/rootfs/var/empty/sshd
141316    4 drwx--x--x   2 root     root         4096 Oct 10 16:38 /tmp/rear.Abflj1IRPkWj2FD/rootfs/var/empty/sshd/etc
141317    4 drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         4096 Oct 10 16:38 /tmp/rear.Abflj1IRPkWj2FD/rootfs/var/run/sshd
</pre>

I have neither of them on SLES12 and my current code  
creates them if not exists, see my comments in the code.  
For me recovery with SLES12 still works.

Ok, I restart non-regression test on POWER and keep you informed

@jsmeix,

I tested
[http://github.com/jsmaix/rear](http://github.com/jsmaix/rear)  
branch :
empower\_the\_user\_to\_specify\_what\_ssh\_files\_get\_included\_in\_his\_recovery\_system\_issue1512

It is working now.

Thanks

@schabrolles  
many thanks for testing and confirmation.

Later I will try to find out what the root cause is  
because some missing stuff in the recovery system  
could indicate we have a bigger problem somewhere  
(much more stuff could be accidentally missing).

As far as I tried to find out what the root cause is  
it is not coming from the recent changes around ssh.

I created on my SLES12 test system the directories  
/var/empty/sshd/etc and /var/run/sshd

I went back to the ReaR 2.2 release, i.e. I did a

<pre>
git checkout fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e
</pre>

back to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e)  
and did a "rear mkrescue"  
and further back to ReaR 2.1 via

<pre>
git checkout fd4336609da10388a9de0c0bc927d9b3f72e2fae
</pre>

back to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd4336609da10388a9de0c0bc927d9b3f72e2fae](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd4336609da10388a9de0c0bc927d9b3f72e2fae)  
and did a "rear mkrescue"  
but in neither of them I got /var/empty/sshd/etc  
or /var/run/sshd in the recovery system.

I cannot find in those older git checkouts  
in the code 'empty' together with 'sshd'  
or 'run' together with 'sshd'.

Currently I have no idea how that ever had worked.

@jsmeix I should make the test with previous ReaR version on a RHEL
(where I got the issue).  
Iâ€™ll do that when I will be back to the office and let you know.

With

merged  
I think this issue is sufficiently fixed.
