-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Installing extlinux should also be working  
for a mounted vfat boot partition see  
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/syslinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/syslinux)  
which reads (excerpt):

    For FAT, ext2/3/4, or btrfs boot partition use extlinux,
    where the device has been mounted:

    # extlinux --install /boot/syslinux

    Alternatively, for a FAT boot partition use syslinux,
    where the device is unmounted

@rear/contributors  
tomorrow is public holiday in Germany (at least in Bavaria)  
so I will keep it open for further review next week and  
I would like to merge it next Tuesday (10. Jan.) afternoon  
provided there are no objections until then.
