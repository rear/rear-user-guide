-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

sp-i is a Cisco UCS server with RHEL7.  
I did a backup with ReaR which seems successful.  
Then I did an upgrade to RHEL8, which is a bit complicated with Redhat,
but it worked. The server bootet successfully RHEL8.  
(1 week pause)  
To reproduce and test the upgrade process I wanted to go back to RHEL7.
For this I booted the ReaR Rescue CD (rear-sp-i.iso) and selected
"recover", which seems successfully, too. But after rebooting the
recovered RHEL7 system it was not able to remount the / filesystem from
ro to rw state:

[https://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/fop/NtoxIEXY/X-20240404231512.jpg](https://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/fop/NtoxIEXY/X-20240404231512.jpg)

I looked in the NFS rear directory and found:

    -RW-     15,938,002 2024-03-25 14:07 backup.log
    -RW-  4,321,746,328 2024-03-25 14:06 backup.tar.gz

rear-sp-i.iso is much younger than backup! And it was created at 1:30, a
time where I am not working!  
My assumption: Some unknown (cron?) job has recreated rear-sp-i.iso with
RHEL8 and its newer xfs is incompatible with RHEL7 xfs.

Any idea what I can do in this situation?

I have second server (sp-j) with identical configuration, still running
with RHEL7  
Shall I run ReaR there and use this rear-sp-j.iso?

attempting to restore a RHEL7 system with an recovery iso that contains
already an RHEL8 system will not work and is not supported. REAR itself
does not setup any cronjobs, you should clarify how the recovery iso was
created after update to RHEL8. I dont see how REAR is at fault here.

One possible "dirty" solution would be:

1.  create bootable Recovery iso image on the identical left over RHEL7
    system
2.  boot iso, extract the REAR disk layout config from the overwritten
    ISO Image based on RHEL8 and copy it to the running instance
3.  run recovery

It should then re-create disk partitions based on the information from
the original system using the tools compatible to the RHEL7 backup.

@Framsfex  
perhaps you also have an old cron job  
as a leftover from ReaR 2.4 or before?

That's it!  
We have the same time stamp of the new created ISO image!  
This is what I have already assumed.  
Too bad, our Redhat installation now is broken, we have had to reinstall
it.

We have installed ReaR 2.4 from the RHEL 7.9 repo and then made the  
upgrade to RHEL 8.3 (where the hidden cronjob run) which we tried to  
recover with ReaR back to RHEL7  
I do not know which ReaR version comes with RHEL 8.3

Hi @Framsfex sorry to hear that. In RHEL 8.3 there is also ReaR 2.4, but
the iso made on a different system may be incompatible.

I think this may work, if the disk layout is identical (therefore you
don't need to worry about copying the disklayout from the original
server). But there may be some issues when bringing up the network. The
rescue system will ask you to map MAC addresses of the second system to
the MAC addresses of the first system, and then use the IP addresses of
the second server (unless your IP addresses are configured by DHCP).

In RHEL 9 we deleted the cron job btw, thus users won't face this
problem anymore.

@pcahyna  
I don't know how ReaR's cron file was installed by Red Hat's RPM  
but when Red Hat did it as we had in packaging/rpm/rear.spec via

    %config(noreplace) %{_sysconfdir}/cron.d/rear

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/89a8f18ec402b439caf4800421644f5bf5d174e5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/89a8f18ec402b439caf4800421644f5bf5d174e5)  
then according to the table in  
[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jw35/docs/rpm\_config.html](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jw35/docs/rpm_config.html)

    The following table shows what we ended up with
    after installing an RPM,
    optionally editing the resulting files,
    and then upgrading the RPM.

    File marked as     | Changed in  | On-disk file     | On-disk file
                       | update RPM? | untouched        | edited
    ...
                       | No          | File from update | Edited file
    %config(noreplace) |             |
                       | Yes         | File from update | Edited file,
                       |             |                  | file from the
                       |             |                  | update in .rpmnew

there might be the cron file left even when an RPM package update  
does no longer contain that cron file?  
The case when a config file is no longer provided by an  
RPM package update is not described there so I don't know  
what actually happens in this case.  
I only liked to note that the RPM package update might not  
have removed the unwanted cron file.

Perhaps, we should add a %post action to remove the (old) cron entry in
the spec file?

@Framsfex Did you succeed in the recovery with the similar RHEL 7 ISO

Unfortunately, in RHEL 8 this file is still considered wanted (it is
shipped in the package), so this reasoning does not apply here (the
problem was related to a RHEL 7 -&gt; RHEL 8 upgrade) and no way of
removing obsolete config files would have helped the user here. I will
check how does newer RHEL and Fedora (where the file is not wanted
anymore) behave in this respect.

We used a dd image from a second server (identical hardware) and did
not  
try it with ReaR again,.
