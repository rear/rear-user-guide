Replace '/tmp/rear.XXX...' by '/var/tmp/rear.XXX...' in comments:

Current master code:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -i 'tmp/rear\.' | grep -v '/var/tmp/rear\.'

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:
    # Furthermore BUILD_DIR (i.e. usually /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX cf. TMPDIR above) and

    usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh:
        # Each restore_input is a path like '/tmp/rear.XXXX/outputfs/f121/backup.tar.gz':

    usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500_compare_layout.sh:
    # and TEMP_LAYOUT is of the form /tmp/rear.XXXX/tmp/checklayout.conf

    usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh:
                # e.g. when /sbin/lvcreate should be copied to /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/bin/lvcreate

    # but there is already the dangling symlink /tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/bin/lvcreate -> lvm

    # cp: not writing through dangling symlink '/tmp/rear.XXX/rootfs/bin/lvcreate'

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh:
    # /dev/sdb1 /tmp/rear.gfYZXbLIa2Xjult/outputfs ext2 rw,noatime 0 0

    usr/share/rear/output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh:
        #   cp: will not overwrite just-created '/tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/f121/rear-f121.log' with '/tmp/rear.XXX/tmp/rear-f121.log'

    usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/700_create_efibootimg.sh:
    # "cp: error writing '/tmp/rear.XXX/tmp/efi_virt/./EFI/BOOT/...': No space left on device"

@rear/contributors  
This are only changes in comments.  
So it should be safe to "just merge" it.  
Nevertheless one approval would be nice.  
Otherwise - provided there are no objections - I would  
merge it tomorrow afternoon.
