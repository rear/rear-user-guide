Short
=====

When I run through the quickstart, I create the rescue disk and boot a
server i want to backup. In rescue mode, when I try to backup a system,
I get the error:

Could not find "isolinux.bin". Maybe you have to set
ISO\_ISOLINUX\_BIN....

Long
====

1.  I installed rear at debian 8 (At first 1.17.2 from git, then the deb
    package with same version, after that rear 1.16.1 as deb package,
    all the same outcome)
2.  I formatted an usb stick with `rear -v format /dev/sdb`
3.  I set up my local.conf(see below)
4.  I create my rescue stick `rear -v mkrescue`
5.  I booted rear ( using another hardware than the machine, where I
    created the stick )
6.  I pressed `ctrl + c` when dhclient was waiting (I have no
    dhcp-server here)
7.  I configured my network card manually with ifconfig and tested
    NFS-Connectivity
8.  I executed `rear  -v mkbackuponly` (and mkbackup too)
9.  This error was shown:
    `"Could not find 'isolinux.bin'. Maybe you have to set ISO_ISOLINUX_BIN [$ISO_ISOLINUX_BIN] or install the syslinux package ?"`
    And other errors, after I commented out this check (mbr.bin, ... all
    of the stuff in /usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386). After I
    disabled all the checks in the mentioned directory, no backup data
    files were created at all, when I looked at my NFS Share

local.conf

@megabert did you install extlinux - that is what you need to boot from
an USB device?

You should run `rear mkbackup` instead of `rear mkrescue`. From within
the rescue system you can only run `rear recover`.

And yes, It can be that ATM you need to install the package that
provides isolinux.bin. We will fix this in the next release, IIRC.

Yes.

Ok. Seems I haven't got the full picture. I thought, i create a stick,
and then I can walk to my servers and then boot & backup.

But wait. Backing up online is way cooler than I thought! :)

Thanks.

If that is the case, maybe rename the issue to rear "prevent
incompatible workflows in rescue mode"

<s>A bit of hijack perhaps, but can `rear recover` be executed
automatically on boot?</s>

Thank you.

Yes, hijack. See \#686 for details:

    ISO_DEFAULT=manual

And a pull request to the man page / web site is most welcome :-)

@schlomo `ISO_DEFAULT` is already described in the man page.
