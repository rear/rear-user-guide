Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1549](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1549)  
mkrescue/mkbackuponly errors out with BACKUP\_URL=iso  
because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1547](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1547)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1548](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1548)  
but  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1596\#issuecomment-347955896](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1596#issuecomment-347955896)  
indicates that there are (special) use cases for  
mkrescue/mkbackuponly with BACKUP\_URL=iso  
so that the hardcoded Error should be replaced with  
a UserInput dialog that errors out by default to be on the safe side  
but the user can actively intervene to run mkrescue/mkbackuponly  
even with BACKUP\_URL=iso when he really wants that.

This follows my general principle that the user must  
always have ready-made means of final power to decide  
and enforce what ReaR should do and then ReaR must obey.

I consider missing ready-made means of final power  
as "minor bug" and adding them as "enhancement".

By the way:  
I do not consider "just change the (open source) code"  
as a ready-made mean of final power for the user.

I will "just merge"
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1614](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1614)  
unless there are immediate furious objections against  
providing ready to use final power to our users ;-)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1614](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1614)
merged  
I consider this issue to be fixed.

@N3WWN  
to provide an automated response run ReaR in debug mode '-d'  
so that the UserInput function shows its ID like

<pre>
UserInput -I BACKUP_URL_ISO_PROCEED_MKRESCUE needed ...
</pre>

Then you can specify a predefined input for that particular  
UserInput call e.g. via

<pre>
# export USER_INPUT_BACKUP_URL_ISO_PROCEED_MKRESCUE=Yes
</pre>

or specify that in your local.conf (no 'export' needed there).  
For details see the USER\_INPUT\_ variables in default.conf

Thanks @jsmeix !

@N3WWN  
could you describe your particular use case for  
mkrescue/mkbackuponly with BACKUP\_URL=iso  
because I still have no idea why that could be useful  
and/or how that could actually work.
