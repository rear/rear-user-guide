@fabz5  
what is the output of the command

    lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

on your original system?

In your particular case you have /dev/mmcblk0boot0  
and that special kind of device node name  
can currently not be handled properly by ReaR.

My current analysis:

In your case it fails in
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
therein when it calls the get\_partition\_number() function as

    get_partition_number mmcblk0boot0

The get\_partition\_number() function calls in your particular case

    echo "mmcblk0boot0" | grep -o -E "[0-9]+$"

to get the partition number which results in your case the trailing
`0`  
but `0` is not a normally valid partition number, see the
get\_partition\_number  
function code in usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh  
for what kind of device node names it can deal with:

    # Function returns partition number of partition block device name
    #
    # This function should support:
    #   /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000p1
    #   /dev/mapper/36001438005deb05d0000e00005c40000_part1
    #   /dev/sda1
    #   /dev/cciss/c0d0p1
    #
    # Requires: grep v2.5 or higher (option -o)

    get_partition_number() {
        local partition=$1
        local number=$(echo "$partition" | grep -o -E "[0-9]+$")

        # Test if $number is a positive integer, if not it is a bug
        [ $number -gt 0 ] 2>/dev/null
        StopIfError "Partition number '$number' of partition $partition is not a valid number."

        # Catch if $number is too big, report it as a bug
        (( $number <= 128 ))
        StopIfError "Partition $partition is numbered '$number'. More than 128 partitions is not supported."

        echo $number
    }

This are the excerpts from your

Anyhow, calling

@fabz5  
I detected the totally different issuse  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2088](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2088)  
when I noticed in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087\#issue-421604286](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087#issue-421604286)

    ERROR: Partition mmcblk0rpmb is numbered ''. More than 128 partitions is not supported.
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-testvm02.log for details

the triple `ERROR:`messages which is plain wrong.  
It should cleanly abort at the first error.

Because I cannot reproduce such a multiple `ERROR:`message  
I would like if you coud try out if my proposed fix in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2088](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2088)  
helps in your case.

To do that edit in your usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
the Error function:  
Insert a `sleep 1` at its very end so that it becomes this

    function Error () {

        ...

        kill -USR1 $MASTER_PID
        sleep 1
    }

Then re-run `rear -Dv mkbackup` and now it should error out with

    ERROR: Partition number '0' of partition mmcblk0boot0 is not a valid number.
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-testvm02.log for details

I edited the Error function as advised, but to no avail. The 3 error
messages remain. To make sure everything goes as expected I also a added
another line:

         ...
         kill -USR1 $MASTER_PID
         LogPrintError "sleeping for 1 second"
         sleep 1
    }

which results in:

@fabz5  
thank you so much for your prompt  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087\#issuecomment-473884096](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087#issuecomment-473884096)  
I think that shows there is another bug in ReaR  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2089](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2089)

Regarding this issue here, i.e. regarding mmcblk/eMMC disks:

I myself never had nor do I have any mmcblk/eMMC disk device  
so that I cannot reproduce issues with it or actually help in this area.

Perhaps you could enhance ReaR to support mmcblk/eMMC disks  
as far as you need it for your particular use case?

@fabz5  
I look forward to your GitHub pull request.

Regardless that I do not have any mmcblk/eMMC disk device  
I could help you - to some extent - with general coding stuff in ReaR.  
To avoid that you do much coding work on your own and then  
we will tell you about a lot of things that you should have done
differently  
I would recommend that you do a GitHub pull request as soon as
possible  
for you (i.e. when you have some very first step that works a bit for
you)  
so that we can check early if changes are needed.

In general:

Submit early and submit often, cf. Wikipedia:Release early, release
often  
[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release\_early,\_release\_often](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often)  
Do not mix up several independent separated issues in one big
all-in-one  
GitHub pull request because a pull request cannot be partially
accepted.  
On the other hand do not split several changes that belong to each
other  
into several pull requests.

See "Contributing" at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)

See in particular  
"Keeping your forked repo synced with the upstream source" at  
[https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/](https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/)

The images therein might be a bit outdated but the general information

@fabz5  
is this issue soved for you since your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091)

I.e. does now run "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" run for you without an
error  
or are there more adaptions and enhancements needed in ReaR  
to get mmcblk/eMMC disk devices supported in general  
or at least for your particular use case?

@fabz5  
how you could try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
where
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091)
is merged:

Basically "git clone" our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
into a separated directory and then configure and run ReaR  
from within that directory like:

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

    # mv rear rear.github.master

    # cd rear.github.master

    # vi etc/rear/local.conf

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

The issue is solved, at least concerning mkbackup. Thus it can be
closed.  
However there is still trouble with the restore in ReaR 2.4 (efibootmgr
is called with a wrong disk name). I will try out the current ReaR
master to see if this issue persists (from looking at the code, I guess
so). If I am right, I will open another issue.

Thanks a lot! :-)

@fabz5  
I have a question about what a "eMMC" device actually is.

From your 'lsblk' output in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087\#issuecomment-473851770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2087#issuecomment-473851770)  
and your description in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091\#issue-262630887](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091#issue-262630887)  
I assume that at least your "eMMC" device is not one single disk  
but actually your "eMMC" device consists of four `disk` type block
devices:

    NAME               KNAME             PKNAME TRAN TYPE FSTYPE  SIZE 
    /dev/mmcblk0       /dev/mmcblk0                  disk        58.2G 
    /dev/mmcblk0boot0  /dev/mmcblk0boot0             disk           4M 
    /dev/mmcblk0boot1  /dev/mmcblk0boot1             disk           4M 
    /dev/mmcblk0rpmb   /dev/mmcblk0rpmb              disk           4M 

where only the `/dev/mmcblk0` disk is what is of interest for ReaR.

Is my assumtion true?

If yes, it seems what is missing in ReaR is a generic method  
where the user can explicitly specify to exclude unwanted  
whole disks during "rear mkrescue".

It seems currently there is only a generic method in ReaR  
how to exclude unwanted components during "rear recover",  
see the section "Including/Excluding components" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

FYI:  
Because of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1771](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1771)  
it is currently not possible to exclude less than a whole disk  
(e.g. only certain partitions or filesystems on a disk).

Your assumption is true. However please note, that the "eMMC" is not
only recognised as four block devices, but that also the special
partitions "mmcblk0boot0/1, mmcblk0rpmb" are recognised as partitions ON
/dev/mmcblk0. They have the same names as the three additional disk type
block devices. In this particular case the exclusion of the three
special disk devices would not have been sufficient (they were already
excluded anyhow by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1682](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1682)).

In general however the possibility to exclude entire disks from
mkrescue/mkbackup would be great.

@fabz5  
thank you so much for your explanation.

As far as I understand it now there are not two different kind  
of `mmcblk*boot*` and `mmcblk*rpmb` thingies - the only ones  
that exist are the `disk` type block devices

    NAME               KNAME             PKNAME TRAN TYPE FSTYPE  SIZE 
    /dev/mmcblk0boot0  /dev/mmcblk0boot0             disk           4M 
    /dev/mmcblk0boot1  /dev/mmcblk0boot1             disk           4M 
    /dev/mmcblk0rpmb   /dev/mmcblk0rpmb              disk           4M 

but what ReaR wrongly did before
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2091)  
is that it recognized those `disk` type block devices  
as if they were `part` type block devices below PKNAME /dev/mmcblk0  
i.e. as if the `lsblk` output would have been something like

    NAME                 KNAME               PKNAME       TYPE   SIZE 
    /dev/mmcblk0         /dev/mmcblk0                     disk  58.2G 
    |-/dev/mmcblk0boot0  /dev/mmcblk0boot0  /dev/mmcblk0  part     4M 
    |-/dev/mmcblk0boot1  /dev/mmcblk0boot1  /dev/mmcblk0  part     4M 
     -/dev/mmcblk0rpmb   /dev/mmcblk0rpmb   /dev/mmcblk0  part     4M 

The reason is that currently ReaR does not use the `lsblk` output  
but determines the disk devices layout by more traditional methods  
so that it could be another cleanup/enhancement to let ReaR  
use the `lsblk` output to determine the storage devices layout,  
cf.

You are right about the `disk`type block devices. Using `lsblk`seems
like a reasonable idea to determine disk device layout indeed.

I even think using `lsblk` to recreate the storage devices layout  
is a nowadays basically mandatory step forward because `lsblk`  
should provide the right dependencies of arbitrary complex layers  
of storage devices "out of the box", for an (artificial) example  
of a complex layout see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2023](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2023)
