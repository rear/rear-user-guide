I merge it because according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968\#issuecomment-240399489](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/968#issuecomment-240399489)  
there is no special reason why TMPDIR must be set empty  
in default.conf and without setting TMPDIR in default.conf  
everything works well for me, see
