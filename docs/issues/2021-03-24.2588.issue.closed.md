The `OUTPUT=USB` method originated from using a USB stick  
but actually it implements using any disk device  
(also an additional built-in disk like nowadays a SSD).

In particular things like

    # rear format /dev/sda
    USB device /dev/sda is not formatted with ext2/3/4 or btrfs filesystem
    Type exactly 'Yes' to format /dev/sda with ext3 filesystem
    ...

where `/dev/sda` is not a USB disk but the system disk are plain wrong  
when ReaR shows it as if `/dev/sda` was a `USB device`, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2587\#issuecomment-805199097](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2587#issuecomment-805199097)

So I would like to replace wording like "USB device" or "USB disk" or
similar  
by generic wording.

@rear/contributors  
do you agree that I replace wording like "USB device" or "USB disk" or
similar  
by generic wording?

@jsmeix I agree with you to make the wording more generic.

I like it, especially because I am currently working on `OUTPUT=USB`
support on S/390, where the disks certainly are not USB :-)

@pcahyna  
I had already so much "fun" with the various special ways of the `USB`
method  
that my wishful thinking is to implement a new separated clean and
simple `DISK` method  
which behaves fully compatible (as far as possible) with other methods
in ReaR  
cf. `USB_SUFFIX` in default.conf (see the GitHub issues therein).

So if the `USB` method leads to too many special case difficulties on
IBM Z / s390  
and you wish to "implement things right from scratch" I would help you
as good as I can  
(obviously we at SUSE also would like to have proper IBM Z / s390
support in ReaR).

Currently `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` and `OUTPUT=USB` compete somewhat in ReaR.  
As far as I noticed `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` works better to boot on UEFI  
while `OUTPUT=USB` supports to include the backup in the medium.  
So adding one more competitor `OUTPUT=DISK` could be just wrong.  
Perhaps improving `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` is better?

So far it has seemed to me that extending USB support to S/390 will not
be too difficult, but perhaps I have been optimistic only because I have
not investigated deep enough. (I admit I was not aware of `USB_SUFFIX`,
but this special handling does not seem to have any direct impact on
architecture-dependent boot support. Do you know any other quirks to be
aware of?)

I like the ability of including the backup in the medium.
`OUTPUT=RAWDISK` is attractive because it creates an image similar to an
ISO image, but precisely for that reason I am afraid it will not support
other desirable features of `OUTPUT=USB`, like multiple backups.

@pcahyna  
USB\_SUFFIX belongs only to the backup so it has no impact on
architecture-dependent boot support.  
Currently - off the top of my head - I don't remember other quirks to be
aware of  
but various `USB` special stuff had hit me too often so I fear other
things are  
lurking around - I will tell you when something re-appears in my mind -
shudder ;-)

Regarding including the backup in the medium:

We support to include the backup in the ISO via
BACKUP\_URL=iso:///backup  
which is yet another area of special quirks, see ISO\_MAX\_SIZE  
and ISO\_FILE\_SIZE\_LIMIT.

Because OUTPUT=RAWDISK uses the entire disk device to be overwritten  
(not only a partition) it is not possible to have multiple backups on
the disk  
that is used for OUTPUT=RAWDISK.

Thanks for the reply, I have hit that, for now
`rm -f /usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-s390/350_safeguard_error_out.sh`
solves it :-) (I will update that file eventually when everything else
is working.)

Yes. That's why I don't think any extended form of `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` will
be a sufficient 100% replacement for `OUTPUT=USB`.

That said (thinking aloud), why couldn't `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` create only a
partition image instead of the entire disk image? And another partition
could be used to store the actual backups.

I was also wondering if using only a partition instead of the whole disk
is possible  
but I am not at all a sufficient booting expert to understand the
details behind  
whether or not that is actually possible with a  
"make an image and then 'dd' that onto a disk"  
method.

In contrast with OUTPUT=USB ReaR uses only partitions  
(one can leave free space after the ReaR data partition for other
partitions)  
and ReaR installs the bootloader "as usual" on the (USB) disk.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2589](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2589)
merged  
the initially described issue here is fixed so I close it.

@pcahyna  
nevertheless feel free to add further comments here.
