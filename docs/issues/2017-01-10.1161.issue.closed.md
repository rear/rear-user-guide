-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.18 forward

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When "backup" folders exist, using "find" takes a long time.  
    Suggest this change at line 164 in
    output/USB/Linux-i386/30\[0\]\_create\_extlinux.sh:

<pre>
- for file in $(cd $BUILD_DIR/outputfs; find rear/*/* -name syslinux.cfg); do
+ for file in $(cd $BUILD_DIR/outputfs; ls -r rear/*/*/syslinux.cfg); do
</pre>

This is much quicker when the backup folders contain thousands of
files.  
It also accomplishes part of the TODO mentioned in the script.  
Thanks for all you do!

In general regarding using 'ls' versus 'find'  
when its argument contains a wildcard '\*' see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh)  
(excerpt)

<pre>
# Here things like 'find /path/to/dir -name '*.tar.gz' | sort' are used because
# one cannot use bash globbing via commands like 'ls /path/to/dir/*.tar.gz'
# because /usr/sbin/rear sets the nullglob bash option which leads to plain 'ls'
# when '/path/to/dir/*.tar.gz' matches nothing (i.e. when no backup file exists)
# so that then plain 'ls' would result nonsense.
</pre>

I.e. before calling

<pre>
ls -r rear/*/*/syslinux.cfg
</pre>

one would need to ensure that "rear/\*/\*/syslinux.cfg"  
does never evaluate to nothing - i.e. an additional test  
would be needed before calling "ls -r rear/\*/\*/syslinux.cfg".

Comparison how much time is actually saved  
(on my test system):  
with "find"

<pre>
real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.006s
sys     0m0.001s
</pre>

with "ls -r"

<pre>
real    0m0.018s
user    0m0.015s
sys     0m0.002s
</pre>

Surprise!  
With "ls -r" ist is actually much slower.

But even if it was faster with "ls -r"  
the whole stuff would be about saving  
at most a few thousandths of a second  
which is not worth any effort.

@lrirwin  
can you explain what you mean with  
"backup folders contain thousands of files"?

Yes -- each night these run:  
rear -v savelayout  
rear -vdD mkbackup  
That creates folders like:  
$BUILD\_DIR/outputfs/rear/$HOSTNAME/20170110.2215/backup  
The entire linux system is backed up into that folder.  
I've succeeded in being able to incorporate --link-dest into ReaR's  
rsync method, so there may be as many as 15 folders on any given
media.  
Each of them is a complete system backup, so there are thousands of  
entries in each backup folder.  
ls -r runs a lot faster than using find and it gives them in reverse  
order as well...

BTW - this is the --link-dest solution I came up with in /usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/50\_make\_backup.sh at line 90 where the rsync option is:
=======================================================================================================================================================

(rsync) \# make sure that the target is a directory mkdir -p $v "$backuparchive" &gt;&2 LINKDEST=`ls -d $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/rear/$HOSTNAME/*/backup/bin 2>/dev/null | tail -n 1 | cut -f1-8 -d"/"` case $LINKDEST in "") LINKDESTOPT="";; \*) LINKDESTOPT="--link-dest=$LINKDEST";; esac Log $BACKUP\_PROG $v "${BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS\[@\]}" --one-file-system --delete  --exclude-from=$TMP\_DIR/backup-exclude.txt --delete-excluded ${LINKDESTOPT}  $(cat $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt) "$backuparchive" $BACKUP\_PROG $v "${BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS\[@\]}" --one-file-system --delete  --exclude-from=$TMP\_DIR/backup-exclude.txt --delete-excluded ${LINKDESTOPT}  $(cat $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt) "$backuparchive" ;;

Saves a ton of space on backup media...

By guessing from your comments it seems  
you use rysnc as backup method and that results  
very many individual files while I use 'tar' so that  
I get only a few tar archives so that for me the  
whole difference is about a few millisecods.

I really helps to provide the information as requested in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
to aviod wasting time with guesswork.

Furthermore preferably provide your proposed changes  
as GitHub pull requests which also makes it easier for us  
to see what you actually like to change.

Finally see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so that over the time the ReaR code can get better step by step.
