Hi,  
backup creation failed in architecture aarch64 with error:  
*ERROR: Cannot setup GRUB\_RESCUE: Cannot read kernel file ''.*

It looks that problem is that aarch64 does not have grub2. It has only
grubby. Is there some way how to create a backup on this architecture?

    # arch
    aarch64

    # rpm -q rear
    rear-2.00-1.el7.aarch64

    # cat /etc/rear/local.conf 
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://$NFSSERVER/mnt/rear/
    GRUB_RESCUE=1

    # rear -v mkbackup
