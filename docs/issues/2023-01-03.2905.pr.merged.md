not tested by me but see

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

grub-install defaults to --target x86\_64-efi  
if the system is booted with EFI  
so one cannot install a legacy-bios (or 32bit) grub  
without setting the --target parameter

@rear/contributors  
tomorrow is public holiday in Germany (at least in Bavaria)  
so I will keep it open for further review next week.

I introduced a new USB\_GRUB2\_INSTALL\_OPTIONS variable  
to provide "final power to the user".  
This is not yet documented in default.conf  
so I can easily change things as needed because  
I like to wait for your (@rear/contributors) feedback  
whether or not it is OK as currently impemented.

This is not yet tested by me.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it as is  
with the new USB\_GRUB2\_INSTALL\_OPTIONS variable  
(intentionally not yet documented in default.conf)  
tomorrow afternoon unless there are objections.

So users could test it and we could see  
how far it works "out there" for users.

Depending on user feedback we can later  
document it as is in default.conf  
or do needed changes until ReaR 2.8 release  
which is not earlier than summer/autumn 2023 or later  
(unless critical fixes require an urgent release).

looks fine to me but sadly I do not have much time at the moment for
testing or patches
