Redirect stdout only if not in verbose mode to avoid  
possible regressions because of redirected STDOUT, see

I should have initially mentioned that intentionally  
STDOUT is not redirected in verbose mode  
to make "rear recover" behave as before  
(the recover workflow is always verbose)  
so that users won't get regressions during recovery  
(i.e. in case of emergency and time pressure).

But plain "rear mkbackup" has STDOUT redirected  
so that we can still get some user feedback how  
redirected STDOUT behaves.

I think that this is an interesting idea.

I postponed the redirection of STDOUT vor ReaR v 2.2 in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f47f705c0857e46b93c2ccc49b8ba504c05559eb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f47f705c0857e46b93c2ccc49b8ba504c05559eb)  
which obsoletes this pull request.
