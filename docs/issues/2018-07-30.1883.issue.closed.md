How do I find latest Rear version available from official SUSE

Is there a repository which I should add to get the Rear software?

Thank you.

@suseusr168  
for questions about what RPM software packages are officially available
from SUSE  
for SUSE Linux Enterprise products (like SLES-HA) you need to get in
contact  
with your official SUSE suppport or customer help contact because such
things  
may depend on what contract you have with SUSE.

Here at ReaR upstream we cannot answer such questions.

See in particular the related isssue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1506](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1506)

Our ReaR upstream RPM packages are available via the openSUSE build
service  
cf.
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
but the openSUSE build service is not an official repository for RPM
packages  
that are officially supported by SUSE for SUSE Linux Enterprise
products.

See also the section  
"RPM packages for disaster recovery" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
what rear\* RPM packages are available for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12.

@suseusr168  
our currently latest official SLEHA12 RPM package is `rear118a`  
which is - simply put - too old for the POWER architecture  
because since `rear118a` was made @schabrolles did tons of  
enhancements and fixes in particular for the POWER architecture  
so that one should use the current up-to-date ReaR on POWER.

@jsmeix,  
Thank you for your reply.

We have been using the version 2.1 which @schabrolles has provided to
us.  
We are trying to find out if there is a newer and officially supported
version from SUSE.

We don't know what command to use to find out what version of Rear is
available from SUSE.

When I run the command "zypper search rear" on our SMT server , it seems
to show the version we have installed.

Is there another repository name to use to check what version of Rear is
currently available to install from the SUSE repositories?

Thanks again.

@suseusr168  
the latest officially supported version from SUSE  
is in the `rear118a` RPM package for SLEHA12  
and in the `rear23a` RPM package for SLEHA15  
but in particular `rear118a` is nowadays in practice  
often too old for the POWER architecture.

The official `rear118a` RPM package should somewhat work on POWER  
but compared to what @schabrolles enhanced and fixed since that time  
the official `rear118a` RPM package behaves poor on POWER.

Accordingly it is good to use a newer ReaR version on POWER  
but nowadays even ReaR version 2.1 is meanwhile a bit old  
because the latest ReaR GitHub master code contains a few  
but possibly critical general fixes (not only on POWER and  
not only for SUSE) so that I would recommend to use our latest  
ReaR GitHub master code because that one should also become  
an official supported version via the updated `rear23a` RPM package  
from SUSE, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1506\#issuecomment-409153043](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1506#issuecomment-409153043)

Simply put I think you have to wait until the updated `rear23a` RPM
package  
became officially provided for SLEHA15 SLEHA12 and SLEHA11 to get  
an up-to-date ReaR version that is officially supported by SUSE.

I know basically noting about the SUSE Subscription Management Tool
(SMT)  
and its SMT server setup so that I cannot help you in this area.

@suseusr168  
if you like to try out my above mentioned updated `rear23a` RPM
package  
on your SLES12-SP3 PPC64LE system:

I let that package build right now on the public openSUSE build
service  
wherefrom you could download the current built RPM package  
`rear23a-2.3.a-1.1.ppc64le.rpm` (the RPM release number `1.1` varies)
from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/SLE\_12\_SP3/ppc64le/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/SLE_12_SP3/ppc64le/)

The openSUSE build service is not an official repository for RPM
packages  
that are officially supported by SUSE for SUSE Linux Enterprise
products  
so that in particular any RPM packages from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/)  
are not officially supported by SUSE, cf.  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:jsmeix](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:jsmeix)

But this way you could right now try out what is intended to become  
the officially provided one for SLEHA15 SLEHA12 and SLEHA11  
provided no serious issues appear with it.

And now my price for that service ;-)  
I would very much appreciate it if you try out and test and verify  
whether or not that updated `rear23a` RPM package actually works  
for you on your particular system in your particular environment  
and provide feedback to us here at ReaR upstream.  
Many thanks in advance for testing it!

I can help with testing.

I tried to install it on our SLES12 SP3 LPAR and it failed with the

@suseusr168  
the message tells it:  
The RPM capability `lsb-release` is needed/required  
by the RPM package `rear23a-2.3.a-1.1.ppc64le`.  
I.e. you need an RPM package that provides `lsb-release`  
and this is provided by the RPM package `lsb-release`.  
This is no tautology:  
A needed RPM capability (usually called RPM requirement) named `foo`  
can be provided by a totally different named RPM package `bar`,  
e.g.: `/usr/bin/cat` is provided by the RPM package named `coreutils`

<pre>
# rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/bin/cat
coreutils-8.25-12.8.x86_64
</pre>

Simply put:  
Install the RPM package `lsb-release` before you install `rear23a`.

I think
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1884](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1884)  
could be a serious issue so that I would have to  
update again my updated rear23a RPM package for SUSE  
because I assume disks with 4K block size (both for logical and physical
blocks)  
which happens at least with some IBM harddisks  
are an important use case where ReaR must "just work".

1.  I was able to create the Rear ISO backup file and restored the
    backup to another LPAR.  
    I have attached the restore log.  
    [Rear23a.Restore.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2251310/Rear23a.Restore.log)

I noticed there were a few "error: unrecognized number." during the
restore menu. I just pressed enter.

What are the differences between the Rear Version (A,B,C) below?  
A. Your version rear23a-2.3.a-1.1.ppc64le.rpm.  
I noticed it is 2.4 when I run a rear -V  
rpm -qa|grep rear

B. Version provided by SUSE support

When I installed this version :
rear-2.4-1.git.0.aa7b197.unknown.ppc64le.rpm, I didn't see any pre-req
rpm lsb-release.

When I tried to install your 2.3.a-1.1 and the SUSE 2.3-74.2, it
required the lsb-release pre-req.

Is the lsb-release pre-req required now?

Thanks.

Regarding `error: unrecognized number`:

The

<pre>
Welcome to GRUB!

error: unrecognized number.

                             GNU GRUB  version 2.02
</pre>

error messages are from GRUB2 as far as it looks.

I don't know how booting with GRUB2 happens on PPC64LE PowerVM LPAR  
(in general I am really not at all a bootloader expert) so that I
cannot  
really help here.

I had a similar (but different error in GRUB2) while I worked on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828)  
therein see the entries that contain
`error: invalid environment block`.  
Accordingly I have now in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

<pre>
# Move away outdated information from previous boot via GRUB2
# to avoid a possible GRUB2 "error: invalid environment block."
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828
# GRUB2 can use /boot/grub/grubenv or /boot/grub2/grubenv
# to remember a small amount of information from one boot to the next.
# But on a by "rear recover" recreated system there is no such thing
# as a meaningful previous boot (because "rear recover" recreates a system
# by reinstalling it completely from scratch) so that there is no meaningful
# use-case to remember any information from a possible previous boot,
# cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828#issuecomment-399050741
# Nevertheless that information from the last boot on the original system
# could be still of interest for the user so that it is not deleted:
BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /boot/grub/grubenv /boot/grub2/grubenv )
</pre>

But I have no idea what the root cause of an
`error: unrecognized number`  
GRUB2 error message could be - in particular because that error
message  
is so very explicit and helpful - GRRR! - what number is unrecognized
where?  
I really hate useless messages that tell nothing about the current
actual  
environment where a particular issue happened - e.g. pointlessness
like  
`error: file not found` - what `file` was not found in this particular
case?

Regarding different RPM packages that provide ReaR:

My version rear23a-2.3.a-1.1.ppc64le.rpm contains the currently latest
GitHub  
master code - i.e. it provides you the most up-to-date ReaR.

As far as I know any RPM package from any 'opensuse.org' site is never  
officially supported by SUSE support for SUSE Linux Enterprise
products.  
As far as I know RPM packages that are officially supported by SUSE  
for SUSE Linux Enterprise products should come from a 'suse.com' site.

Whether or nor lsb-release is required by a RPM package depends on  
what is defined as requirement for the particular RPM package in the  
so called RPM 'spec' file.

Different rear RPM packages have (slightly) different RPM 'spec'
files,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855\#issuecomment-404100990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855#issuecomment-404100990)

My rear RPM packages require lsb-release in their 'spec' files  
because on older SLES and openSUSE versions it is perhaps still needed  
while on newer SLES and openSUSE versions it should be no longer
needed  
but - to be on the safe side - I simply keep the RPM requirement for
lsb-release.  
It does not hurt to have /usr/bin/lsb\_release installed (it is a
generally useful tool)  
and in some cases it could be still needed in some cases and then I
think  
it is better to have it installed than to let things possibly go wrong
in ReaR.

FYI:  
/usr/bin/lsb\_release is called as fallback in the
SetOSVendorAndVersion  
function in usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh and also in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/990\_sysreqs.sh  
When the SetOSVendorAndVersion function results wrong values  
things could go really wrong in ReaR at certain but possibly critical
places.  
As far as I remember @schabrolles had "some special kind of fun"  
with code that depends on the values of variables that are set by  
the SetOSVendorAndVersion function like OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR  
where code in usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh depends on.

Regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1884](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1884)
(disk with 4K block size):

I would like to know what on your PPC64LE PowerVM LPAR  
both the logical and physical block size of your system disk is  
i.e. what the output of the following commands on your system is:

<pre>
# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/logical_block_size

# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/physical_block_size
</pre>

Replace `sda` with what your system disk device basename actually is,  
cf. the 'ReaR/PPC Disk size issue' mails on the rear-devel mailing list
like  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-devel/2018-July/001643.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-devel/2018-July/001643.html)

@suseusr168  
in your Rear23a.Restore.log I found an interesting example where  
`Verifying md5sums of the files in the Relax-and-Recover rescue system`  
failed with

<pre>
./etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules: FAILED

I will investigate what modifies
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  
but I assume this is all o.k. so that I can exclude that by default  
It also happened one single time to me that I got a failure  
with an unusual file in `/dev/` so that I think we may better exclude  
all files in `/dev/` to avoid such false alarm.

FYI:  
When you run rear in debugscript mode '-D' you get at the end the

But after "rear -D recover" you do not need to remove it because  
"rear -D recover" runs within the ReaR recovery system  
and that runs only inside the main memory of your system  
so that for "rear -D recover" rear's working area in /tmp/  
is only inside the main memory of your system  
where all goes away during reboot.  
Within the ReaR recovery system the files of the recreated system  
are under "/mnt/local" where the tree of filesystems on the disks is
mounted.  
In contrast when you run "rear -D mkbackup/mkrescue"  
rear's working area in /tmp/ stays there until you remove it maunally  
or some automated /tmp/ cleanup stuff removes it - if you have such.

@schabrolles  
I would like that you have a look at the Rear23a.Restore.log from
@suseusr168  
cf.

For me things look o.k. but I just like a confirmation from you.

In particular I would like to know whether or not the migration mode  
behaves sufficiently well with multipath:

<pre>
Setting up multipathing
Activating multipath
multipath activated
Starting multipath daemon
multipathd started
Listing multipath device found
 size=125G
 size=125G
 size=50G
 size=11G
Comparing disks
Ambiguous possible target disks need manual configuration (more than one with same size found)
Switching to manual disk layout configuration
Using /dev/mapper/360050764008100b5a8000000000000ef (same size) for recreating /dev/mapper/360050764008100513800000000000038
Current disk mapping table (source => target):
  /dev/mapper/360050764008100513800000000000038 => /dev/mapper/360050764008100b5a8000000000000ef

UserInput -I LAYOUT_MIGRATION_CONFIRM_MAPPINGS needed in /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/300_map_disks.sh line 275
Confirm or edit the disk mapping
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) n/a
3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
5) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
</pre>

Item `2) n/a` is because in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh
there is

<pre>
    is_completely_identical_layout_mapping && choices[1]="Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration" || choices[1]="n/a"
</pre>

@jsmeix I got a look at the log file sent by @suseusr168.

Only a small Bug here... I think it is also present on master (small bug
... not blocking)

When activating multipath, disk name are not shown (only size). I think
it is because multipath firendly name is not use. I have to look how to
deal with it.

    Listing multipath device found
     size=125G
     size=125G
     size=50G
     size=11G

For the REAL stuff ... it looks good to me, migration is OK as we use a
different system to restore. Grub2 was reinstalled correctly, ramdisk
regenerated and bootlist setup.... Works perfectly +1:

    Patching /etc/default/grub_installdevice: Replacing [/dev/disk/by-id/dm-name-360050764008100513800000000000038-part1] by [/dev/disk/by-id/dm-name-360050764008100b5a8000000000000ef-part1]

    Found PPC PReP boot partition /dev/mapper/360050764008100b5a8000000000000ef-part1 - installing GRUB2 there

    Running mkinitrd...
    Recreated initrd (/sbin/mkinitrd).

    Set LPAR bootlist to /dev/sdm /dev/sde /dev/sdi /dev/sda

@schabrolles : Thanks for verifying this.

@jsmeix ; When will your rear23a-2.3.a-1.1.ppcle.rpm be included with
the official SUSE release of SLES12 SP3?

@suseusr168, could you please send me the output of `multipath -l `  
I just want to check why device name does not appear during multipath
activation.
