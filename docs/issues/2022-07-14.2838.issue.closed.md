#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Hello,

This isn't an "issue", but rather a question/howto.

I am successfully using ReaR to backup to a remote system via sshfs.

I want to perform a test restore, to confirm that I can restore the
backup and to identify potential issues like the one that I have
encountered here.

So, I am trying to restore the backup into a test VM on the remote host.

So, the remote environment is different to the source.

The sshfs backup consists of a recovery ISO and a tar archive.

I am booting the recovery ISO in my target VM and then rear will need to
connect to the backup host across sshfs to access the tar archive.

I have networking configured in the rear recovery environment.

However, rear recover, cannot access the tar archive

By default, the recovery ISO appears to be looking for the tar archive
in the location that it was present during the backup. Which makes sense
if I'm performing the restore from the same location.

However, I don't want to touch the original system. I just want to
confirm that the backup works and that I can restore it.

I think that I need to modify two files in the recovery environment so
that I can change the behaviour of rear recovery

1.  Use a modified rear.conf file where I can specify the local URL to
    the sshfs server
2.  Modify ssh\_config, because I'm using a different port for ssh when
    performing this test restore

I've tried mounting the recovery ISO with isomount, but I can't locate
the relevant files/folders mentioned above.

Am also open to other suggestions if I am going about this the wrong
way.

@ZENAdmin-Ops

without your etc/rear/local.conf it is basically impossible  
to guess how you actually made your ISO and your backup.

Without your "rear -D recover" debug log output it is impossible  
to see how it actually failed in your specific case, see the  
section "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Mounting the ISO in the running ReaR recovery system  
should be usually useless because normally the ISO  
contains not the backup but only the files of the  
ReaR recovery system (kernel and initrd).

Normally the replacement hardware or VM  
where you run "rear recover" would be in the same  
network environment where your original system is  
(where you had run "rear mkbackup") so it works same  
to access your backup.tar.gz via network.

When your replacement hardware or VM  
is in a different network environment  
compared to where your original system is,  
you need to adapt /etc/rear/local.conf  
in the running ReaR recovery system  
as needed to access your backup.tar.gz  
from the different network environment.

@jsmeix

I've been thinking about this since my earlier post, you confirmed my
thoughts. Thanks.
