During the layout creation, I get an error (see
[https://gist.github.com/wdpoorte/8b203c8cd6c203ddc6da](https://gist.github.com/wdpoorte/8b203c8cd6c203ddc6da))

I could fix this by modifying
/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10\_include\_partition\_code.sh
using the following command:

    sed -i -e "/^parted /asleep 1" /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/10_include_partition_code.sh

I can create a pull sequest if necessary and am wondering if is still
needed to have the sleep 10 in the code when the sleeps are added.

The current sleep entries in Relax-and-Recover are quite liberal.
Depending on the type of hardware the sleep time may be less or maybe
even more. I think we used a `sleep 10` because we thought it would fit
all cases, but YMMV :-/

Our opinion at the time was that we needed a better way to make sure the
device/partition was ready, however we did not find such a method that
worked in all cases. (e.g. polling udev would be nice)

But then again we would have to be testing this for different kind of
hardware and cases and that's something we don't have the
infrastructure/resources for.

Wrt. your patch, I am not sure whether doing a `sleep 1` after each
parted call is needed or wanted. I would prefer to add it only to those
places where it is known to be needed.
