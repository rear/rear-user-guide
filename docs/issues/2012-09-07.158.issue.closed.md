When the user has no rights to write to the destination folder (as
root), we should detect and report this to the user. Causes could be NFS
root\_squash, read\_only mounts and/or selinux.

If possible, we should analyse the permission problems and provide
guidance for each specific case. Or if impossible, at least report the
various causes for this issue.

This closes \#146.

Another point of interest is NFSv4 is not properly supported within rear
at this moment. E.g. read the background details at
[http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/796](http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/796)  
The best we can offer at this moment is to define variable
`BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=2,nolock"` in the `/etc/rear/local.conf`file.
Or, use `nfsvers=3` which is also not mapping the UIDs of the
files/directories to -2 (on 64 bit Linux) or 4294967294 (on 32 bit
Linux).

Crossed this while doing a recovery exercise using RBME and restoring
over NFSv4 (on fedora 18 beta):

I want to upvote to handle the NFSv4! Because it becomes more and more
the standard version for NFS.

In our case we put in place ReaR as system backup tool for our RHEL5
servers. For that we already had to adapt the NFS server to allow the
RHEL5 mount the share in version 3. But now we get also RHEL6 that we
need to backup. And since RHEL6 the default version used by the client
is also v4!  
So as workaround we had to turn off the support of v4 on the NFS server.
But this is actually not a nice trick.

Regards,

@xenlo You mean adding an rpc.idmapd service to the rescue image ? It is
already possible to add it yourself to the configuration file and have
it started on boot. Integrating this into Relax-and-Recover should be
quite easy.

Yes - please get nfsv4 working. We cannot standardize on any other
versions of NFS for security reasons. Currently, a good number of ReaR
images are failing because of this. If not support, please post a
workaround until supported.

a work-around is `BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"`

NFSv4 support post-pone to rear-1.18 release

Fully NFSv4 integration into rear is postponed to 1.19. No time left for
1.18 release.
