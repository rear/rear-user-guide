[\#566 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/566) `merged`: write os.conf to /etc/rear/

os.conf MUST be at /etc/rear/os.conf in the rescue image. $CONF\_DIR may
have been different depending on the rear installation directory.

I don't understand why. According to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear)
we read `$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf` so that the original code should be
correct.

Could you please tell us which problem you are trying to solve? Do you
use a non-default `$CONFIG_DIR`?

In case rear is installed at a non-default location, for example
/opt/rear/, CONFIG\_DIR would be /opt/rear/etc/rear which would result
in the os.conf tried to be written to
/tmp/rear.sJ21Z1FtDdfQQOF/rootfs//opt/rear/etc/rear/os.conf which fails
of course as this path doesn't exist.

When I run mkrescue, the os.conf file *should* be written to
"/tmp/rear.sJ21Z1FtDdfQQOF/rootfs/etc/rear", but actually rear tries to
write the os.conf file to
"/tmp/rear.sJ21Z1FtDdfQQOF/rootfs//opt/rear/etc/rear/os.conf" failing
with /opt/rear/usr/share/rear/build/default/99\_update\_os\_conf.sh:
line 3: /tmp/rear.sJ21Z1FtDdfQQOF/rootfs//opt/rear/etc/rear/os.conf: No
such file or directory

Also, other config from the original installation directory are beeing
copied from $CONFIG\_DIR to rootfs/etc/rear/ as you can see here:
10\_copy\_as\_is.sh\#L27

My setup:

-   lsb\_release -i -s: Debian
-   lsb\_release -r -s: 7.8
-   installed rear to /opt/rear/: cd /opt; wget
    [https://codeload.github.com/rear/rear/zip/rear-1.16.1](https://codeload.github.com/rear/rear/zip/rear-1.16.1);
    unzip rear-1.16.1; rm rear-1.16.1; mv rear-rear-1.16.1 rear
-   the only file I touch is /opt/rear/etc/rear/local.conf adding
    BACKUP\_URL and OUTPUT\_URL, no other files like os.conf or so is
    beeing created/edited.

During "/opt/rear/usr/sbin/rear mkrescue" I find this in rear.log:  
2015-03-18 18:15:57 Including build/default/99\_update\_os\_conf.sh

When booting the rescue image and running "rear recover", this stack
trace can be found:

Trace 1: /usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh:32

But, if I apply the patch from above, the os.conf will be properly
written to /etc/rear/os.conf of the rescue image and the "LSB package is
not installed" does not appear.

I see what you mean. I think that you found a bug that `$CONFIG_DIR` is
not honored in the rescue image. Would it not solve your problem if
`$CONFIG_DIR` works also in the rescue system?

Another question: Why do you "install" ReaR like this? What you do is
basically running it from source without proper installation. Why not
install it with `make install` or by building a Debian package or simply
using our ready made Debian package?

I digged some more and found  
`usr/share/rear/prep/default/10_init_workflow_conf.sh` where
`CONFIG_DIR` is set explicitly to `/etc/rear` for the Rescue system.

The truth is that I cannot say for sure which strategy we should
implement here:

1.  `CONFIG_DIR` is the same in source system and in rescue system
2.  `CONFIG_DIR` is *always* `/etc/rear` in rescue system.

Running `grep -r etc/rear` suggest that ATM we follow the 2nd strategy.
In that case you are right with your patch.

@gdha what do you think?

@Bullja:  
I would still be happy to understand why you install ReaR like that.
Maybe you have a use case we are not aware of.

BTW, did you try to do `make install DESTDIR=/opt/rear`?

@schlomo @Bullja Personally I think it is better to define `/etc/rear/`
in rescue image then having your own path (especially after months it
might be problematic to remember the original $CONFIG\_DIR path). I
remember issue \#336 which is similar as this one.  
For me it is fine to accept the pull request.

Installing via the deb packages I received some dependency problems I
couldn't solve before so I tried just running rear from source which was
working just great except the one issue os.conf was not beeing written
properly which looked like a bug imho.

On some production systems I still do not want to meet the dependencies
and trying to install as few packages as possible. (portmap, nfs-client,
...)

I am using rear only since few days and found the following installation
methods:

1.  Installation via dpkg: If dependencies are not met, for example
    (portmap for NETFS support?, nfs-client for NETFS support) I can
    still force to install of course, but every time somebody will run
    apt-get on the system, the rear dependency error appears -&gt; not
    good unless there is an option to to tell apt-get to ignore
    dependencies for rear.
2.  Installation via make install: Didn't know about that method before.
    Installation looks good but when running, it failes with some errors
    I do not want to continue looking into. See log below.
3.  "Installation" via copy to /opt/rear: Works well and easy, doesn't
    affect/touch the system at all.

Tending to go the  
$ "copy to /opt/rear"  
$ sed -i 's/$CONFIG\_DIR/etc/rear/g'
/opt/rear/usr/share/rear/build/default/99\_update\_os\_conf.sh  
path as compared to the other methods it is the least intrusive way to
use rear.  
I don't want to say "make install" or "dpkg -i" are bad, I just like to
have the option to just copy and run it :)

\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#  
after "make install DESTDIR=/opt/rear" while running from source works
well.

Thanks for providing some background information.

It seems like so far the make install DESTDIR=... only works for our
build scripts. Feel free to submit more pull requests to improve that
behaviour.

The pidof error you see is a follow up error caused by ReaR not finding
its files. In your case I would advice to use `make install` to manually
install ReaR into its default paths. That way you will get a regular
install without the dependency trouble.

The package dependencies are a constant source of conflict. Some people
only want the bare minimum and others complain if common features don't
work "out of the box".

So far we have only a single ReaR package wich obviously cannot suit
everybody. Maybe we should have a rear base package with just the really
required minimum dependencies and then addon packages for different use
cases that pull in the neccessary dependencies. Again, patches are
welcome.
