-   ReaR version: Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git
-   System architecture: x86
-   Description of the issue:

If `etc/ssh/sshd_config` contains a `Match` section which is effective
at the end of the file, patching will generate wrong results: E.g.,
`skel/default/etc/scripts/run-sshd` will append `PermitRootLogin yes`
expecting it to be effective as a global setting. A `Match` section at
EOF will render this ineffective, preventing an SSH root login on the
rescue system.

#### Example:

Before patching by `run-sshd`:

    [...]
    Match User anoncvs
        PasswordAuthentication no
        X11Forwarding no
        AllowTcpForwarding no
        PermitTTY no
        ForceCommand cvs server

After patching by `run-sshd`:

    [...]
    Match User anoncvs
        PasswordAuthentication no
        X11Forwarding no
        AllowTcpForwarding no
        PermitTTY no
        ForceCommand cvs server
    PermitRootLogin yes
    ClientAliveInterval 0

In the latter case, `PermitRootLogin yes` and `ClientAliveInterval 0`
will only be effective if the user is `anoncvs` (which will never be the
case on the rescue system).
