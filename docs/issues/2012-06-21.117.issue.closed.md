Today I experienced this again

    [root@moria ~]# rear -v mkbackup
    Relax and Recover 1.13.0 / $Date$
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-moria.log
    Rewinding tape
    Writing OBDR header to tape in drive '/dev/nst0'
    Creating disk layout
    Excluding component fs:/var
    Creating root filesystem layout

While the configuration does not ask such a thing:

    OUTPUT=OBDR
    TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/st0
    BACKUP=NETFS

As soon as you defined a BACKUP\_URL this behaviour is no longer seen.
Saw the same thing doing USB tests.

I can't reproduce it.

Can you send the `rear -D savelayout` log to me?

Ok, I can now reproduce it. It is caused by something in prep/
