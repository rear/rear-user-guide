See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030)  
(Borg backup restore requires UTF-8 localization support  
in the rescue/recovery system).

Because UTF-8 is THE nowadays standard locale  
and because UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII  
(i.e. UTF-8 is compatible with the POSIX/C locale)  
I like to suggest to have in general UTF-8 localization  
support in the rescue/recovery system.

Note that I do not request to use a UTF-8 locale  
by default in the rescue/recovery system because  
this could result different output from tools.  
I.e. I want to keep using the POSIX/C locale  
by default in the rescue/recovery system  
to avoid regressions.

I only request that - if needed - one can switch  
to a UTF-8 locale in the rescue/recovery system.

The plain UTF-8 encoding is compatible with ASCII but  
setting LANG to en\_US.UTF-8 is not ASCII compatible,  
see this mail  
[https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2017-11/msg00006.html](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2017-11/msg00006.html)  
that reads (excerpt):

<pre>
Setting LANG to en_US.UTF-8
is a horrible idea for scripts
...
collating order and ctypes get in the way
as it's not ASCII compatible

It is my understanding that UTF-8 character support in ReaR is possible
in a backward compatible manner:

Create `usr/share/rear/build/default/500_create_locale.sh` as follows:

    # Create our own locale
    mkdir -p $ROOTFS_DIR/usr/lib/locale
    localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US $ROOTFS_DIR/usr/lib/locale/C.UTF-8
    StopIfError "Could not create locale"

Set the locale for character encoding only via `export LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8`
(best place yet to be determined).
