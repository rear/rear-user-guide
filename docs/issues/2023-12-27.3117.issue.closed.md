-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

While trying to backup and restore using rsync it is not showing
progress , it will be showing only " Backed up 0 MiB \[avg 0 KiB/sec\]",
util entire backup is completed. I tried this with fedora34,35 and 36,
the same issue i was facing for all these versions

-   Workaround, if any:

I believe this is due to the redirection of stdout from the backup
program. The output, including the progress info, can be found in
${TMP\_DIR}/${BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE}.log :

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0bd84e259c7c61612a1d8eb296ee1e81a2cbc87b/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh\#L55](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/0bd84e259c7c61612a1d8eb296ee1e81a2cbc87b/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500_make_rsync_backup.sh#L55)

I understand that this behavior is not very useful in the case of
`--progress`.

There are two different kind of progress things here.

ReaR's own progress subsystem via  
usr/share/rear/lib/progresssubsystem.nosh  
that shows ProgressInfo "Backed up XXX MiB \[avg YYY KiB/sec\]"  
messages which seems to not work as intended because it is

    showing only " Backed up 0 MiB [avg 0 KiB/sec]",
    util entire backup is completed

instead of increasing numbers for "XXX MiB"  
and current numbers for "YYY KiB/sec".

Additionally in this case here there is  
the `rsync -v --progress` info.  
It is questionable whether or not that info  
should appear on the user's terminal.  
It is also questionable whether or not that info  
should appear in the backup log file because:

I am not a BACKUP=RSYNC user but I guess that perhaps  
when there is '--progress' or '-v' in BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS  
then the code to generate the numbers for the  
ProgressInfo message in  
backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh  
may no longer work, in particular note the line

        nfile="$(tail -1 "${TMP_DIR}/${BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE}.log")"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh\#L98](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500_make_rsync_backup.sh#L98)

I guess because of '--progress' or because of '-v'  
the last line in ${TMP\_DIR}/${BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE}.log  
may be no longer what is needed for the code  
to generate the numbers for the ProgressInfo messages.

I'd **guess** that the root cause of the problem is that you use the
`rsync` protocol and not the `ssh` protocol. The way how we "calculate"
the progress of the backup is actually via `df` and `du` with those two
functions:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/d0496cc751b7f667eb0c8ab0cc5116c1ec05007a/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh\#L65-L73](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/d0496cc751b7f667eb0c8ab0cc5116c1ec05007a/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500_make_rsync_backup.sh#L65-L73)

But since you use `rsync://` this probably doesn't work so that the
numbers stay `0` all the time. TBH, I cannot think of a clear way how to
provide truthful info on rsync progress without parsing the output.
There are multiple open source tools out there that can do this trick,
and provide a progress bar for rsync. Also, newer rsync versions support
`--info=progress2` that provides transfer statistics for the entire job.

I guess that it would be a nice contribution to ReaR to rework the rsync
progress info to use that feature instead of checking the free disk
space via SSH.

Redirection of output will hide it though, no? Just as in the case of
`--progress`.

Yes, but we can pass the rsync output directly to the user via `2>&8` or
something like that.
