-   Type: **Minor Bug Fix**  
    It is a minor bug when "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" does not error out  
    when things have actually failed.  
    In this case when gathering crypt information was not successful  
    the code blindly proceeds resulting wrong (incomplete) entries  
    in disklayout.conf that let later (when it is too late) "rear
    recover" fail.

-   Impact: **High**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By me on my current homeoffice laptop that uses LUKS 1.  
    I get still same 'crypt' entries in disklayout conf.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Error out during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" when LUKS version 2 is
    used  
    because currently LUKS version 2 is not suppported.  
    When LUKS version 2 is used it fails at least to determine the hash
    value cf.  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2204\#issuecomment-520254591](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2204#issuecomment-520254591)  
    so we use an empty hash value as a simple test if gathering crypt
    information  
    was successful and error out if not.
