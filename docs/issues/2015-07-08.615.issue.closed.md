Hi Guys,

I am trying to create a clone of a VM by taking rear and extracting the
ISO to install a Physical HP G9 Blade.  
Booting is not getting started with the ISO.

Thanks  
Abhishek Mittal

Hi Mittal,

this is a supported use case, the requirements are that the Linux
kernel  
and OS of your VM would work on the hardware. If that is *not* the
case  
(e.g. kernel too old, kernel is virtualization kernel that only works
on  
VMs ...) then ReaR cannot do anything.

If it is not that then please provide screenshots and/or logs from
your  
failed boot attempt.

Regards,  
Schlomo

The problem IMO is Gen9 uses UEFI to boot and the ISO image created on
your VM was **not** UEFI aware, therefore, the ISO cannot boot on the
physical Gen9. Try to boot in legacy mode, but still that won't help as
you should create a partition for the EFI and the rest for the OS. Above
all, it should be a GPT partitioned disk, etc. As you see it is very
difficult without the UEFI tools on the rear rescue image ISO. There is
a lot of manual work to do.  
Try cloning from an UEFI VM to Gen9

Gen9's have the capability of either being in UEFI or legacy BIOS
mode.  
Try setting legacy bios mode and try your restore.

I still think the chances of this working are slim. Your VM may not  
have the right drivers to talk to the devices that are native on the  
real hw. For example, if you were using virtual box para-virtualized  
drivers for network and storage, you probably wouldn't have hpsa and  
whatever nic drivers the gen9 needs for native access.

V2P and P2V are much more than just save and restore. There is 'magic'  
that goes on behind the scenes to make that process work.

@abhishekmittal02 did answer your question? Or, do you have any other
concern?
