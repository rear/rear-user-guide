#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3344302?v=4" width="50">[DEvil0000](https://github.com/DEvil0000) opened issue at [2021-10-18 12:33](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2698):

At the moment creating a boot media does only support legacy BIOS boot
or UEFI boot but not both from within the same image. I think this is
true in general but definitely for USB media.  
It should be possible to create boot media supporting both modes in the
same image.  
The format command does have a --efi option and default/without --efi
goes the legacy BIOS boot route.

Proposed changes:

-   add a --bios switch which only does legacy bios installs.
-   change format without --efi/--bios to create a hybrid stick
-   make grub the default bootloader (since I know this one best and
    know how to do it with that)
-   small partitoning changes may be needed
-   bootloader auto detect in
    rescue/default/850\_save\_sysfs\_uefi\_vars.sh needs to get changed
    (must work if booted in legacy and no boot/efi, efivars and
    efibootmgr is availabe) e.g.
    UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=/usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/monolithic/grubx64.efi

If you agree I will start the next days to prepare a PR.

@DEvil0000  
of course I agree when you do a PR.  
I appreciate it and I look forward to it.

In the end if we could come to one single generic bootloader setup  
for the bootloader of the ReaR recovery system that is by default  
`Hybrid UEFI and BIOS with GRUB2 as bootloader`  
it could be a great step forward to get that part of ReaR simple and
straightforward.

Is it really possible to create an image which supports both BIOS and
UEFI? In particular, would a disk with an EFI partition table (I suppose
it is needed for UEFI support?) be bootable by BIOS?

I am not at all a bootloader expert but  
[https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid)  
reads in the "UEFI" section

    The ISO 9660 filesystem is then supposed to boot from optical media
    and from disk storage via BIOS and via UEFI. Unfortunately...

As far as I know *setup iso images* of e.g. *ubuntu* have this hybrid
mode but of course they do it somewhat differently due to their *iso*
nature.  
I just tested USB media with GPT and GRUB and it seems to work in both
worlds.  
My understanding is, that BIOS looks for bootloader code at a specific
disk address (MBR) while UEFI is looking for a EFI partition. So they
should not conflict. The difference from MSDOS partition table to GPT
should basically be where the second chunk of bootloader gets written
to.

Only as a side note FYI:  
At SUSE we had (or perhaps even still have?) some SUSE specific  
parted enhacement called `gpt_sync_mbr` partitioning scheme, cf.

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'gpt_sync_mbr'
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh

Again: I am not an expert in this area.

Ok, so it should be possible for ISOs, as there are working hybrid
Ubuntu ISOs. My question was more about hard disk (OUTPUT=USB)
partitioning.

@pcahyna  
even if such a "Hybrid UEFI and BIOS with GRUB2 as bootloader" setup  
does not work in general it would not be worse than what we have now  
where our recovery system bootloader setup also does not work in
general.

I guess one could have both a bios\_grub partition and a ESP  
and have their partitioning data both in MBR and in a GPT  
so a disk with a ReaR recovery system could have a partitioning like

-   free space for GPT (e.g. up to USB\_PARTITION\_ALIGN\_BLOCK\_SIZE)
-   8 MiB bios\_grub partition
-   512 MiB ESP
-   /boot partition with USB\_BOOT\_PART\_SIZE
-   ReaR data partition up to USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_PERCENTAGE
-   free space for secondary GPT at the end of the disk

This way the four partitions could be both in MBR and in the GPT and  
kernel, initrd, and GRUB2 could be hopefully installed (e.g. two times
as neded)  
so that this disk can boot both with BIOS firmware and UEFI firmware.  
I would hope that BIOS firmware ignores GPT and ESP and  
that UEFI firmware ignores MBR and bios\_grub partition.

It's already there in ReaR. To quote from
[rear/03-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc#rescue-media-output)
(emphasis added):

> OUTPUT=RAWDISK  
> Create a bootable raw disk image on as rear-$(hostname).raw.gz.
> Supports UEFI boot if syslinux/EFI or Grub 2/EFI is installed.
> Supports Legacy BIOS boot if syslinux is installed. **Supports

@OliverO2  
thank you so much to remind us on what we already have in ReaR!  
In this case we have it because you had contributed it to ReaR.  
I am sorry that I had not sufficiently checked what we already have in
ReaR.  
My excuse is that I personaly do not use OUTPUT=RAWDISK  
but I should have known what OUTPUT=RAWDISK provides.

@DEvil0000 @pcahyna  
so the good news is that for OUTPUT=USB we do not need  
to implement things from scratch.  
Instead we should try to re-use the matching code from OUTPUT=RAWDISK  
or at least learn from the OUTPUT=RAWDISK code how to implement it.

@OliverO2 I was not aware that this works with syslinux. Thanks for the
hint will have a look there, too.

@OliverO2 I am a bit confused about the raw output mode. You completely
skip the format workflow and have your own format/partitioning and
bootloader config code instead. correct?  
Due to this the script looks a bit cleaner then the lib code but does
lack quite some features if I get this correct.

Yes, there is no need for a format workflow. You get a disk image and
copy it, that's all. The `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` section in `default.conf`
explains how to use it.

Regarding features: `RAWDISK` is for modern scenarios, so there are no
fancy grub configuration variants, for example. (With UEFI, as the
firmware offers to select boot options, there is less need for a boot
loader to replicate that feature.)

sadly modern UEFI is quite rare for the hardware pool at our customers
sice they tend to have special hardware and keep it for at least
10years. I need all the legacy features for some machines while for some
I need the modern ones.  
Having it basically duplicated instead of using the lib functions is
maybe not the best idea in any case.

The creation of `RAWDISK` output was guided by a number of factors:

1.  the defined goal of creating a PBA for TCG OPAL-2-compliant
    self-encrypting disks,
2.  the quality, comprehensibility, and fitness for re-use of existing
    code,
3.  the volume of tests required to support all the options available,
4.  the risk of inadvertently breaking existing functionality,
5.  last not least: finite resources.

Not using the "lib" functions was a deliberate decision based on careful
research.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2705](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2705)
merged  
"rear format" has now in addition to the --efi switch a --bios switch.  
If none is given (i.e. by default) it will now do hybrid formatting  
with a BIOS boot partition (on GPT) and an EFI system partition.  
This is a precondition for this issue here.
