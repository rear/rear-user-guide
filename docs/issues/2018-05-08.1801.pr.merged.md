##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    SLES12SP2 on POWER with multipath devices

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The actual code without this patch just exclude "real disk" which
    doesn't have fs mounted, not mutlipath devices.  
    This path check if fs has parent device in disk AND multipath, then
    exclude disk and multipath with no fs mounted.

@schabrolles  
please add explanatory comments why "multipath" is also there  
so that others at any later time (who may konw nothing about
"multipath")  
immediately understand how "multipath" also belongs there.

Only optionally:  
Could you perhaps "by the way" also clean up code like

<pre>
if [[ "$AUTOEXCLUDE_..." =~ ^[yY1] ]] ; then
</pre>

to the current way like

<pre>
if is_true "$AUTOEXCLUDE_..." ; then
</pre>

Meanwhile I may no longer understand how that autoexlude code is meant
in general,  
see

After looking a bit closer I think meanwhile I do again understand it  
and this is what I currently think how that autoexlude code is meant:

When AUTOEXCLUDE\_DISKS is true  
it collects in the used\_disks array  
all disks that are somehow used  
for swap and/or by a mounted filesystem  
and then it automatically excludes only those disks  
that are not in the used\_disks array.

This means a disk that has partitions  
for supported and mounted filesystems  
plus partitions for unsupported filesystems  
will not be automatically excluded  
when at least one of its partitions is used  
(as swap or by a mounted filesystem).

Your change enhances that by also  
automatically excluding multipath devices  
when none of its partitions is used  
(as swap or by a mounted filesystem).

If my current understanding is actually right,  
your changes look perfectly right to me.

Last changes ... Add comments and also replace `find_disk` by
`find_disk_and_multiapth` function during swap parent device detection.
