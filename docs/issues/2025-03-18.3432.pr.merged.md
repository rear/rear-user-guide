    swap entry in the disklayout.conf file as it is memory based and not

@gdha  
please post here the complete outputs of the commands

    # cat /proc/swaps

    # swapon --show

on a system that uses /dev/zram\* for swap.

I would like to see what the outpout is  
when /dev/zram\* is used for swap.

I am in particular interested what the swap type is.

As far as I know the swap type is either 'partition' or 'file'.

But /dev/zram\* is memory based and not disk based  
so it seems it is neither a partition nor a file  
(of course disregarding "everything is a file" in Unix).

When the swap type is really either 'partition' or 'file'  
then from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3343](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3343)
follows  
that the swap type for /dev/zram\* must be 'partition'  
because if it was 'file' it would have been skipped by

    if [ "$filename" = "Filename" ] || [ "$type" = "file" ] ; then
        continue
    fi

According to  
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram)  
it looks as if it could be even correct  
that /dev/zram\* swap type is 'partition'  
because zram is a compressed RAM disk  
but the 'lsblk' output in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3343\#issue-2646259861](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3343#issue-2646259861)  
shows that it is not a partition but a whole 'disk'

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

    NAME       KNAME      PKNAME TRAN TYPE FSTYPE LABEL SIZE MOUNTPOINT
    /dev/zram0 /dev/zram0             disk              1.9G [SWAP]

Also the above Arch Linux article also tells that

    zram behaves differently than disk swap

but curretly I don't see how exactly it is different  
(of course RAM is faster but no persistent storage).

So the actual issue could be that a false or at least  
misleading swap type 'partition' is reported which  
is not sufficiently backward compatible with the usual  
swap type 'partition' for a normal disk partition.

swap type `partition` is used even for whole disks:

    # mkswap /dev/vdb
    # swapon /dev/vdb
    # swapon --show
    NAME     TYPE      SIZE USED PRIO
    /dev/vdb partition  10G   0B   -2

so it should be better named `block` (as it applies to any block device,
I doubt that the kernel cares whether the device is a partition or a
disk). zram is a block device:

    $ ls -l /dev/zram0 
    brw-rw---- 1 root disk 253, 0 Mar 25 09:49 /dev/zram0

and thus "like a disk", I don't think that the swap code even
distinguishes it from real disks and disk partitions (unfortunately,
because otherwise the handling of this swap area could be more adapted
to its peculiarities).

@gdha thanks for the fix! A note about the intermediate commit: if you
were to change how the list of swaps is being read (I see that in the
final version you don't), one could then use the output of
`swapon --show --noheadings`.

Please squash the commits together to simplify the history.

I realized that this statement is pretty vague, so let me elaborate.
zram swap lets you attach a compressed swap space of a given size, but
it would be more useful to be able to specify how much maximum RAM
should one let zram to use, and let the swap space depend on the
compression ratio that is achieved. Perhaps
[zswap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zswap) is more suitable for
this use though.
