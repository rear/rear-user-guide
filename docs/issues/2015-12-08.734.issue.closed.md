The man page says:

    OUTPUT_URL=null
       Do not copy the ISO image from /var/lib/rear/output/ to an external destination.
       Useful in combination with an external backup program, or when BACKUP_URL=iso://backup

but, currently this is only honoured when `BACKUP=NETFS` method has been
set.  
We have had requests for external backups methods like TSM and NSR
(issues \#634, \#705, \#419 and \#501) to reduce duplicate ISOs or to
avoid backup ISOs after each `rear mkrescue` run.

Therefore, we could define some new global variables especially for
external backup methods:

-   `COPY_LOCAL_ISO_IMAGE=` : do **not** copy (or to copy when **1**)
    the ISO image to external backup media. (**default set to 1**)
-   `REMOVE_LOCAL_ISO_IMAGE=` : do **not** remove (or to remove when
    **1**) ISO image after successful copied to an external backup
    media. Of course, if we define `COPY_LOCAL_ISO_IMAGE=1` then
    `REMOVE_LOCAL_ISO_IMAGE=1` makes sense as the ISO image was
    successful saved (however, we must be sure it was saved correctly).
    Default **empty**.
-   If we define `OUTPUT_URL=null` we could automatically set
    `COPY_LOCAL_ISO_IMAGE=` (do **not** copy the ISO image to external
    backup media). However, we would prefer also to see
    `REMOVE_LOCAL_ISO_IMAGE=` with this settings then.

**Last update:** *16 Dec 2016 - changed the variable names to understand
better what we are talking about*

@jsmeix Does the above make any sense? If not then we can just close
this issue

@gdha  
in current code I cannot find where OUTPUT\_URL=null  
is ever used:

<pre>
$ find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/* | xargs grep -10 'OUTPUT_URL' | grep 'null'
[no output]
</pre>

Where in current code is OUTPUT\_URL=null used?

O.k. - as usual - after asking it - I found  
the OUTPUT\_URL=null implementation myself:

For now I will fix the documentation that OUTPUT\_URL=null  
only works with BACKUP=NETFS.

@gdha  
I fail to understand how OUTPUT\_URL=null is useful.  
I.e. I do not understand the intent behind  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/501\#issue-47292038](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/501#issue-47292038)

With

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=iso://backup/
OUTPUT_URL=null
</pre>

I get on the local system

<pre>
1.3G /tmp/rear.DoVv2d5N5FJMjim/tmp/isofs/backup-basic_system.tar.gz
1.5G var/lib/rear/output/rear-f79.iso
</pre>

and (as expected) nothing on a NFS output location.

With

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=iso://backup/
OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
</pre>

I get on the local system

<pre>
1.3G /tmp/rear.xR2FmUv4D7fEnEf/tmp/isofs/backup-basic_system.tar.gz
1.5G var/lib/rear/output/rear-f79.iso
</pre>

plus the rear-f79.iso copied to the NFS output location.

Summary from my current experiments:  
OUTPUT\_URL=null does not save disk space on the local system  
but it only prohibits to copy the result to the NFS output location.

I wonder what the benefit of OUTPUT\_URL=null is?

@jsmeix Remember, if you do not define an `OUTPUT_URL` variable it will
**inherit** the value of `BACKUP_URL`. In case you want the tar archive
to be included in the ISO image then we would have **2** big copies of
the ISO image (local and remote). The `OUTPUT_URL=null` prevents the
remote copy.  
Furthermore, in case a real backup solution back-ups the ISO image to
tape (or whatever) then some users want the local copy to be removed as
well.  
That is the main reason behind this issue.

@gdha  
many thanks for your explanation.  
Now I understand (at last I hope so ;-)

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1132](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1132)  
the issue should be sufficiently documented  
to avoid false expectations for ReaR 2.0.

For the future (i.e. for ReaR &gt; 2.0):

In general regarding "remove":

In general I think ReaR should never remove something, cf.  
my implementation of BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY  
(see my comment in default.conf)

<pre>
ReaR will not remove any file (any user data is sacrosanct).
</pre>

In particular regarding REMOVE\_LOCAL\_ISO\_IMAGE:  
Instead of first creating a possibly huge local ISO  
(when the ISO contains the backup) and then copy  
that to the remote output destination, I would prefer to  
create the ISO directly at the remote output destination  
if possible with the specified OUTPUT\_URL scheme.  
This would avoid that the local systems disk could get  
filled up with the local huge ISO.  
In particular when the remote output destination is  
a NFS share ReaR could create the ISO directly there  
in the same way as it currently writes the backup directly  
onto the NFS server with BACKUP\_URL=nfs://...

@jsmeix I wonder if we not better close this issue without any further
coding? Nobody seems to be interested in this item.

I agree.

Actually with \#1132  
the initial issue here had been sufficiently fixed.  
Only the future things as mentioned in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/734\#issuecomment-268195068](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/734#issuecomment-268195068)  
will not be implemented - unless there is real user need for that.
