#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.3 / Git
-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"): does not matter
-   System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of
    virtual machine): x86
-   Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot? does not mattter
-   Brief description of the issue: Stating a file instead of a dir to
    "rear -c ..." gives unexpected results
-   Work-around, if any: use the right options

I accidentally gave a config file to "-c" which produced a rescue ISO
file (as expected). It would  
be better if rear bails out in that situation and gives a warning/error
message.

I think a test in usr/sbin/rear that the '-c' option argument is a
directory  
is possible because I think the '-c' option argument must be a
directory  
in any case (at least 'man rear' indicates that).

@wzwei  
in general ReaR is currently not really fail-safe.  
Currently many things in ReaR can go wrong in weird arbitrary ways  
at unexpected places if you do not carefully set up and use ReaR.

In general you may have a look at the section  
"Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@jsmeix thank you for the hint. I know the points and already
experienced some problems ;-)

Thx,  
Wolfgang

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1920](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1920)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

@gdha  
thank you for fixing it regardless that it was assigned to me  
(currently I have not so much time for ReaR).
