FWIW:  
In general I think (as far as I remember) rear runs silent  
(except in verbose mode) like traditional Unix programs  
"no news is good news".

Personally I prefer verbosity but that is my personal  
preference (and not what rear does by default - as  
far as I remember).

@gdha @schlomo  
can you comment what the default rear behaviour  
should be regarding verbosity?

@phracek rear exits with recording an exit status in the
journal/messages file - is that not enough?

@phracek  
at least I need much better background information  
what the intent behind is to understand the issue.

The curent implementation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1022/files)  
is a hack that perhaps works for this one customer  
(but I don't know what his intent behind is)  
but in general it is wrong because

a)  
it does the

<pre>
LogPrint "Finished running $WORKFLOW workflow $BACKUP_URL `date` "
</pre>

for any workflow (in particular also for "rear mkrescue")  
where no backup is made

b)  
we would get a somewhat duplicate messaging

<pre>
Log "Finished running $WORKFLOW workflow"
LogPrint "Finished running $WORKFLOW workflow $BACKUP_URL `date` "
</pre>

with "Finished running $WORKFLOW workflow" two times.

Summary:

From my point of view in its current state  
both the issue and its implementation  
look rather crude.

@phracek  
in general have a look at

This issue is not for the 1.19 release (=&gt; "Rear future").

For a future release (hopefully for 1.20) I will try to clean up  
messaging in general, cf.
