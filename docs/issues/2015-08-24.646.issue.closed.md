Hello, MultipathMaster here,

We have a certain set of systems within our environment that have a
horrible network connection (a t-1), which is only 1.5 megabit a second,
and so we were wondering if there was a way to actually have rear (when
mkbackup or mkrescue is issued) make one ISO for an entire system?

I understand that this would mean that the ISO would be 10 gigs or
largers.

I really wanted to be able to do something like this BACKUP=ISO as well
as the OUTPUT=ISO, so that it will just be one big ISO.

An easy way would be --&gt; dd if=/dev/device | gzip &gt;
/path/to/location/backup.gz

then to include that at the %post section of the image build have it do
this --&gt;

cp /path/to/location/backup.gz $INSTALL\_ROOT/

and this backup.gz will then be included within the ISO image itself.

Once this is accomplished, the way to restore would simply be --&gt;  
zcat/cat backup.gz | dd of=/dev/device

However that being said, I would like an answer as to whether or not
rear has this option pre-built into him natively (i.e. make a giant ISO
of the system, similar to how Mondo works).

Just a question. Thanks -- MultipathMaster

@multipathmaster see the man page on how to create an ISO with archive
included. Feedback is of course more then welcome. It should make
multiple ISO images.

GDHA,

Again you have been more than helpful...

BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///opt/hd/sa/mondo  
BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup  
OUTPUT=ISO  
ISO\_DIR=/opt/hd/sa/mondo  
ISO\_PREFIX="rear-$HOSTNAME.dc9098-$(date "+%y%m%d.%H%M%S")"

Here is what I have to begin building the ISO files and the tar.gz
archive, however quick question, how can I tell rear to use a different
tmp directory than /tmp. Running out of space, but in /opt/hd/sa/mondo
we have more than enough space to write the ISO and the tarball as well
as using this space for the tmp (rear working dir), how do I point rear
to this dir to take advantage of the extra space?

@multipathmaster the `conf/default.conf` says:

    # the TMPDIR influences the mktemp command to define an alternative basedir instead of /tmp
    # useful in case he /tmp is not large enough to contain ISO images and/or backup archives
    # be careful the directory MUST exist otherwise you will get an error by mktemp
    TMPDIR=""
    export TMPDIR    # the export is required so that mktemp can pickup the variable

Rule of dumb, always check the default.conf file first ;-)

GDHA, you are the man! We are working now! We will test, but you can
close this support case out, this gets us across the finish line for
sure for this particular project. Thanks again for your time.
