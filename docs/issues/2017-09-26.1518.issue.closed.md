Recovery system libraries can be inconsistent  
because (at least for me on SLES12) by default  
some libraries require other libraries that are missing, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514\#issuecomment-331868727](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514#issuecomment-331868727)

This is only a minor bug because in practice all works for me and  
I assume this issue exists "since ever" also for other distributions.  
I assume only via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514)  
this issue here became visible.

No longer a minor bug but a real bug because  
I think I know the reason:

I analyzed in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514\#issuecomment-331868727](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1514#issuecomment-331868727)  
the first case where  
"/usr/lib64/libsoftokn3.so requires additional libraries".

No program (i.e. no file in /bin/ in the recovery system  
requires libsoftokn3 so I wondered how that library came  
into the recovery system and I found it hardcoded in  
usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf (excerpt):

<pre>
LIBS=(
...
### needed for curl HTTPS
...
/lib*/libsoftokn3.so*
/usr/lib*/libsoftokn3.so*
</pre>

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/25eb92534ebaa5120885259c0011ee35cd89aa5b](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/25eb92534ebaa5120885259c0011ee35cd89aa5b)

What seems to be missing from my current point of view  
is that in build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

<pre>
# copy libraries
declare -a all_libs=( $( for lib in ${LIBS[@]} $( SharedObjectFiles "${BINARIES[@]}" ) ; do
                             echo $lib
                         done | sort -u ) )
</pre>

the SharedObjectFiles function must also be called for  
the libraries in ${LIBS\[@\]} - why the heck is there no  
quotation i.e. why is it not "${LIBS\[@\]}" ???

Using in build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh

<pre>
# copy libraries
declare -a all_libs=( $( for lib in $( SharedObjectFiles "${LIBS[@]}" | sed -e 's#^#/#' ) $( SharedObjectFiles "${BINARIES[@]}" | sed -e 's#^#/#' ) ; do
                             echo $lib
                         done | sort -u ) )
</pre>

is not yet sufficient because now I get in the log (excerpts):

It seems the whole "needed libraries autodetection"  
does not work sufficiently transitive (i.e. it does not sufficiently  
find libraries needed by libraries needed by libraries needed by...)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4456d6424c93df024fb1a67b56262f0df76d62c5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4456d6424c93df024fb1a67b56262f0df76d62c5)  
is a minimal fix for this issue that I found after longish  
digging into the binaries and libraries copying code  
until I got some understanding how it works.

The main problem was that I failed to see that the  
SharedObjectFiles function only returns additionally  
need libraries but not the one that needs them so that  
something like a plain

<pre>
all_libs=( $( SharedObjectFiles "${LIBS[@]}" "${BINARIES[@]}" ) )
</pre>

does not result all needed libraries for the recovery system  
because those libraries in LIBS are missing that are not needed  
by a binary in BINARIES (the BINARIES are copied separated).

Accordingly the LIBS need also to be added via something like:

<pre>
all_libs=( "${LIBS[@]}" $( SharedObjectFiles "${LIBS[@]}" "${BINARIES[@]}" ) )
</pre>

The actual code looks even more complicated, in particular  
the everywhere used trailing 'sed' band-aid as in

<pre>
SharedObjectFiles ... | sed -e 's#^#/#'
</pre>

shows that something is not right with the SharedObjectFiles  
implementation.

During my experiments while digging around inside  
the binaries and libraries copying code I did already  
a major cleanup of that code (which "just happened"  
because I needed to understand the code ;-) and  
I will provide that cleanup in a separated pull request  
because such a cleanup needs some review.

FYI regarding "why the heck is there no quotation" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1518\#issuecomment-332508657](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1518#issuecomment-332508657)

I think in contrast to string variables  
where no quoting in 'for' loops is required  
to get each word separated

<pre>
# string="foo bar 'foo bar' baz"

# for word in $string ; do echo "'$word'" ; done
'foo'
'bar'
''foo'
'bar''
'baz'

# for word in "$string" ; do echo "'$word'" ; done
'foo bar 'foo bar' baz'
</pre>

array variables require quoting in 'for' loops  
to get the array elements correctly separated

<pre>
# arr=( foo bar 'foo bar' baz )

# for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'foo'
'bar'
'foo bar'
'baz'

# for e in ${arr[@]} ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'foo'
'bar'
'foo'
'bar'
'baz'
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1521](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1521)
merged  
the whole binaries and libraries copying code is now  
cleaned up and simplified.
