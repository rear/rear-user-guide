-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In the `create_grub2_cfg` function in
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
that is used in case of UEFI to set up GRUB2 as bootloader for the
recovery system  
do no longer let GRUB2 load the modules `video_bochs` and
`video_cirrus`  
because those are not available as GRUB2 modules in case of UEFI
(`x86_64-efi`)  
and the generic `insmod all_video` that is still there should be
sufficient for GRUB2  
cf.
