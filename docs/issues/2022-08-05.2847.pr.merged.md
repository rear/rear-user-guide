Differential ShellCheck is a GitHub action that performs differential
ShellCheck scans on files changed via PR and reports results directly in
PR.

Since this repository contains a lot of shell scripts I think you might
find it useful.

Documentation is available at:
[@redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck#readme).
Let me know If you are missing some feature or setting. I'm always happy
to extend functionality.

A general note on using ShellCheck for ReaR scripts:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1062932894](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1062932894)

Conditions for using ShellCheck for ReaR scripts:

    * show only newly introduced problems
    ...
    * do not produce too many false positives

According to "How does it work"  
[https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck\#readme](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck#readme)  
it seems "differential ShellCheck scans on files changed via PR"  
means that only the differences in ShellCheck output are reported  
so that old / already existing ShellCheck issues are not reported  
but only new ShellCheck issues because of changes in a PR.

If this is true the first condition  
"show only newly introduced problems"  
should be fulfilled with Differential-ShellCheck.

Regarding the second condition  
"do not produce too many false positives"  
see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1034576705](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1034576705)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1034978519](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1034978519)

    Efficiency is what actually matters.

How to get efficiency see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1062945160](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1062945160)

    # for e in error warning info style ; \
    do for s in usr/sbin/rear $( find usr/share/rear/ -type f -name '*.sh' ) ; \
       do shellcheck -s bash -S $e $s ;

    ...

    shellcheck.error.out
    685
    shellcheck.warning.out
    2192
    shellcheck.info.out
    6313
    shellcheck.style.out
    6588

    ...

    start with what ShellCheck considers to be an "error"
    and afterwards step by step as time permits
    we can proceed with "warning" then "info"
    and finally perhaps even "style" issues.

So what I want mandatory is that one can see  
the severity ('error' 'warning' 'info' 'style')  
of each reported ShellCheck issue.

E.g. we may initially limit reported ShellCheck issues  
only to what ShellCheck considers to be an "error"  
(if this is possible with Differential-ShellCheck)  
and watch how things behave with that for some time.

`differential-shellcheck` currently doesn't support severity option, but
it is planned to implement it and it should be really easy -

Hi @jamacku ,

Do you know why it prints such warnings?

The `severity` option was introduced in `differential-shellcheck@v2.5.0`
but the workflow was still using `@v2.4.0`. I have updated the SHA. Now
it should work correctly.

> @jamacku , what's the difference or what is better than my PR \#2754 ?

Hi @thomasmerz, looking at your PR, I see the following differences:

-   In your workflow, you are manually downloading ShellCheck sources,
    unpacking them, and executing them. This isn't the best practice, in
    my opinion. ShellCheck provides a container with everything you
    need, or you can use ShellCheck supplied by your distro. After that,
    you manually look for shell scripts in the repo and execute
    ShellCheck. All these manual steps could require future maintainers
    attention if they stop working or they want to take advantage of
    some new ShellCheck features. On the other hand, the ShellCheck
    workflow proposed in this PR uses [dedicated GitHub
    Action](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck),
    and maintainers of the rear don't have to maintain the code and
    logic behind it. It is constantly developed and updated, and new
    features are added.

-   I have also noticed that your ShellCheck workflow performs full
    scans. That is why you need to [fix all
    "defects"](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2756) to make it pass.
    This is usually quite challenging for most bigger projects since
    ShellCheck can produce a lot of "defects". Also, fixing existing
    defects in some cases could result in regressions. Meanwhile,
    ShellCheck from this PR performs differential scans and reports only
    newly added defects. This makes it easy for maintainers to adopt
    ShellCheck early and start linting incoming changes. It doesn't
    force them to fix or mute all "defects" reported by ShellCheck if
    they have existed in some cases for years, and they can focus on
    fixing real issues and defects.

-   From what I can tell, your workflow produces only text output into
    the runner's console. But this ShellCheck workflow can produce SARIF
    format and upload it directly into GitHub. You can see an example in
    the first comment of this PR.

@jamacku , now you really got me (plus after having a look at your GH
profile). You @jamacku are a full-time-developer at Red Hat, I'm just a
linux sysadm (@thomas-merz is my business account) and no developer.
BTW: I've heard of your co-workers Lukáš and Kamil from @timogoebel at
work 😃

Therefore I totally agree that your solution and maintenance will be
much better for the ReaR project over here 👍🏼  
I really like "my" workflow for my personal and much smaller projects
very well. But for this enterprise solution we really need a more
professional and better supported workflow as you can and will
provide.  
I'm really glad that I started some discussions about assuring code
quality by `shellcheck` and I really want to hand over to your solution.
So I will close my PR \#2754 to honor your PR. Please respond/give
feedback ( @gdha @jsmeix @schlomo ) if you also prefer this PR over
mine?

Just some final question:  
Will your workflow use latest `shellcheck`
[version](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/blob/1a854266f67dca1ce56debca470a1ba321d4e9d8/Dockerfile#L11)
shortly after it has been released? My workflow always use latest (which
some people like and others might dislike) because I don't want to care
about updating versions.

I will have a look if your workflow can also replace mine in my personal
(and other contributed) projects 🤷🏼‍♂️

Hi @jamacku,  
I'm still working with it and testing the Differential Shellcheck.  
The Differential Shellcheck looks good. We want to test it more
carefully for the ReaR project.

@pcahyna sent me some interesting PRs that had been merged.  
I executed them with enabled Differential SHellcheck. So I verified if
Differential Shellcheck find fixed errors.  
And the same but in reverse way, I added the errors back and verify if
Differential Shellcheck recognize it.  
Also, I tested it with different severeties.  
There some examples for original PR
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831):

[https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/336](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/336)  
[https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/333](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/333)

I sent more examples to @pcahyna and @jsmeix.

Also, I added exceptions of rules into .shllcheckrc:  
[https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/71](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/71)  
Please, ignore the fact that I disabled Packit for the testing.

Thank you,  
Anton

The solution of examining all existing defects or "defects" is really
not feasible. I recall that the original issue \#1040 triggered cleanups
of RAID code by @jsmeix and it took me lots of work to test just this
chnage (PR \#2768) because indeed, when fixing linter warnings en masse,
one risks introducing regressions, often more serious than the original
defects.

I really like this approach of checking only new stuff, thanks a lot
@jamacku for this PR.

Can you maybe also add a dependabot entry to update the pinned GitHub
actions versions? That way we won't "forget" to update.

Besides that I'd like to encourage everybody to accept this PR and to
see how it works out in "real life". I think that the risk is very low
as we can always change the configuration if there is too much pain in
future PRs. I think it wouldn't hurt ReaR as a project to be a little
bit more daring with such changes, as reverting them or modifying them
to be less problematic is not much work. And maybe it just works out
well and then everybody will be happy.

@schlomo  
when I visited Prague (triggered by Ubuntu Summit 7-9 Nov.)  
I talked in person with @pcahyna and @antonvoznia  
in particular about the "ShellCheck for ReaR" topic.

We all agree here (as far as I see).

Because "ShellCheck for ReaR" is implemented by Red Hat people  
and @pcahyna is a ReaR maintainer, he leads that whole thing.  
As far as I know he is currently rather busy with other things  
that have higher priority so I ask for patience until he gets time  
(after all "ShellCheck for ReaR" is not an urgent issue).

Hi @thomasmerz, Thanks a lot for your constructive approach and
discussion. It's nice to see such a great community of developers.

> [version](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/blob/1a854266f67dca1ce56debca470a1ba321d4e9d8/Dockerfile#L11)
> shortly after it has been released? My workflow always use latest

In the current solution, I use the [latest stable Fedora
container](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/blob/df26fb4b57b0350fe07735a8b432d0d97296cb2b/Dockerfile#L3)
as the base image for my Action. I'm using Fedora since there are a
couple more packages that I need and are currently packaged only for
Fedora. So I use the ShellCheck version that comes with Fedora. Now, my
Action uses [ShellCheck
0.8.0](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/blob/df26fb4b57b0350fe07735a8b432d0d97296cb2b/Dockerfile#L11).
But I have already created [request to update to ShellCheck
0.9.0](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/issues/158)
once it's available in Fedora 37.

Regarding updates, I usually release a new minor release (e.g. `v3.x.0`)
when I update to a new ShellCheck version. So it depends on how you are
using my Action. If you pin to a major version (e.g. `v3`), you should
always use "latest ShellCheck". If you are pinning to SHA or the exact
version, then you probably would need some dependency manager to take
care of updating.

FYI:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2768](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2768)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1062932894](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1062932894)

See in particular my comment on Mar 18  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2768\#issuecomment-1072387116](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2768#issuecomment-1072387116)

    ... now I do at least understand what the code should do

which was 10 days after my initial comment there on Mar 8.  
Before Mar 18 my attempts to fix it made things worse  
(i.e. I introduced regressions) because I did not  
understand what the code actually does.

So what is more important in practice  
than a coding style checking tool is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

    Make yourself understood

    Code must be easy to understand (answer the WHY)
    ...
    Provide comprehensive comments that
    tell what the computer should do and

Regarding "mute defects reported by ShellCheck":

In general I am against muting what ShellCheck reports.

My reasoning:  
With muting ShellCheck the issue gets only concealed  
which makes things worse because then the real issue  
will never again be reported so it will never get fixed.  
Furthermore those `shellcheck disable=SC...` comments  
encourage others to "just do the same" to deal with ShellCheck.  
In the end bad code becomes even more bad with tons of  
ugly `shellcheck disable=SC...` comments all over the place  
instead of actually fixing the root causes of issues.

Only when something reported by ShellCheck is a false positive,  
muting ShellCheck is OK but then only with an explanatory  
comment that tells WHY the particular case is as false positive.

Unfortunately it seems muting things reported by ShellCheck  
is often the immediate way how ShellCheck issues are handled  
which makes in the end all only worse (in practice nobody  
will later care about muted ShellCheck issues).

@antonvoznia is now producing examples of how will ShellCheck work in
practice (by redoing old PRs with ShellCheck turned on). See selected
examples in his reply. My plan is to take those examples and identify
which real defects have been found by ShellCheck and which "defects" are
uninteresting, or just false positives. Then he will produce statistics
of the ratio between useful and useless warnings depending on the
severity level of the tool.  
In addition, I would like to have also statistics for more PRs about the
amount of warnings and the frequency of every warning (without knowing
whether they are valid or not). This will get us some idea about the
amount of warnings we should expect from future changes.  
According to the findings we will then decide what severity level and
perhaps other settings of ShellCheck are the most appropriate, and merge
the PR. My ETA for that is half of January.

The first task (identifying which warnings are real defects and which
ones are useless) will need manual work and I expect to do that myself
(it needs someone who is familiar with the code base, so @antonvoznia
ca'nt do it by himself). (That's why the plan is to do it only for a
subset of selected PRs.) If someone else wants to contribute to this
effort, help is welcome!

Me too, and that's another good aspect of having differential checks:
you can simply ignore the results if they are not relevant and
ShellCheck won't bother you again (but in case someone decides to do a
scan in non-differential mode, ShellCheck will report the problems again
and one can reexamine them - they will not get concealed).

We will eventually need to decide what to do in these cases. A typical
example will be the unquoted expansion `$v` (v is a variable that is
either `-v` or nothing). If ShellCheck warns about unquoted expansion,
it is a false positive. But annotating every occurrence of this with a
"shellcheck disable" comment and an explanation will lead to lots of
such annotations in the code.

Regarding unquoted variables:

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1034870262](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1034870262)  
we had on Feb 10

    3717 SC2086

where SC2086  
[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086)  
is "Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting"

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1062945160](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1062945160)

    shellcheck.info.out
    ...
    3717 SC2086

SC2086 is only of `info` severity for ShellCheck.

I think at least for now we don't need to care about it  
because I think we should start with what ShellCheck  
considers to be an "error" and afterwards  
step by step as time permits we can proceed  
with "warning" and later perhaps "info" and  
finally perhaps even "style" but "style" sounds  
questionable (if not even "calling for dispute").

In particular regarding

    command $v ...

[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086)  
shows how one could make safe code for it via

    command "${v[@]}" ...

or

    command ${v:+"-v"} ...

but now the code looks ugly which contradicts  
"Code must be easy to read" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
and  
it is likely even inexplicable for unexperienced users

    What the heck does that "${v[@]}" or ${v:+"-v"} thingy do
    and why the hell do they need to use that stuff here?

which contadicts  
"Code must be easy to understand (answer the WHY)" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
and I don't want to have a lengthy explanation comment  
at each code place where e.g. '$v' is used unquoted.

My plan for integrating this is as follows:  
@antonvoznia did some research on configuration adjustements needed. I
will let him clean up and rebase his branch (
[https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/tree/differential-shellcheck](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/tree/differential-shellcheck)

I have three main questions:

1.  where to we maintain and discuss our shellcheck rules?
2.  how do we teach shellcheck to consider Bash 4.1 as "reference" as we
    will support those old versions for quite some time?
3.  we use a large amount of Bashism that shellcheck complains about,
    and where I really don't see a benefit to follow the recommendation.
    Do we plan to exclude all those rules, or will we plaster ReaR code
    with shellcheck overrides? Or adapt ReaR code to match shellchecks
    coding guidelines?

I was quiet so far on this topic due to lack of practical experience,
but recently I wrote some more ReaR code in VS Code with shellcheck
active and I found it more annoying then helpful.

Some examples for that:

-   nearly every variable is marked as "unused" because it is used in
    another file that shellcheck of course can't know about
-   every unquoted variable is an error, but in many cases we actually
    know that we don't need to quote it because it is a system path or
    has other content where we created it and know that it won't contain
    spaces. Unquoted variables however are still easier to read and
    faster to type
-   every use of `local` is an error because shellcheck can't know that
    all our scripts are run inside a function
-   every beginning of a script file is an error because there is no
    shebang
-   we use `var=( $(something))` in many - many - places and the word
    splitting happening there is often quite intentional. I personally
    don't see the value of alternatives like
    `read -a var < <(something)`. Quite the opposite, our syntax
    preserves potential errors while the `read` syntax doesn't:

<!-- -->

    $ var=($(uname -a ; false)); echo $PIPESTATUS
    1
    $ read -a var < <(uname -a ; false); echo $PIPESTATUS
    0

There is probably more, my point is that as much as I love code quality,
I really don't know how much useful stuff will be left if we globally
disable all the rules that I touched in this short list of things which
annoyed me recently.

What I would like to see for this PR is therefore also the part of the
global shellcheck rules, or at least deciding where we maintain those.

Also a big shout out of thank you for those who spent already so much
time fixing shellcheck issues, as marked in our [release
notes](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

From my experience, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040\#issuecomment-1062932894](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1040#issuecomment-1062932894)  
I think when we globally disable all ShellCheck codes  
where ShellCheck reports too many false positives,  
a lot will still be left where things that ShellCheck reports  
point to real issues (usually "point to" but not "are").

I think automated usage of ShellCheck does not require  
that ShellCheck must detect very most of real issues.  
I think it is already helpful when automated ShellCheck  
detects "some" issues (for some reasonable amount of "some").  
I.e. better some automated help than none at all.

    In usr/sbin/rear line 232:

                                                      ^-----^ SC2154 (warning): option is referenced but not assigned.

so some ShellCheck 'warning' reports are actually bugs  
which proves  
[https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

    As a programmer I might not want to decide
    for the user if some problem is an ERROR or not.
    The obvious solution is to issue a WARNING in an attempt
    to shed the responsibility of making a decision.
    ...
    But in an automated world ... WARNINGS for most cases only create
    extra manual work because somebody needs to go and check

I don't know if theoretically a perfect ShellCheck could be made  
that can decide if a referenced but not assigned variable is an error  
or if this is impossible for the bash scripting language.

I meant that we can neither rely on that  
a ShellCheck 'error' is actually an error  
(because SC2168 is almost always a false positive)

Huge thanks @jsmeix for this detailed analysis!

What I take away from it is the following:

1.  we need to create a `.shellcheckrc` file (or maybe `shellcheckrc` to
    support running it as snap) with our specific configuration of
    -   `shell=bash`
    -   disabling checks we don't want to get alerts for, e.g. those
        that are mostly false positives
2.  it will take a bit of fine-tuning the rules as more commits/PRs come
    in and we shouldn't be worried about it but simply do it

I'd like to propose merging this PR as soon as the RC file is added so
that we get started. It won't prevent anything but add valuable
visibility, improving the quality of ReaR.

@schlomo The creation of meaningful ShellCheck defaults has nothing to
do with @jamacku who is just the author of Differential ShellCheck.
AFAIK, the defaults should be/have been created by @antonvoznia as part
of his master thesis which @pcahyna supervised \[1\]. So we should wait
on their input instead.

Hi, I will meet with @antonvoznia this week to discuss the merging of
his work and if there is no progress, I will take care of merging it
myself.  
(Sorry @schlomo , I agree that it is rather overdue.)

merging - @antonvoznia please prepare a PR with your shellcheck
configuration additions.

@schlomo the ShellCheck RC files are in \#2976. I will merge it without
much delay, because I don't want to keep ShellCheck enabled without
configuration for too long - it would lead to annoying noise in any
future PRs. We can discuss further adjustments separately.

Thanks, fully agree with your approach
