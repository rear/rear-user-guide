Currently OBS Archiving:Backup:Rear contains the  
old and outdated ReaR versions 2.4 and 2.5 and 2.6

    # osc list Archiving:Backup:Rear

    ebiso
    rear-2.4
    rear-2.5
    rear-2.6
    rear-2.7

I wonder if those rather old ReaR versions  
are still needed by any user "out there"?

I suggest to remove ReaR versions 2.4 and 2.5.

I would like to keep the current latest ReaR release 2.7  
and one before that i.e. ReaR 2.6 but normally not more.

When a new ReaR version is released, e.g. assume it is 'ReaR 2.8'  
then we should keep the older ReaR 2.7 and 2.6 for some time  
(e.g. some weeks or a few month) but finally we should  
remove the oldest one (i.e. 2.6 in this example)  
to get to the "current one plus one older" state  
(i.e. 2.8 and 2.7 in this example).

Cf. the similar cleanup issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3056](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3056)  
and see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289\#issuecomment-2242912000](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289#issuecomment-2242912000)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289\#issuecomment-2243093772](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289#issuecomment-2243093772)  
how old sources in OBS that stay unchanged  
for a longer time (more than a year or so)  
cause unexpected issues for our users and  
likely needless maintenance efforts for us.

No news (in particular no objections) is good news  
so I did right now:

    # osc list Archiving:Backup:Rear
    ebiso
    rear-2.4
    rear-2.5
    rear-2.6
    rear-2.7

    # osc rdelete -m "removed old and outdated rear-2.4 \
     see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3290" \
     Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.4

    # osc rdelete -m "removed old and outdated rear-2.5 \
     see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3290" \
     Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.5

    # osc list Archiving:Backup:Rear
    ebiso
    rear-2.6
    rear-2.7
