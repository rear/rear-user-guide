DeaR @rear/contributors I'd like to collect your thoughts on the
following proposal to create a portable rear recovery solution.

Problem
-------

The problem to solve is to use `rear recover` based on another
(non-ReaR) rescue system instead of the ReaR rescue system. The reasons
are due to corporate requirements of a customer environment or due to
software compatibility problems between the ReaR rescue system and
proprietary backup software.

Solution Approach
-----------------

The idea is to create a new `OUTPUT=PORTABLE` method that will produce
an "ReaR Portable Recovery" archive containing

-   `/etc/rear`
-   `/usr/share/rear`
-   `/usr/sbin/rear`
-   `/var/lib/rear`

For recovery the user would to the following:

1.  start the recovery system from their rescue solution, e.g. the
    [System Rescue CD](https://www.system-rescue.org/)
2.  configure the system to work in the network and have the same
    identity as the original system (`$HOSTNAME` etc.)
3.  install - if needed - the proprietary backup agent or other software
    required for the recovery
4.  unpack the ReaR portable bundle to `/`
5.  run `rear recover` as usual

I expect users to potentially run into trouble with the automated
migration of hardware IDs for network, but for simple cases I expect
this to "just work".

What do you think? What did I forget?

@schlomo  
I like the generic idea very much.

My reason (as far as I understand it) is that  
with OUTPUT=PORTABLE it is possible to separate what belongs to  
the ReaR recovery installer (i.e. what "rear recover" needs)  
from what belongs to ReaR's bootable rescue system  
so implementing it will help to get our code cleaner  
via Keep Separated Items Separated ("KSIS").

Only an offhanded thought FYI  
regarding

    4. unpack the ReaR portable bundle to /

I wonder if this may overwrite things  
in the non-ReaR rescue system?

Therefore I am wondering if it is possible  
that also "rear recover" could run from within any directory  
as "rear mkbackup" can, e.g. in a git checkout directory like

    git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
    cd rear
    vi etc/rear/local.conf
    usr/sbin/rear mkbackup

If this is possible, then with OUTPUT=PORTABLE  
it could be possible to

    4. unpack the ReaR portable bundle to any directory
       and change into that directory
    5. in that directory run "usr/sbin/rear recover"

What I mean is to get what belongs to  
ReaR's recovery installer (i.e. what "rear recover" needs)  
separated from what belongs to the non-ReaR rescue system.

The idea behind is that what "rear recover" needs  
could be different what there is in the non-ReaR rescue system,  
e.g. "rear recover" may need certain specific binaries  
like the exact binaries from the original system  
and not whatever binaries in the non-ReaR rescue system.

Or in other words:  
How to ensure that what there is in the non-ReaR rescue system  
is what "rear recover" needs?

Update: Started to work on this in `portable-recovery` branch. After
some twiddling I got this far with a SystemRescueCD.

In this test it failed to install the boot loaded because ReaR thinks it
is running on Arch Linux (SysRescueCD) and not the restored OS.

Looks promising, but I need to make the system read the `os.conf` stuff
from the recovery info and not from the rescue system. Good opportunity
to finally get rid of the `os.conf` in `/etc/rear` ðŸ˜ƒ

Your thoughts are welcome.
