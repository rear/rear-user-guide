In current ReaR master code we have various 300\_copy\_kernel.sh scripts

<pre>
# find usr/share/rear/ | grep 300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Fedora/ia64/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64le/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-i386/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Debian/ia64/300_copy_kernel.sh
</pre>

that get run in a Linux distribution dependant way via their sub
directories  
according to the $ARCH variable (and other general variables)  
by the SourceStage function (in
usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh).

Additionally usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-i386/300\_copy\_kernel.sh  
and usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64le/300\_copy\_kernel.sh  
and usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64/300\_copy\_kernel.sh  
contain Linux distribution dependant cases by code like

<pre>
    if [ -r "/boot/vmlinuz-$KERNEL_VERSION" ]; then
        ...
    elif [ -f /etc/redhat-release ]; then
        ...
    elif [ -f /etc/debian_version ]; then
        ...
    elif [ -f /etc/arch-release ]; then
        ...
    elif [ -f /etc/gentoo-release ]; then
        ...
</pre>

But to distinguish Linux distribution dependant cases usually the
variables  
OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR OS\_VENDOR OS\_VENDOR\_VERSION and so on  
should be used see the SetOSVendorAndVersion function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh how those variables are set.  
For example how those variables are used see the
get\_part\_device\_name\_format function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh that contains (excerpt):

<pre>
            case $OS_MASTER_VENDOR in
                (SUSE)
                    ...
                ;;
                (Fedora)
                    ...
                ;;
                (Debian)
                    ...
                ;;
                (*)
                    ....
                ;;
            esac
</pre>

Accordingly this way should also be used in this case here if possible.

@jsmeix then we should also move this script to the `default`
sub-directory.

@gdha  
I didn't had a closer look how those scrips are same and where they
differ  
and I guess I won't find time for that before ReaR 2.5 gets released
but  
because current things work there is no hurry (therefore 'ReaR future').

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1983\#issuecomment-442395004](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1983#issuecomment-442395004)  
indicates that the current mess is a minor bug because  
400\_guess\_kernel.sh is run after 300\_copy\_kernel.sh  
which - offhandedly - looks just plain wrong to me...

@jsmeix,

Comparing 300\_copy\_kernel.sh and 400\_guess\_kernel.sh, the output
looks somehow similar:

    diff $r/pack/Linux-i386/300_copy_kernel.sh $r/pack/GNU/Linux/400_guess_kernel.sh
    1c1

    ---
    > # guess kernel if not set yet or error out, for diverse Architectures (arm, aarch64, etc.)

    <     if [ -f /etc/slackware-version ]; then

    <         if [ -f "/boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/vmlinuz" ]; then
    <            KERNEL_FILE="/boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/vmlinuz"
    <         elif [ -r "/boot/vmlinuz-$KERNEL_VERSION" ]; then
    <             KERNEL_FILE="/boot/vmlinuz-$KERNEL_VERSION"
    <         else 
    <            Error "Could not find a matching kernel in /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware or /boot!"
    <         fi
    <     elif [ -r "/boot/vmlinuz-$KERNEL_VERSION" ]; then
    ---
    >     if [ -r "/boot/vmlinuz-$KERNEL_VERSION" ]; then

These files serves similar purpose, and could be IMHO merged.

Because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1983\#issuecomment-442408993](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1983#issuecomment-442408993)  
I think we should set the KERNEL\_FILE variable in the 'prep' stage  
in a single script that does "the right thing"  
and remove our current various 300\_copy\_kernel.sh scripts  
(except output/USB/Linux-i386/830\_copy\_kernel\_initrd.sh)  
i.e. remove

<pre>
usr/share/rear/pack/Fedora/ia64/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Debian/ia64/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64le/300_copy_kernel.sh
usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-i386/300_copy_kernel.sh
</pre>

because they do not copy the kernel into the recovery system  
but only also set the KERNEL\_FILE variable in various ways.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985)  
intends to get this issue (plus

fixed.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985)
merged  
this issue is hopefully fixed - if not I will of course fix regressions.
