Reported by hreif as
SF\#[2939418](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2939418&group_id=171835&atid=859455)

In verify/TSM/default/40\_verify\_tsm.sh user has 30 secs to enter the
number for the filespaces to recover. For more complex setups this is
not enough, especially if not all filesystems are to be recovered (e.g.
they are non-locallly)

Therefore I added a timed question whether he want to change
something.  
If he wants then user has all the time he needs to choose the right
spaces.

In principle,
verify/TSM/default/39\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh
has the same problem, but there 30 secs might be enough for entering a
date there.

An interesting discussion and code examples are provided in the original
feature request at
SF\#[2939418](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2939418&group_id=171835&atid=859455)

SF tracker has been disabled for this project. Are those code snippets
and discussions preserved?

Yes, we have a backup of all content. There does not seem to be an
option to leave the SF tracker in read-only mode, so I decided to
disable it to prevent people from reporting issues there. (Only a
handful of issues from SF are open, so the impact was not that big)

Is there something specific you like ? I can try to copy&paste the
original content, but it might not be that easy :-/

I was just curious, where my script went ;-)

In fact I was looking for the current version in order to update our  
private 1.7.22d version. I found that the 40\_verify\_tsm.sh patch was  
missing and that both dr/GNU/Linux/10\_describe\_diskbyid\_mappings.sh
and  
finalize/GNU/Linux/16\_remove\_diskbyid.sh (other Ticket) were not
present.  
So I raised my voice ;-)

Another thing: there is still the old webpage like  
[http://rear.sourceforge.net/documentation.php](http://rear.sourceforge.net/documentation.php)
which doesn'T point to the  
new location (okay, deep linking sometimes guides you wrong ;-)

Viele Grüsse

@hreif Let me know if I should bring anything back from SF though !

And yes, the old website should disappear (or redirect). The current
implementation is problematic (to say the least). I will open another
ticket for this. Thanks for reporting !

@hreif Has everything being restored (patches/updates)? Otherwise, we
can close this issue, right?

In the `conf/default.conf` file we introduced (since rear-1.15) a new
variable:

    # some external backup software give you the opportunity to enter paths to exclude ...
    # we tend to use a timer in seconds we wait before continuing (we do not want to break the automated restores)
    WAIT_SECS=30

With this the original question has been fulfilled - we're good to
finally close this issue.

Hmm. Maybe we should name the parameter something like  
"INTERACTIVE\_PROMPT\_TIMEOUT"? Much more explaining what it does...
