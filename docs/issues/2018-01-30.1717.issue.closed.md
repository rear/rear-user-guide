HI,  
Maybe you could upgrade to ReaR &gt;= 2.2.  
There was
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1418](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1418)
implemented which might solve your issue.

This is a captious one, I had 8 machines and only 2 were affected (but
not always).

Ok. Is the best way to update to run “yum update pkgname” ??

@techadmin7 Do you have a support contract with RedHat? If yes, please
open an incident for this with RH so that they can fix their ReaR
version too.  
If you want to test the latest stable version of rear go to our Download
page and select the proper OS -  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RHEL\_7/x86\_64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RHEL_7/x86_64/)

@techadmin7  
we cannot tell you what the best way is how to upgrade  
a particular software on your particular Linux distribution.  
For such kind of Linux distribution specific questions  
you may better ask at your particular Linux distribution.

In general regarding ReaR version upgrades see the section  
"Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In general regarding debugging issues in ReaR see the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

FYI  
how you could test the current ReaR GitHub master code  
without get things messed up with an already installed  
ReaR software package:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

When the issue still appears with the current ReaR GitHub master code  
provide your complete etc/rear/local.conf and a "rear -D mkbackup" log
file, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Debugging\_issues\_with\_Relax-and-Recover](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Debugging_issues_with_Relax-and-Recover)

@gdha I do have a contract with Redhat. I have opened a case just
waiting for there response. Thank you for your advise.
