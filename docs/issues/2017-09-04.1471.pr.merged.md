Now rescue/default/900\_clone\_users\_and\_groups.sh  
should match
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
plus some possible bug fixes (more fail safe - hopefully)  
and a better description in default.conf

Please wait - it is not yet tested...

@N3WWN  
have a look if you think it is also o.k. this way  
for your

I tested it and it seems to work at least for me.

If there are no furious objections ;-)  
I like to merge it soon...

@schlomo  
whoops!  
I clicked in my browser "reload page"  
but it did not show your comments  
so that I have merged it now "as is".

That CLONE\_ALL\_USERS\_GROUPS  
replaces the CLONE\_USERS and CLONE\_GROUPS  
is what was and still is documented in default.conf  
and what was and still is implemented.  
My changes should not change the behaviour  
compared to wat it was directly before my changes.

It continues with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472)  
but only minor adaptions there - no change in behaviour.  
Because it still works as it worked before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1471](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1471)  
(at least according to what I see)  
I close this one as "fixed".  
Of course if I implemented *new* bugs  
with my pull requests, then I will fix them.

Yup, looks good to me, @jsmeix ! The changes that I suggested for issues
I ran into when work on the YUM backup method are taken into account, so
I'm happy.
