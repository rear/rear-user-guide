#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): rear-2.4-7

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): RHEL7.7 / Centos 7.7

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    KVM guest

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    GRUB

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    local disk

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Using ReaR to backup the system and creating a bootable recovery
    image, select "Automatic Recover <Node Name>" from the GRUB menu,
    complete the recovery process and reboot the server. Upon first
    boot, the system will throw an error from selinux stating that it
    can not find its policy file.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Selecting manual recovery seem to complete the recovery correctly
    without any issues, possible race condition.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):  
    Working on getting logs.

@Toure  
does it behave reproducible?  
I.e. when you test it several times does then the issue  
always happen when you select `Automatic Recover`  
in the ReaR recovery system bootloader menue  
but it never happens when you launch "rear recover" manually?

I ask because I cannot imagine what the reason could be.

As far as I see the only difference between `Automatic Recover`  
and launching "rear recover" manually is coded in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup)  
which is run (as /etc/scripts/system-setup) during ReaR recovery system
startup  
and all what it does is to launch "rear recover" automatically, so there
should  
be no difference what "rear recover" does.

For a real analysis inspect your "rear -D recover" debug log files  
and compare in particular the SELinux related messages therein  
for both cases (i.e. when it fails versus when it works).

Those are the SELinux related files in ReaR:

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/selinux
    usr/share/rear/restore/default/500_selinux_autorelabel.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/500_selinux_autorelabel.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/Linux-i386/510_selinux_fixfiles_exclude_dirs.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/600_restore_selinux_contexts.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/403_binds_for_selinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/FDRUPSTREAM/default/270_selinux_considerations.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/RSYNC/GNU/Linux/200_selinux_in_use.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/GNU/Linux/610_start_selinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/GNU/Linux/310_stop_selinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/GNU/Linux/600_start_selinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/YUM/default/600_capture_selinux_contexts.sh

What is actually run in your case depends on your backup/restore method.

I cannot actually help with SELinux specific issues  
because I do not use SELinux but I know that every now and then  
there have been SELinux related issues with ReaR, cf.  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
and we have `BACKUP_SELINUX_DISABLE`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1064](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1064)  
but I don't know if that could be at all related to this issue here.

@jsmeix Thanks for responding I may have found the issue, still testing.
It has to do with the option for NETFS:  
" \# Disable SELinux policy during backup with NETFS or RSYNC (default
yes)  
BACKUP\_SELINUX\_DISABLE=1"

I am not sure why this does effect the manual recovery, but if the above
flag is disabled, that is if it is set to "0" then the recovery seems to
work. As I mentioned I am still trying to test and re-test to make sure,
but so far that has been to only fix so far.

@Toure Strange - the ReaR Automated Testing project is using the
automatic recovery for years already and I never had difficulties with
SELinux so far.  
Did you have the time for doing re-tests? And results to share with
us?  
Thanks.

@gdha sorry for the delay we have not been able to reproduce the issue.
