The checklayout workflow is special because  
it sets EXIT\_CODE=1 when the disk layout has changed  
or when configuration files have changed  
but that exit code 1 is no error but meant as a signal  
that things have changed which require a new ISO image  
so that users can run "rear checklayout || rear mkrescue"
