##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Critical**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2611 \#782 \#465

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On CentOS 7 or CentOS 8:

    -   backup and restore with backup on ISO and ISO stored on
        `OUTPUT_URL=sftp://`
    -   backup to NFS with several reproducers for \#2611 :
        -   overriding `umount` by a function that does nothing and
            inserting a script that kills ReaR before unmounting URLs,
            thus triggering the exit tasks
            -   both in backup and output stages (bug was present only
                in the output stage)
        -   inserting a script that blocks umount by spawning a long
            running process with its cwd inside the temporary mountpoint
            `$BUILD_DIR/outputfs`
            -   both in backup and output stages (bug was present only
                in the output stage)
        -   overriding `umount` by a function that does nothing and
            returns an error
            -   only in the output stage
    -   backup to NFS without any bug reproducer
    -   complete backup and restore with rsync over ssh (`BACKUP=RSYNC`)
    -   backup to sshfs (`BACKUP=NETFS` `BACKUP_URL=sshfs://...`)
    -   mkrescue with `OUTPUT=PXE` and several reproducers  
        `PXE_TFTP_URL: nfs://...`, `PXE_CONFIG_URL: nfs://`. Reproducers
        consist of overriding `umount` by a function that does nothing
        and returns an error
        -   before `800_copy_to_tftp.sh`
        -   before `810_create_pxelinux_cfg.sh`
    -   mkrescue with `OUTPUT=PXE` and no bug reproducer  
        `PXE_TFTP_URL: nfs://...`, `PXE_CONFIG_URL: nfs://`

In the case of reproducers I chceked that other directories under the
mountpoint do not get removed. In the case of no reproducers I checked
that the proces completes successfully, and also that the build dir is
correctly removed and that ReaR does not create and remove useless
`$BUILD_DIR/outputfs` with URL schemes that do not need it (`rsync://`,
`sftp://`).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Cleanup of temporary mount point handling, particularly for output.
Unification of mount point umount and cleanup - move to the
`mount_url()` and `umount_url()` functions, callers do not need to worry
about it, resulting in huge deduplication (demultiplication), this
concerns both the normal path and the error path (exit tasks). Replaced
the various `rm -rf` of the mountpoint by `rmdir` (this fixes \#2611)
and added lazy umount in case normal umount does not succeed. If build
dir is kept, propose a safe way to remove it to the user
(`rm -Rf --one-file-system` instead of just `rm -Rf` where the user
would risk to remove everything in their mounted filesystem if still
mounted.)

Stop creating the empty mountpoint (`$BUILD_DIR/outputfs`) for schemes
that do not need to mount anything (`rsync://` or anything "ftp-like".)

Fixes also some other bugs noted in the process: filesystem-specific
umount command not called
([https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20359a987662cc0c3fcfa52d62d1feac7cd55850\#r51319634](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20359a987662cc0c3fcfa52d62d1feac7cd55850#r51319634))
, unknown schemes considered invalid (noted in discussion under \#932).

Identical scripts under `DUPLICITY` and `YUM` were replaced by symlinks
to increase code sharing.

Reverts \#782 (the change that introduced bug \#2611) and \#578 - it is
not clear how .lockfile can exist in the unmounted filesystem, and if it
does, it is a bug.

During the work on this branch I have found many other issues that are
not fixed in this PR (to keep the amount changes manageable). They are:

1.  Unexpected use of `local` backup scheme in RBME:
    5d85fc250232921bf314643e22b210b71996884f
2.  Probably wrong symlink in BLOCKCLONE: PR \#1172 , commit
    a4ab7406e653406c010c58a232f898d1ea85e592 @gozora
3.  Duplicate script in PXE: d850c4094238a03c9b926b88d7e1582ecd28af52
4.  UEFI seems to have broken OBDR support:
    41efc97eb7141c30455df45a871b98cd08e09fa7
5.  OBDR probably got broken on ppc64le:
    4ef0f30156f0afea4a02d12f40c2c9d18cbe5e43, PR \#1383
6.  `OUTPUT_MOUNTCMD` got broken by commit
    6cd218ae30601eb56098b22581345f6ea8fe0aa2, see
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20359a987662cc0c3fcfa52d62d1feac7cd55850\#r51375233](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/20359a987662cc0c3fcfa52d62d1feac7cd55850#r51375233)
7.  `OUTPUT_UMOUNTCMD` is not called in exit tasks on error
8.  Possible problems with `.lockfile`: PR \#578 - what is `.lockfile`
    actually used for? What if `$OUTPUT_URL = $BACKUP_URL` but
    `$OUTPUT_PREFIX != $NETFS_PREFIX` ? What if
    `NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY` is set and `KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY` is
    unset? Also, it seems that `opath.old` created by a run that aborts
    will then be removed entirely by a subsequent run, because the
    lockfile will get removed by `150_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh`,
    resulting in no working backup.
    `backup/NETFS/default/250_create_lock.sh` claims that it "creates a
    lockfile in $NETFS\_PREFIX to avoid that mkrescue overwrites
    ISO/LOGFILE made by a previous mkbackup run when the variable
    NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY has been set", but it is not clear
    how this gets achieved in the code.
9.  backup log gets copied to `${opath}` even if `${opath}` is an empty
    string (can happen when backing up to a tape), resulting in dropping
    the log to the root directory:
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2433c72f614af5b22547d6bd873ff4d224901a2c/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh\#L357](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2433c72f614af5b22547d6bd873ff4d224901a2c/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh#L357)
10. FDRUPSTREAM seems to copy a file to the output location when it is
    not mounted yet: \#2142 @mutable-dan

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for that huge cleanup and severe bugfix work!

I will have a look as time permits but possibly it gets delayed until
next week.

@gdha @rmetrich and all @rear/contributors  
I would much appreciate it if you find some time and have a look.  
Perhaps you spot this or that issue by plain looking at the code?

Regarding "Impact: Urgent (Is Urgent higher than Critical?)"  
Personally I think Urgent issues have higher timing priority than
Critical issues  
because Urgent means actual time pressure right now while Critical does
not  
necessarily imply time pressure but Critical could imply time pressure
indirectly.  
In this particular case I think the issue is Critical (because possible
loss of data)  
but not actually Urgent (because no current end-user case who has the
issue).

@pcahyna LGTM! I recall explicitly copying the files instead of using
symlinks in case the files were still in a state of flux (the ZIPPER
method was pretty new at the time) and I didn't want to force others to
test the YUM method. Now that these methods have been shown to be out of
active change/development, I think it's safe to convert the files to
symlinks. Thanks!

@N3WWN thanks for the review. Note though that the symlinked files are
not those copied from ZYPPER (those usually have some modifications, al
least s/ZYPPER/YUM/), but from NETFS. It would be nice to share files
between ZYPPER and YUM, but it would take more work.

Yes, you're correct. It's been a minute since I've really looked at the
code, but still LGTM even after my mistaken reference ;)

@pcahyna concerning OBDR - I cannot recall anyone ever used this
(besides myself when I implemented this &gt;10yrs ago and since then
never used nor tested). I would even vote to remove this from ReaR (why
maintaining if not used)?  
Lots of changes - so we will see how these behave after a while ;-)  
The problem with ReaR is/was it tries to do good for too many people
without the needed backup/help from the community and then small
mistakes creep in... It is good to clean up the code.  
And for that a big kudo for @pcahyna and @jsmeix

@gdha Do new tape drives support OBDR, or is it something that HP
dropped a long time ago? If it got dropped, I am for removing it. If it
is still supported on reasonably modern hardware, I could try
resurrecting it.

FYI regarding OBDR:  
At SUSE we got in July 2018 a customer issue report about

    ReaR OUTPUT=OBDR support missing for PPC64LE (needs to be implemented)

on SLES12 SP2 with SAP on PPC64LE using ReaR 1.18 which resulted  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1868](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1868)

In our SUSE internal issue report I found this piece of information:

    Tape drive is a IBM 7226 multimedia enclosure
    It is not clear at this time if it supports OBDR ...
    since 7226 multimedia enclosure seems
    no function of OBDR(not sure)

cf.
[https://www.ibm.com/products/7226-multimedia-enclosure](https://www.ibm.com/products/7226-multimedia-enclosure)  
and
[https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XQ1DVZJP](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XQ1DVZJP)  
where none of them contain `OBDR` so it seems  
a IBM 7226 multimedia enclosure does not support OBDR.

There was no further info whether or not that drive actually supports
OBDR  
or any further info how far OBDR actually worked for them, cf.

That being said we never got a complaint it wasn't working (and I'm
pretty sure it is broken in the meantime) - IMHO I'm in favor of
removing it altogether. @dagwieers Do you mind if it was gone as you
were the only one ever used by my knowledge?
