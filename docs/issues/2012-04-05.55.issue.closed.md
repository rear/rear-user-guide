=============================================================================================================

Currently the `EXCLUDE_*` variables only require a component-prefix in
those cases where it is ambiguous. By requiring all components to be
prefixed, we remove the inconsistency from the syntax.So instead of
`/dev/vg_data`, it would become `vg:vg_data`

Example:

    EXCLUDE_BACKUP=( "fs:/data" )
    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "vg:vg_san" )
    EXCLUDE_RESTORE=( "fs:/tmp" )

PS This affects \#54

@jhoekx as far I can see in the current code "fs:/mnt-point" is already
being processed by the exclude code parts:  
`./layout/prepare/default/61_exclude_from_restore.sh`,
`./layout/save/default/34_generate_mountpoint_device.sh`

However, I couldn't find a link to "vg:vg\_san" (guessing in
`./layout/save/default/31_include_exclude.sh`)  
Am I missing something? Or can we close this issue?

@dagwieers @jhoekx Do you still see the need of this request, or can we
close it?

Re-open this issue when we found a sponsor to implement this missing
feature
