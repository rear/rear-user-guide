-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/save/GNU/Linux/100\_create\_layout\_file.sh  
call 'lsblk' with 'MOUNTPOINTS' with plural 'S'  
to show all mounted btrfs subvolumes  
in contrast to 'MOUNTPOINT' that shows only  
a random one of the mounted btrfs subvolumes.

    `-/dev/vda3 virtio part swap       2G [SWAP]

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

    /dev/sr0    sata   rom  iso9660 84.1M

    |-/dev/vda2 virtio part btrfs     13G /usr/local
    `-/dev/vda3 virtio part swap       2G [SWAP]

So 'MOUNTPOINT' is misleading when several btrfs subvolumes  
of one btrfs are mounted because the 'MOUNTPOINT' output  
looks as if the btrfs on /dev/vda2 is only mounted at  
the mountpoint /var on my original SLES16-SP6 test VM  
versus it looks as if the btrfs on /dev/vda2 is only mounted  
at the mountpoint /usr/local on my other test VM  
after "rear recover" of my original SLES16-SP6 test VM  
but actually several btrfs subvolumes of the btrfs  
on /dev/vda2 are mounted at several mountpoints  
which are same on my other test VM after "rear recover"  
as they have been on my original SLES16-SP6 test VM  
so only the 'MOUNTPOINTS' output shows that "rear recover"  
did everything right while in contrast the 'MOUNTPOINT'  
output looks as if "rear recover" did something wrong.

@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate it if you could have a look here  
because I would like to have this included in ReaR 2.8  
to avoid the misleading 'lsblk ... MOUNTPOINT' output  
when several btrfs subvolumes of one btrfs  
are mounted at several mountpoints.

Where the 'lsblk' option 'MOUNTPOINTS' works  
for me on SUSE/openSUSE:

'lsblk ... MOUNTPOINTS' works on my SLES15 SP5 test VM  
and on my openSUSE Leap 15.5 workstation where both have  
lsblk from util-linux 2.37.4

'lsblk ... MOUNTPOINTS' also works on my SLES15 SP4 test VM  
with lsblk from util-linux 2.37.2

'lsblk ... MOUNTPOINTS' fails on my SLES12 SP5 test VM  
with lsblk from util-linux 2.33.2

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,MOUNTPOINTS || echo $?
    lsblk: unknown column: MOUNTPOINTS
    1

Only FYI because it could be of interest:

At least on SLES12-SP5 'lsblk'

    # lsblk --version

    lsblk from util-linux 2.33.2

fails with a wrong error message when 'MOUNTPOINTS' is used:

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINTS,UUID,WWN
    lsblk: unknown column: MOUNTPOINTS,UUID,WWN

which looks as if MOUNTPOINTS and UUID and WWN are unknown columns  
but actually only MOUNTPOINTS is an unknown column:

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,UUID,WWN
