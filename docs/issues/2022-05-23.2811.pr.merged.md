-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This is basically same as  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735)  
but without PRE\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS and POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS

For the reasoning see

@rmetrich what do you think? The advantage of this approach is that it
avoids the problematic part of \#2735 and still allows to make progress
with the arguably more important part: recovery commands. (The
disadvantage is that it introduces an asymmetry between
`PRE/POST_RECOVERY` and `PRE/POST_BACKUP`.)

@jsmeix I don't entirely agree with your assessment that

This may be true for `mkbackuponly` but not for `mkbackup`: one may have
a need to execute a command after the rescue image is created, but
before the backup is taken, and there is no way to do that with
`mkbackup` other than using `PRE_BACKUP`. (One might circumvent it by
splitting the task into `mkrescue` && `mkbackuponly`, but we saw
recently that separating backup from layout creation has its own
problems.)

Regarding

    The disadvantage is that it introduces an asymmetry
    between PRE/POST_RECOVERY and PRE/POST_BACKUP

The asymmetry is an unfortunate consequence because  
PRE/POST\_RECOVERY behave different than PRE/POST\_BACKUP  
because the latter "mess around" with exit tasks  
and that different behaviour results that  
PRE/POST\_BACKUP\_COMMANDS cannot be cleanly implemented  
(at least not with reasonable effort).

Yes, you are right.  
The only way would be

    rear mkrescue && COMMAND && rear mkbackuponly

Regarding

    separating backup from layout creation has its own problems

yes, but only if the basic system was changed  
between backup and layout creation, so

    rear mkrescue && COMMAND && rear mkbackuponly

should be reasonably safe  
(provided COMMAND does not change the basic system).

By the way:  
What is also not such a good idea is  
to change the basic system  
while "rear mkbackup" is running :-)

I included the changes from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2789](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2789)  
so this pull request would obsolete the other one  
if this pull request could be merged.

@pcahyna @rmetrich  
if you do not object against it I would like to merge  
this pull request tomorrow afternoon  
because it is at least a step forward and  
it solves the initially reported issue in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735\#issue-1089733641](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2735#issue-1089733641)
