In order to improve usability of packages in Fedora, project Man Page
Scan was created and its task is to provide consistency of man pages
(and documentation in general). The results are now available for
package maintainers to fix documentation issues.

If you need to re-run the check yourself, here is the simple process of
man page check:

1.  Download man-page-day from:

    [https://pagure.io/ManualPageScan/blob/master/f/man-page-day.sh](https://pagure.io/ManualPageScan/blob/master/f/man-page-day.sh)

2.  Run the script:

<!-- -->

    $ /home/gdha/Downloads/man-page-day.sh rear
    Current version of package:
    rear-2.4-26.git.0.9a6f640.unknown.el7.x86_64

    checking whether binary files have man pages:

    [ OK ] binary /usr/sbin/rear has man page /usr/share/man/man8/rear.8.gz
    [ Warn ] man page is in section 8. Only commands requiring admin privileges, or deamons should be in this section, the rest should be in section 1

    checking whether config files have man pages:

    [ Error ] config file /etc/cron.d/rear has no man page! Check it's content for proper documentation
    [ Error ] config file /etc/rear/local.conf has no man page! Check it's content for proper documentation

    checking for unused man pages:

    [ OK ] no man pages left

    now checking individual man pages:

    checking /usr/share/man/man8/rear.8.gz:
    [ OK ] man page parsing with lexgrog succeeded
    [ OK ] man page doesn't contain any repeated word

    Summary: 4x OK, 1 warnings, 2 errors

@gdha  
whether or not /etc/cron.d/rear exists depends on the particular RPM
package.

We do not have any 'cron' file in the ReaR upstream source files.  
But we do some cron setup in the RPM spec file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)  
which seems to be used for Fedora but I cannot use it for SUSE.

In particular my SUSE and openSUSE rear\* RPM packages  
(i.e. those rear\* RPM packages where I make the RPM spec file  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855\#issuecomment-404100990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1855#issuecomment-404100990)
)  
do not provide any cron file because I am against any kind of
automatically  
activated "service-like-thingies" in RPM packages.  
With "service-like-thingy" I mean anything that runs automatically  
without having been explicitly activated by the user, i.e. real
services  
(like the `cupsd`) but also things like cron jobs and advanced udev
rules  
(when a udev rule does more than the basic hardware enablement).  
Furthermore automatically activated services are in general forbidden  
by the SUSE and openSUSE guidelines how to make RPM packages  
for SUSE and openSUSE.

@jsmeix in our upstrean
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1892\#issuecomment-410973078](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1892#issuecomment-410973078))
we do have a cron entry enabled. Which leads to the following question:
do we still want this in upcoming releases? I know from end-users it
generates ISO images without rear being properly configured, and
therefore, it would perhaps be better we disable the cron entry
altogether in rear. If we describe it in our documentation should be
sufficient, no?

What is the RHEL policy? Do they shop a cron job? If not then I would
also move it to the docs or examples area so that the users have a more
consistent RPM installation experience. This is especially important if
users upgrade a distro RPM with our upstream RPM. In that scenario the
perceived behavior should not change.

@gdha  
we may add such a 'cron' file to the upstream sources as an example
file  
or provide it only as a piece of text in a documentation.

The latter is already there in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-presentation.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-presentation.adoc)

    Use case: Centralized images /2
    ...

    *  Relax-and-Recover cron-job at /etc/cron.d/rear:

    30 0 1 * * root /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    30 1 * * * root /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

I think we must not install such a 'cron' file into `/etc/cron.d/`  
on an end-user system because I think we are not allowed  
to silently add an automatically activated "service-like-thingy"  
on the end-user's system.

I think our current documentation is sufficient  
i.e. I think an example 'cron' file is not needed.

I think the current example RPM spec file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/packaging/rpm/rear.spec)  
should be improved by removing therein what installs  
such a 'cron' file into `/etc/cron.d/` on the user's system.

Alternatively we may have several example RPM spec files  
as needed for different Linux distributions, for example  
rename `packaging/rpm/` into `packaging/fedora/` and  
add a `packaging/suse/` for different RPM spec files  
for Fedora and SUSE based Linux distributions.

This automatic cron is broken and leads to having broken ReaR ISOs at
the end, in my opinion, we should remove this file and provide a systemd
service + timer instead, which wouldn't be enabled by default.

Example:

-   `rear-rescue-iso.timer`

@rmetrich  
could you describe why calling `rear mkrescue` via cron  
is broken and leads to having broken ReaR ISOs at the end  
in contrast to calling the same `rear mkrescue` via systemd?  
(Not all systems have systemd, e.g. SLES11 has not.)

What I know what cannot work reliably is calling `rear mkrescue`  
via ReaR's 'udev' workflow that gets triggered via a udev rule in  
etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules see

The cron entry doesn't catch errors and the admin will not notice that,
unless he configures automatic email for example.  
With the systemd service, this is more easily catchable.

@jsmeix I agree that we better remove the cron.d entry  
@rmetrich Indeed we better replace it with an inactive systemd service,
however, the ISO in the name is a bit misleading as it depends what the
user defined at the end, no? I would drop the ISO in the name.

I noticed in packaging/rpm/rear.spec there is still

    Requires: crontabs

Does that also belong to the /etc/cron.d/rear/ related things  
that can be removed or is that needed in general?

Now the one error part of this issue

    [ Error ] config file /etc/cron.d/rear has no man page!

is fixed.

The remaining error part

    [ Error ] config file /etc/rear/local.conf has no man page!

is not yet fixed.

I think we do not need and should not have a "man local.conf" man page  
in particular not because of its confusing/meaningless name
`local.conf`.

I think we should close this issue as "fixed as far as reasonable".
