Removed Travis CI status due to not working (any more).

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Other**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2757

-   How was this pull request tested? Not required.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The current Travis CI integration is not working any more so its
    linked build status provides a misleading information and thus has
    been removed. The travis specific configuration file will also been
    removed with this PR.

Hi @antonvoznia, please have a look at the removed `.travis.yml`. I
believe the same will be trivial to implement using Packit (as it builds
RPMs, it already does the equivalent of `make install`, and
`make validate` can be easily added to the `%check` section of the spec
file).

@pcahyna  
I dared to assign it to you because it seems  
you know at least something about that area.  
Feel free to merge it when it is OK for you.

@jsmeix no problem! I think the only question is whether the
non-functional `.travis.yml` should be removed or should be left in the
tree (with a comment, perhaps) - the latter would make it easier to
resurrect Travis testing in the future if anyone is interested. (Whether
anyone would be interested in this is another question, given the
availability of probably superior alternatives.)

@pcahyna I think leaving `.travis.yml` will be a good approach. I just
recognised this configuration file in my yesterday's excursion.

@hpannenb ok, I then suggest that you replace the commit that removes
the file by a commit that adds a comment saying that it is currently
broken and why.

Will create a new one.
