During migration, ReaR recovery propose candidate disk if they have the
same (or bigger) size than the original.  
The problem is that size of mulitpath device is currently not stored in
layout file:

This patch propose :

-   To store multipath device size in `$LAYOUT_FILE`
-   Add line beginning by multipath to be part of the comparison process
    when searching for device with the same size or finding unmapped
    candidate.

@schabrolles Is this part 1 of a pull request? Or am I missing the point
here?

@gdha You are right in a way. (\#1309 \#1315)  
This pull request treat what we have to modify to have a multipathed
disk proposed as a replacement disk during migration.

-   (before this one) You will need (\#1309) to activate multipath if
    you migrate from non-multipathed to multipathed with
    `BOOT_OVER_SAN=y`
-   (after in the process) You will nedd (\#1315) to properly map the
    old &lt;=&gt; new device with good multipath partition naming.

@schabrolles  
in layout/save/GNU/Linux/280\_multipath\_layout.sh  
you inserted output of $dm\_size in the 'multipath' lines  
in $DISKLAYOUT\_FILE via

<pre>
echo "multipath /dev/mapper/$dm_name $dm_size ${slaves%,}" >> $DISKLAYOUT_FILE
</pre>

but I miss adapted code where those 'multipath' lines are input  
because now ${slaves%,} has become the third parameter  
(before it was the second parameter).

As far as I see  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/210\_load\_multipath.sh  
does not need adaptions because it only  
uses the first parameter /dev/mapper/$dm\_name

As far as I see also  
layout/save/default/335\_remove\_excluded\_multipath\_vgs.sh  
does not need adaptions because it also only  
uses the first parameter /dev/mapper/$dm\_name

Now I wonder where ${slaves%,} is used at all?

If ${slaves%,} is nowhere used we should remove it.

I think I found where ${slaves%,} is used: In  
layout/save/default/320\_autoexclude.sh  
(which is run after layout/save/GNU/Linux/280\_multipath\_layout.sh)  
as

<pre>
while read multipath device slaves junk ; do
...
done < <(grep ^multipath $LAYOUT_FILE)
</pre>

where now "read multipath device slaves junk"  
must become "read multipath device dm\_size slaves junk"

Furthermore with positional parameters  
one must ensure no positional parameter is empty  
so that in layout/save/GNU/Linux/280\_multipath\_layout.sh  
plain

<pre>
dm_size=$(cat /sys/block/$name/size)
</pre>

is not fail-safe and must be at least

<pre>
dm_size=$(cat /sys/block/$name/size)
test "$dm_size" || Error "Failed to get /sys/block/$name/size"
</pre>

so that it errors out early during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue"  
instead of blindly proceed and let it fail arbitrarily later  
because "read multipath device dm\_size slaves junk"  
reads wrong parameters when dm\_size is empty.

Same in  
layout/prepare/default/520\_exclude\_components.sh

<pre>
while read multipath device slaves junk ; do
...
done < <(grep ^multipath "$LAYOUT_FILE")
</pre>

must now be

<pre>
while read multipath device dm_size slaves junk ; do
</pre>

@jsmeix Good catch... I will do this.

@jsmeix Do you want me to change LAYOUT\_FILE to DISKLAYOUT\_FILE in the
following files ?

-   layout/save/default/320\_autoexclude.sh
-   layout/prepare/default/520\_exclude\_components.sh
-   layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh

@jsmeix it seems that the latest changes in
`layout/save/default/320_autoexclude.sh`  
and `layout/prepare/default/520_exclude_components.sh` brake the
recovery process when recover from (multipath) =&gt; (non-mulitpath). In
the other way, it is working.  
I need more time to understand what is happening here.

@jsmeix, I think I found it. (9359a1a)

`generate_layout_dependencies` needed to be updated for multipath after
the addition of dm\_size parameter at field 2. (cf commit dd65bd0).  
This change shifts the slave disk at field 3.

I'm gonna test this tomorrow with Sles11sp4, Sles12, RHEL 6 and RHEL
7.  
single path =&gt; multipath AND multipath =&gt; single path

@schabrolles  
many thanks for your careful testing.  
That positional parameters in LAYOUT\_FILE / DISKLAYOUT\_FILE  
make things fragile and caused several weird looking issues  
in the past where things fell apart at totally unexpected places :-(

@jsmeix if I understand well, we should use `$DISKLAYOUT_FILE` each time
we want to use `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` ... So if you
want, I can start to make the changes in the files used in this pull
request.

What do you think ?

@schabrolles  
I would very much appreciate it when one same name  
is used for one same thing.

To fix the DISKLAYOUT\_FILE versus LAYOUT\_FILE  
inconsistency please do it in a separated pull request  
for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/718](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/718)  
after the current pending pull requests were merged.

I fear there is perhaps some obscure reason why  
different variable names are used?

I would prefer to keep separated issues separated (KSIS;-)  
and not mix them up in one pull request (cf. RFC 1925 item 5).

@jsmeix I've finished my test and the migration works for all of the
tests.

I only have one issue regarding xfs with rhel7 when moving from
multipath to not multipath .... but it is not related to this pull
request. I will investigate and open another pull request/issue if
needed.
