This PR is based on \#2829 so let's keep it a draft until that's
resolved and properly rebased.

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2828\#issuecomment-1164134153](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2828#issuecomment-1164134153)

-   How was this pull request tested? RHEL 7 with BIOS and EFI (both
    hybrid and native disk layouts)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

`parted` 3.2 added the support for `esp` keyword. Thus, `parted` 3.1 on
RHEL 7 does not support it yet so try a fallback that sets the
corresponding partition type using `sgdisk`.

@lzaoral  
what I see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2830/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2830/files)  
does not look right to me.  
It seems to also contain changes from my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829)  
that should not be included here.  
I guess your pull request here was not based  
on plain master code but on

in the header. Without it, the code was otherwise more involved for such
a small change.

@pcahyna thanks for the rebase!

@jsmeix sorry for a longer response time. I have tested this PR only by
comparing the outputs of gdisk on RHEL 7 and 8 (there are still some
small differences, though not anymore in the type of the EFI system
partition) but I haven't tested if such layout is still bootable. There
are national holidays in Czechia right now so will get to it on
Thursday.

Edit: typo

Tested on RHEL 7 with BIOS and EFI (both hybrid and native disk layouts)
and the rescue USB booted fine and the restore was successful.

@lzaoral  
thank you for verifying on RHEL7.
