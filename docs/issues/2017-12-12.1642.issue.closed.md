Curently TSM backup restore requires that one has a  
TSM password file 'TSM.PWD' in the recovery system  
via something like

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( ... /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD ... )

COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( ... /etc/opt/tb017/security/TSM.PWD ... )
</pre>

This contradicts that in general the recovery system  
should not contain secrets.  
Cf. what we did for SSH keys in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1511](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1511)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1512)

Accordingly it should be possible for the user that  
TSM backup restore also works without 'TSM.PWD'  
in his recovery system.  
In this case the TSM password should be asked  
from the user during "rear recover".

@jsmeix I think it is more easier for most of the ReaR users if the
TSM.PWD or the newer password files of the TSM client are in the
recovery image.  
So is an automatic restore possible at the point of booting the ReaR
rescue image.

@dcz01  
this issue is not about to no longer have TSM password files  
in the recovery system.  
This issue is about that the user has the final power to decide  
whether or not he wants to have secrets in his recovery system.

Regarding "the user must get the final power" see for example  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513\#issuecomment-332123766](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513#issuecomment-332123766)

Of course the user can only choose between  
either a recovery system with secrets that makes  
unattended recovery possible  
or a recovery system without secrets that may  
require interactive user input during recovery.

The current shortcoming in ReaR's TSM support is  
that the latter does currently not work.

Regarding my "either/or" above:  
Tertium datur!  
With RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL it should be possible  
to have the recovery system ISO image without secrets, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472\#issuecomment-328459748](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1472#issuecomment-328459748)  
and get the needed secrets at "rear recover" runtime  
because since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1267)  
RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL should also work with HTTPS  
so that it should be possible (at least in my theory) to get even  
secrets at "rear recover" runtime safely into the recovery system.
