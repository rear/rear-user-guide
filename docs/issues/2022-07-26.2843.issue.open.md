-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.7 but I noticed it already earlier since some time during 2.6  
    (it had "just worked" by default everywhere before for me)

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    SLES15 SP3 and SP4

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.122.1/nfs
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )

Intentionally I have all kernel modules included by default.

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR):  
    virtual QEMU KVM machines on an openSUSE Leap 15.3 host system

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    BIOS

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When I boot the ReaR recovery system on my KVM VMs I get

    ...
    Loading kernel.....................
    Loading initrd.cgz..........................ready.
    Probing EDD (edd=off to disable)... ok

and then no further messages are shown  
so in particular no recovery system startup messages are shown  
but after a short time (only a few seconds)  
the video mode changes (which keeps the above messages shown)  
(but there are no recovery system startup messages shown)  
and after another short time (some more seconds)  
the screen blanks and shows the recovery system login screen  
where then all works normal.

I tried the kernel command line parameters

-   `edd=off` but likely this issue has nothing to do with BIOS Enhanced
    Disk Drive Services (EDD)
-   `nomodeset` makes no difference
-   removing `vga=normal` makes no difference
-   I tried some modes with `vga=ask` but found none that helps
-   replacing `vga=normal` with `nomodeset` makes no real difference
    (i.e. still no recovery system startup messages are shown) but then
    there is no video mode change

I tried all available VGA settings in "Virtual Machine Manager 3.2.0"  
`QXL` (the default), `Bochs`, `Ramfb`, `VGA`, `Virtio`  
but found none that helps

In contrast when I boot another ReaR recovery system made with

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL="gpt"
    USB_BOOT_PART_SIZE=1024
    USB_DEVICE_BOOT_LABEL="MY-BOOT"
    USB_BOOTLOADER="grub"
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/MY-BOOT
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_PERCENTAGE=10
    USB_DEVICE_FILESYSTEM_LABEL="MY-DATA"
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/MY-DATA
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )

from my USB disk on my older BIOS laptop  
all the usual messages are shown  
including the recovery system startup messages.

@rear/contributors  
do you perhaps have some ideas what I might try out  
to determine the root cause or even solve the issue?

Got it!

It has nothing to do with video mode.

The reason is the kernel 'console' setting which is  
by default `console=ttyS0,9600` (at least for OUTPUT=ISO).

Removing `console=ttyS0,9600` makes it work:  
All recovery system startup messages are shown.  
The kernel startup messages, the init (systemd) startup messages,  
and the ReaR recovery system startup scripts messages are shown.

Also `console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0` works same for me.

In contrast with `console=tty0 console=ttyS0,9600`  
only the kernel startup messages are shown in my case.

This helped me to see the actual root cause:  
[https://serverfault.com/questions/708447/probing-edd-boot-message-stays-for-ten-minutes-on-centos-6-6](https://serverfault.com/questions/708447/probing-edd-boot-message-stays-for-ten-minutes-on-centos-6-6)

Therein this answer:

    I had the same symptoms but the problem was
    that the vmware console wasn't showing the boot output
    (after the EDD line and a few minutes,
     the login prompt suddelny appeared)
    I added

    console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200

    ..to the grub and next boot all was fine

It seems the "Overhauled serial console support code"  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699)  
in ReaR 2.7 caused some regression in some cases.

At least there is (at least usually) an easy workaround:  
Adjust the kernel 'console' parameter setting in the  
ReaR recovery system bootloader menu.  
And normally (i.e. when there are no failures)  
the recovery system startup messages are not needed.  
So it is only a "minor bug".

it is also related to the change done by @lzaoral recently. If a working
serial console is detected on your machine, it is used as
`/dev/console`.

@jsmeix You were faster than I could write my comment :-)

I recognised this during my short VM testing with CentOS7, AlmaLinux 8
and 9. I thought it was a change by decision/intention I could not
follow. It is different compared to at least ReaR 2.6.  
IMHO this leads to cumbersome situations especially in migration mode
where one cannot find the dialogues on the console but on the serial
port only.  
Unfortunately those dialogues only appear on the primary used device
(e.g. the console) even when there is a serial port attached.

Edit: In my case "migration mode" means a V2V, P2V etc. migration not
setting this mode manually.

@hpannenb  
could you describe more percisely what exactly you experience?

For me with ReaR 2.7 defaults I only do not see  
the recovery system startup messages  
but all works normally as soon as the  
recovery system login screen shows up.

Then I can log in normally and enter

    # export MIGRATION_MODE='true'

    # rear -D recover

and all migration mode dialogs work normally for me.  
I use `export MIGRATION_MODE='true'` here only  
to simulate a migration so I could see  
how it behaves in migration mode.

I do not use a serial console.

The minimal `site.conf`I use is

    # ReaR - site.conf
    export TMPDIR="/var/tmp"

    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes
    USE_RESOLV_CONF=no

    ISO_PREFIX="rear-testing-$HOSTNAME"

    USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=15

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='root'

I create a rescue image on VM1 and boot this image in VM2. During the
startup I will be asked in `55-migrate-network-devices.sh` about to
provide the proper network mapping. With ReaR 2.7 this dialog is present
on e.g. `ttyS0` (serial) only; with ReaR 2.6 this dialog was shown on
`tty0` (console).

Edit: The login prompt thereafter is present on (virtual) console AND on
(virtual) serial port.

@hpannenb  
thank you!  
Now I understand what dialog(s) you mean.

For me (as not a serial console user)  
all works well with explicit

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE='no'

in etc/rear/local.conf (during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup)  
because then there is no longer any 'console' setting  
for the recovery system kernel  
(at least no longer for OUTPUT=ISO).

@hpannenb  
when you use a serial console you may experiment with the

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB

config variables what works best for your case.

@jsmeix As already mentioned by You: Due to "power to the user" I
determined many new settings for CONSOLE parameters in the default.conf
of ReaR 2.7 compared to 2.6. In my test setup the described situation is
the more obvious change.

Edit: The reason why I test with virtual serial console on my QEMU/KVM
is a) it is configured by default and b) the HPE servers I use in the
company are all setup with a virtual serial port (VSP) to be used as a
means to login via iLO.
