only creates the first logical ...

Would it be possible to retry the exercise with our latest release
(1.14)? You can download it from

Frank, can you also post the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`
file?

Hey Jeroen,

Nice to see you online ;-)

Thanks,

The configuration that was saved from the original system is already
missing the disks.  
Can you post the output of `rear -vD savelayout` on the original system?

If you need to complete this restore first, you should add the missing
lines to `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` in your rescue system,
like:

    logicaldrive /dev/cciss/c2d0 2|A|1 raid=5 drives=? spares= sectors=32 stripesize=
    logicaldrive /dev/cciss/c0d0 0|A|1 raid=5 drives=? spares= sectors=32 stripesize=

I don't know which drives should be used for them, you can probably
figure that out :-)

I was looking at this again today. Sorry for the delay.

Can you post the output of `hpacucli controller all show config`? From
the savelayout log it looks like the drives of the missing disks are not
in the hpacucli output.

Ok, I see.

There are some incorrect assumptions in the current implementation. I
did not realize that you could have multiple logical drives in one array
and the physical drives are per array (which is logical if you think
about it).

It's not a quick fix...

I have a workaround so I don't need the fix ... hope you have enough
information to fix the problem when somebody need it ;-)  
Thanks for the support Jeroen !!!
