Hi,

we use ReaR with a bunch of Ubuntu Systems and it works great so far.  
Many thanks for this great project and keep up the good work.

Usually we put an IP address in **local.conf** or **site.conf**  
and then **rear recover** works just fine in the rescue system.

But lately I used the DNS Name instead of the IP address because the
Backup target used DNS Round Robin.

While testing the recover, the backup source could not be mounted
because the hostname was not resolvable.

I checked **/etc/** for **resolv.conf** and it was there, but a *cat* on
it failed complaining it could not find the file.

I also checked the code if resolv.conf gets copied over to the rescue
system.

In **/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/30\_dns.sh** the variable
**COPY\_AS\_IS** actually does this

The problem is, that /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and that file was not copied over.

/etc/resolv.conf -&gt; ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf

Cause is the **resolvconf** package which dynamically creates the
**resolv.conf** in **/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf** and symlinks it to
/etc.
