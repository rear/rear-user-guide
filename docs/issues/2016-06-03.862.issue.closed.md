-   rear version :1.17.2

@Wsaibot Are you trying to explain that `mkinird` fails and `dracut`
should be used instead for RHEL 7.2?  
The man page tells me: mkinitrd - is a compat wrapper, which calls
dracut to generate an initramfs.

Could it be that one of the modules was not present (seems a very long
list to me)?

@gdha You are correct about the man page. I tried a little bit more deep
analysing the problem. As you can see above, the
`chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login -c ...` command gives the
error:`fork: No such file or directory`. I found out, that has nothing
todo with the mkinit-command. I did the commands manually from the
revocery-ISO and the issue is:

-   `chroot /mnt/local` is working, I get a chroot-environment
-   `chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash` is working, I get a chroot-environment
-   `chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login` is not working, I get error
    "fork: No such file or directory"

I tried then this:

-   chroot /mnt/local mkinitrd -v -f --with=crc32c-intel
    --with=crct10dif-pclmul --with=crct10dif\_common
    --with=crct10dif\_generic --with=ahci --with=ata\_generic

    --with=dm-mirror --with=dm-mod --with=dm-region-hash --with=e1000
    --with=8139cp --with=mii --with=virtio\_net
    --with=iscsi\_boot\_sysfs --with=sd\_mod --with=sr\_mod
    --with=virtio\_scsi --with=syscopyarea --with=sysfillrect
    --with=sysimgblt --with=virtio --with=virtio\_pci

    3.10.0-229.7.2.el7.x86\_64

This command is working fine. Also later in the automatic recovery
process the creation of grub2 is working. There is also a `chroot`
command without the part "`/bin/bash --login -c`".

Can you verify this issue?

@Wsaibot Thank you for the detailed analysis! I'll verify it tomorrow.

@gdha: I did some more testing. In my environment I get the same failure
in RHEL6. After that, I thought it couldn't be a rear problem and I have
80% right ,-).

We have an entry in .bash\_profile called "exec /usr/bin/rootsh". When I
remove this entry, mkinitrd works fine. Later in the rear recover
process, the chroot command for grub also don't uses the "/bin/bash
--loging -c" part. Do you know, why this is used for the mkinitrd
command? For minimize .bash\_profile problems for a login shell, it
would be good, to change the chroot-command as I posted before (chroot
/mnt/local mkinitrd -v -f --with...). This is also working for
RHEL6/RHEL7 and would be more like also the grub-command.

@Wsaibot if you add the `usr/bin/rootsh` script to the `COPY_AS_IS`
array then your problem should be fixed I hope

@gdha the `/usr/bin/rootsh` is an the server, which is backuped and
restored (in the chroot-environment). `COPY_AS_IS` would copy the file
to the recovery media. So the tool is on the place, the .bash\_profile
(on server, not revocery media) needs it. I think, that the rootsh has a
problem, running in a chroot. So it's a problem from the tool.

For me the "only" question is, if we will change the chroot-command in
`finalize/Fedora/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh` to not using a a login
shell for creating the initrd.

Thanks!

@gdha  
regarding your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862\#issuecomment-225197934](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/862#issuecomment-225197934)  
(verify if the behavior on SLES is the same?):

On SUSE finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh is run.

Both in finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
and finalize/Fedora/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh there is

<pre>
chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT /bin/bash --login -c "mkinitrd ...
</pre>

is run.

In general I wonder why a login shell is needed to run in between  
(but I am not at all a mkinitrd expert).

In my personal direct install script at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Generic\_system\_installation\_with\_the\_plain\_SUSE\_installation\_system](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Generic_system_installation_with_the_plain_SUSE_installation_system)  
it worked for me without a shell in between:

<pre>
# Mountpoint in the installation system of the target system filesystem root:
target_system_filesystem_root="/mnt"
...
# Make initrd verbosely in the target system:
if test -n "$make_initrd"
then chroot $target_system_filesystem_root /sbin/mkinitrd -v
fi
</pre>

What is the reason that "mkinitrd" has to be run  
from a login shell?

@gdha

+       if chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login -c "mkinitrd ...
</pre>

it was you who initially made the

<pre>
chroot /mnt/local /bin/bash --login -c "mkinitrd ...
</pre>

command with the longin shell in between.

Do you remember the reason why?

FYI:  
in the rear sources using

<pre>
find . -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -2 ' chroot '
</pre>

finds a lot of chroot with a login shell in between.

I wonder in general if chroot with a login shell in between  
is really a good idea or if perhaps keep things simpler  
and omit the login shell in general for chroot is better?

The oldest commits that contain 'chroot .\*bash --login'  
are from @schlomo in 2009 and 2010.

I assume all other 'chroot .\*bash --login' code  
is via copy and paste.

@schlomo  
do you know the reason behind why

<pre>
chroot ... /bin/bash --login -c "mkinitrd ...
</pre>

is used with the login shell in between  
instead of directly calling it via

<pre>
chroot ... /sbin/mkinitrd ...
</pre>

Details:

In the current rear sources I did

<pre>
$ find . -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -l 'chroot .*bash --login'
./usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64/20_install_yaboot.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64/22_install_grub2.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/22_install_grub2.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/ppc64/20_install_yaboot.sh
./usr/share/rear/finalize/default/89_finish_checks.sh
</pre>

and then for each of those files I get the history using

<pre>
git log -p filename
</pre>

I asked our (i.e. SUSE's) dracut package maintainer  
(our dracut package contains /sbin/mkinitrd)  
if he knows about a reason to run mkinitrd  
with a login shell in between as in

<pre>
chroot ... /bin/bash --login -c "mkinitrd ...
</pre>

and offhandedly he does not know a reason  
why there should be a login shell in between.

one up after ReaR v2.0 release, no?

After ReaR v2.0 release I will remove the login shell in between  
when it is not obviously needed.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1171)  
merged, this issue should (hopefully) be fixed.

FYI:  
It was much more complicated than I initially assumed.  
One cannot "simply remove" a login shell in between  
from a chroot call.  
Reason:  
With a login shell in between one has in the chrooted  
environment all the advantages of a "normal working shell"  
which means one can write the commands for 'chroot'  
as one would type them in a normal working shell.  
In particular one can call programs by their basename without path  
so that it usually "just works" independent where each particular  
Linux distribution installs programs as long as the program  
is in one of the directories in $PATH.  
With this experience I wonder now if it makes things really  
work better in 'chroot' without the login shell in between.  
When it does not work with a login shell in between  
one could also argue that then the login shell setup  
on that particular system is broken which is not an  
issue in ReaR because a login shell must "just work"  
so that the login shell setup must be fixed  
by the admin of that particular system.

An example where a login shell in between is needed:

A login shell in between is needed in particular  
when shell scripts are called inside 'chroot'.

For example grub2-mkconfig is a shell script:

<pre>

It seems using no login shell for chroot calls  
causes more issues that it solves, see
