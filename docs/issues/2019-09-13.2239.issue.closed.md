Currently we have in default.conf

    # Automatically exclude filesystems mounted under directories given here
    # The default is /media to exclude USB devices mounted there.
    # This is different from EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS, which accepts only mountpoints.
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media )

(excerpt)

    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "fs:/run/media" )

    The problem is that it seems to exclude only exact paths
    (eg. fs:/run/media/[USER]/[DISK_LABEL]),
    and not everything inside /run/media.
    It also does not expand globs like fs:/run/media/*.

(excerpt)

    Changing to
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /run/media /mnt )
    avoids commenting out components I want,
    and also automatically excludes any temporary USB devices.

indicate that a nowadays better default for AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH  
could be something like

    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run/media /mnt )

@rear/contributors  
what do you think about a nowadays better default for  
AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH to be something like

    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run/media /mnt )

?

Sure why not.

I would even propose

    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )

@rear/contributors  
please review and test
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2244](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2244)  
because I fear the impact could be high for some users  
(e.g. when someone has /tmp mounted and expects that to be included).

@rmetrich  
regarding `/tmp` in AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH  
I wonder if recovery still works o.k. by default  
when one has `/tmp` mounted as a separated normal  
filesystem like a separated disk with only /dev/sdc1  
that is ext2 mounted at /tmp

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2261\#issue-332030061](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2261#issue-332030061)  
I tested that it still works with a separated filesystem on /tmp.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2261](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2261)
merged  
I hope this issue is sufficiently done.
