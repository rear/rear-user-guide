In general how big the ISO with the ReaR recovery system could get see

FYI:  
I am not a BACKUP=CDM user  
so I cannot reproduce issues that are specific for BACKUP=CDM  
nor do I know how things should behave with BACKUP=CDM.

> `/dev/mapper/ol-var           /dev/dm-3 /dev/sda3      lvm  xfs           50G /var`

How much free space do you have on `/var`? ISOs can be big, but 50G
should be IMO enough.  
Concerning the ISO size, I see that you are using Rubrik CDM. This seems
to be particularly prone to generating large rescue images, see

Thanks, in that output, /var was expanded for testing.

Servers in question have /var of 5 GB; in that environment /var/tmp grew
to ~ 6GB

Sorry for the confusion.

> in that environment /var/tmp grew to ~ 6GB

I see, 6GB, so that's apparenly not enough. I also think that ReaR
stores the rescue image files to `/var` multiple times, once the
unpacked content of the ISO (kernel+initrd), and then the resulting ISO
image under `/var/lib/rear`. Maybe even before this it holds a copy of
the whole unpacked rescue system tree (that the initrd is created from)
under TMPDIR - not sure about this now. Combined with the propensity of
`BACKUP=CDM` to create big images, it does not seem unlikely to overflow
6GB.

You can store the ISO directly to another location by setting `ISO_DIR`
in the config file (by default it is set to `$VAR_DIR/output`). See the
comment `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`. This will save at least
some space in `/var` by avoiding a copy of the ISO image there.

Tmpdir is looking promising - will test with that and return with the
result.

Thank you.

Looks good - quick and a little dirty approximate results below. This
provides an answer to my question and will avoid having to expand /var
for the time being.

Thank you!

OUTPUT\_URL=file:///root/restoreinfo

export TMPDIR="${TMPDIR-/opt/reartmp}"

~ 1 GB on /var  
~ 4 GB on /opt  
iso ~ 1 GB

with ISO\_DIR=:/root/restoreinfo

/var ~ 0 GB  
/opt ~ 3.3 GB  
iso ~ 1 GB

@humis988  
thank you for your feedback how you made it work in your specific case.
