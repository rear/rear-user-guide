[\#3270 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3270) `closed`: reduzing the initrd size?
============================================================================================

**Labels**: `support / question`

With the option `FIRMWARE_FILES` one can minimize the firmwares that are
being loaded into the ReaR initrd.

We currently have the issue, that on CentOS 9 servers we do have big
initrds (like 500-650MB). We try to reduze that, but the
`FIRMWARE_FILES` parameter only allows a "whitelist" on what firmware
will be loaded.

Is it possible to blacklist firmware?  
I am asking this because than I would go though the `lib*/firmware`
folder and blacklist firmwares that are pretty big in size but will
probably never used within the rear environment.

If that is not possible, can this feature please be developed?

Is there any other option that minimize the firmwares that are being
loaded into the ReaR initrd to reduze the initrd size?  
The only other option I see is the `REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION` which we
already discovered. But the lzma compression only shrinks the size about
10%.

Did you try `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` already?

As I understand, that means ReaR does not load any firmware, correct?  
Can you please explain for what ReaR needs firmwares?

@damm620  
I think right now the most simple and straightforward way  
to get what you need is to add a new script like  
usr/share/rear/build/default/980\_remove\_needless.sh  
where you do something like

    pushd $ROOTFS_DIR 1>&2
      rm relative_path/to/files
    popd 1>&2

to remove what you don't need from within  
your particular ReaR recovery system.

@damm620  
ReaR does not need any firmware nor does ReaR load any.  
Certain hardware needs firmware and the kernel loads it.  
For example NICs and GPUs (GPU firmware is often big).  
Without proper firmware such hardware won't work.  
Bad when the kernel booted fine (except firmware loading)  
and the ReaR recovery system is up and running  
but you sit in front of a black screen without network access ;-)  
In general fully virtualized VMs usually don't need firmware.  
It depends on your hardware and/or on the VM if firmware is needed.  
So try out if the ReaR recovery system works on your hardware  
with `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` and if yes all is fine.  
Otherwise - provided you know what firmware files  
your hardware needs - specify the needed firmware  
via `FIRMWARE_FILES`.

So as long as I can boot into rear (grub or ISO), see all disk, have
network connectivity and the tsm backup client works, the test should be
sufficient right?

Yes, this should be sufficient to check  
that the ReaR recovery system works for your needs.

But in general see

An addedum regarding

    ... provided you know what firmware files your hardware
    needs - specify the needed firmware via FIRMWARE_FILES

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681\#issuecomment-930879162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681#issuecomment-930879162)  
why it is not easy to know or to find out what  
firmware files get used on one's own hardware.  
There is nothing we can do in ReaR against that  
(i.e. we cannot determine what firmware files are used)  
so to be on the safe side we include by default  
all firmware files in the ReaR recovery system  
(except on architectures like ppc64 or ppc64le).

I use this configuration to reduce the rescue image size and build
times:

    FIRMWARE_FILES=('no')
    MODULES=('loaded_modules')
    EXCLUDE_MD5SUM_VERIFICATION=all

About modules and firmware files you need to understand where you
**might** want to boot a rescue image. With these options limiting the
modules and firmware files your rescue image will only work on identical
or extremely similar hardware, e.g. perfect for recovering a virtual
machine.

For recovering on physical hardware, that could be very different from
the original, I'd recommend to include more or all modules and firmware
files. The more you test and know your recovery environment, the more
you can narrow it down. If you don't know then take it all, just to be
sure.

If you need to reduce the rescue image even further and want to use ReaR
for recovery without the ReaR rescue system, then you might take a look
at the new `PORTABLE` output mode:

@damm620 please kindly close the issue when appropriate.

@schlomo

Thanks for your answer.

What exacltly do you mean with this? In most cases we want to recover on
the same or very similar hardware. Does this work when I remove all
firmware? Why is this?  
When I remove all firmware but the ReaR(-kernel) needs some firmware for
the network hardware for example to get it running, then I am stuck when
recovering because the network in the ReaR does not work, right?

Can you please clearify? We will scale this out to a few thousands
servers and I just want to be sure that I understood correctly.

by the way: nice presentation :)

@damm620 the dependency goes like this: `kernel` -&gt; `modules` -&gt;
`firmware`.

So you would need to know the modules that your hardware requires and
then you can check with those modules for required firmware. We could,
TBH, actually determine this automatically because `modinfo` reports the
potential firmware files used ba a module.

In my experience you don't need any firmware on virtual machines. On
physical hardware you might have drivers that require firmware files.

The reason that ReaR takes along all drivers and all firmware is so that
you could recover even a very old system on brand new hardware, as long
as the kernel of that old system supports the new hardware.

So to answer your question:

1.  know your potential recovery hardware
2.  determine which modules are required for that, and use either
    `MODULES=('loaded_modules')` or specify the modules you need
3.  determine if any of those modules require firmware and add that to
    `FIRMWARE_FILES`, e.g. as a pattern.
4.  Repeat if your potential recovery hardware changes

And yes, my suggestion from above might be just what you need - but
please validate.

BTW, if you plan to roll out ReaR to thousands of systems then I'd like
to suggest for you to reach out to us for a little bit of
[consulting](https://relax-and-recover.org/support/) around design and
architecture. For such a large installation there is usually a lot of
stuff that ReaR can do for you that is not so obvious and where our
experience from other large installations can be useful.

@schlomo

So ReaR per default when setting `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` is going to
load all modules (incl. their firmware if there are dependencies), but
non "additional" firmware right? So all dependend firmware is going to
be loaded but no extra ones?

second questions: So only modules can load firmware, not the kernel
itself? Because I did check via
`lsmod -> modinfo $module|grep -i firmware` if there are any firmware
loaded on our servers. I turns out none of them does.

@damm620 no, sorry. `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` simply doesn't take any
firmware files, no automagic here (yet). I just realised that we could
do some automagic here by running `modprobe` against all modules that we
include.

Kernel can load firmware if something that needs firmware is compiled
into the kernel. Sorry for being imprecise here. Additionally, there
could be firmware compiled *into* the kernel, but then ReaR wouldn't
have to deal with that.

IIRC there was also some kind of kernel magic to match firmware device
IDs or such to filenames to auto-load firmware, but maybe I remember
that wrong.

In the end, testing is the best way. If you can't find any firmware that
plays a role on your systems then I'd think it to be safe to disable
firmware inclusion in the rescue system. Worst case, you'll have to add
another initramfs file to the boot media to add the missing firmware
files as a hot patch for an existing ReaR rescue image.

@schlomo

okay, we use only official centos, rhel and suse distros. So I doubt
that there are any modules backed into the kernel, that will load
firmware, right? Or is this assumption incorrect?

Can you show me the part of the code in ReaR (or file/folder) so that I
can maybe develop an "automagic" doing something like:

    - get all kernel modules with lsmod
    - modprobe each of them and grep after "firmware"
    - if s.th. is found include this firmware into the initrd

`usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/420_copy_firmware_files.sh` would be
your friend. It runs already after the modules so that you can rely on
the previous script that copied the modules.

For a PR I'd suggest to give the `FIRMWARE_FILES` variable a new special
value of `auto` which would trigger the autodetect. We could potentially
set `FIRMWARE_FILES=auto` if `MODULES=loaded_modules` if we assume that
this would be typically used together

Please make sure that you also handle the CPU microcode updates, I don't
know if and how that works and if ReaR rescue systems that include all
firmware files would update CPU microcode correctly.
