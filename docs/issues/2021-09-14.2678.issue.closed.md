-Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Attempting to setup a working ReaR (2.5), CentOS (7.9), and Rubrik CDM
(5.3) backup/restore process, testing with this setup currently is not
working though.  
I have had to specify all of the vendor and arch version as the correct
info didn't seem to be gathered appropriately.  
That assumption was based on the log output prior to specifying these
things, it would create an ISO using Fedora and i386 arch references.

In either instance, the output log states the process failed, but the
STDOUT doesn't state any failure. Looking in the logs, I don't see the
definative ERROR to resolve.  
One process does create an ISO, but the recovery doesn't work (won't
properly prompt for CDM recovery via ReaR), and the other way no ISO is
created.

Need to understand at what point either method is truly failing.

-Workaround, if any:  
none found

ReaR v2.6 is required for CDM support.

Thank you. I will retry with that version. Rubrik documentation, or
support did not point this out. I will note however, that I did try with
that version initially and received similar if not the exact outcome I
have with v.2.5 described here. But I did not keep the logs from that
attempt (of course). So I will recreate this best I can and reopen if
necessary.

@cervantevo FIY:  
In general you may also have a look at the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
where I describe how one could test several ReaR versions in parallel  
each one in its own separated directory without conflicts between each
other  
and without conflicts with a normally installed ReaR version via RPM
package.
