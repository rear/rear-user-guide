@lzaoral  
is this one perhaps intended to fix the currently failing checks  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424\#issuecomment-2716960374](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424#issuecomment-2716960374)  
which look from my point of view to fail outside of ReaR?

@jsmeix No, not at all. This is mainly for myself so that I can use the
`tools/run-in-docker` script locally. I use a macOS as my host OS,
therefore, I cannot use `docker` due to licensing issues
[^1](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and I
consider `podman` a superior container management tool, anyway.

@lzaoral  
ah - ok -thank you for the info  
and sorry for my unrelated noise question.  
But now I wonder why those tests passed here but failed for me?  
I will never be able to make sense of that CI stuff :-(

The original jobs in this PR were scheduled before the outage (March 3rd
vs March 6th). I've just rebased this PR so the newly scheduled jobs
should now fail as well.
