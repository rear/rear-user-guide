If OUTPUT\_URL uses the `file://` scheme, ReaR aborts with a weird error
message "BUG: Filesystem where the booting related files are on ...
could not be found" in `output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh`.

Check if OUTPUT\_URL got actually mounted at the right place
($BUILD\_DIR/outputfs) by `output/default/100_mount_output_path.sh` and
abort earlier with a meaningful error message if not.

because it reports a bug in ReaR when

@pcahyna  
perhaps it is more clear to enhance the checks in  
output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh  
directly where all that is done instead of implementing  
things that belong together in various separated scripts?

regarding your

I could do it if it helps you when I would do it.  
I would also only implement a single specific check  
that helps with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3098](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3098)

I think I would only implement one check that  
there is something mounted at $BUILD\_DIR/outputfs  
and if nothing is mounted there, then error out.  
Only optionally a check that what is mounted there  
is a block device and if not show a LogPrintError.

I think I would implement that directly in  
output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh  
and replace that BugError() by Error() therein.

For OUTPUT=USB, having a block device is a pretty basic requirement. For
this reason, I prefer to have the check for block device mandatory and
let it error out when it fails.

Since this is a basic requirement of OUTPUT=USB, I prefer to have the
check as early as possible. I could even rename
`110_check_mounted_usb.sh` to `101_check_mounted_usb.sh` to be executed
ASAP after `100_mount_output_path.sh`. I was lazy to audit all the
scripts between `100_mount_output_path.sh` and
`850_make_USB_bootable.sh` to check if they also might misbehave when
the output is not mounted (or not a block device) and even if they
don't, we could add some code that uses the mountpoint or its underlying
device later.

This are all scripts in usr/share/rear/output/  
(excerpt)

    # find usr/share/rear/output/ | grep -o '[0-9][0-9][0-9]_.*' | sort -n

    100_mount_output_path.sh
    150_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh
    200_make_boot_dir.sh

I would recommend to leave at least one free number  
between already existing scripts (better two or three free numbers)  
to allow easy addition of more new scripts in between existing scripts  
(in particular with at least one free number users can add own
scripts)  
so I don't like 101\_check\_mounted\_usb.sh and  
I think 110\_check\_mounted\_usb.sh is fine here  
or perhaps 105\_check\_mounted\_usb.sh if you like this more.

On what older Linux systems

    findmnt -funo SOURCE --target $BUILD_DIR/outputfs

works as expected:

I test with

    # findmnt -funo SOURCE --target /

SLES10-SP4:

    # findmnt -funo SOURCE --target /
    -bash: findmnt: command not found

SLES11-SP3:

    # findmnt -funo SOURCE --target /
    -bash: findmnt: command not found

SLES12-SP5:

    # findmnt -funo SOURCE --target /
    /dev/sda2

SLES15-SP3:

    # findmnt -funo SOURCE --target /
    /dev/mapper/system-root[/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot]

So it seems (at least for the above tested systems)  
when 'findmnt' is there then `findmnt -funo SOURCE --target ...`  
works as expected.

Note the test on SLES15-SP3  
where `findmnt -funo SOURCE --target ...`  
does not output a plain kernel device node  
but a kernel device node with additional stuff,  
so e.g.:

    # test -b /dev/mapper/system-root[/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot] && echo y || echo n
    n

    # test -b /dev/mapper/system-root && echo y || echo n
    y

Of course a mounted filesystem on USB device for ReaR  
has likely not some (over)complicated btrfs structure  
(like what is mounted at '/' on SLES).

This would be problematic - we would have to revisit this if we want to
support formatting the USB as btrfs.

On SLES15-SP3:

    # man findmnt
    ...
      -v, --nofsroot
        Do not print a [/dir] in the SOURCE column
        for bind mounts or btrfs subvolumes.

so

    # findmnt -funvo SOURCE --target /
    /dev/mapper/system-root

does what we need  
and now I have to check on what older Linux systems  
findmnt supports '-v, --nofsroot' ...

RHEL 6 supports it:

    [root@pcahyna-1mt-rhel-6 ~]# findmnt -funvo SOURCE --target /mnt/redhat
    ...redhat.com:/devops_engineering_nfs/devarchive/redhat
    [root@pcahyna-1mt-rhel-6 ~]# findmnt -funo SOURCE --target /mnt/redhat

for some reason, it is useful even with NFS.

I can add `-v` then, but it could be better to leave it out? I suspect
that formatting the USB as btrfs with subvolumes could lead to various
funny problems later, I doubt the USB code is adapted to it.

... which is what I want. I want the check to fail with NFS mounts.

feel free to add 'v' or leave it out in this case

I was wondering whether or not bash 3 versus bash 4  
could be also used to distinguish reasonably well  
if findmnt is there or not.

So I tested SLES11-SP4 (above I had tested SLES11-SP3).

SLES11-SP4:

    # findmnt -funvo SOURCE --target /
    /dev/sda2

SLES11 and older have bash 3.  
SLES12 and newer have bash 4.  
So at least for SLE bash 3 does not mean there is no findmnt.  
But at least for SLE bash 4 does mean there is findmnt.

So if we would make bash 4 mandatory for next ReaR version 2.8  
we could more safely assume certain other programs are there.

@jsmeix I will leave it out, but if you want to test with
btrfs-formatted USB, and you find that the check is the only thing that
prevents this case from working, I will add it.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2023-12-08 14:29](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3102#issuecomment-1847279640):

Now it may error out with only those texts:

    'findmnt -funo SOURCE --target $BUILD_DIR/outputfs' returned an empty string

or

    'findmnt -funo SOURCE --target $BUILD_DIR/outputfs' failed with exit code ...

But this could be too little context for the user  
so he may not understand where to look for a cause.

Therefore I would like to suggest code like

    if usbdev="$(findmnt -funo SOURCE --target $BUILD_DIR/outputfs)" ; then
        if [ -z "$usbdev" ] ; then
            LogPrintError "'findmnt -funo SOURCE --target $BUILD_DIR/outputfs' returned an empty string"
            Error "Could not check that OUTPUT_URL '$OUTPUT_URL' refers to a mounted block device"
        fi
        # It needs to be a disk-based filesystem (not e.g. NFS)
        # as OUTPUT=USB basically means "disk" (not necessarily USB).
        if ! [ -b "$usbdev" ] ; then
            Error "OUTPUT_URL '$OUTPUT_URL' refers to mounted '$usbdev' which is not a block device"
        fi
    else
        # needs to be in the "else" branch. "! usbdev=$(findmnt ...)" would clobber
        # the exit status of "findmnt" and $? would become useless.
        LogPrintError "'findmnt -funo SOURCE --target $BUILD_DIR/outputfs' failed with exit code $?"
        Error "Failed to check that OUTPUT_URL '$OUTPUT_URL' refers to a mounted block device"
    fi

If you like you may downgrade those LogPrintError to DebugPrint.

By the way:  
I prefer when all Error() messages are different  
to be able to find the right single place in our code  
where a particular Error() exit happened  
(e.g. when a user only reported an Error() message without context).

@jsmeix done, thanks for the suggestion.

While testing, I discovered a bigger issue: `file://` does not work with
USB even if the user had mounted the filesystem themselves. There are
many places in the USB code that expect the output to be mounted at
`$BUILD_DIR/outputfs`. It would be a much bigger project to fix this, so
I merely adjusted the error messages and documented it.

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for your testing!

Better merge it sooner than later now  
before you find more and more issues  
lurking in our labyrinthine USB code ;-)

Now I remember that we have

"Check conditions that depend on BACKUP\_URL or OUTPUT\_URL  
in particular conditions that depend on their schemes."

thanks for the offer, cleanup of this area is certainly welcome. Not
sure if it has the highest priority given we have not had many bug
reports about that, though (and I don't have any immediate use for it
ATM).

Some remarks on what would IMO need to be cleaned up:

-   confusion between setting USB\_DEVICE from OUTPUT\_URL vs.
    BACKUP\_URL. The current code tries to determine USB\_DEVICE from
    OUTPUT\_URL, but if OUTPUT\_URL is not `usb://`, it determines it
    from BACKUP\_URL instead. THat's why I was able to reproduce the
    problem with

<!-- -->

    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///srv

This should be unified and USB\_DEVICE determined always from
OUTPUT\_URL since it represents the location of boot files, nto of the
backup.

-   if one wants a separate boot partition on the USB, it is a bit
    complicated, one has to set several things manually:
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2660\#issuecomment-885643937](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2660#issuecomment-885643937)
    in particular OUTPUT\_URL different from BACKUP\_URL. It would be
    good to be able to do it with a single setting. IMO, this usage can
    conflict with OUTPUT\_URL being different from BACKUP\_URL in case
    one wants to use two USB devices: one for booting and another for
    backup (which should be a legitimate use).
-   maybe all of BACKUP\_URL, OUTPUT\_URL, USB\_DEVICE should be set
    based on OUTPUT=USB and the setting of USB\_DEVICE\_BOOT\_LABEL and
    USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_LABEL, setting them manually by user only
    risks inconsistencies (but BACKUP\_URL can be something else than
    `usb://` ).
