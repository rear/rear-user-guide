1- Grub2: Using search --fs-uuid instead of hardcoded root='hd0,msdos1'

Actually we found that ppc64 and ppc64le are not aware of "hd0,msdos1",
current grub2 rescue does not work without the above option in ppc64 and
ppc64le. Since this search option is used even in x86 grub2 distro menu,
so it would be better to handle as platform independent option.

By the way, this search option allows to use GPT formated disk ! Which
is not the case of 'hd0,msdos1'

2- Changing the way REAR grub2 menuentry is created. By using the
standard /etc/grub.d directory to store the REAR menu, we are sure that
it will not be removed by a manual grub-mkconfig (or an automated one
after a kernel upgrade.)

@gdha I apply the changes in `94_grub2_rescue.sh.`

-   creating a `/etc/grub.d/45_rear` file in order to store rear grub
    menuentry, then grub-mkconfig create the complete grub.cfg file with
    rear included.
-   using fs UUID with fs search function to detect /boot instead of
    `hd0,msdos1`. rear grub is now working on GPT partitioned disk and
    on Power system (including PowerVM and PowerKVM)
-   `/boot` UUID is checked before adding it into grub.cfg.

I put a bit of mess in my git branch ... If it is an issue I can redo
the job... just tell me what is best to do. (a new pull request ?)
