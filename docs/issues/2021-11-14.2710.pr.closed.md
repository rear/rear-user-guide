Hello Anton,

can you please open test/experiment PRs against your own fork, or my
fork, to avoid noise for other ReaR developers (unless you want them to
see the changes)?

@rear/contributors : Anton is my student, working on CI for ReaR. (I
already had a student for the same topic two years ago, as you might
recall, but he dropped out.) I can present the subject on the mailing
list.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your explanation about  
this pull request which misses any word of reasoning about "what" and
"why" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

I would prefer a matching issue here at GitHub about `CI for ReaR`  
because I prefer GitHub's issue features over plain e-mail
communication.  
Of course additionally there can be an e-mail if you like.

Hello,  
I'm so sorry, it was my mistake. Of course, I've done it accidentally.

Thanks,  
Anton

@antonvoznia  
no problem - @pcahyna explained it all.  
Mistakes just happen - and this one was a really tiny one without any
bad effect.
