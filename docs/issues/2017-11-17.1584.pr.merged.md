The intention behind this mode/variable is to make it possible to use
the EMC Legato networker in a client only mode during recovery. Such a
use case is needed if the administrator of the to-be-recovered system is
not the administrator of the EMC Legato networker server itself or
allowed to access it. This appears for example in an environment in
which the backup-and-restore-as-a-service infrastructure is operated
elsewhere.

1.  NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE is not set or set to "no": The NSR backup method
    is executed as before for backwards compatibility in ReaR.
2.  NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE is set to "yes": Several NSR actions will be
    skipped and during the recovery a user prompt is displayed to
    trigger the recovery on the remote NSRSERVER.
