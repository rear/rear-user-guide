-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Running the ~../rear -d -v -D mkrescue with this local.conf, is not
    generating an ISO image.  
    The output also is not capturing that the process is erroring.  
    In the debug log, it is self referencing to review the log for
    further details.  
    Not entirely sure if some, all, or none of the "returns 1" lines are
    where the focus should go.  
    I have tried to resolve some of the sections that have "returns 1"
    in the line,  
    but nothing seems to be resolving the true issue.  
    I would like assistance in understanding which section in the ISO
    generation is actually needing resolution.

I am not a BACKUP=CDM user  
so I can neither really reproduce issues with BACKUP=CDM  
nor do I know how things should actually behave with BACKUP=CDM.

Perhaps the reason could be that you have  
neither OUTPUT\_URL nor BACKUP\_URL  
specified in your etc/rear/local.conf  
but  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc)  
reads

    3. Edit /etc/rear/local.conf and enter:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM

so perhaps BACKUP=CDM could work even without a OUTPUT\_URL?

Thank you for that suggestion. I have added OUTPUT\_URL=null as well as
USE\_DHCLIENT="no". It did produce an ISO. We are currently testing the
restored ISO for any issues.

We are glad that an ISO was produced, but viewing the actual ReaR debug
log shows the process should have failed, or at least produced some
error output. The log still doesn't describe which part encountered
error. Am I reading too far into this?
