-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2406](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2406)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    With executing `rear mkbackup` with configured lftp.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Currently OUTPUT\_LFTP\_OPTIONS are evaluated after connection to  
    destination host is established. This avoids using of  
    OUTPUT\_LFTP\_OPTIONS for connection specific settings.  
    This patch moves OUTPUT\_LFTP\_OPTIONS to the beginning of lftp
    command  
    before any other command is executed.
