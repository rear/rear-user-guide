### Requesting support or just a question

Requesting support: ReaR thinks output device is not a block device

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output

I have been using ReaR for years without issue.

My local.conf file is:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.1.1.14/rocky-dd
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/creds,vers=2.1"
    USE_RAMDISK=0
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/home/timeshift' )

I recently moved to a new Windows machine.  
Prior when this worked,  
I had `BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.1.1.12/rocky-dd`.  
The IP of the new machine is 192.1.1.14,  
and I changed BACKUP\_URL to match.

On 192.1.1.14 there is a Windows share configured identically  
to that which was on 192.1.1.12 with the name rocky-dd.  
I am able to use a mount command on my Linux machine  
to view the contents of rocky-dd.  
Now if I run `rear -v mkbackup -D`  
I get the following output:

    [root@server2 dd]# rear -v mkbackup -D

Have tried rebooting Linux and Windows.  
Enabled SMB1 in Windows.  
I can't figure out why ReaR won't connect properly to the new machine.  
Any help greatly appreciated.

Note, if I change BACKUP-URL back to 192.1.1.12, everything works.  
So perhaps this is some weird Windows/Linux interaction, but I can't
figure out what it is.

Machine that it works on is Win10.  
Failing machine is Win11.  
Source machine running ReaR is Rocky Linux 9.5.

@hspindel

I am neither a Windows user nor a cifs user  
so I cannot actually help with cifs specific issues.

What is your exact mount command on your Linux machine  
to view the contents of rocky-dd on 192.1.1.14 (Windows 11)  
and also on 192.1.1.12 (Windows 10) ?

I assume the "Linux machine" where you did your manual  
mount command to view the contents of rocky-dd  
is the machine where ReaR runs.  
If not, also verify that your manual mount command  
works on the machine where ReaR runs.

@jsmeix

Thank you for the response.

The exact Linux command I use to mount the Windows share (on the same
machine where ReaR runs) is:

mount -t cifs //192.1.1.14/rocky-dd /mnt/rocky-dd -o
credentials=/home/howard/dd/mount-credentials

Using that mount command, I can view the contents of the share where I
want ReaR to store its backup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the Windows machine where I have no problems running ReaR the mount
command is identical except that 192.1.1.14 is replaced with 192.1.1.12.
Contents of the credentials file are identical. 192.1.1.14 is the Win11
machine, 192.1.1.12 is Win10.

I just noticed in the debugging output from ReaR that the mount command
ReaR is using does not include "-t cifs". Could that be the problem? If
it is, it does not explain why ReaR works okay when the mounted
filesystem is on Win10, but not on Win11.

As a test, I also tried running ReaR with the target as the Win10
computer but with -D on ReaR invocation, and very curiously ReaR never
reports attempting a mount command in this case (but apparently the
Win10 filesystem is mounted, since the output from ReaR appears there).

I was also wondering about the missing '-t cifs' mount option.

The matching code in ReaR 2.7  
(and basically same in ReaR master code but with better quoting)  
is in usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh  
therein in the function 'mount\_url()'  
therein the '(cifs)' case

    (cifs)
        if [ x"$options" = x"$defaultoptions" ];then
            # defaultoptions contains noatime which is not valid for cifs (issue #752)
            mount_cmd="mount $v -o rw,guest //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
        else
            mount_cmd="mount $v -o $options //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
        fi
        ;;

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L603>  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L632>  
where 'mount' is called without '-t cifs' option.

So as a test if the '-t cifs' option matters in your case  
you may change that code to

    (cifs)
        if [ x"$options" = x"$defaultoptions" ];then
            # defaultoptions contains noatime which is not valid for cifs (issue #752)
            mount_cmd="mount $v -t cifs -o rw,guest //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
        else
            mount_cmd="mount $v -t cifs -o $options //$(url_host $url)$(url_path $url) $mountpoint"
        fi
        ;;

i.e. add the '-t cifs' option in both `mount_cmd="..."` lines  
and then retry "rear -D mkbackup".

FYI:  
There never had been a '-t cifs' option in that code  
so it had worked all the time without the '-t cifs' option.

FYI  
what I tried (I am not a cifs user):

On a test VM with SLES15-SP5  
with unmodified ReaR GitHub master code  
I have in etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=cifs://192.168.178.66/rocky-dd

(192.168.178.66 is the IP of the host where the VM runs on  
and on the host a firewall is running)

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Running 'prep' stage ======================
    ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -o rw,guest //192.168.178.66/rocky-dd /var/tmp/rear.G0GdFvSy9yTNYMy/outputfs' failed.

      mount error(113): could not connect to 192.168.178.66Unable to find suitable address.
    ...

so I think for my test 'cifs' is autodetected by 'mount'  
because I have 'mount.cifs' in the 'mount' output.  
The error is right because I don't have any  
cifs://192.168.178.66/rocky-dd

I get the same when I run that mount command  
in the terminal where had called "rear mkrescue"  
('mp' is a mountpoint directory that I created there)

    # mount -v -o rw,guest //192.168.178.66/rocky-dd mp

    mount.cifs kernel mount options: ip=192.168.178.66,unc=\\192.168.178.66\rocky-dd,user=,pass=********
    mount error(113): could not connect to 192.168.178.66Unable to find suitable address.

and (of course) '-t cifs' does not make a difference for me

    # mount -v -t cifs -o rw,guest //192.168.178.66/rocky-dd mp

    mount.cifs kernel mount options: ip=192.168.178.66,unc=\\192.168.178.66\rocky-dd,user=,pass=********
    mount error(113): could not connect to 192.168.178.66Unable to find suitable address.

@jsmeix  
I am pleased (and somewhat surprised) that adding '-t cifs' to lines you
indicated in global-functions.sh resulted in ReaR running fine with a
Win11 share as the backup target.

To verify that this didn't cause other problems, I went back and ran the
modified ReaR with a Win10 backup target. It also worked fine. So I
think that putting '-t cifs' into the production code is probably okay
(although I understand that you may wish to do more testing).

Thank you very much for your help in getting ReaR working again!

@hspindel  
I know nothing about how 'mount' without '-t' detects the filesystem
type  
and I know even less ;-) about how 'mount' autodetects via network.

I guess that Windows 11 behaves a bit different  
compared to Windows 10 regarding autodetection of cifs shares.  
Perhaps Windows 11 does not respond to cifs share autodetection  
(e.g. because of security reasons or whatever else)  
or Windows 11 responds different to cifs share autodetection  
so 'mount' cifs share autodetection fails with Windows 11  
and then 'mount' falls through to one of its meaningless  
fallback error messages for example the "well known"

    mount: ...:
      wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sd...,
      missing codepage or helper program, or other error.

(cf.
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2908#issuecomment-1380526144>)  
or something like that.

@jsmeix

I also know nothing about how mount works. I just noticed in the debug
log that -t wasn't there.

Your hypothesis about Windows sounds good to me. Thank you again for
your help in resolving this.

I saw your request to merge the change into ReaR. Great!

@hspindel

only out of curiosity:

Because "man 8 mount" reads

    -t, --types fstype
    ...
    For most types all the mount program has to do is issue
    a simple mount(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge
    of the filesystem type is required.
    For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs)
    an ad hoc code is necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs,
    and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount program.
    In order to make it possible to treat all types
    in a uniform way, mount will execute the program
    /sbin/mount.type (if that exists) when called with type ...

I wonder what your verbose '-v' mount command output is  
when you call 'mount' on your Rocky Linux 9.5 system  
to mount your cifs share on your Windows 11 machine 192.1.1.14

    mount -v -o credentials=/home/howard/dd/mount-credentials //192.1.1.14/rocky-dd /mnt/rocky-dd

versus

    mount -v -t cifs -o credentials=/home/howard/dd/mount-credentials //192.1.1.14/rocky-dd /mnt/rocky-dd

I guess that in the first case without '-t cifs' there is  
nothing about 'mount.cifs' in your 'mount' command output  
and it fails  
while in contrast in the second case with '-t cifs' there is  
something about 'mount.cifs' in your 'mount' command output  
and it succeeds.

If my guess is right I assume it means that without '-t cifs'  
'mount' does not automatically call 'mount.cifs' when  
Windows 11 should be accessed.

You may compare that with how your 'mount' command output looks  
when you access your Windows 10 machine 192.1.1.12

    mount -v -o credentials=/home/howard/dd/mount-credentials //192.1.1.12/rocky-dd /mnt/rocky-dd

versus

    mount -v -t cifs -o credentials=/home/howard/dd/mount-credentials //192.1.1.12/rocky-dd /mnt/rocky-dd

Of course all that does not explain why it behaves different  
for Windows 10 versus Windows 11 - i.e. what the actual  
difference is - which must be something "inside" Windows.
