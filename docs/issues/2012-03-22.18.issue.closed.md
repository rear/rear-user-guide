When demo-ing a restore of 80GB to a 2GB disk, the disklayout.conf is
rewritten with negative values for parted, which fails with 'undefined
option' errors.

Cannot reproduce ! Maybe we should look where negative sizes can occur
and make sure we cover those cases ?

I improved the logic and code a lot in d63c44a4d6 . Don't know when or
why I thought the old logic was OK...

Let's assume this is now fixed, reopen when a similar problem is
detected.

Let me clarify that Rear (during recovery) does not know what the file
system usage is at the time of the backup (it only knows about the file
system usage at the time of creating the rescue image). As a result if
you recover a system to a smaller disk, it is up to the user to make
sure that the required file system sizes are sufficient before starting
the recovery (*disklayout.conf*) or restore process (by resizing logical
volumes and file systems).

Any suggestions on how to make Rear better in this regard are welcome
considering the above.
