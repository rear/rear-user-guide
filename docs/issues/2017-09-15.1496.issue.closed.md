[\#1496 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1496) `closed`: Error during layout recreation with btrfs and docker
=======================================================================================================================

#### Basis

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Ubuntu
    16.04.3 LTS
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): see below

#### Problem

Using `rear mkrescue` on a system with **docker** running on a **btrfs**
file system makes a subsequent `rear recover` stop with the following
error messages:

    Mounting filesystem /
    [  169.768852] BTRFS error (device sda2): '@/var/lib/docker/btrfs' is not a valid subvolume
    An error occurred during layout recreation.

#### Workaround

Use `systemctl stop docker.service` before running `rear mkrescue`.

#### Probable root cause

Docker somehow manages to put a seemingly impossible entry in the
kernel's notion of mounted file systems (`proc/self/mounts`):

    # mount | grep docker
    /dev/sda2 on /var/lib/docker/btrfs type btrfs (rw,noatime,nodiratime,ssd,space_cache,subvolid=257,subvol=/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs)

The option `subvol=/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs` breaks it. Btrfs subvolumes
can be mounted by `subvolid=` or subvolume path (`subvol=`). In this
example, `subvolid` 257 is the root subvolume and there is no such
subvolume with a path of `@/var/lib/docker/btrfs` or
`/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs`. Trying to mount such a beast manually fails:

    # mount -t btrfs -o rw,noatime,nodiratime,ssd,space_cache,subvolid=257,subvol=/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs /dev/sda2 M
    BTRFS error (device sda2): '/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs' is not a valid subvolume
    # mount -t btrfs -o rw,noatime,nodiratime,ssd,space_cache,subvolid=257,subvol=@/var/lib/docker/btrfs /dev/sda2 M
    BTRFS error (device sda2): '@/var/lib/docker/btrfs' is not a valid subvolume

This is the current list of relevant btrfs subvolumes (excluding volume
snapshots named `.@*`):

    # btrfs subvolume list -a / | grep -v '<FS_TREE>/.@'

#### What to do

I have no idea why the docker folks did this, but since this stuff is
out in the wild, I'd like to convince ReaR to just ignore anything that
looks like a docker-generated subvolume (snapshot or not). AFAIK, these
btrfs docker-trees cannot be safely restored anyway in a consistent
fashion.

I've tried to use
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=("${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "fs:@/var/lib/docker/btrfs")`
but apparently this doesn't match. Is there any overview documentation
on how the exclusion mechanism actually works. Any hints where I should
look?

@OliverO2  
Oh dear!

It seems you have to fight with btrfs subvolume stuff in Ubuntu.  
I had fights with the btrfs subvolume structure in SUSE.  
If you can - run away from btrfs subvolumes ;-)  
If you find nested btrfs subvolumes, run even more away!

First and foremost:  
I know nothing about the btrfs subvolume structure in Ubuntu.  
ReaR may need adaptions and enhancements to make  
it also work with the btrfs subvolume structure in Ubuntu.  
Currently ReaR seems to work with btrfs for SUSE and Red Hat.

In general when you have to deal with btrfs subvolumes:

(1)  
You basically must use the findmnt command  
to know what is really mounted where, e.g. for btrfs use

<pre>
# findmnt -t btrfs
</pre>

All other comands may only lead you into more  
and more confusion because they may more or less  
hide what is really mounted where.

(2)  
You basically must mount the whole btrfs filesystem  
(which means to mount btrfs root subvolume)  
at a mount point as you like e.g. via

<pre>
mkdir /tmp/btrfs-root
mount -t btrfs -o subvolid=0 /dev/sdXn /tmp/btrfs-root
</pre>

and then go to that mount point directory and  
inspect the whole btrfs filesystem.

(3)  
When not the btrfs root subvolume but a btrfs subvolume  
is mounted at the '/' mountpoint then you do not see  
the whole btrfs filesystem below '/' but only what is  
below the there mounted btrfs subvolume.  
Use (1) and (2) to get a better overview what there really is.

(4)  
When not the btrfs root subvolume but a btrfs subvolume  
is mounted at the '/' mountpoint then creating  
more subvolumes just with a command like

<pre>
# btrfs subvolume create /path/to/mysubvol
</pre>

creates that new subvolume below the btrfs subvolume  
that is mounted at the '/' mountpoint and usually this is  
not what is intended.  
Usually what is intended is to create a new subvolume  
at a path below the root of the whole btrfs filesystem.  
To create a new subvolume at a path below the root  
of the whole btrfs filesystem you need to first mount  
the btrfs root subvolume as described in item (2)  
and then create the new subvolume via the mountpoint  
directory where the root of the whole btrfs filesystem is.  
But such a new subvolume will not be visible/accessible  
when not the btrfs root subvolume but a btrfs subvolume  
is mounted at the '/' mountpoint.  
To make such a new subvolume visible and accessible  
it must be mounted at a mountpoint directory that is  
inside the btrfs subvolume that is mounted at the '/' mountpoint.  
Usually a /etc/fstab entry is created to mount such a  
new subvolume automatically during boot at a  
mountpoint directory that is inside the btrfs subvolume  
that is mounted at the '/' mountpoint.  
For details how this works under SUSE see  
[https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00397.html](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00397.html)

Accordingly for this issue I guess:  
When in Ubuntu not the btrfs root subvolume but  
a btrfs subvolume is mounted at the '/' mountpoint  
then the docker folks may have created their new subvolume  
in a wrong way (i.e. as a second-level sub-subvolume below  
the btrfs subvolume that is mounted at the '/' mountpoint)  
and during "rear recover" such second-level sub-subvolumes  
cause issues, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944)  
therein see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944\#issuecomment-238239926](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944#issuecomment-238239926)  
and you may also follow the other links therein.

Have fun with nested btrfs subvolumes!  
;-)

@jsmeix  
Thanks for the extensive explanation.

> If you can - run away from btrfs subvolumes ;-)

Not at all! We've been using Btrfs for more than three years and it has
shown to be a perfect fit over here. We snapshot each volume every 5
minutes for system-wide short-term backup (with a snapshot cleanup
schedule, of course). Our unattended backup solution creates backups
from snapshots, enabling consistent anytime backups without interrupting
work or shutting down services. And, once a week, recent backups are
compared to their snapshots to ensure that the whole backup system
actually does what it is meant to do.

> (1)

Thanks for pointing me to `findmnt`. Output over here is:

    # findmnt -t btrfs
    TARGET                  SOURCE                             FSTYPE OPTIONS

Note that Btrfs automatically translates subvolid=0 to subvolid=5, its
internal hardwired root id.

> (2)  
> You basically must mount the whole btrfs filesystem

I do. Our volume organization is as follows:

-   For each disk partition the root subvolume (subvolid=0) is mounted
    on /volumes/<disk-number> (e.g. `/volumes/01`).
-   On these root subvolumes, the primary system subvolumes (@, @home)
    are created, like (e.g. `/volumes/01/@`, `/volumes/01/@home`) and
    mounted in the usual locations (`/`, `/home`).
-   Snapshots are created from primary system subvolumes on the root
    subvolume, like `/volumes/01/.@-2017-09-15T16:20:01+02:00` and
    `/volumes/01/.@home-2017-09-15T16:20:01+02:00`

So far, this is all as intended. The root subvolume (subvolid=0) is used
for subvolume management only. The '/' mountpoint uses a subvolume named
`@`.

True when looking at the directory tree, but the output of
`btrfs subvol list` is identical regardless of the path provided, as
long as that path is somewhere within the same Btrfs file system. (Even
if I use `btrfs subvol list -a /var/lib/docker/btrfs | grep -v '\.@'`
the output is the same.)

The strange thing is: Nowhere does a subvolume named
`/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs` or `@/var/lib/docker/btrfs` show up, so it
seems that Btrfs knows nothing about it.

In general, I don't see a problem with nested subvolumes as long as

-   one has a reasonable mounting strategy and
-   keeps in mind that snapshots do not cross subvolume boundaries.

This may be exactly what's intended.

So yes, docker creates subvolumes below the `@` subvolume, which in turn
is a subvolume of the root subvolume. Docker also creates subvolumes and
snapshots even further down the hierarchy (see [How the btrfs storage
driver
works](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/btrfs-driver/#how-the-btrfs-storage-driver-works)).

In my eyes there is nothing wrong with this except for that 'bogus'
volume name `/@/var/lib/docker/btrfs` unknown to Btrfs itself.

#### Conclusion so far

I think ReaR should find a way to deal with it, which includes

-   accepting subvolumes of subvolumes as normal Btrfs use,
-   automatically filtering out 'bogus' Btrfs volumes, which are
    impossible for ReaR to recreate, and
-   offering a configuration option to filter out Btrfs volumes on
    request.

I would still be grateful if someone could point me to information on
how to make `EXCLUDE_RECREATE` cover Btrfs volumes.

curently there is no support for EXCLUDE\_RECREATE

@OliverO2  
only a side note related to what you wrote:

<pre>

backups from snapshots, enabling
consistent anytime backups without
interrupting work or shutting down services.
</pre>

I argue that such backups are not consistent,  
depending on what kind of consistency one  
expects to get from a backup of files:  
Reason:  
See the section  
"Generic files backup with the plain SUSE installation system" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
Consistent backup means that all files
in the backup are consistent on the
application level. For example assume
there is an application program running
that changes several files simultaneously.
When that program is running during files backup,
the backup may contain old data in some files
and new data in other files which could be
an inconsistent state that leads to errors
in that application after such an
inconsistent backup was restored.

@jsmeix

> I argue that such backups are not consistent,

What you get is intra-file-system consistency: Since btrfs snapshots are
atomic operations, snapshots offer the same consistency level you would
get from modern file systems after a power failure. When you backup from
such snapshots, you won't have problems with any application programmed
to survive a power failure (which you should expect from any reasonable
application) For example, file based DBMS generally change multiple
files in a safe sequence (possibly with added journaling) so that any
inconsistencies from a sudden outage can and will be rectified during
the next startup.

Of course, if you have unsafe applications, you have a problem. But then
you'd have a problem anyway since such an application wouldn't survive
its own crash due to internal (bug) or external circumstances (resource
exhaustion).
