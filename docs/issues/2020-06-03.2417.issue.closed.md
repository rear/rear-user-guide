Hello experts,

Hope you are doing well.  
Its been years since I was really happy with the Rear backup recovery.  
Buy recently I have been facing a picualliar issue while creating a
backup.

so here is the scenario. I accidentally installed the server into 'nvme'
disk instead of 'sda'. So I was planning to take backup of the image.
and recover the system under 'sda'.

-   Disk output

<!-- -->

    **$ lsblk**

    └─sda3          8:3    0 429.6G  0 part 
    sdb             8:16   0  65.5T  0 disk 
    **└─sdb1          8:17   0  65.5T  0 part /Backup  <=== [should be skipped]**

    ├─nvme0n1p1   259:1    0     1G  0 part /boot
    ├─nvme0n1p2   259:2    0     4G  0 part [SWAP]

    nvme1n1       259:4    0 372.6G  0 disk 
    ```

My rear conf :

     $ sudo cat /etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///Backup/rear/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///Backup/rear/
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/Backup/*' )
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /Backup )
    USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"
    AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=( /dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb )
    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=( "${EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS[@]}" "fs:/sda1" "swap:/dev/sda2" "pv:/dev/sda3" "fs:/dev/sdb1" "fs:/Backup/" )
    export TMPDIR="/Backup/rear-tmp/"

So , while I ran the backup it showed that was skipping the '/Backup'
directory where the '/dev/sdb1' was mounted. So the total backup should
be **450GB maximum**. but the backup is still compressing and continue
**upto 3 TB**. that means it is also compressing the data under /Backup
directory. Because I have over 6TB of backup under that /backup
directory.

output:

Anything in your mind guys ???

Ugh, yet another issue with our "include exclude hell" in ReaR ;-)

As a quick offhanded proposal without actual analysis you may have  
a look at things like `BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE` in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1091](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1091)

In general including/excluding components like
disks/partitions/filesystems  
is different from what gets included/excluded regarding the backup.  
There are some relationships but in general both are different things.

What gets included/excluded regarding the backup  
in case of `BACKUP=NETFS` happens mainly via  
backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh)

Run "rear -D mkbackup" (`-D` is debugscript mode)  
and inspect the log file what exactly happens while  
backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
is running. The log file should (hopefully) show why something  
is automatically included in the backup in your particular case.

Regarding including/excluding components see

@jsmeix , Yes those are as it is, I tried another varification after
checking the log , that included the directory,

     $ sudo cat /etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///Backup/rear/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///Backup/rear/
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/Backup/*' ) <========== this is the problem, shoule be /Backup
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /Backup )
    USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"
    AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=( /dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb )
    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=( "${EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS[@]}" "fs:/sda1" "swap:/dev/sda2" "pv:/dev/sda3" "fs:/dev/sdb1" "fs:/Backup/" )
    export TMPDIR="/Backup/rear-tmp/"

Corrected by removing the asterisk \* after /Backup/

     $ sudo cat /etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///Backup/rear/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///Backup/rear/
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/Backup' )  <==== corrected
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /Backup )
    USE_RESOLV_CONF="no"
    AUTOEXCLUDE_DISKS=( /dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb )
    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS=( "${EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS[@]}" "fs:/sda1" "swap:/dev/sda2" "pv:/dev/sda3" "fs:/dev/sdb1" "fs:/Backup/" )
    export TMPDIR="/Backup/rear-tmp/"

So the problem is solved but question remains . it was not supposed to
include the directory with this.

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/Backup/*' )

@asmkaiser  
thank you for your feedback what the actual reason was!

I had missed the wrong syntax of the  
EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS array element.

I think the examples in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2599](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2599)

    # examples: /tmp
    #           /media/bigdisk
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()

indicate that the values in the EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS array  
should be directories but in particular no quoted globbing patterns.

The code for EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh\#L29](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh#L29)

        for excluded_mountpoint in "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; do
            test "$excluded_mountpoint" && echo "$excluded_mountpoint/"
        done >> $TMP_DIR/backup-exclude.txt

proves that quoted globbing patterns actually behave  
as quoted values should behave in bash, for example:

    # EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/etc/*' )

    # for excluded_mountpoint in "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; do echo "$excluded_mountpoint/" ; done
    /etc/*/

versus non-quoted globbing patterns

    # EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( /etc/* )

    # for excluded_mountpoint in "${EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS[@]}" ; do echo "$excluded_mountpoint/" ; done
    /etc/adjtime/
    /etc/aliases/
    /etc/aliases.d/
    /etc/aliases.db/
    /etc/alsa-pulse.conf/
    /etc/alternatives/
    ...

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ea61df57be40833127a30736b9e3f9c5f0cc5a8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ea61df57be40833127a30736b9e3f9c5f0cc5a8)  
I better describe the usage of non-quoted globbing patterns  
versus quoted globbing patterns in default.conf
