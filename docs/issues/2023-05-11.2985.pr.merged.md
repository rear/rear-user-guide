run commands that deal with GALAXY11\_PASSWORD  
in a confidential way via

    { confidential_command ; } 2>/dev/null

@jsmeix  
I tested your stand and it worked with Commvault (Galaxy11)

**a comparison**  
e.g. GALAXY11\_USER="my\_commvault\_user" and
GALAXY11\_PASSWORD="my\_commvault\_secret"

actual master version:

    grep -n "my_commvault_secret" rear-myserver.log
    2682:++ '[' -n 'my_commvault_secret' ']'
    2683:++ qlogin -u 'my_commvault_user' -clp 'my_commvault_secret'

    grep -n "qlogin" rear-myserver.log
    2683:++ qlogin -u 'my_commvault_user' -clp 'my_commvault_secret'

your version:

    grep -n "my_commvault_secret" rear-myserver-new.log
    [empty]

    grep -n "qlogin" rear-myserver-new.log
    [empty]

In my opinion, it is very good to hide the credentials so that they are
not uploaded by mistake.

Otherwise, in some places it may be useful to see them. But by default
this should be disabled. This could be activated by an additional CMD
line parameter (see
[2967](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1508418115)).

@codefritzel  
thank you so much for testing it and  
for your comment what your preferred default behaviour is!

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it today afternoon  
unless there are objections.

I know that with

    { qlogin -u "${GALAXY11_USER}" -clp "${GALAXY11_PASSWORD}" ; } 2>/dev/null

there are no longer any 'qlogin' stderr messages in the log  
which could make it harder to find the root cause  
when 'qlogin' fails - depending on what messages 'qlogin'  
shows on stdout or stderr when it fails.

I think it is sufficient to see that 'qlogin' fails  
(which is made clear here via the Error exit)  
and then it is the user's task to debug on his own  
why exactly 'qlogin' fails with his credentials  
on his system in his environment.  
At least I would never ever go so far to debug issues  
where I would need to know secret user data  
for further debugging.

In general user data is sacrosanct so  
secret user data is topmost sacrosanct  
which means some reasonable level of protection  
from accidentally publishing secret user data  
outweighs drawbacks in debugging specific cases.

You could add an error messages saying that `qlogin` failed and should
be retried on the console to see the error

A side note FYI:

My recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2985/commits/4a3865abd75484cb7c347c7af73f7925010722eb](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2985/commits/4a3865abd75484cb7c347c7af73f7925010722eb)  
shows an interesting bash coding subtleness:

    # Using "if COMMAND ; then ... ; else echo COMMAND failed with $? ; fi" is mandatory
    # because "if ! COMMAND ; then echo COMMAND failed with $? ..." shows wrong $? because '!' results $?=0

How bash behaves with $? versus $PIPESTATUS:

    # true ; echo $?
    0

    # false ; echo $?
    1

    # ! true ; echo $?
    1

    # ! false ; echo $?
    0

    # true ; echo $PIPESTATUS
    0

    # false ; echo $PIPESTATUS
    1

    # ! true ; echo $PIPESTATUS
    0

    # ! false ; echo $PIPESTATUS
    1

This is because '!' is a reserverd word in bash  
so it behaves like a command i.e. it sets $?  
so one has to avoid '!' like

    # if ! cat qqqq ; then echo failed with $? ; else echo worked with $? ; fi
    cat: qqqq: No such file or directory
    failed with 0

    # if cat qqqq ; then echo worked with $? ; else echo failed with $? ; fi
    cat: qqqq: No such file or directory
    failed with 1

Excerpts from "man bash" (GNU bash version 4.4.23)

    A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands ...

    The return status of a pipeline is the exit status
    of the last command, unless ...

    If the reserved word ! precedes a pipeline,
    the exit status of that pipeline is the logical negation
    of the exit status as described above.

    PIPESTATUS
    An array variable ... containing a list of exit status values
    from the processes in the most-recently-executed foreground
    pipeline (which may contain only a single command).

As an addedum to make the code easier to read  
in particular to avoid needless nested braces { ... {...} ... {...} ...

I removed superfluous braces {...} around variable names via
