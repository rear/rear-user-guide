BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS used to be a string variable, turn it into an
array (GD, 06/SEP/2017 - issue \#1175)

added new script prep/NETFS/GNU/Linux/205\_inspect\_tar\_capabilities.sh
which will automatically add capabilities to the BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS
array

@schlomo  
I wonder if that is really a "breaking change"  
(i.e. a backward incompatible change) because  
according to my current (limited) experience  
in general bash behaves well backward compatible  
for strings and arrays.  
For example:  
a string variable 'var' can also be evaluated  
by using array syntax "${var\[@\]}" e.g.

<pre>
# BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="--this --that"

# echo "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}"
--this --that
</pre>

and also for adding more array elements

<pre>
# BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="--this --that"

# BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}" "--xattrs" )

# echo "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}"
--this --that --xattrs
</pre>

so that for users who specify BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS  
as a string of words in their local.conf things should still  
work o.k. (unless I overlooked something special here).

@jsmeix please use `declare -p` to "view" variables and arrays. Consider
this example:

    $ v="hello world" ; declare -p v ; v=( "${v[@]}" yes we can) ; declare -p v
    declare -- v="hello world"
    declare -a v=([0]="hello world" [1]="yes" [2]="we" [3]="can")

We can see how the initial value that consists of two words is now a
single value with two words. The root cause is that we now quote the
array variable whereas the previous implementation on purpose did not
quote it. This is actually the core of the breaking change:

Good grief!  
@schlomo you are right:

Let's just try to keep unquoted arrays like `${opts[*]}` to the absolute
minimum :-)

@gdha  
can you check if using explicitly unquoted

<pre>
${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[*]}
</pre>

in the backup restore command pipe

<pre>
dd if=$restore_input | $BACKUP_PROG_DECRYPT_OPTIONS $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY | $BACKUP_PROG --block-number --totals --verbose ${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[*]} "${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}" -C $TARGET_FS_ROOT/ -x -f -
</pre>

could make it behave still backward compatible  
or - if that is not possible -  
could you check if we could somehow import a user-defined  
BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS string of words like

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="--this --that"
</pre>

with each word as a separated array element  
into the new BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS() array?

I am against unquoted arrays for the sake of backwards compatibility. In
general I want ReaR to look forward more than backward. That means that
we should guide users in their upgrade process without compromising on
the new functionality.

Specifically, I can imagine adding a test that occurs after reading the
user configuration. This test would check for blanks in
`$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS` (just the first value, therefore no array) and
abort ReaR with a error message that the user has to update their
configuration to use the array notation instead. The error message can
even suggest how:

    Error "The BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS variable is now a Bash array and not a string. Please update your configuration to look like this:${IFS}BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS+=( $BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS )"

Example:

    2017-09-07 14:19:53.284830783 ERROR: The BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS variable is now a Bash array and not a string. Please update your configuration to look like this:     
    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS+=( --anchored )

This will actually put the old - bad - options there and how how to
write it 😄

Only a quick unpolished proposal how we might import  
user-defined BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS string of words  
as separated array elements into BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS()

<pre>
# BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="--this --that"

# old_backup_prog_options="$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS"

# unset BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS

# for backup_prog_option in $old_backup_prog_options ; do BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}" "$backup_prog_option" ) ; done

# for backup_prog_option in "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}" ; do echo $backup_prog_option ; done
--this
--that
</pre>

With some additional testing via "declare -p" whether or not  
the initial BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS is a string or  
already an array we could keep backward compatibility.

@schlomo  
a test with a meaningful Error exit message is perfectly fine for me.  
I only do not want to rely only on release notes  
because nobody reads documentation until it is too late ;-)

I also initially thought about an automatic migration but favor the
Error message to make the whole topic more explicit and to get our users
to actually update their configuration.

In general I would prefer a test using 'declare -p'  
over a test of spaces in plain $VAR because it could be

<pre>
VAR=( "first value" "second value" )
</pre>

i.e. already an array where the first element intentionally  
and rightfully contains a blank.  
I mean "in general" for BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS the  
values might never contain blanks - hmmm wait:

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( '--suffix="my suffix"' )
</pre>

or some other unexpected special things like that ;-)

Actually `BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( '--suffix="my suffix"' )` won't work as
intended because the `"` would be part of the string. If at all then
`BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( '--suffix=my suffix' )`. However, in this
specific case IMHO we can keep it simple and really just check for
`$IFS` in the first value because the previous implementation for
**tar** specifically did not really make it simple for users to put
there complex multi word options (quoted quoting hell).

For the sake of simplicity I would therefore keep the test simple and
trust that the actual backup will die complaining about strange options.
So in any case, our test for the old form is just a courtesy to the
user.

@schlomo I like the **Error** bail-out : +1

    $ BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS="--anchored --selinux"
    $ echo "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS}"
    --anchored --selinux
    $ echo "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS}" | grep " "
    --anchored --selinux
    $ echo "${#BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}"
    1

If I understand it well we check if the variable (string) contains a
**blank** and if the amount of values in the array is *1* we have a
mismatch, right?

Yes, good point. If there are two array values and the first one has a
blank then it might be intentional.

    [[ ${#BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]} -eq 1 && "$BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS" == *\ * ]] && Error "..."

should work just fine. No external program calls and positive logic 😄

@gdha  
now there is in prep/NETFS/GNU/Linux/205\_inspect\_tar\_capabilities.sh

<pre>
echo "BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( ${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]} )" >> $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf
</pre>

which fails if a BACKUP\_PROG\_OPTIONS array element  
contains a string of words.  
E.g. on commandline:

<pre>
# arr=( 'first' 'second=foo.bar' 'the end' )

# for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first'
'second=foo.bar'
'the end'

# echo "arr=( ${arr[@]} )"
arr=( first second=foo.bar the end )

# arr=( first second=foo.bar the end )

# for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first'
'second=foo.bar'
'the'
'end'
</pre>

What seems to work for me is:

<pre>
# arr=( 'first' 'second=foo.bar' 'the end' )

# echo "arr=( $( for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do echo -n "'$e' " ; done ) )"
arr=( 'first' 'second=foo.bar' 'the end'  )
</pre>

It looks rather complicated but currently I don't know  
a better way.

Somewhere in the ReaR code I noticed a comment

At least on my SLES11 machine it seems to work

'first'
'--second=foo.bar'

# declare -p arr
declare -a arr='([0]="first" [1]="--second=foo.bar" [2]="the end")'

# declare -a arr='([0]="first" [1]="--second=foo.bar" [2]="the end")'

# for e in "${arr[@]}" ; do echo "'$e'" ; done
'first'
'--second=foo.bar'
'the end'

I found the comment about 'declare' in an older ReaR version

It might be related to Bash 2.x, not sure any more. If I wrote it then
for sure I observed that behavior somewhere.

Maybe we should add some test code to our `Makefile`. If not to test

👍 for keeping it simple and sticking to problems that we know from reality.

That said, if we can use a Bash feature vs. self-coding then I would expect that to reduce the risk for bugs.

I am referring to a real tar option and not to hypothetical cases.
You could have done "man tar" or "tar --usage | grep STRING"
to verify what I am talking about - didn't you?
Here for your convenience a real example
(on my SLES11 system):
<pre>
# mkdir foo

# echo Hello >foo/hello

# tar -cvf foo.tar foo
foo/
foo/hello

# tar -xv --suffix="my suffix" -f foo.tar
foo/
foo/hello
Renaming `foo/hello' to `foo/hellomy suffix'

# find foo
foo
foo/hello
foo/hellomy suffix
</pre>
