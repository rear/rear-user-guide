Hi,  
I was testing REAR on a ppc64 box. It backs up ok, but when restoring,
the PREP partition doesn't get created. This partition is used as
storage for the bootloader on ppc, so it's necessary.  
It looks to be a pretty easy fix, though. Parted supports creating a
PREP partition, and the backup part notes the partition type. We just
need to check for the "prep" flag in the flaglist in:  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/20\_partition\_layout.sh  
It's around line 160 or so. Pretty low risk change, too.  
I have a system I can test on.

@jayfurmanek will you prepare a pull request for this?

Pull request created. I'll likely be creating a few more for ppc64 as I
ran into a few other issues. This particular issue is fixed with the
change in the pull request.
