ReaR version 2.7.

RPM
Source:[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RHEL\_7/x86\_64/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/RHEL_7/x86_64/)

Build: From Github

Both types has different behavior's of execution and errors.  
Ex:  
Build from source code has an error  
ERROR: Syntax error: Variable FULLBACKUPDAY not assigned as Bash array
in /etc/rear/local\_i.conf:  
FULLBACKUPDAY=`date +%a`

But the same works in a RPM based installation.

Is this behavior expected ??

See default.conf how to specify FULLBACKUPDAY  
and see init/default/001\_verify\_config\_arrays.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/init/default/001\_verify\_config\_arrays.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/init/default/001_verify_config_arrays.sh)  
therein the listed issues why that check is there.

We neither have a /etc/rear/local\_i.conf file  
in our GitHub sources, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/etc/rear](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/etc/rear)  
nor do we specify FULLBACKUPDAY in our  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)

@jsmeix The prob is we need to use FULLBACKUPDAY=(date +%a) for the
built from source and just FULLBACKUPDAY=date +%a for the RPM
deployment. Why is that ?

Does the default files has one and another don't have the array ?  
And this the default behavior. Ignore the conf file, it is a custom file
that we created along with local.conf.
