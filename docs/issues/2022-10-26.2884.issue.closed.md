    `rear format -- --efi`  
    `rear mkrescue` fails due to vfat as a boot partition FS on the

    the error with -D:

<!-- -->

-   analysis:  
    to my unserstanding syslinux should be fine with vfat while for
    extlinux it is not perfectly clear.  
    as far as I remember vfat for the boot partition is fine too.

options:

1.  it should be perfectly fine to install a ext2 instead of a vfat FS
    on the boot partition in such a case.  
    ext3 and ext4 should also work to my understanding but this may
    depend on your bios too.  
    maybe just use some ext with a warning instead of a error and exit
2.  I remember it working with vfat so allowing this may work just fine.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    guess using ext2 on boot partition of the system would do or fixing
    the usb device manually.

this is from [archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/syslinux) and
tells us extlinux is fine with vfat.

not sure if this is actually the correct syntax but vfat should here be
handled the same as extX.

Happy New Year!

@DEvil0000  
does it work for you with the change in your

I made  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2904](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2904)  
with that change right now but I could not yet test it.

same to you!

yes, this fix is a valid fix. I guess it was the only bug preventing it
to work but I do not actually remember if this was the only bug or not.

I am curious how it happened, because I believe that with
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1` leads to using GRUB as the bootloader, so the
syslinux/extlinux part should be skipped. @jsmeix I suspect there may be
a problem with your commit
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/93abd4e1026a10553aa835d8794893f1b0b9b6f6](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/93abd4e1026a10553aa835d8794893f1b0b9b6f6).
Tse problem apparently is that even empty `USB_BOOTLOADER=` means GRUB
in the UEFI case, see the comment in default.conf:

    # Default is using GRUB2 for EFI other then elilo, extlinux for ext, syslinux otherwise:
    USB_BOOTLOADER=

hmm, it should not be the problem witht hat commit. I must admit I don't
understand how this code is supposed to work and why is it using
extlinux even on UEFI.

@pcahyna  
don't worry,  
for me the whole OUTPUT=USB related code is a mystery ;-)

this specific issue should be fixed (hopefully).

sorry for the late reply.

I remember it was not installing a efi bootloader the usual way but
copying over the needed files. If i remember correct it was putting a
syslinux-efi file there if `USB_BOOTLOADER=` was not set to grub. It is
however possible that I set `USB_BOOTLOADER` to syslinx manually while
testing.

Please also keep in mind that hybrid bootload (installing a bios and a
uefi bootloader) is perfectly valid. This is what I started to introduce
with the format flags --bios/--efi (none set is hybrid for usb at
least).

> for me the whole OUTPUT=USB related code is a mystery ;-)

the USB code is a bit of a mess as most of those options.  
technically however it works mostly the same way as for `RAW` as well as
for `ISO`. At least when it comes to the bootloader. This does not mean
those 3 versions do the same thing since they do not share much code but
they could.
