Related to issue \#183 and \#1301

eMMC and NVMe devices might need the partition separator `p`.

With this modification I was able to recover migrate from /dev/sda to
/dev/nvme0n1 until patching etc/fstab phase.

Without this mod I wasn't even able to reach the partitioning of the
target nvme device.

Issue \#1315 is modifying the same script - we need to be careful here.
