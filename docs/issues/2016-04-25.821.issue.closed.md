    prevent creating them as normal btrfs volumes (see 548965e).
-   Work-around: We need to manually include the auto-excluded
    subvolumes to the restore list, like

I do not have any smart suggestion how this can be 'fixed'. I just found
that `/var` was not restored by default by TSM on btrfs system. This may
well be also a TSM support for BTRFS is not perfect.

There is nothing at all what I could do regarding  
issues with third-party backup tools.

When the issue also hapens with 'tar'  
I will have a look.

@pavoldomin  
does the issue also happen with 'tar'?

As far as I understand the comments in default.conf  
and as far as I remember how it works with 'tar'  
items in EXCLUDE\_RECREATE are added to EXCLUDE\_BACKUP  
but items in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE take precedence over  
items in EXCLUDE\_BACKUP so that in the end what is specified  
in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE gets included in the backup  
regardless of what is set in EXCLUDE\_RECREATE.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-04-26 13:50](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821#issuecomment-214751329):

The issue (or at least a similar issue with same result)  
also happens with 'tar'.

With

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/var/spool/*' )
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" 'fs:/var/spool' )
</pre>

one gets the whole content of /var/spool/\* in the backup.tar.gz  
(during "rear mkbackup")  
but  
one does not get the content of /var/spool/\* restored  
(during "rear recover").

In 61\_exclude\_from\_restore.sh the entries  
in EXCLUDE\_RECREATE become added  
to the restore-exclude-list.txt file  
that is used for the 'tar' restore  
as --exclude-from=...restore-exclude-list.txt  
so that entries in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
do not get restored.

The fix with newer rear versions is easy:

With newer rear versions theer is no longer the need  
for entries in /etc/rear/local.conf like

<pre>
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( ... 'fs:/var/spool' ... )
</pre>

to exclude them during component recreation.

Reason:

With newer rear versions btrfs subvolumes are not  
listed in disklayout.conf as

<pre>
fs ...
</pre>

components (as it was during my initial btrfs support implementation)  
but now via well separated components as

<pre>
btrfsdefaultsubvol ...
btrfssnapshotsubvol ...
btrfsnormalsubvol ...
btrfsmountedsubvol ...
btrfsnocopyonwrite ...
</pre>

so that in /etc/rear/local.conf entries like

<pre>
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( ... 'fs:/var/spool' ... )
</pre>

do not match anything during component recreation  
but still match during backup restore.

I tested on SLES12-SP1 with default btrfs subvolumes  
that without entries in /etc/rear/local.conf like

<pre>
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( ... 'fs:/var/spool' ... )
</pre>

I do get the whole content of /var/spool/\* restored  
from the backup.

@pavoldomin  
please test if it also works for you this way with TSM.

Sorry for late response, our exchange decided to move rear emails to
junk folder, how rude.

Thanks @jsmeix. I'll test this tomorrow. For `NETFS` backup I still
should keep subvols in `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE`, right? Just remove them
from `EXCLUDE_RECREATE`

@pavoldomin  
yes,  
you must list those btrfs subvolumes in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
that you want to have in backup.tar.gz during "rear mkbackup"  
but you do not need any btrfs subvolumes in EXCLUDE\_RECREATE

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-04-27 12:47](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821#issuecomment-215071027):

Ha!

Now I even know why it had worked  
with my initial btrfs support implementation  
with entries in /etc/rear/local.conf like

<pre>
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( ... 'fs:/var/spool' ... )
</pre>

to get the whole content of /var/spool/\* restored  
from the backup.

I was sure that I had tested it at that time  
and that it had worked without missing  
stuff during backup restore.

My initial btrfs support implementation  
was never sent to rear upstream  
because it was a bad first-attempt hack  
that only works for SLES12-GA.

My initial btrfs support implementation  
was only implemented for SLES12-GA as a  
patch "adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff" for  
rear version 1.16 in our SLES12 RPM package "rear116".

The "rear116" RPM package changelog shows  
in particular this entry:

<pre>
Fri Jul  4 12:42:49 CEST 2014 - jsmeix@suse.de
- Enhanced adaptions_for_btrfs_for_SLE12.diff so that it skips
  filesystem components from being automatically added to
  restore-exclude-list.txt when the files are explicitly
  listed to be included in the backup via BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE
  to avoid that files in btrfs subvolumes get automatically
  exclued from being restored from the backup (bnc#885698).
- SLE12-btrfs-example.conf is a working example for SLE12
  with default btrfs subvolume that gets installed
  as /usr/share/rear/conf/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf
</pre>

The adaptions\_for\_btrfs\_for\_SLE12.diff changes  
in particular 61\_exclude\_from\_restore.sh  
to skip filesystem components in EXCLUDE\_RECREATE  
that have a matching entry in BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
from being automatically added to restore-exclude-list.txt

The "automatically added" is the crucial point here.

What the user has specified in EXCLUDE\_RESTORE  
is still added to restore-exclude-list.txt  
so that with e.g. the following in local.conf

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/var/spool/*' '/var/log/*' )
EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" 'fs:/var/spool' )
EXCLUDE_RESTORE=( '/var/log/*' )
</pre>

the whole content in /var/spool/ and /var/log/ will be  
saved in backup.tar.gz during "rear mkbackup"  
and during "rear recover" /var/spool/\* will no longer  
be automatically added to restore-exclude-list.txt  
but /var/log/\* will still be added to restore-exclude-list.txt  
so that whole content of /var/spool/ will be restored  
but not the content of /var/log/.

In contrast my more generic btrfs support implementation  
(that should also work on Red Hat and Fedora) which  
was included in rear upstream did no longer have that  
change of 61\_exclude\_from\_restore.sh because it does  
not need that change because in my rear upstream btrfs  
support implementation there is no longer the need  
to specify btrfs subvolumes in EXCLUDE\_RECREATE.

All what I missed to do was to remove the outdated  
and leftover EXCLUDE\_RECREATE stuff from  
the btrfs example config files  
/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf  
/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf

Hi,

I've tested it and it is not working with TSM.  
I also found a reason: in `verify/TSM/default/40_verify_tsm.sh` the
default filesystems included in TSM restore plan are taken from
`disklayout.conf` by

    # Use the included_mountpoints array derived from the disklayout.conf to determine the default
    # TSM filespaces to include in a restore.
    included_mountpoints=( $(grep ^fs $VAR_DIR/layout/disklayout.conf  | awk '{print $3}') )

This wont match btrfs subvolumes - as those are listed as

    ...
    btrfsnormalsubvol /dev/sda2 / 262 @/var
    ...

I am afraid decision which BTRFS volumes are included in restore by
default requires bit of redesign of the code.

In any case, I am happy with my workaround, just need to place the
missing filespaces to the offered list within 30 seconds. We are using
workarounds with the TSM backup already - as the used version does not
seem to work with BTRFS subvols properly. Without them, the critical
filesystems like '/var' are not even backed up.

@pavoldomin  
have you also tested it with 'tar' (i.e. NETFS backup).  
If yes, does it work for you with tar/NETFS ?

Regarding TSM:

First a general question about TSM:

Can TSM operate only on filesystems (i.e. mountpoints)  
or can TSM operate also on any directories (like 'tar')?  
In other words:  
Does TSM save avd restore whole filesystems (like 'dd')  
or does TSM save and restore files and directories?

Do I understand it correctly that content of btrfs subvolumes  
get saved in the TSM backup during "rear mkbackup"  
but does not get restored during "rear recover"?

In general I think backup restore based on 'fs' components  
in disklayout.conf at least looks strange from my point of view  
(and I would have never ever expected such a dependency).

In general I think what is saved in the backup and  
what is restored should be handled well separated from  
what storage components are saved and recreated.

For example I would expect that it "just works" to recreate  
only the root filesystem component and restore all files  
from the backup in there regardless from how many  
different filesystems or whatever other kind of storage  
components (like btrfs subvolumes) the files in the backup  
had been saved.

In general I would prefer to keep separated things separated.

In particular:  
I can maintain the plain btrfs support in rear  
but I cannot also maintain any kind of "hidden"  
interdependent stuff - especially I cannot do anything  
for third-party backup tools that I do not have on my  
systems (i.e. where I cannot test anything).

In particular see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769\#issuecomment-183282736](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/769#issuecomment-183282736)
(excerpt):

<pre>
IMHO we would be better off to extract the backup
functionality from ReaR into a separate Open Source
project which deals only with backup and restore.
That way we can stay true to ReaRs goal of doing
the "bare metal" part while also delivering value with
a new backup solution that can focus only on that part.
</pre>

In general I think there are too many interdependant  
automatisms that try to make "usual things just work"  
but result unexpected obscure failures in other cases  
(like this one).

In verify/TSM/default/40\_verify\_tsm.sh

<pre>
# Use the included_mountpoints array derived from the disklayout.conf to determine the default
# TSM filespaces to include in a restore. 
</pre>

is perfectly o.k. to have a reasonable default behaviour.

But I fail to find where the user can specify what he wants to have  
if the default behaviour is not the right one for his needs.

From my current (total TSM noob) point of view  
the whole TSM issue could be that it is missing  
how the user can specify what TSM should restore  
(and perhaps also what TSM should save in its backup).

Right now I noticed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821\#issuecomment-215369140](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/821#issuecomment-215369140)

<pre>

...

</pre>

This means TSM does not support things like

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/var/spool/*' '/var/log/*' )
</pre>

in /etc/rear/local.conf which is no big surprise  
because default.conf reads:

<pre>
# These settings apply to all cases of internal Relax-and-Recover backup
...
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( )
</pre>

But I wonder what the right way is how the user can specify  
what to include in the TSM backup if the default behaviour  
is not what he actually needs?

That the case, from what I understand. TSM takes everything it
includes/excludes simply from ^fs entry in the disklayout and ignores
whatever backup options we define (I defined them, because I wont to
have more or less same config everywhere).

Thats why I assumed that TSM code needs some redesign.

NETFS restore is working fine when I cut subvols from
`EXCLUDE_RECREATE`.

@pavoldomin  
many thanks for your testing that it works with tar/NETFS.

I will do a pull request that fixes my btrfs example config files.

Regarding the TSM issue I submitted a new separated  
issue

to  
"enhance TSM support to specify what to backup and restore"

With

at least for the tar/NETFS backup method.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/833](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/833)
mitigates the problem where the btrfs subvlums are not restored by
default via TSM.

Now by default both 'fs' and 'btrfsmountedsubvol' entries  
in disklayout.conf are used to generate the default TSM  
filespaces to include in a restore.

This mitigates this issue here because now a better default is  
used but this does not yet implement
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)  
because the user still cannot explicitly specify what to backup  
and restore with TSM when the default behaviour is not  
what he actually needs.

@pavoldomin  
I would appreciate it very much if you could test  
whether or not the new default behaviour  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/833](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/833)
is already  
sufficient for your needs.

btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /.snapshots rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=258,subvol=/@/.snapshots @/.snapshots
</pre>

where "/.snapshots" is the SUSE default mountpoint  
for all the SUSE default btrfs snapshot subvolumes  
(i.e. what SUSE's "snapper" tool does).

This does not work on systems that have  
btrfs snapshot subvolumes elsewhere.

Perhaps how the default TSM filespaces are created  
could be further enhanced regarding exclusion of  
any btrfs snapshot subvolumes by using the  
"btrfssnapshotsubvol" entries in disklayout.conf:

<pre>
# There is no recovery of btrfs snapshot subvolumes.
# Format: btrfssnapshotsubvol &lt;device&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt; &lt;btrfs_subvolume_ID&gt; &lt;btrfs_subvolume_path&gt;
#btrfssnapshotsubvol /dev/sda2 / 259 @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
#btrfssnapshotsubvol /dev/sda2 / 281 @/.snapshots/2/snapshot
</pre>

but therein the &lt;mountpoint&gt; is always '/'  
(i.e. not the mountpoint directory as is looks  
from within SUSE's mounted btrfs structure)  
which is shown in the "btrfsmountedsubvol"  
entries in disklayout.conf:

<pre>
# All mounted btrfs subvolumes (including mounted btrfs default subvolumes and mounted btrfs snapshot subvolumes).
# Determined by the findmnt command that shows the mounted btrfs_subvolume_path.
# Format: btrfsmountedsubvol &lt;device&gt; &lt;subvolume_mountpoint&gt; &lt;mount_options&gt; &lt;btrfs_subvolume_path&gt;
btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=259,subvol=/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /.snapshots rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=258,subvol=/@/.snapshots @/.snapshots
</pre>

I got confused  
(as usual when I deal with SUSE's default btrfs structure):

What is mounted at the directory "/.snapshots"  
is not a btrfs snapshot subvolume  
but a "normal" btrfs subvolume,  
see disklayout.conf

<pre>
# Btrfs normal subvolumes for /dev/sda2 at /
# Format: btrfsnormalsubvol &lt;device&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt; &lt;btrfs_subvolume_ID&gt; &lt;btrfs_subvolume_path&gt;
btrfsnormalsubvol /dev/sda2 / 257 @
btrfsnormalsubvol /dev/sda2 / 258 @/.snapshots
</pre>
