Current ReaR master code.

For the reason behind see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1711\#issuecomment-381416646](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1711#issuecomment-381416646)

Currently it is neither possible to use RESULT\_MAILTO  
to mail only some of the RESULT\_FILES (e.g. only the log file)  
nor is it possible to mail files not in RESULT\_FILES.

The current RESULT\_\* config variables in default.conf

<pre>
RESULT_FILES=()
RESULT_MAILTO=()
RESULT_MAILFROM=root
RESULT_MAILSUBJECT=
RESULT_SENDMAIL="$( type -p sendmail || echo /usr/lib/sendmail )"
RESULT_SENDMAIL_OPTIONS=( -oi -t )
</pre>

are meant only what to do with the RESULT\_FILES.

The way out are a new set of config variables  
that are meant only about what to send by mail like

<pre>
MAIL_FILES=( "${RESULT_FILES[@]}" )
MAIL_TO=( "${RESULT_MAILTO[@]}" )
MAIL_FROM="$RESULT_MAILFROM"
MAILSUBJECT="$PRODUCT $WORKFLOW"
SENDMAIL_PATH="$RESULT_SENDMAIL"
SENDMAIL_OPTIONS="$RESULT_SENDMAIL_OPTIONS"
</pre>

so that the user can specify what to send by mail  
independent of the RESULT\_FILES array content.

Because there is zero user request for such a functionality  
I won't implement it.
