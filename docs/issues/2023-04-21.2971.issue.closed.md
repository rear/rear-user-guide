    I just see the error in the log file /var/log/rear/rear-c202s.log
    about the integer expression expected.  
    I do have the problem that the USB flash drive boots and I get the
    menu, but I get all of these messages for each menu item.  
    I am listing the visible menu item that you see on the screen and
    then error lines are what I see when I hit enter to select the menu
    item.

The messages in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11291981/rear-c202s.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11291981/rear-c202s.log)

    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh: line 83: test: p2: integer expression expected
    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/950_verify_disklayout_file.sh: line 83: test: p3: integer expression expected

are unrelated to the GRUB2 error messages.

Regarding the 'integer expression expected' messages:

In general what layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh
does  
is not required functionality to make ReaR work because it is only
there  
as a safeguard that the entries in disklayout.conf are syntactically
OK  
which they should normally be.

The part in layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
that results those 'integer expression expected' messages  
only checks for non consecutive partitions and only when  
partitions of the form /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdX2 /dev/sdX3  
(i.e. of the form $disk\_dev$part\_num) are used,  
see the comments in that code.  
When partition device nodes like /dev/mmcblk0p1 /dev/mmcblk0p2  
/dev/mmcblk0p3 /dev/mmcblk0boot0 /dev/mmcblk0boot1 are used  
(i.e. of the form ${disk\_dev}p$part\_num)  
that test is skipped.

So the 'integer expression expected' messages  
are no errors but expected failures of the 'test'  
to also find out if the form $disk\_dev$part\_num is used.

@Jerry2840  
in general when you run ReaR (or any other rogram) in debug mode  
you may get various kind of messages that indicate this or that
failures  
but you would need to understand what is actually meant to happen  
in each case to decide if a failure is expected and handled  
or if a failure is unexpected and indicates a real error.

For example on my currently used computer:

    # dmesg | egrep -i 'fail|error'

    [    0.000000] tsc: Fast TSC calibration failed
    [    0.000000] DMAR: Parse DMAR table failure.
    [    3.400876] RAS: Correctable Errors collector initialized.
    [   46.184357] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Could not resolve symbol [\_TZ.PSL.CFGD], AE_NOT_FOUND (20210730/psargs-330)
    [   46.185935] ACPI Error: Aborting method \_TZ.PSL due to previous error (AE_NOT_FOUND) (20210730/psparse-531)
    ...

My computer works perfectly well for me as far as I can tell  
and I don't have sufficient low-level knowledge to decide  
if those messages mean or indicate some real problem  
so I just ignore them and go on bona fide.

Regarding the GRUB2 error messages  
I am afraid I cannot really help here  
because I am not a sufficient GRUB2 expert  
to imagine what their reason could be.

Only a blind guess  
in particular because you use a Red Hat system  
(but I am not a Red Hat user):

As far as I know on Red Hat based systems  
the whole GRUB2 software is split into several RPM packages  
and by default not all GRUB2 software is installed - in particular  
some GRUB2 modules are not installed by default - so you may  
need to additionally install certain GRUB2 RPM packages  
to get GRUB2 working for ReaR.

@pcahyna  
could you have a look here (as time permits)  
regarding the GRUB2 error messages?

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c8f5e3f41c970a89304cd2b1bc5d04a2d2a7fdb4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c8f5e3f41c970a89304cd2b1bc5d04a2d2a7fdb4)  
in layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
it now suppresses unhelpful stderr messages like  
"test: p1: integer expression expected"  
that appear for partitions of the form like  
/dev/mmcblk0p1 (i.e. of the form ${disk\_dev}p$part\_num).

Later if needed and as time permits  
layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
may be enhanced to check for non consecutive partitions  
also for partitions of the form like  
/dev/mmcblk0p1 (i.e. of the form ${disk\_dev}p$part\_num).  
Probably this is not needed in practice because  
the parted versions that are nowadays used  
should be sufficiently new so that they  
support FEATURE\_PARTED\_RESIZEPART or FEATURE\_PARTED\_RESIZE  
(i.e. the 'resizepart' or 'resize' command),  
cf. lib/layout-functions.sh

First of all, @Jerry2840, big congratulations of probably being the
first ReaR user on a *Chromebook* 😄 (I also use an old Chromebook as a
"kitchen dashboard"...)

Your GRUB2 error looks like the Grub modules are missing or not found,
please take a look at your rescue media and check the location of the
`echo.mod` file on it. In your logfile I found this line

    grub2-mkstandalone: info: copying `/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/echo.mod' -> `/tmp/grub.XXpN8c/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/echo.mod'.

which suggests that the module was copied, but maybe it got copied to
the wrong place.

Hello, sorry for the late reply. If you still can reproduce the issue, I
wonder what is in the GRUB image if you can get to the GRUB shell. Do
you have the (memdisk) device? grub2-mkstandalone creates this. To find
out what modules you have, use

    ls (memdisk)/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/

If (memdisk) is not there, I suspect you have booted a different GRUB
image than the one produced by ReaR.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26300485?u=9105d243bc9f7ade463a3e52e8dd13fa67837158&v=4" width="50">[pcahyna](https://github.com/pcahyna) commented at [2023-06-27 14:13](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2971#issuecomment-1609593994):

I found more details. I can reproduce the problem starting with Fedora
37 (Fedora 36 was fine). In the GRUB image produced on Fedora 37 we have

    prefix=(hd1,gpt1)/EFI/BOOT
    root=memdisk

(hd1 is the USB disk where ReaR has been booted from). This does not
work, as /EFI/BOOT on the ReaR image does not contain any GRUB
modules.  
If I execute

    set prefix=(memdisk)/boot/grub
    set root=hd1,gpt

then I can boot the rescue system.  
In Fedora 36 I have

    prefix=(memdisk)/boot/grub
    root=hd1,gpt1

and the image works out of the box. So, something has changed with
variables in the image produced by grub2-mkstandalone between Fedora 36
and Fedora 37.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031)
is merged  
there is Secure Boot support for OUTPUT=USB  
in our ReaR upstream master code.

The basic idea for Secure Boot booting of the ReaR recovery system  
is to "just copy" the (signed) EFI binaries of the Linux distribution  
(shim\*.efi and grub\*.efi as first and second stage UEFI bootloaders)  
instead of let ReaR make its own EFI binary via build\_bootx86\_efi()  
and @pcahyna shows in his  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031\#issuecomment-1669336117](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031#issuecomment-1669336117)  
that this also works for normal UEFI boot  
(i.e. UEFI boot with Secure Boot disabled)  
at least on RHEL 9.

So it could be a possible workaround for now  
to "misuse" the new Secure Boot support for OUTPUT=USB  
via something like (in local.conf or site.conf)

    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/shimx64.efi

(specify the actual 'shim\*.efi' file on your system)  
for normal UEFI boot (i.e. with Secure Boot disabled).

@Jerry2840  
could you try out if this workaround  
actually makes things work for you?

See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how you could try out the current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
from within a separated directory as a test to find out  
if things work better with current ReaR upstream master code  
compared to your installed ReaR version.

That should indeed work and we should actually make this the default,
i.e. always use the OS-provided GRUB image (and the Secure Boot shim if
present), without having to set `SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER` manually.

ReaR in Fedora has been unmaintained for a year at least so the update
above should fix a lot of problems you may encounter.

The issue is actually caused by a regression in the `grub2` package
which was fixed by the following commit
[https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grub2/c/8dde55b253cc29289794efe91e70f70f23c79a83](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grub2/c/8dde55b253cc29289794efe91e70f70f23c79a83)
in `grub2-2.06-110.fc38` on Fedora 38.

The GRUB bug in Fedora was fixed about a month ago,
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=2209435](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2209435).
(The bug description mentions PXE, but the mkstandalone image problem is
caused by the same issue.) Closing.
