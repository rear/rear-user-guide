In a DMZ we can not use the normal backup solution  
and we are stuck to netfs and NFS.  
Currently we use NFSv3 which has totally no security.  
In NFSv4 we have some more options.

AFAIK rear does not yet support NFSv4 because  
rear does not deal with the extra daemons  
that it needs (idmap ...).

Currently NFSv4 works only as much as  
the plain kernel module supports.

Adding the daemons should be not difficult. See  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/05\_start\_required\_daemons.sh  
what already happens for NFSv3.

@jsmeix I think this issue deserves to be completed for rear-1.19, don't
you think so? More and more NFSv4 is being used. If I can I'll give it a
try in the near future.

Right now I was wondering about my initial comment
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/754\#issue-126609225](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/754#issue-126609225)  
because I know that this is not my own wording.

I found out wherefrom it came:

I did only some copy and paste from the  
"ReaR and NFS4" mail thread in Jan. 2016  
on the Relax-and-Recover users list, see  
[http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2016-January/thread.html](http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2016-January/thread.html)  
in particular see  
[http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2016-January/003282.html](http://pikachu.3ti.be/pipermail/rear-users/2016-January/003282.html)

Personally I know nothing at all about NFSv4 options  
and currently I do not have any customer request  
for it so that from my current point of view  
there is no current demand for special NFSv4 options.

In particular because there is not any kind of  
futher communication from Michael Brookhuis here  
I set the milestome to any unspecific future rear version.

@gdha  
nevertheless I would of course appreciate it  
if you like to implement some first steps  
towards specific NFSv4 support so that  
users who need specific NFSv4 support  
could find some entry points where they can  
further enhance it according to their needs.

@gdha  
oops - sorry - I did not notice that you had  
changed the milestone from "future" to "1.19".

As NFSv4 is not yet completely integrated within rear we changed the
milestone from **1.19** to **future**
