-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current master code

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    In restore/DUPLICITY/default/400\_restore\_duplicity.sh there is

<pre>
if [ "$BACKUP_PROG" = "duplicity" ]; then
...
    export HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
</pre>

which means if at this point the HOSTNAME is not what `hostname`
outputs  
then the current HOSTNAME value is changed to what `hostname` outputs  
not only while 400\_restore\_duplicity.sh runs but  
also for all subsequent scripts that run afterwards.

This conflicts with how the HOSTNAME variable is meant to be used in
ReaR.

By default he HOSTNAME value is set in default.conf as

<pre>
HOSTNAME="$( hostname -s 2>/dev/null || uname -n | cut -d. -f1 )"
</pre>

which could be different compared to `HOSTNAME=$(hostname)`.

Additionally the HOSTNAME value can be specified different by the user  
as he likes or needs in his particular case in his etc/rear/local.conf

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Use a different Duplicity specific variable name.

@Lukey3332  
could you have a look here because you use Duplicity?

According to  
git log -p --follow
usr/share/rear/restore/DUPLICITY/default/400\_restore\_duplicity.sh  
the `HOSTNAME=$(hostname)` exists since the beginning via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/992df3e35094d935a9711740440e8b93b6c95776](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/992df3e35094d935a9711740440e8b93b6c95776)
