The ppc code is broken. There are two problems:

1.  In /usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64/30\_copy\_kernel.sh the copy
    command is commented out (last line).
2.  The RPM spec file list syslinux as a requisite. There is no syslinux
    package for the ppc platform. The yaboot package is used instead. I
    suggest somethink like this:  
    %ifarch ppc,ppc64  
    Requires: yaboot  
    %else  
    Requires: syslinux &gt;= 4.00  
    %endif

What version have you tested ? The master branch at this time reverted
to a very simple SPEC file, which we intend to improve to support other
distributions and also PPC... For testing Rear on PPC we might need your
help as we don't have any test equipment.

And depending on the timeframe, we might make the next v1.14 release,
with your help.

I would prefer to see in the rear.spec file:

%ifarch %ix86 x86\_64  
Requires: syslinux  
%endif  
%ifarch ppc ppc64  
Requires: yaboot  
%endif

Yes, I have added it already. I was planning to merge some bits with the
previous version it just did not happen yet.

I made a rescue CD, but it failed to boot:  
The problem is in
/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/30\_create\_yaboot.sh  
The yaboot binary should be copied to /ppc/chrp directory. Instead it is
copied to the file chrp in directory ppc. I modified the mkdir line in
the file:  
mkdir -p $v $TMP\_DIR/ppc/chrp &gt;&2

Now it creates the chrp directory and the yaboot file is copied into it.

The boot was successful, but the recovery system failed to start:  
\[ 3.070199\] systemd\[1\]: No hostname configured.  
\[ 3.070270\] systemd\[1\]: Initializing machine ID from random
generator.  
\[ 3.150799\] systemd\[1\]: Failed to load default target: No such file
or directory  
\[ 3.150815\] systemd\[1\]: Trying to load rescue target...  
\[ 3.150840\] systemd\[1\]: Failed to load rescue target: No such file
or directory

I'am using Fedora16 to test. Any idea what to check to make it work?

It looks like a systemd problem.

You can learn more about it by adding `systemd.log_level=debug` to the
kernel command line (press tab in syslinux).  
We probably forget to copy some directories on ppc...

I've found out that the /lib/systemd/system/default.target link points
to rear-1.13.0/multi-user.target, but there is no rear-1.13.0 directory
(there is no rear\* directory). Can you tell me which script should
create this directory and its contents?

Good catch. That's tar in our makefile adding rear-1.13.0 also to
targets of symlinks.

Those files are in `usr/share/rear/skel/default/lib/systemd/system`.

So do we go back to using pax ? ;-)

No, we read the tar
[manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/transform.html)
:-).

This problem should be fixed by 25f49cca00d86bc285b92c01e43206a3da49ec87
(and it is in my testing).

Perfect ! :-D

I ran another test with the new version:

The copy command in /usr/share/rear/pack/Linux-ppc64/30\_copy\_kernel.sh
is still commanted out, so the kernel image were missing. Please fix it!

After correcting that I was able to boot the rescue image.  
The recovery however failed with some TSM error. I will open a new issue
about that.

For x86, the copy kernel line is also commented out. We copy the kernel
in output/ISO/Linux-i386/80\_create\_isofs.sh. We'll make it mirror that
by copying it in output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/80\_create\_isofs.sh.
