#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
    OS\_VERSION=7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

<pre>
# Default is to create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
# set OUTPUT to change that
# set BACKUP to activate an automated (backup and) restore of your data
# Possible configuration values can be found in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
#
# This file (local.conf) is intended for manual configuration. For configuration
# through packages and other automated means we recommend creating a new
# file named site.conf next to this file and to leave the local.conf as it is.
# Our packages will never ship with a site.conf.
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=BAREOS
BAREOS_CLIENT=HDBBackup-fd
</pre>

    BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Hello,  
    Error: ERROR: No restore job defined in Bareos for HDBBackup  
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-HDBBackup.log for
    details  
    Terminated  
    My questions:

1.  where is this restore job supposed to be found - in the Bareos
    backup server or Client side?
2.  Is this restore job should be specific to the client in question or
    generic?

Thanks much for all help. I have put a lot of efforts into Bareos setup
and now need help to setup rear for Bare metal restore. Bareos manual
says about REAR: "It is easy to set up and requires no maintenance so
there is no excuse for not using it". But for me it became a very
complicated.

-   Work-around, if any:

I am not a Bareos user so that I cannot really help  
but it seems the issue was already fixed  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1138](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1138)  
and your "Relax-and-Recover 2.00" does not contain that fix.

@Adkham72  
please try if it works with current ReaR GitHub master code.

To test the current ReaR GitHub master code  
basically "git clone" it into a directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

(note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/").

Hi Johannes, Thanks much for writing back to help, I really appreciate
it.

I have followed the steps you've advised and this command works.

usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup

But the other command rear -v mkrescue seems not working by sying:

No restore job defined in Bareos for HDBBackup.

I need more of your help.

Thanks,

Adkham

I do not define `BAREOS_CLIENT` during my tests - I usually define:

    BACKUP=BAREOS
    BAREOS_RESTORE_JOB=client-restore
    BAREOS_FILESET=client-fileset

With the `bconsole` command you should be able to find the info you are
looking for.

Because there are no further comments  
I assume this isssue is sufficiently answered  
so that I can close it hereby.
