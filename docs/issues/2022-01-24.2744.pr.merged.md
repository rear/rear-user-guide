-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Do no longer copy all in `/usr/lib*/syslog-ng/*`  
but only copy `*.so` files `/usr/lib*/syslog-ng/*so`  
and skip things in `/usr/lib*/syslog-ng/loggen/`  
because 'loggen' is not included in the recovery system.

@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate a review by one of you as time permits.

When there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow
afternoon.

I tried to dig out why all in /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\* is included:

It started with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/83b67d58d8dda4aa5d6c02a28c827b1d7ce4b9e4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/83b67d58d8dda4aa5d6c02a28c827b1d7ce4b9e4)  
where /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng was added to COPY\_AS\_IS  
which was then moved to LIBS as /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\* in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7f7be5841bf77741d81b06c3ff422a09c4346467](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7f7be5841bf77741d81b06c3ff422a09c4346467)

Unfortunately neither explain why all in /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\* is
included.

I know basically nothing about syslog-ng  
so only by gut feeling I think  
all in /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\* is not needed  
and /usr/lib\*/syslog-ng/\*so is sufficient  
for what is needed in the recovery system.

I postpone merging it by one day and  
if there are no objections I would merge it tomorrow afternoon.

Regardless that

and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743\#issuecomment-1022133392](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743#issuecomment-1022133392)  
show build/GNU/Linux/390\_copy\_binaries\_libraries.sh  
needs to be enhanced regarding LIBS evaluation  
I think this pull request here still is OK because  
it avoids unneeded stuff in the recovery system:  
`loggen` in this case which nowhere appears in ReaR code.
