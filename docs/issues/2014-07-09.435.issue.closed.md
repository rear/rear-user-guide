Could someone post a real live example of performing a full restore from
an iscsi device? Please reference "Add iscsi support \#64". The goal is
to first perform a full boot iso and tar backup using rear to an iSCSI
mounted filesystem on my linux server, and then be able to do a
recovery/restore from this iSCSI device when needed. Thank you

Re-open this issue when we found a sponsor to implement this missing
feature

I have done a working demo to restore a rear backup from iscsi device.
@gdha can you advise how to publish it ?

@msabry2020 FYI:  
According to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429)  
`currently iSCSI needs special manual setup`  
Therein see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429\#issuecomment-645626221](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429#issuecomment-645626221)  
and the subsequent comments therein for a description  
how @gozora did a recovery with iSCSI devices  
with some additional manual setup.

@msabry2020 What do you have in mind? A sub-chapter in the user guide
perhaps? Or, is your intention to prepare a Pull Request to add a new
feature into ReaR? I re-open this issue for further comments...

@gdha I've just came through this while I was trying to do the same
scenario "to restore rear backup on iscsi device".After some trials, it
worked for me and I just wanted to share my findings.
