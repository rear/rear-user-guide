-   Brief description of the issue

I'm trying to do a backup with ouput format NETFS and ISO, over rsync
and have what I thing are two issues

1.  The backup.tar.gz does not get copied to the remote location. Is
    that ok? Only the .iso file is. What I have in mind is that after I
    boot from the .iso, it'll go to the specified rsync server and get
    the backup.tar.gz from there. Is that working as designed or it
    should copy to the remote location? How does the recover part works
    if the file does not gets copied? Do we have to do that copying on
    our own?

2.  Is there a way to specify a user/password or a remote user other
    than root with ssh key authentication for the rsync? We want to have
    a central rsync server to where we are going to generate all backups
    and from where we are going to pull all the images to an external
    site, but we can't give "root" access to every server involved in
    the backup to the central rsync server.

-   Work-around, if any

I changed one line in a script to copy the file to the remote location,
but not sure if that'll make rear recover the backup.tar.gz from there,
we haven't tried that.

@eltonyuy The `BACKUP_URL=rsync://10.x.x.x/exports` was never
implemented in rear, because we have the `BACKUP=RSYNC` method. I am not
planning to implement this scheme unless it is sponsored, or somebody
does it in my behalf.

Regarding "BACKUP\_URL=rsync://..." not implemented:

In current rear master I have implemeted a test for  
currently known valid BACKUP\_URL schemes,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/842)

With current rear master I get:

<pre>
# grep -v '^#' /etc/rear/local.conf
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=rsync://10.160.4.244/nfs
...
# /usr/sbin/rear mkbackup
ERROR: Invalid scheme 'rsync' in
BACKUP_URL 'rsync://10.160.4.244/nfs'
valid schemes: nfs cifs usb tape file iso sshfs ftpfs
Aborting due to an error,
check /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-e229.log for details
Terminated
</pre>

But I did not do any test for OUTPUT\_URL.

@jsmeix Thanks for the test.

I think this issue can be closed as an  
"enhancement" that is "looking for sponsorship".
