See the related

@gdha  
do you perhaps know what the reason behind was  
why in init/default/050\_check\_rear\_recover\_mode.sh  
the help workflow is not allowed inside the recovery system?

My forensics via

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/init/default/050_check_rear_recover_mode.sh
</pre>

shows that this script originated by you via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ad2283c402736253e4f76d36659f353695aeceea](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ad2283c402736253e4f76d36659f353695aeceea)  
probably as a result of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/719\#issuecomment-159967555](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/719#issuecomment-159967555)

Perhaps therein the  
`From within the rescue system you can only run rear recover`  
was too restrictive?
