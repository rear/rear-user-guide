hello,  
is it possible to restore a single file from an iso by extracting or
mounting?

Does the ISO contains the archive as well or only the boot image? It
depends of course. Do you use an external backup program?

ISO contains only backup/archive no boot image. No external Backup
program

@firsttris could you show the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file as I have no
clue where you boot from?

sorry i explain in more detail:

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///media/4abdc695-ec9c-4fcf-ad8e-442c63dbc626/backup/img/  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///media/4abdc695-ec9c-4fcf-ad8e-442c63dbc626/backup/img/

if i run

rear mkbackuponly  
(backup system without creating rescue media)

i get:  
backup.tar.gz

doc says:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
Create a bootable ISO9660 image on disk as rear-$(hostname).iso

why do i get a .tar.gz?

from my understanding i have now created a image which contains my
system drive.  
usually if you get a iso file you can easily mount it if you do
something like:  
mount ISOFILE MOUNT-POINT -o loop  
Is it now possible to mount or to unzip this --&gt; backup.tar.gz "iso"
while my system is running?  
Is there a easy/quick way to access a file in this iso/container/image?

in partclone, clonezilla this was possible..

is my understand about the iso wrong?

the reason:

i currently have 2 backups for my system drive..disaster recovery with
rear and full rsync of my system drive (in case a file is lost or
destroyed).

regards & thx for your help

what kind of device is
`BACKUP_URL=file:///media/4abdc695-ec9c-4fcf-ad8e-442c63dbc626/backup/img/`?

-   mkbackonly will not create an ISO image to boot from
-   mkrescue only creates an ISO image and no tar archive
-   mkbackup does both
