This is a request for comments what you think about  
making a document that contains preferred  
bash coding patterns for Relax-and-Recover.

This RFC is triggered by my proposal in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4440a05ac782e30290e678b7b158d868f4758899\#commitcomment-17878403](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4440a05ac782e30290e678b7b158d868f4758899#commitcomment-17878403)  
and that @gdha agreed that it is a "good idea" in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4440a05ac782e30290e678b7b158d868f4758899\#commitcomment-17879810](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4440a05ac782e30290e678b7b158d868f4758899#commitcomment-17879810)

Therefore I am wondering if I should step by step  
collect bash coding patterns that we prefer to use  
and document them to help all rear contributors  
to get ready-to-use bash coding patterns.

Of course my request is primarily selfish ;-)  
because first and foremost it is me who likes  
to learn about preferred bash coding patterns  
and therefore - provided you agree - I will make  
such a document.

I would like to make it as a separated document in  
the rear wiki that can be used together with the  
existing Coding Style

FYI:

Triggered by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/914\#issuecomment-232755869](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/914#issuecomment-232755869)  
I initiated a "Developers Guide" document  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide)

But I think that coding patterns would not well match  
the intent of the "Developers Guide" so that  
coding patterns should be in a separated document.

@jsmeix I think this is a good idea.
