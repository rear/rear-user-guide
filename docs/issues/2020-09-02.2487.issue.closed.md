Hello,

First of all, I would like to thank you for this excellent software that
makes life easier for all sysadmins.

Actually I am implementing a Backup/Disaster Recovery strategy for a
medical environment, with virtual servers hosted on Proxmox
([](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page)) for my license thesis.  
The project is still in the simulation phase but the idea is to make
Backups and Disaster Recovery of virtual machines, but also of Proxmox
itself (more precisely of the node in which the virtual machines are
located) in order to be able to facilitate the Disaster Recovery
process. It's indeed quite possible to do it by saving the configuration
of `/etc` and `/var/lib/pve-cluster` with periodic cronjobs and then do
some tinkering, but this is not very intuitive.

ReaR works perfectly fine with virtual machines but it's when I try to
apply it to the Proxmox server that things get complicated. First, by
running the simulation command, this is what I get:

[rear -s
mkbackup.txt](https://github.com/aftermath8/Bachelorarbeit/files/5162818/rear.-s.mkbackup.txt)

-   This is the first dysfunction I've noticed:

<!-- -->

    Exiting rear mkbackup (PID 16241) and its descendant processes
    Running exit tasks

I call it a *dysfunction* because I don't get any error message but also
this is not how it should run (at least, it did not appear for virtual
machines' simulation)

So once I run `rear -v mkbackup`, ReaR does the job with obviously the
same dysfunction message at the end:  
[rear -v
mkbackup.txt](https://github.com/aftermath8/Bachelorarbeit/files/5163194/rear.-v.mkbackup.txt)

-   So I create a VM and try to restore my Proxmox on it. The second
    dysfunction is that when I access the recovery terminal, I notice
    that my virtual machine has the same IP address as my Proxmox server
    (this should not happen because Proxmox generates a new IP for every
    VM). So I ping to see which address is free on the router and I
    change it manually in `/etc/hosts`, then reboot, but it doesn't
    change anything.

-   This is what I get after `rear -v recover`

Sorry for being maybe too "amateur", I'm learning the job :man\_student:

Thank you!

@aftermath8 See
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq)
section IP Migration. You could also use DHCP via defining the vairable
**USE\_DHCLIENT=yes** in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file.

Hi @gdha  
Thank you for your answer! I used the variable `USE_DHCLIENT=yes` and
the IP address is indeed not the same anymore, but there is still a
problem with `rpcbind`, which means that the Recovery process cannot be
executed:

@aftermath8 Check if issue \#2341 could help you with your problem? It
is for RHEL, but yeah you never know.  
And, issue \#2250 is maybe a better one to check.

Both issues helped, no such error message anymore, thanks!

Summary of the solution:

-   Added `USE_DHCLIENT=yes`
-   Replaced  
    `test "ok" = $attempt || Error "RPC portmapper '$portmapper_program' unavailable."`  
    by  
    `test "ok" = $attempt || LogPrint "RPC portmapper '$portmapper_program' unavailable."`
-   Replaced  
    `rpcinfo -p 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'portmapper' && { attempt="ok" ; break ; }`  
    by  
    `rpcinfo -p | tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE | grep -q 'portmapper' && { attempt="ok" ; break ; }`
