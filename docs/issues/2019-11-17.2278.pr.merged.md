    Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    1.  RAWDISK: include additional Grub modules from /boot/grub (and
        /boot/grub2) which had formerly been missing
    2.  OPALPBA: improve Plymouth boot animation on Ubuntu, provide
        integration capabilities for other distros

@franciscohosting Here is the promised patch. I'd be happy if you could
test this on CentOS 7 and report your experiences here.

I am a bit afraid that you might be disappointed: The code I have just
committed does not change the secure boot functionality at all in
RAWDISK output but is a leftover from trying to make Grub 2 (UEFI) play
nicely with a graphical boot animation afterwards, which I wanted for
the TCG Opal 2 PBA (disk unlocking system). I had used syslinux before
as it boots faster, but on a system configured for secure boot Grub 2 is
a must.

I tried hard to get all that boot-time video support, mode switching and
whatever as close to the original system as possible. As Grub 2 is
scarcely documented there was much guesswork involved. I had two
machines to test on with different graphics hardware (bare metal
required) and both behaved differently. One insisted on booting into a
black screen. There was an invisible password prompt waiting until
Return was pressed once. Only then the display appeared.

After all it turned out that an incomplete Grub 2 configuration was not
that much the culprit: It was a missing shared library: Plymouth could
not dynamically load `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/plymouth/script.so` as
this referenced ` /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libply-splash-graphics.so.4`
which was missing on the PBA system. The first library was included as
part of a directory via `COPY_AS_IS`, but that did **not** automatically
pull in libraries referenced by it. `build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh`
handles executable dependencies but overlooks those of `*.so` files.
Once I got that right, Grub 2 booted nicely into a graphical screen.

With respect to the remaining UEFI code in ReaR, it seems that there is
some confusion about which code is responsible for which part. An
example:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2f66b904fdc1f69d31f1c9fa64e13a0964c21a38/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh\#L46](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/2f66b904fdc1f69d31f1c9fa64e13a0964c21a38/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh#L46)

However, `efibootmgr` is not a boot loader, so it cannot replace Grub 2.
It is just a tool to change UEFI variables which are stored in
non-volatile memory on your motherboard. For example, `efibootmgr` can
select the boot disk devices and the order of boot device preference. So
instead of selecting boot devices in the BIOS setup you could use
`efibootmgr` to the same effect.

If I understand ReaR code correctly (and I have only had a glimpse),
`660_install_grub2.sh` is only used to install a legacy (BIOS)
bootloader. That's why it contains

    is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER && return

Installing an UEFI bootloader seems to be done in
`output/ISO/Linux-i386/820_create_iso_image.sh` and
`usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/675_install_shim.sh` by
mechanisms I don't know about. `shim-install` seems SUSE-specific, it
actually does install Grub 2 and may be worth a look as it is all-bash:
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/devel:openSUSE:Factory/shim/shim-install?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/devel:openSUSE:Factory/shim/shim-install?expand=1)

On shim: Linux distributions use `shimx64.efi` as their first stage boot
loader, which is signed by Microsoft and thus works with secure boot at
factory defaults. (Shim is used, as for legal reasons Grub cannot be
signed directly.)

If you'd like more details, see [Take Control of Your PC with UEFI
Secure Boot | Linux
Journal](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/take-control-your-pc-uefi-secure-boot).

Hope this helps...

@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate a second review from another ReaR maintainer  
to be more on the safe side against possible regressions.

@OliverO2  
thank you for your explanation in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278\#issuecomment-554791749](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2278#issuecomment-554791749)

Yes, it helps because you also think that the current way  
how ReaR re-installs UEFI booting during "rear recover"  
at least looks a bit fishy and needs a closer look and  
may perhaps need some cleanup and enhancement.

But for now how ReaR re-installs UEFI booting  
seems to "work sufficiently in most cases" and  
I think @gozora explained why in his  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2275\#issuecomment-554028783](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2275#issuecomment-554028783)

So no need to rush - better carefully and step by step,  
cf. RFC 1925 items (2) and (2a)  
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925)

I would like to wait until next monday  
for a second review from another ReaR maintainer.

When there is no objection I would merge it next monday afternoon.

@OliverO2  
thank you for your continuous fixes and improvements for ReaR.  
In particular I appreciate it that you cuntinuously maintain  
those features that you had initially contributed to ReaR  
i.e. you care about "your code".
