if you are using *file://* you need to manually mount you USB device
into specified destination (/media/usbdisk/bk) before launching
`rear mkbackup` ... (same applies for `rear recover`)

Btw. ReaR [supports booting directly from USB
device](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#using-relax-and-recover-with-usb-storage-devices),
without need to create ISO.

@armandocardenasf  
only as a side note because you use the meanwhile  
rather old ReaR 2.3 version on POWER architecture,  
cf. "rear / rear116 / rear1172a / rear118a / rear23a" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads excerpt:

    In practice ReaR version 2.4 is basically
    required on POWER architectures

see also "Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover"  
and "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think `media/usbdisk` indicates a USB disk is used.  
Would of course be nice to know what is in `/etc/rear/basic.conf`.  
But regardless of what there is at `BACKUP_URL="file:///..."`  
in any case when `BACKUP_URL="file:///..."` is used  
that thingy must be a separatedly mounted fileystem-like thing  
that does not belong to the `/` filesystem, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/400\_automatic\_exclude\_recreate.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/400_automatic_exclude_recreate.sh)

I already solved the problem, thank you very much. The problem was at
the mounting point of the USB drive, there was a failure, unmount and
mount again, and everything worked fine. I appreciate your time and
attention

@armandocardenasf  
thank you for your feedback what the root cause was  
in your particular case.  
Such feedback helps us a lot to understand whether our code  
behaves reasonably well even in exceptional cases  
or if we need to do further improvements.
