Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git  
Distributor ID: Ubuntu  
Description: Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS  
Release: 16.04  
Codename: xenial

When using tar backup, if the file is changed it saves the whole file in
the incremental backup. Is there any way to have a threshold setting,
where if a file is larger than the setting it will backup only the
changed portions of the file?

My incremental backups are 22GB because of a mysql table file that
changes daily.

If not could you recommend the simplest compatible backup software that
can still be used for bare metal restore and does incremental backups?
If I don't notice an issue for a few days I need to be able to go "back
in time".

Thank you

Only FYI in general regarding incremental backups  
(I never used any kind of incremental backups myself)  
you may have a look at the possibly related issues  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/974)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/952](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/952)

In general regarding issues with backup tools:

Relax-and-Recover (rear) is neither a backup software nor a  
backup management software and it is not meant to be one.  
rear only calls an external tool that does the backup of the files  
during "rear mkbackup" and its counterpart to do the restore  
of the files during "rear recover" but neither backup nor restore  
functionality is actually implemented in rear, cf. the section about  
"Relax-and-Recover (rear) versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Therefore issues with backup tools usually do not belong  
directly to rear.

Regarding whether or not 'tar' can backup only the changed  
portions of the file?

I don't know if 'tar' has support for that.

Regarding backup is huge because it contains  
huge application files like database files:

Personally I would recommend to use ReaR only  
to backup the files of the basic operating system  
but not to also backup huge application files like  
databases.

Personally I would recommend to do the backup of huge  
application files like databases separated from ReaR, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Basics](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Basics)  
that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
In this particular case "disaster recovery" means
to recreate the basic operating system
...
In particular special third party applications
(e.g. a third party database system which often
requires special actions to get it installed and set up)
must usually be recreated in an additional separate step. 
</pre>

I think it is sufficiently answered because issues with backup tools  
usually do not belong directly to rear.

Regarding a backup tool that can backup  
only the changed portions of the file  
you may follow what goes on here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1030)

[https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  
reads

<pre>
BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
...
Deduplication based on content-defined chunking is used
to reduce the number of bytes stored: each file is split into
a number of variable length chunks and only chunks that
have never been seen before are added to the repository.

@jsmeix Did you notice that both issues (\#1030 and \#1006) are opened
by same person? ;-)

I did not notice it.  
My comment makes the issues referenced by each other  
so that now also others can notice their relationship ;-)
