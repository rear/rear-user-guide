As usual I have tested it on my SLES12-SP1 test system with btrfs where
this code is actually used and without an explicit REQUIRED\_PROGS=(
"${REQUIRED\_PROGS\[@\]}" wipefs ) in /etc/rear/local.conf and it "just
works" for me - i.e. I get wipefs automatically available in the
recovery system (and then used by 13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh).
