After restoring and rebooting, I get the error:  
run-init: /sbin/init: No such file or directory  
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!

And cannot proceed.  
On the original host /sbin/init is also missing and other debian hosts
it is also missing. Booting is no problem then.  
What went wrong?

could it be that it was required to rebuild the initial ramdisk? And,
maybe that did not happen - check the recover log file (after booting
rear recover ISO image)

No feedback since more than one year =&gt; closing it.  
If needed it can be reopened.

First thing to do is:  
1- boot your linux distribution on USB or CD  
2- live boot your system on the USB or CD key  
3- in command line type: mount /dev/sda1(or your dist partition) /mnt  
4- chroot /mnt  
5- nano /etc/resolv.conf (in this file, put this line: nameserver
8.8.8.8)  
6- apt-get install init

after reboot your system. It will work fine. Enjoy

@jeankoffi543 So init was not present? Why was it not restored?

@gdha i don't know why. But i know that init depends of insserv, update
can remove insserv.  
There is many problem to this error. Reinstall init would solve this.

Since ReaR v 2.1 the new default.conf setting  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS="yes"  
rebuilds the initramfs/initrd in any case during "rear recover"  
in the recreated system to be on the safe side.  
I guess that avoids issues as this one.

apt-get install init

Solved the problem.
