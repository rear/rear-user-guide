Hi,

I'm trying to find a solution that will generate disaster recovery ISOs
every day for every server.  
The backup software would be bacula.

is it possible to define an ISO file instead of a USB device as
destination?

EDIT: local.conf mentions an ISO is used if output is not set. But what
if I want to specify an ISO location?
