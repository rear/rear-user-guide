When using BIOS, I had the option to interrupt the boot process (by
pressing Tab key) to enter  
define a fixed IP address when you boot up from the rescue image.  
But this option is not available in UEFI mode. In this mode, you can
edit the grub menu with "e" key to interact with kernel parameters and
there is no do what I need to.

The only work around is to chose "One Time Boot" and opt for BIOS, but
because my HP hardware allows me to do that, not sure if other servers
vendors offer that option.

Pressing "e" in Grub menu and add following works fine for me:

Thanks for your reply, I was not aware it works the same way.

@bobbysch  
FYI a side note:

If you know the fixed IP address of the ReaR recovery system in
advance  
you could specify that in etc/rear/local.conf via something like

    NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 192.168.100.2/24 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 192.168.100.1' 'return' )

see the NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS description  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2763](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2763)
