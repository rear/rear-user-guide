asciidoc had too many dependencies on OpenSUSE and Debian. Please
consider to avoid the asciidoc usage.

I very much hope that asciidoc is only a build-time requirement and not
a  
runtime requirement. If it is a run-time requirement then we must remove
it.

I see 2 possible answers:

1.  Most users use prebuilt packages and we don't care how bloated the
    build  
    automation gets. Those few who want to build themselves probably can
    afford  
    to either setup a build system (or use mock or build or pbuilder)
    or  
    shouldn't mind to install an extra GB of build environment.
2.  Please suggest a better / leaner alternative. The goal is to have
    a  
    simple human-friendly format in which we can maintain the docs.
    Coding  
    manpages in roff is not an option.

asciidoc is a build-time requirement for the docs only. We can however,
prepare the man and user-guide on-front to avoid asciidoc to be
installed with developers.  
Only the rear maintainer(s) is/are writing documentation unfortunately

BTW, the same applies for (future) plans on cfg2html using asciidoc :-)

we will not change the`asciidoc` requirement - maintainers require it
for sure (pity it pulls a lot of extra code).
