Original report
---------------

1.  Successful created ISO File with TSM-Support with `rear mkbackup`
2.  boot from ISO and execute "rear recover" successfully without errors
3.  booting restored system hangs after mounting the last mountpoint.
    boot does not freeze, or give some error messages. System Request
    keys shows the boot prozess stops by executing kjournald on last the
    mountpoint during mountall prozess.
4.  There no errors from creating ISO FIle till succesfull restore.
5.  After rebooting sometimes, the boot process does suddenly work, and
    the boot failure does not come any more.Very strange.

Environment:  
Problem occured on Physikal Hardware and Virtual Machines (Vbox, VMware
ESX)  
OS: Ubuntu 10.04.03 LTS  
TSM BA Client 6.2.2.5  
Rear Version 1.11.0 / 2011-05-24 10:39:25 +0200

The error occurs with GRUB2 and GRUB Legacy, with using UUID and also
with using PATH Devices.  
I have tested so many things and have no more Ideas to solve this
Problem.  
Hope anyone else has some Ideas or Expirience with Rear and Ubuntu.

Cheers

what kind of data does sda7 contain (ext3 type)? I find pt 5 quite
strange

-   looks like the file system is dirty and needs a fsck, but it is
    journaled  
    file system, but still the question is why?
