I've tried again with latest master and disk partitions were correctly
recreated. parhaps the issue \#1931 was preventing correct restore? I've
also observed parted was missing from rescue
(`"/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 328: type: parted: not found"`
in pastebin logs) so I added it to PROGS. don't know which one was truly
the root cause but it works now.

which is the very fist thing that goes wrong and all the rest are only
bad  
consequences because afterwards ReaR blindly proceeds and errors out  
somewhere later at an unrelated place with a weird error message, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@mailinglists35  
first get your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1930](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1930)
fixed  
then
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
that defines the create\_partitions() function  
will not blindly and silently return too early.

@gdha  
I think it is a bug that 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
blindly returns when there is no `parted`.  
I think this is against "Try to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
I think it should verbosely error out in this case.

I think that is another place of old code in ReaR that we need to clean
up  
where as usual the code is without a comment that explains what the
reason  
behind is why 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh could blindly return
when  
there is no `parted`.

If you do not object I will just now change that and let it error out
there.

@gdha  
actually I am very grateful for what our predecessors contributed.  
Without their contributions ReaR would not be what it is nowadays:  
The de facto standard tool for disaster recovery on Linux.

This issue should now be fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/17e5c7b7a563e8caf1c9d33c0023969c142a9cf7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/17e5c7b7a563e8caf1c9d33c0023969c142a9cf7)

Even if there is a subtle exceptional corner case where things work  
even without having `parted` in the recovery system, then the user  
who actaully has this special case can adapt his
100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
to not error out there (e.g. by adding an initial `return` line).

thank you so much for the extremely fast response and fix!

@mailinglists35  
when you really need `PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" ... parted ... )`  
something strange is going on in your particular case  
because I never needed it and I do not know about any case  
where it was needed to explicitly add 'parted' to the PROGS array.

In your case your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2480027/rear-gw2.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2480027/rear-gw2.log)  
from your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1930\#issuecomment-429964990](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1930#issuecomment-429964990)  
contains (as expected)

<pre>
+ source /usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf
++ REQUIRED_PROGS=("${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]:-}" parted)
.
.
.
+ source /usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/390_copy_binaries_libraries.sh
...
+++ echo '2018-10-15 21:13:42.033200666 Found binary /sbin/parted'
...
++ Log 'Binaries being copied: ... /sbin/parted ...
...
++ cp --verbose --archive --dereference --force /sbin/parted /tmp/rear.2Cj7RPbPv9hH6hP/rootfs/bin
</pre>

so that 'parted' is copied into your recovery system - as far as your
log tells.

I had to put parted there because on restore
[log](https://pastebin.com/eTBvM6LP) I was stuck in not creating
partitions and I noticed on the restore log that it was a warning about
parted not found.

I will try again with updated commit to see if now parted is there by
default without having to add it to PROGS

thank you again! :)
