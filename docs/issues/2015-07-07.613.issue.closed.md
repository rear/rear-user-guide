Hi,

just found another issue. When / is on an LVM (this might also affect
/usr), then systemd (systemd-remount-fs) does a "remount" on those 2
mountpoints, which seem to cause both mountpoints to be remounted with
the kernel devices names and not the symlinks from
/dev/mapper/....Because of this, a recovery fails totally!

This leeds to something like this (diskdeps.conf)

    root@debian8:# cat diskdeps.conf
    /dev/sda1 /dev/sda
    /dev/sda2 /dev/sda
    /dev/sda5 /dev/sda
    /dev/debian8-vg pv:/dev/sda5
    pv:/dev/sda5 /dev/sda5
    /dev/mapper/debian8--vg-root /dev/debian8-vg
    /dev/mapper/debian8--vg-swap_1 /dev/debian8-vg
    fs:/ /dev/dm-0     <<= fault here
    fs:/boot /dev/sda1
    fs:/boot /dev/sda1
    fs:/boot /fs:/
    swap:/dev/mapper/debian8--vg-swap_1 /dev/mapper/debian8--vg-swap_1
    root@debian8:#
    root@debian8:# cat /etc/fstab
    ...
    /dev/mapper/debian8--vg-root /     ext4     errors=remount-ro
    ...

    root@debian8:# mount
    ...
    /dev/mapper/debian8--vg-root on / ext4 (rw,reltime.....)
    ...

    root@debian8:# df -h /
    /dev/dm-0             7.2G          3,2G    3,7G      47% /

@rpasche could you run a `rear -vD savelayout` to see where it goes
wrong? And, I'm not yet convinced this is a rear bug, if Debian decides
to do it different to avoid confusing then it gets confusing...to
others.

I did not say, this is a rear bug. Just telling that there is an issue
in this constelation ;-)

What files do you want?

@rpasche the rear.log, and the files under `/var/lib/rear/layout` -
thanks - perhaps use gist to link to this issue

I think I found the error. It is within the initrd (maybe only within
Debian). There is a function, that, given a device path for / filesystem
(e.g. `/dev/mapper/vg_lv-root`), that resolves the links to get the
*real* device (e.g. `/dev/dm-0`) for an LVM device.

This happens for `/`, `/usr` and `/etc` if these are separate
mountpoints within /etc/fstab.

Grmpf....meanwhile, I'm sick of debian 8.

See
[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=791754](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=791754).
Just sent a patch for the function "resolve\_device", that - for me -
works very well. Patch is - not yet - on the list.

After I patched my initrd function and rebuilt the initrd, rear recover
works as expected.

@rpasche thank you for sharing your comments - please add any update as
follow-up - could be interesting for other Debian8 victims.

@rpasche could you share a few lines of your incident to add to our FAQ
web page?

I'm not sure, what else I should tell, that wasn't mentioned in the bug
report on Debian? When / is located on an LVM, then within initrd, this
filesystem will be mounted with the "real" kernel device name and this
gets written to /proc/mounts.

To fix this, you can use the patch that I have added to the bug report,
update the initrd afterwards and pin the "initramfs-tools" package until
this gets fixed upstream.

Added it to the release notes.

I am still having this issue when restoring a backup created on Debian
Jessie. I did apply the patch to initramfs - shell script file functions
as explained here
([https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=791754](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=791754))
before creating the backup image. Anyone successfully did a backup
restore on Debian Jessie (8.x) ?. Error received when restoring:  
No code has been generated to restore device fs:/

Here is my steps to create backup and restore:

1.  Patched the file functions in
    /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions
2.  formatted USB disk with rear format
3.  Did rear backup - rear -v mkbackup
4.  Restoring with - rear recover

Error : No code has been generated to restore device fs:/ (fs)  
Please add code to /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh to manually it or
choose abort.

Any pointers is greatly appreciated.  
Thanks  
Pradeep

I am reading the issue resolution again, I think I have to re-build
initrd ? I will try that.  
Any other way to resolve this without rebuilding initrd ?

I wanted to update - after I updated the initrd using command (
update-initramfs -u ), then then taking a backup, the recover seem to be
proceeding.

I did notice that during the recovery process, I see the following on
the console that displays the decrypting archive key. Can this be
disabled or masked. Showing the decrypting key is not a best practice
from security.

"Decrypting archive with key: XXXXXX"

Thanks

I think this is another issue and should be opened separately. And just
a note. The bug has been "closed" in "unstable" on debian. So you do not
have to "pin" the initramfs-tools package on debian systems, when they
are running "unstable".

Robert
