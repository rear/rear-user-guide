I am running rear + bareos in our environment. Each client has its own
fileset, thus needed a specific restore job. I noticed that I need to
add a parameter to tell rear which restore job to automatically start.

I also noticed that a default folder was missing. I added this folder
and rear + bareos work fine since quite a few months. It seems to be
time to share this and offer this contribution.

I cannot really check anything semantically here because  
I never used Bareos but I can do some superficial  
mainly syntactical check:

You use a variable named BAREOS\_RESTOREJOB  
that I cannot find anywhere in the current rear code  
but I can find a variable named BAREOS\_RESTORE\_JOB in  
usr/share/rear/prep/BAREOS/default/55\_check\_bareos\_restore\_jobs.sh

I guess what is actually needed is an enhancement of  
how BAREOS\_RESTORE\_JOB currently works.

In particular that BAREOS\_RESTORE\_JOB is documented  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf therein in  
the "\# BACKUP=BAREOS stuff (bareos.org)" section.  
and that its usage is sufficiently explained there.

@gdha  
because (according to "git blame")  
usr/share/rear/prep/BAREOS/default/55\_check\_bareos\_restore\_jobs.sh  
was made by you I assign this pull request also to you.

The curent rear master code contains in  
restore/BAREOS/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh

<pre>
            FILESET="fileset=\"$BAREOS_FILESET\""
        fi
        if [ -n "$BAREOS_RESTORE_JOB" ]
        then
            RESTOREJOB="restorejob=$BAREOS_RESTORE_JOB"
        fi
        echo "restore client=$BAREOS_CLIENT $RESTOREJOB $FILESET where=$TARGET_FS_ROOT select all done
" |     bconsole
</pre>

which is the same code as in your pull request  
except that BAREOS\_RESTORE\_JOB is used  
(and not BAREOS\_RESTOREJOB).

Therefore I think it is already fixed in curent rear master code  
and accordingly I close this pull request as (already) "fixed".
