#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

v2.5 & v2.6

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

All

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

N/A

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

All

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

All

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

N/A

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

N/A

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):

N/A

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

CDM v5.0.3-P4 and v5.1.1 began excluding the RBS agent from backups. As
a result when a system is restored by ReaR and CDM the RBS agent won't
be re-installed. Re-protection of the system after restore isn't
possible until RBS is reinstalled. If the system needs to be re-linked
to its old backups certificates on the recovered system will have to be
updated with the ones prior to the restore.

-   Workaround, if any:

After recovery but before rebooting copy /etc/rubrik to
/mnt/local/rubrik. Also copy /usr/bin/rubrik to
/mnt/local/usr/bin/rubrik. Both copies should also copy the file
permissions.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

N/A
