@lzaoral  
Wow!  
Looks "rather interesting" to me as a total ZIPL noob ;-)  
Now I have a starting point :-)  
Thank you for it!

Glad to hear that! ðŸ˜„ BTW, if you accidentally overwrite the `zipl`
configuration of your host (e.g. when using the same device for storing
the kernel and initrd) when experimenting, you can just call `zipl`
without any argument to restore it to the default values (at least on
Fedora/RHEL).

@lzaoral  
I would like to suggest to add a bit more context description  
to make the "Booting ReaR rescue initramfs on s390/s390x"  
section somewhat self-contained (to a reasonable extent)  
so that when someone reads only this section  
it is comprehensible on its own.

Perhaps as a total ZIPL noob I am not an intended reader  
of this section so my following suggestions could go too far.  
Nevertheless I just make them and you can then decide  
if and what context description you may add  
as you think what could be best for our users.

(1) "Bare metal" recovery (i.e. recovery on a "bare VM"):  
As far as I see it seems the described method using zipl  
makes the ReaR recovery system boot on the same system  
where the zipl command is run.  
Accordingly it seems the zipl method has the same drawback  
as the kexec method, that a running Linux system is  
already needed where the ReaR recovery system should boot  
(to run kexec or zipl) so neither the kexec method  
nor the zipl method support recovery on a "bare VM"  
(i.e. on a VM where not yet a Linux system must be running).  
Is this the case or do I misunderstand something?  
If my understanding is right, it should be clearly described  
that a running Linux system is already needed  
where the ReaR recovery system should be booted.  
If I misunderstand things, it should be clearly described  
where "rear mkbackup" was run  
versus where "rear recover" should be run  
and how to make the ReaR recovery system boot  
where "rear recover" should be run.

(2) REAR\_OUTPUT usage:  
It confuses me that REAR\_OUTPUT is used  
both for zipl "output" via --target and  
for zipl "input" via --image and --ramdisk.  
I read  
[https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/s390-tools/zipl.8](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/s390-tools/zipl.8)  
and I am wondering if it is really required that one same  
REAR\_OUTPUT directory must be used for the zipl options

    --target=REAR_OUTPUT
    --image=REAR_OUTPUT/...
    --ramdisk=REAR_OUTPUT/...

or if all could be different directories like

    --target=BOOTMAP_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
    --image=/SOME/PATH/TO/KERNEL
    --ramdisk=/ANOTHER/PATH/TO/INITRD

If all could be different directories it should be clearly  
described what the reason is why it is usually OK  
to use one same directory for all three options.  
I think the same directory for KERNEL and INITRD is natural  
but perhaps a differnt --target directory could be required,  
see the next item (3):

(3) Bootloader install device:  
It was inexplicable to me why

    The bootloader ... was installed on the dasda device

regardless that no bootloader install device was specified.  
I think  
[https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/s390-tools/zipl.8](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/s390-tools/zipl.8)  
explains it:

    -t <TARGET DIRECTORY> or --target=<TARGET DIRECTORY>
      Use the specified <TARGET DIRECTORY>.
      zipl uses this directory to store the bootmap,
      i.e. a file containing boot data.
      The actual boot loader is installed onto the device
      containing the target directory.
      Supported devices are DASD and SCSI disks.

So it should be made more clear that via --target  
the bootloader install device is implicitly specified  
to avoid possibly "surprising" results when a user  
specifies some --target=... that happens  
to be on whatever unexpected device  
where then a bootloader gets installed.  
In particular when REAR\_OUTPUT is used for --target  
(i.e. the ReaR recovery system kernel and initrd  
may be stored anywhere where its underlying device  
is not meant to be booted from).

(4) Only for DASD disks:  
According to  
[https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/s390-tools/zipl.8](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/s390-tools/zipl.8)  
the zipl --target method is only supported for  
DASD and SCSI disks.  
If this is right, it may be clearly described.  
Probably - as far as I remember the code -  
currently only DASD disks are supported by ReaR  
so currently the zipl --target method is supported on  
all IBM Z disks that are currently supported by ReaR.  
The crucial word is "currently" - i.e. if ReaR gets  
enhanced to also support other IBM Z disks, the  
described zipl --target method may no longer work  
so to be future-proof this restriction of the  
zipl --target method should be mentioned  
because in practice nobody updates documentation ;-)

To avoid misunderstanding:

In my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3158\#issuecomment-1956565746](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3158#issuecomment-1956565746)  
I wrote about "bare metal recovery",  
I even wrote "true bare metal recovery".

This was very misleading because on IBM Z systems  
"true bare metal recovery" is not wanted.  
On IBM Z there is always some virtualization in between.  
What I actually meant was that the ReaR recovery system  
can be booted on a "bare VM" i.e. on a VM where not yet  
another Linux operating system must be running.

I changed my misleading wording in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3158\#issuecomment-1956565746](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3158#issuecomment-1956565746)  
from "bare metal" to "bare VM".

Thank you a lot for the thorough review, @jsmeix!

I've specified that the new section is only for virtual machines running
under z/VM. While it should be possible to also use ReaR on IBM Z LPARs,
I have never tried that personally (maybe @pcahyna has some
experience?).

(1) The `zipl` method can be used independently of the running OS which
is an information I forgot include by using z/VM Control Program
directly. Actually, it should be quite straightforward to use `zipl` to
implement `OUTPUT=USB` just like you would use GRUB2 or EXTLINUX to
prepare a bootable device on `x86_64`.

(2) Correct, the value of the `--target=` option can be arbitrary as
long as that directory is on the same device. (Actually, I was able to
create the bootmap file (even without `--force`) on a completely
different device but unsurprisingly, the machine then failed to boot.)

(3) Hopefully done.

(4) RHEL only supports IBM Z machines with DASD or SCSI disks so I have
zero experience with other disk types. However, `zipl(8)` on Fedora
Rawhide also mentions NVMe as a supported `--target=`. Also, it seems
that `--tape=` is the right option for tape devices. So the only option
that cannot be covered by `zipl` is the z/VM reader (a virtual punch
card reader) which cannot be used with plain kernel and initramfs anyway
(I have never tried booting RHEL installer from this device but,
apparently, you also need some additional files to do so.).

I've updated the `zipl` section to include this information as well.

@lzaoral  
thank you so much for your so much improved documentation!

In particular thank you for spelling out  
certain IBM Z specific terms like

    z/VM Control Program (CP)

which helps to avoid confusion with things  
like the traditional Unix `cp` program ;-)

I think I got now (for the very first time - hooray!)  
some basic understanding how all that IBM Z booting stuff  
belongs together (in particular zipl and chreipl versus CP).

@lzaoral  
some years ago (at the time when I did my first tests  
with ReaR on IBM Z) we had an internal issue at SUSE  
whether or not to officially support ReaR on IBM Z.  
At that time only virtual machines running under z/VM  
with only DASD disks were considered.  
ReaR on IBM Z LPARs was explicitly not considered.  
So at least for now we do not need to worry about  
support for ReaR on IBM Z LPARs or non-DASD disks.  
Nevertheless it is very good to make clear that  
support for ReaR on IBM Z is currently limited to  
virtual machines running under z/VM with DASD disks  
and perhaps also under z/VM with SCSI disks.

Now this

    The machine will not boot if `BOOTMAP_INSTALL_DIRECTORY`
    and `REAR_DIRECTORY` are on different devices!

makes things clear and it explains why in practice  
it is probably simplest and best to use one same  
directory for bootmap, kernel, and initrd.
