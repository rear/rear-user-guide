#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

\[root@xhcsm5a rear\]\# rear -V  
Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.3 (Maipo)

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=sshfs://root@xxx.xxx.xx.xxx/dbar/  
BACKUP\_URL=sshfs://root@xxx.xxx.xx.xxx/dbar/  
KEEP\_OLD\_OUTPUT\_COPY=1  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE\[@\]}" '/u01'
'/var/cache/yum')

using legacy BIOS boot?

We use ReaR with sshfs option to backup Linux physical/virtual servers.
This works very well but each week we have approximately 30 backups fail
because sshfs hangs.

The current work around is to create the ReaR files local on the server
then copy them to the backup server.

Here is the ls output from /tmp:

\[root@xhcsm5a rear.tdHIIt4LVxXrsKA\]\# pwd  
/tmp/rear.tdHIIt4LVxXrsKA  
\[root@xhcsm5a rear.tdHIIt4LVxXrsKA\]\# ls -lhart  
ls: cannot access outputfs: Transport endpoint is not connected  
total 0  
??????????? ? ? ? ? ? outputfs  
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Nov 27 14:16 tmp  
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 16 Nov 27 14:16 rootfs  
drwx------ 5 root root 44 Nov 27 14:16 .  
drwxrwxrwt. 4 root root 50 Nov 27 14:25 ..

In most cases a server reboot will fix the problem but I'm wondering if
there was anyway to avoid rebooting the server to clear this issue?

Thanks,  
John

Hello @John-Leone,

This don't look like ReaR issue to me.  
You can confirm directly with RedHat, but AFAIK sshfs is not supported
on RHEL...

Hi @gozora  
That's correct sshfs is not supported by RedHat, I opened a case with
them and they don't support sshfs.  
I'm looking for a workaround other than rebooting the server.

Lot of things can be wrong here and I guess RedHat does not support
sshfs for a reason ...  
I personally did not run into any kind of hang situations with FUSE
filesystems, but try just umount stale share:

    fusermount -u /tmp/rear.tdHIIt4LVxXrsKA/outputfs

sshfs works fine most of the time.  
I tried fusermount -u then tried running a new backup with the same
result.

Most of the time ... :-).  
Did you try `rmmod fuse && modprobe fuse` ?

That's a good idea, but same result.

@John-Leone Please add `ServerAliveInterval 15` to your `.ssh/config`
file to avoid such issues in the future

I close it because it is not an issue in ReaR.
