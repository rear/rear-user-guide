@leonardottl  
I am not a IBM POWER user so that I cannot help with POWER specific
issues.  
@schabrolles is our IBM POWER expert  
but currently he is busy with client on-site requests  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2232\#issuecomment-531280327](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2232#issuecomment-531280327)

I notice that in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3673761/rear-koza.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3673761/rear-koza.log)  
there is (near the end) only

    2019-09-30 15:15:01.120713440 Including output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh
    2019-09-30 15:15:01.123360621 Including output/default/950_email_result_files.sh

without the expected log messsage

    Copying resulting files to usb location

that should normally come from
usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/950_copy_result_files.sh)  
unless things have gone wrong before so that this script does nothing.

I am also missing

    ... Including output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh
    ... Writing MBR of type ...

lines in your log file when running  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh)

So I was wondering if before you did run `rear mkrescue`,  
you had formatted your USB disk especially for use with ReaR, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

But the log messages about `REAR-000` like

    2019-09-30 15:14:10.319559019 Including prep/NETFS/default/060_mount_NETFS_path.sh
    mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.Xhun18bUFlRMlIR/outputfs'

    mount: /dev/sdk1 mounted on /tmp/rear.Xhun18bUFlRMlIR/outputfs.

indicate that you had formatted your USB device for use with ReaR.

Therefore I think the root cause is that scripts like

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh

have the system architecture `Linux-i386` directory in their path  
so that such scripts are not run on POWER architecture  
(POWER architecture specific scripts would have to have  
a `Linux-ppc64` or `Linux-ppc64le` directory in their path)  
which means in the end that current ReaR seems to  
not support `OUTPUT=USB` on POWER architecture.

@schabrolles  
could you please have a look here and verify whether or not  
current ReaR supports `OUTPUT=USB` on POWER architecture?

@jsmeix I currently never done any changes or test on OUTPUT=USB on
Power. SO I think you point where the problem is ;-)  
Unfortunately, as you said, it is difficult for me to work on this point
for the moment.

Thank you both, @jsmeix and @schabrolles , I think you have identified
the issue, thanks. Would you recommend I try to build the ISO output and
try with that?

Let me update that using the ISO OUTPUT allowed us to make bootable
media and we are now performing the backup, I will update if all goes
well. So til now it seems that the issue was the fact that for Power USB
OUTPUT seems to not be supported.

@leonardottl, just for a test, if you really want to boot on USB, you
can try to copy the iso into a USB device with dd

    dd if=<path_to_rear.iso> of=/dev/<USB_block_device> bs=1M

WARNING, it will destroy all the data you have on the USB device.

Tell le if it works

@leonardottl

in general regarding `OUTPUT=USB` versus `OUTPUT=ISO`  
and `BACKUP_URL=usb:...` versus ` BACKUP_URL=nfs:...`:

The USB specific parts in ReaR behave somewhat different  
compared to the usual way via ISO and backup on NFS.

In particular when you have your backup on USB things are different  
compared to backup on NFS, see in particular `USB_SUFFIX` in
default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L754](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L754)

For some examples of USB specific issues that I found right now see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2171\#issuecomment-509143476](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2171#issuecomment-509143476)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1738\#issuecomment-370394149](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1738#issuecomment-370394149)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571\#issuecomment-343461088](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571#issuecomment-343461088)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158)  
and several more...

But the most dangerous generic issue when using a USB disk  
originated in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)  
which should nowadays be mostly avoided, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271\#issuecomment-346633365](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271#issuecomment-346633365)  
but that is not yet fully sufficient because there is still  
a generic problem when a ReaR recovery disk is used, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854)

By the way:  
Regarding "Creating bootable USB from ReaR ISO" you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)

If you like to try out if `OUTPUT=USB` could be made  
working on POWER with relatively little effort:

1.  Create a new usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-ppc64le/ directory.  
    For `ppc64le` versus `ppc64el` see  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2195\#issuecomment-517648246](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2195#issuecomment-517648246)

2.  Copy the scripts in usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/  
    into the new usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-ppc64le/ directory.

3.  Run `rear -D mkrescue` in full debug mode and inspect the log file  
    if things look o.k. when running those scripts.  
    If not you have to adapt those scripts as needed for POWER.  
    If things look o.k. try to boot the ReaR recovery system  
    and if it starts up well try if `rear -D recover` works.  
    If not see in particular "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"
    in  
    [https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Thank you @jsmeix for the detailed response, I think making the USB
directly may be doable then. However, we decided to generate the ISO and
burn it on the USB directly using dd as you also suggested, this worked
fine!

We have now made the backup successfully, but have one last question. Is
it normal for mkbackup to not consider some files or directories, for
instance we noticed that the home directory was not included in the tar
backup file, is this correct? can we add a flag to also include it and
others? Thank you for your time and help.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2019-10-04 06:59](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243#issuecomment-538270003):

ReaR runs the `tar` backup with the `--one-file-system` option, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh\#L136](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh#L136)

When you use btrfs subvolumes they behave like separated filesystems,
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf\#L54](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf#L54)

To specify explicitly what and only what is included in the backup you
may use  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L996](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L996)

Another hint regarding architecture specific scripts:  
Run e.g. `rear -s mkrescue` (`-s` is simulation mode) to see what
scripts  
would be sourced and `grep` for architecture specific scripts.  
For example on my Ubuntu x86 system with `OUTPUT=USB` I get

    # usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue | grep 'i386'

    Source conf/Linux-i386.conf
    Source prep/USB/Linux-i386/340_find_mbr_bin.sh
    Source prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_check_usb_disk.sh
    Source prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_find_syslinux_modules.sh
    Source prep/USB/Linux-i386/400_check_extlinux.sh
    Source build/Debian/i386/600_fix_debian_stuff.sh
    Source output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh
    Source output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
    Source output/USB/Linux-i386/830_copy_kernel_initrd.sh
    Source output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh

For `OUTPUT=USB` on POWER you need equivalent `/USB/` scripts.

Dear @jsmeix and @schabrolles , we are still unable to get rear to
backup the entire system, if you can comment on our issue it would be
most appreciated, believe us that we are working on our side to solve it
but just cannot find what we are doing wrong.

To define which directories to include we are using:  
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE=( '/\*' )  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE=y

should these options force rear to backup the entire file system, or is
something else required?

Here is one example where we are using the EXCLUDE option instead, but
still not getting all the directories, such as /home and others.

I attach the local.conf and the log file from rear -Dv mkbackup

@leonardottl  
before I try to dig around in your logs (as time permits)  
I would like to know what output you get for the following commands:

    lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

and

    findmnt -a

to get an overview of your block devices and filesystems structure  
plus your `disklayout.conf` file that "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" created.

In general when you use `BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE=y`  
you need to explicitly specify in the BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE array  
all filesystem-like thingies (usually the mountpoints of filesystems  
and - if you have - btrfs subvolumes) you want to get in your backup.

Ugh - looks somewhat complicated what is mounted there,  
in particular I know nothing at all about container stuff  
like kubernetes and kubelet or docker.

I see nothing about `home` at all so it seems the `/home/`  
directory belongs to the root filesystem so that it should normally  
just be automatically included in the `tar` backup.

Currently I have no idea why it is not included in the backup  
in this particular case here.

Is perhaps what appears as `home` not a regular directory  
of the root filesystem but some kind of indirectly provided stuff  
via some container thingy like kubernetes, docker and whatnot?

In fact home is just an example of a directory that is missing, in fact
home is basically empty in our setup, because most of the work is done
on containers, and stored on a data disk, so home is basically
configuration stuff for each user, not much else. But other directories
are also missing.  
So yes, home is in the root (which it should not be we know), but it is
not being included in the bakup, in general the backup is only a
fraction of the size of the whole system .

Some other points to consider:

-   the backup is bien made from the booted OS of the server, not from
    the ISO (is this a problem?)
-   We estimate that the size of the backup should be 100GB, it is only
    like 18GB
-   within the tar we see there are missing directories (such as home
    but others as well)
-   when we make the backup we turn off all the services that are
    writing to disk, such as docker and kubernets

@leonardottl  
I think it will not provide a real solution for your issue  
so mainly FYI you may have a look at a similar issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344)

Perhaps it might even help you a bit nevertheless.

Regarding huge files on a ISO i.e. with `OUTPUT=ISO` on PPC64le  
(in particular having a backup.tar.gz that is bigger than 4GiB in the
ISO)  
see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344\#issuecomment-602507147](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344#issuecomment-602507147)  
and subsequent comments and the links therein  
that are about using the `-iso-level 3` option also on PPC64le, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344\#issuecomment-601655379](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2344#issuecomment-601655379)

With current ReaR GitHub master code  
the `-iso-level 3` option is now also used on PPC64le, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2346](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2346)

If you like to try that out see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"

@leonardottl  
right now I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2348](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2348)

Please have a look there if I described the issue correctly.  
I am not a PPC user so I may misunderstand things.

@jsmeix  
Thanks for all the tips. I did not update, but our issue was resolved,
we updated all of our system, including the OS and everything else. REAR
is now working as it should, and backs up all of our docker system. Let
me get back to you with the currently installed versions and other
details.

It is strange though because according to \#2344 a PreP partition is
missing, so the system should not even start booting, while here it
starts booting and can not mount root.

@pcahyna, the reason why the system can boot is because it is using
petitboot
([https://github.com/open-power/petitboot](https://github.com/open-power/petitboot))
used on Power BareMetal system (like LC models).  
In a nuteshell petitboot is micro-linux in firmware which load and scan
disk and network to find grub configuration and aggregate then into a
single menu (for disk, SAN, network, dvd, usb). ... So, in that case,
PreP partition is not needed.

@schabrolles thanks for the explanation. So it looks that this and
\#2344 are two different issues.

@pcahyna, yes you are right... \#2344 is PowerVM LPAR, in that case,
Prep is needed.
