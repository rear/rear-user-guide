-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? Manually

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

These new array variables enable to ignore specific IP addresses or
network interfaces when building the network configuration used in the
rescue environment.  
This is typically useful when floating IP addresses are used. Not
ignoring these may lead to outage if the floating IP address is used by
another system at time the system is getting recovered.

Looks good, thanks - @rear/contributors , do you have an opinion on the
variable naming? I checked the current variables and there is nothing
called `IGNORED_*` but there are many `EXCLUDE_*` variables. As the
present variables are for a bit different purpose than the `EXCLUDE_*`
ones (those are for excluding stuff from backup, layout, or both, ditto
`*INCLUDE_*`), I think the different name is acceptable. Shouldn't one
use an imperative (`IGNORE`) instead of a participle (`IGNORED`) for
consistency, though?

We also use `EXCLUDE` named variables (in imperative grammar form)  
to exclude things from the recovery system e.g. `COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE`.

We use nowhere `IGNORE` named config variables  
except `EXTERNAL_IGNORE_ERRORS` which has a different meaning  
than what IGNORED\_IP\_ADDRESSES and IGNORED\_NETWORK\_INTERFACES  
are meant to do as far as I understand their description in
default.conf  
which actually means something like  
"ignore them during recovery system build so they get excluded from the
recovery system".

So I think renaming them into  
`EXCLUDE_IP_ADDRESSES` and `EXCLUDE_NETWORK_INTERFACES`  
explains better to the user what their actual meaning is.

Thanks for the comments, I will squash all this before merging once you
are ok with this.

@rmetrich  
thank you for your prompt code cleanup and enhancements.  
I reassign it to you so that you can merge it when you are ready for
merging it.

Just a thought: `EXCLUDE_IP_ADDRESSES` and `EXCLUDE_NETWORK_INTERFACES`
are intended for the rescue image only. Do you think that there will
ever be a need to exclude the addresses from the recovered system (i.e.
permanently)? I would prefer to not have such transformations of the
resulting system in ReaR, but there are some already (the various
mapping rules and migration capabilities).

@rmetrich thank you for quickly addressing the review comments. I think
squashing the commits is appropriate. I keep separate commits when there
is a logical need to do so (like, when in the same PR I do a cleanup of
the old code, then I do functional changes, I keep the two separate),
but it is not the case here.

In general recreating a system different than it was before  
belongs primarily to MIGRATION\_MODE in ReaR.

If the values in EXCLUDE\_IP\_ADDRESSES and
EXCLUDE\_NETWORK\_INTERFACES  
are also intended for the recreated system some additional separated  
config variable would be needed.

The current config variables that are related to migration are not
named  
with MIGRATE in their name so one has to search default.conf for
places  
that mention `migrat` (ignore case) to find what is related to
migration.

The whole system migration area is currently not well implemented.  
Something is done automatically mostly even hardcoded by scripts  
so not at all any "final power to the user" in those cases.  
Something can be specified via some config variables.  
Something is just missing, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2312)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2468](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2468)

For the not so fun of it:  
As far as I remember some longer time ago  
I tried to improve the automated networking migration code  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2310)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2313)  
in the recreated system but I basically got lost in that code  
likely because I am not at all an expert in networking setup.  
There is a reason why I prefer DHCP - my FritzBox router  
and the KVM/QEMU virtualization environments  
do the networking setup better than I can :-)
