===========================================================================================

Hi,

We are using Oracle Linux 6.4 and when we are using rear for
recovering  
the bootloader does not get installed.  
The problem is I think that the grub code doesn't get called.  
Oracle Linux is an Red Hat clone btw.

Any help is welcome.

Below part of the restore log en the rear dump.

WARNING ! For this system

there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system or the
code  
that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.

Please contribute this code to the Relax and Recover project. To do so  
please take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize,  
for an example you can use the script for Fedora (and RHEL/CentOS/SL)
in  
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/20\_install\_grub.sh

You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login' to access the recovered
system.  
Please remember to mount /proc before trying to install a boot loader.

I tried to add support for Oracle in
8c27d34aaa0c8ca2b7aff6a09e7ba2e26bdf9a6d. Please test and close the
issue or provide a new dump. Seems like you are the first to try Oracle
Linux, at least I could not find any reference to it in our code.

It works !  
The bootloader got installed and the system was restored successfully.  
I will do some tests with other servers this week but i have good hope.
