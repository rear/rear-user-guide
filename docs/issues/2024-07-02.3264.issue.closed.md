-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): ReaR project

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    The idea is when we close a milestone automatic a WIKI page will be
    created containing the release notes. This will reduce our manual
    effort of creating one and editing it to make it presentable.

As test case a workflow was created on another project (of mine) to see
how it looks. e.g.
<https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/wiki/Release-Notes-v1.28>

And the workflow itself used is at
<https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/blob/master/.github/workflows/wiki.yml>

Let us discuss if we want to implement this for our ReaR project as
well?

We will not use this method as we are looking for better ways now.
