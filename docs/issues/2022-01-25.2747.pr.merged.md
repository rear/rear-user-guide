-   How was this pull request tested?

Deployed a RHEL 7.9 system on vSphere, ran `rear mkrescue` with no
errors. Performed BMR on using the created ISO image on a 2nd empty
vSphere VM and was able to recover the original system successfully.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Removed the need to include /usr/lib64 with the Rubrik CDM image. Rubrik
CDM v6 and higher does not seem to need the libraries in this directory
anymore. This will also reduce the image size when CDM is being used and
fix boot problems due to an image that is too large.

@DamaniN  
in general regarding explicitly adding libraries to the recovery system
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743\#issuecomment-1018280042](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743#issuecomment-1018280042)

As far as I understand it only libraries that are loaded via dlopen  
should be needed to be explicitly listed in LIBS  
because all other libraries (i.e. "normally" linked libraries)  
should get automatically included in the recovery sytem  
according to what I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743\#issuecomment-1018280042](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2743#issuecomment-1018280042)

So I think in general adding the whole /usr/lib64/ to the recovery
system  
should never be needed.

E.g. on my openSUSE Leap 15.3 system with its default Gnome  
/usr/lib64/ contains more than 20000 regular files  
and needs more than 3GiB disk space

    # find /usr/lib64 -type f | wc -l
    21751

    # du -hs /usr/lib64
    3.1G    /usr/lib64

@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate a second review by one of you as time permits.

I am not a CDM user, so I can't comment on CDM functionality and the
impact of the change on it, but including the whole `/usr/lib64` has
always looked as a bad idea to me (it produces very large rescue images
with stuff like e.g. Firefox included), so I will be glad to see it
removed.

When there are no objections I would merge it tomorrow afternoon.

@DamaniN  
thank you for your continuous fixes and improvements for BACKUP=CDM!

Contributions for special backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not use those special backup tools  
so we totally depend on contributions from users  
who use and know about the special backup tools.
