While Rear always used */tmp* for almost everything it does, the
practice is probably against what users would expect. Although I don't
know what the best alternative should be. We need to discuss this.

ISO file location:

-   $(pwd)
-   /var/lib/rear/
-   /tmp

Log file location:

-   $(pwd)
-   /var/log/rear/
-   /var/log
-   /tmp

I am in favour of using dedicated paths that ReaR (rpm, deb) controls

-   /var/lib/rear/output for the result of OUTPUT
-   /var/log/rear for log files with a suitable log rotation/deletion
    rule so  
    that one can safely use ReaR in a cron job.

That way removing the ReaR package can also remove the content of
these  
dirs.

For RHEL/Fedora (fhs-2.3) the following location are fine:  
ISO location : /var/lib/rear/output/  
Log location: /var/log/rear/

I guess as FHS rules apply the other OSes fine too.
