Hi,

I am using rear version 1.15-5.el6 in my setup.  
I have a requirement, where number of backups per server are needed to
be kept limited because of space constraints.  
Can someone help me with the option in /etc/rear/local.conf where the
number of backups will be defined, i.e. if i set 1 copy, then while
taking second copy the first copy will be wiped off.

Thanks,  
Vivek P.
