We have to port the OBS (OpenSUSE Build System) related code to Github
for releasing packages for various distributions.

For this we need to readdress the versioning of the project as Github is
not based on a global revision like subversion. The proposal is to use
an official version from the release and a daily timestamp. Another
change will be the package name for (daily) snapshot releases to
**rear** instead of **rear-snapshot**.

Both changes will make normal releases and snapshot releases
interchangeable:

    rear-1.13.0
    rear-1.13.0-1.git20120528
    rear-1.14
    rear-1.14-1.git20120812

There is also no need for the third digit, so we might as well stop
doing the third digit (until it is needed). This means that our next
release will become **1.14** and if there is a need to patch 1.14
(because a major bug is backported to that release) we will release
**1.14.1**. This gives us the future flexibility to support older
releases.

The first step, to have a Rear project on OBS is already performed by
Schlomo. You can find our new project location at:
[Archive:Backup:Rear](https://build.opensuse.org/project/packages?project=Archiving%3ABackup%3ARear)

The we must make sure that the snapshot and release packages go to  
different repos on OBS. Otherwise people won't be able to install the  
release. That was the original reasoning behind the rear-snapshot
package.

Dag,  
did you finish the git2obs.sh script? If it is not yet finished can you
push it into git so we can have a look and try to finish it?

@gdha There is nothing in my scripts that even works, so there is
nothing to share. It will probably confuse you even more :-( I did not
have the time to look into it after LinuxTag 2012.

My focus is now on the Makefile, then OBS, then automated testing and
potentially after that reorganizing the tree. We could do a release when
the automated testing is useful. At some point I would also like to
re-indent all files and make that Bash coding style document. But life's
too short :-(
