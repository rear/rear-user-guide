When I attempt a restore from an iso created  
using the rear -v mkrescue command,  
and select the option to restore from a replica Rubrik cluster,  
the agent will not register on the replica cluster  
when I attempt to register it using the IP address.  
I get an error indicating the agent is not running  
(refusal to connect on port 12801).  
When I check on the partially restored system,  
the Rubrik agents are not running.  
Attempts to start the agents using  
"systemctl start rubrikagents"  
result in an error  
"rubrikagents.service not found"

-   Workaround, if any:

None I can find so far.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

The backup log files did not reflect any errors.  
The system I was trying to recover (a Vmware VM)  
no longer exists and I have no option left to restore  
except to use the Rubrik replica copy of the backup.

@rmccrack If you look into the `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` file
you will find:

    ####
    # BACKUP=CDM (Rubrik CDM; Cloud Data Management)
    ##
    # ReaR support for Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM).
    # ReaR will copy the Rubrk RBS agent and required OS binaries to its ISO for incluson on boot.
    # ReaR will start the Rubrik RBS agent when 'rear recover' is run.

And also check script
`/usr/share/rear/verify/CDM/default/450_start_cdm_rbs.sh` - could be
that the content is a bit outdated?

The issue is not with starting the Rubrik agent, it is that the original
Rubrik installation, which is what the iso contains, does not have the
correct security certificate for the replica Rubrik instance. This is
embedded in the rpm package that is normally downloaded from the Rubrik
instance, and is installed when that package is installed. It is
possible to download that package, as the curl utility does seem to be
available. But once downloaded, neither rpm nor yum are available to
install the replacement package, and without that one cannot complete
the step of registering the system by IP address on the replica Rubrik
instance. Consequently, one cannot complete the recovery.

@rmccrack Certificates of Rubrik are stored on your original system on a
dedicated location. Please check the Rubrik documentation if you don't
know it by heart. You could also verify inside the RPM package with
`rpm -qpl rubrik.rpm` command.  
Once found the location you could add it to the
`COPY_AS_IS_CDM=( /etc/rubrik /usr/bin/rubrik /var/log/rubrik /etc/pki )`
array in the `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` file.

@rmccrack  
the ReaR recovery system is intentionally a minimal system  
that contains only what is needed for "rear recover"  
because for each system one system specific  
ReaR recovery system is needed so the ReaR recovery system  
should not be bigger than what is actually needed.  
Think about bigger environments where ReaR is used  
for very many systems - one needs storage space for  
all those system specific ReaR recovery systems.

In particular there is no software package management  
in the ReaR recovery system by default.

You could add what you like to the ReaR recovery system  
via COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, and LIBS  
see their descriptions in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

All what is needed for "rear recover" must be put  
into the ReaR recovery system during "rear mkrescue".

So the missing "security certificate" has to be be put  
into the ReaR recovery system during "rear mkrescue".

This is what @gdha tried to tell you.  
I.e. you may use e.g. COPY\_AS\_IS\_CDM  
to copy the missing "security certificate"  
into the ReaR recovery system during  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup".

In case of emergency during "rear recover" you can add  
missing files into the running ReaR recovery system  
e.g. via "curl" or "scp" or via USB stick or whatever.  
But you would have to provide the actual missing files  
and not those files somehow packaged into a package format  
that you cannot unpack within the ReaR recovery system.  
So if the missing "security certificate" is one file  
you could use e.g. "curl" to get that file from another  
system and copy it into the running ReaR recovery system.  
When you need to copy many files into the running ReaR  
recovery system you can use a tar archive because 'tar'  
is always available in the ReaR recovery system, see  
REQUIRED\_PROGS in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
and see also RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL therein.

FYI  
in general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:

Usually we at ReaR upstream do not have or use third-party backup
tools  
(in particular not if a third-party backup tool is proprietary
software)  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.

In case of issues with third-party backup tools and ReaR  
we at ReaR upstream can usually do nothing but totally  
depend on contributions and help from those specific users  
who use and know about each specific third-party backup tool.

First, all the "COPY\_AS\_IS" information is beside the point, because
the required certificate for the Rubrik replica server is not on the
original system. True, I could anticipate and stash the required file
somewhere, but then the user would have to have a simple way to stop the
Rubrik agent, move the certificate file into place, and restart the
agent. With the usual "service" or "systemctl" utilities non-existent
(apparently) that's not a trivial issue and at the very least your
program should be putting detailed instructions to the screen for this
when a replica is to be used.

If you are not intending to support use of a Rubrik replica instance for
a restore, why do you prompt for a yes/no answer regarding whether the
original CDM instance is being used for recovery? And then, if the
answer is no, prompt for the IP address of a node in the replica
instance? These are valid questions if you can use the replica to
restore from. Otherwise, they are misleading because the fact is, one
can only use the original instance as the code stands today.

What I need is for our average off-hours support technician to be able
to use this product to get a trashed unix virtual system back up and
running in a reasonable period of time. They aren't going to know all
the intricacies of either ReaR or Rubrik to "work around" this issue.
And for reasons I won't detail, as often as not a replica copy needs to
be used.

@rmccrack The setting in configuration file
`conf/default.conf:PROGS_CDM=( /usr/bin/rubrik/backup_agent_main /usr/bin/rubrik/bootstrap_agent_main openssl uuidgen )`
makes sure the needed software is copied into the rescue image of ReaR.

The script `prep/CDM/default/450_check_cdm_client.sh` checks if the the
client software `/usr/bin/rubrik/backup_agent_main` is present. However,
it seems there is no code present to start the executable it seems, or
am I wrong?

What is the content of `rubrikagents.service` on your system?  
And, there must be a public Rubrik certificate available on your client
system as otherwise I don't see how if can identify itself with the
Rubrik master?

We figured out what is going wrong and developed a workaround.

When the option to use a replica is selected, four things are attempted:

1.  The /etc/rubrik/keys/agent.pem, agent.crt, and rubrik.crt files are
    renamed.
2.  The Solaris agent package is downloaded from the replica server,
    unpacked, and the /etc/rubrik/keys/rubrik.crt file replaced.
3.  The /etc/rubrik/rba\_keygen.sh script is run to replace the
    /etc/rubrik/keys/agent.pem and agent.crt files.
4.  The two agent programs are re-launched.

A significant percentage of the time, one or both of operations 2 and 3
fail, silently. This leaves one or more of the agent.pem, agent.crt, and
rubrik.crt files missing and as a result the agent restarts fail, which
in turn causes the remainder of the recovery to fail.

Our workaround is a script that we place in the /etc/rear directory that
re-attempts the previously described steps, with extensive
error-checking. We choose the option to restore from the original Rubrik
cluster, and when we reach the prompt following filesystem creation,
etc. we run our script. After successful completion, we continue the
normal procedure of registering by IP address on the replica cluster,
etc.
