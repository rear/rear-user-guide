-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

formatted the USB stick with:

    sudo rear format -- --efi /dev/sdb

then labelled using gparted - adding labels to /dev/sdb1 (REAR-EFI) and
/dev/sdb2 (REAR-RRB)

then run:

    sudo rear mkrescue

fails with

    2020-11-12 10:21:12.591819132 Including output/default/940_grub2_rescue.sh

Without GRUB\_RESCUE, it appears to finish successfully, but the drive
is not recognized by the BIOS on boot up. I have another UEFI USB drive
that is recognized, so I don't think it's the BIOS settings.

-   Workaround, if any:

None known

@jpa57  
I am not a bootloader expert and even less a UEFI expert  
so I cannot actually help with UEFI bootloader setup issues.

You wrote contradicting info:  
On the one hand you wrote

    Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or ELILO or Petitboot):
    BIOS / GRUB

but on the other hand you wrote contradictingly

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE=512
    ....
    /dev/sda    /dev/sda           sata   disk        111.8G 
    |-/dev/sda2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda        part ext4   110.3G /
    |-/dev/sda3 /dev/sda3 /dev/sda        part swap   976.5M [SWAP]
    `-/dev/sda1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda        part vfat     512M /boot/efi
    ....
    sudo rear format -- --efi /dev/sdb

which indicate that you use UEFI.

I assume `BIOS / GRUB` is wrong and actually  
you use UEFI firmware and GRUB2 as bootloader.

On first glance I spotted `COPY_AS_IS=1` in your local.conf  
which is clearly wrong, see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
how each config variable is meant to be used  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1375](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1375)

In particular GRUB\_RESCUE has nothing to do with the  
bootloader of the ReaR recovery system on your USB drive  
(see its description in default.conf).

See the "BOOTLOADER" related config variables in default.conf  
about possible settings for the ReaR recovery system bootloader.

So first of all remove that `COPY_AS_IS=1` from your local.conf  
to be safe against its bad consequences.  
When I use `COPY_AS_IS=1` the whole ReaR in usr/share/rear  
is missing in the recovery system so "rear recover" cannot work.

Then play around with "BOOTLOADER" related config variables  
(in particular UEFI bootloader related things) and try to make  
the ReaR recovery system bootloader on your USB drive working for you.

Regarding `OUTPUT=USB fails to UEFI boot` from a USB drive  
see also the related issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500)  
so also try if `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` works better for you as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500\#issuecomment-724280432](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2500#issuecomment-724280432)  
and subsequent comments.

If all that does not result a ReaR recovery system bootloader  
on your USB drive that can boot via UEFI  
attach your latest "rear -D mkrescue" debug log file to this issue  
so that others who know about UEFI bootloader setup issues  
have a chance to understand what goes on on your particular system.

Thanks for the help. I meant to update it once I resolved it but totally
forgot. It was all my misunderstanding of the settings as described
