-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1989](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1989)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Modified local installation, performed `sudo rear -v mkbackup` and
    observed the 'Docker Root Dir' was recognized as expected.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

On Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS with Docker 19.03.13, rear "Cannot
determine Docker Root Dir" even though 'Docker Root Dir' is found in
`docker info`. This seems to be because docker also sends to stderr
which interferes with the variable assignment:

    $ timeout -k 2s 5s docker info | grep 'Docker Root Dir' | awk '{print $4}'
    WARNING: No swap limit support
    /var/lib/docker

redirecting stderr to null allows the 'Docker Root Dir' value to be
assigned to the `docker_root_dir` variable correctly.

FYI: It appears that this redirection used to be there, but was omitted
(probably by mistake) in

@grigutis  
I do not understand how `2>/dev/null` could help here  
because in a pipe `PRODUCER_COMMAND | CONSUMER_COMMAND`  
the consumer command only gets stdout of the producer command  
so in `docker info | grep` stderr of `docker info` does not reach
`grep`.

An example:

    # cat -n /etc/issue qqq
         1  Welcome to \S - Kernel \r (\l).
         2
         3
    cat: qqq: No such file or directory

    # cat -n /etc/issue qqq 1>/dev/null
    cat: qqq: No such file or directory

    # cat -n /etc/issue qqq 2>/dev/null
         1  Welcome to \S - Kernel \r (\l).
         2
         3

    # cat -n /etc/issue qqq | grep Kernel
    cat: qqq: No such file or directory
         1  Welcome to \S - Kernel \r (\l).

    # var=$( cat -n /etc/issue qqq | grep Kernel )
    cat: qqq: No such file or directory

    # echo "'$var'"
    '     1 Welcome to \S - Kernel \r (\l).'

    # var=$( cat -n /etc/issue qqq | grep Kernel | awk '{print $6}' )
    cat: qqq: No such file or directory

    # echo "'$var'"
    'Kernel'

Thank you for your explanation. After some more testing, it looks like I
was wrong. After taking out the redirection, the variable was still
being set correctly. I tested it a couple of times and it worked every
time. I guess it was just hitting the timeout when I was seeing it
earlier and the fact that it worked after adding the redirection was
just a coincidence. I'll keep an eye on it though.

@grigutis  
let's not give up too early.  
You wrote `I guess it was just hitting the timeout`.  
I never used ReaR on a system with docker, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1989\#issuecomment-456071787](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1989#issuecomment-456071787)  
so I can also only guess but I think we could simply make the timeout
longer  
to avoid that the timeout kills a valid ongoing operation.  
The current 5 seconds timeout value is not because something  
would go wrong if `docker info` did not finish within 5 seconds.  
The timeout is there to avoid that `docker info` basically hangs up  
(i.e. does not finish within a reasonable amount of time).  
So increasing the timeout value to 10 seconds  
(or perhaps even to 30 seconds if really needed in some cases)  
should be ok.  
Cf. the comment of @gdha in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2021](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2021)

    @jsmeix do me a favor and replace docker info
    with timeout 5s docker info - why? I have seen too many cripple
    docker installation the last couple of months.

so the 5 seconds timeout value was just "some reasonable value"  
at that time.

I increased the 'docker info' timeout value from 5 seconds to 10
seconds  
to (hopefully) avoid this issue here.

Thank you. Hopefully that fixes it, but in any case I'll monitor the
logs and see if this ever pops up again.

@grigutis  
thank you for your issue report so that we know at least about it and  
thank you in advance for monitoring if it works now sufficiently
reliable.  
If it pops up again we can look again what the root cause could be.

Well, the problem has reappeared. Last week, it was okay, but today it
failed to find the docker dir. (I only run rear once a week.)

I found that [others have run into this problem of docker commands
taking an unusually long time to
complete](https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-commands-running-slow/48481).
In any case, I just wanted to report this. Thank you for your help.
