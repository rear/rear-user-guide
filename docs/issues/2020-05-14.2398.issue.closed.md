I share a directory from AIX machine to use it as backup for ReaR,  
i can mount it using command

    mount -o vers=3 ip:/share /mount_point

but when i using ReaR it seems that it use NFS Version=4  
and produce error. like below.

The log file in /var/log/rear/xxx.log

    mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.rjbDv6M41RuA6rS/outputfs'
    2020-05-14 16:16:38.263945559 Mounting with 'mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime IP:/share /tmp/rear.rjbDv6M41RuA6rS/outputfs'
    mount.nfs: mount(2): Remote I/O error
    mount.nfs: Remote I/O error

Can anyone help me?  
thanks..

Hi @mahmoudrafat,

NFS version 4 is now Linux default, so it is not ReaR making trouble.  
Try to add `BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"` to your *local.conf*
(*site.conf*).

Hmm, now reading more carefully I see that you've already did that.

Can you provide full */var/log/rear/rear.log*, so we can see what is
going on ?

@mahmoudrafat  
more precisely we need the full debug log, i.e. what you get  
with `rear -d -D mkrescue` or `rear -d -D mkbackup`, see also  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Note that the full debug log may contain private information  
about your business environment like server names or  
even some real secrets so you may as a first step cut away  
what is not needed but what must stay is the full debug log  
of all parts that are related to mounting your AIX NFS share.

For comparison on my SLES12-SP5 x86\_64 test system  
where I use this etc/rear/local.conf

where mounting a NFS share works for me  
that is on an openSUSE Leap 15.1 NFS server.

[rear-test.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4729748/rear-test.log)

Hi, Thanks for your response,  
i attached the error part only because the log is too big more than 1000
page!!  
when i mount the shared directory with "mount -o nfsver=3 IP/share" it
is ok.  
may i change the rear mount command to use that command instead of mount
-v -t nfs -o rw,noatime" ?  
Note: that problem shows only when using AIX NFS server i did it when
using Redhat NFS server and it is ok.

You can attach files directly to this conversation by drag-n-drop, no
need to copy + paste file content.

You can, this right is granted to you by GPL ;-)

I'm just wondering why `BACKUP_OPTIONS` does not work for you, because
content of `BACKUP_OPTIONS` is normally passed to `mount` command by
ReaR, so I'd still like to see full output from `rear -d -D mkrescue` as
@jsmeix proposed in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2398\#issuecomment-628702055](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2398#issuecomment-628702055).

Hmm, I always thought that if `OUTPUT_OPTIONS` is not explicitly set, it
somehow takes over content from `BACKUP_OPTIONS`, but this is only true
if following condition
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/f6e9fbca381ffd7ba14cb3685c64ecad3f1b9585/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh\#L47-L52](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/f6e9fbca381ffd7ba14cb3685c64ecad3f1b9585/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020_translate_url.sh#L47-L52)  
is matched.

@mahmoudrafat can you please add following line to your *local.conf* and
try to re-run `rear mkbackup`

    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

@gozora  
I did what you say and it make ISO image but the size is only 92M for
ISO and 166MB for tar file, that doesn't make sense because the used
space for the root is 22GB!  
Can you please tell me how to change mount option in rear
configuration?  
i need to test it with "mount -o nfsvers=3 " only

@mahmoudrafat

I think you forget to add some specific option needed by Suse when BTRFS
and subvolume are used. Try to use the following as `local.conf`

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    OUPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.122.1/nfs
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
    PROGRESS_MODE=plain
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS=3
    KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( no )
    REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION=lzma

    #SLES BTRFS specific
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" snapper chattr lsattr )
    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )

    for subvol in $(findmnt -n -r -t btrfs | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash') ; do
            BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE[@]}" "$subvol" )
    done

    POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( 'if snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT get-config | grep -q "^QGROUP.*[0-9]/[0-9]" ; then snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT set-config QGROUP= ; snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT setup-quota && echo snapper setup-quota done || echo snapper setup-quota failed ; else echo snapper setup-quota not used ; fi' )

@schabrolles  
I used the example from the docs and i don't think this is the problem
because i made it on VM machine with the same configuration.  
the problem with NFS share from AIX to SUSE.

@mahmoudrafat, compare to the one included into the doc I added
`OUPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"` (proposed by @gozora) ...

Although, did you apply the following command on the AIX machine ?

    nfso -po nfs_use_reserved_ports=1
    nfso -po portcheck=1

@schabrolles, I did what @gozora Said and added
`OUPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"`  
But it make an 150MB ISO only, see the previous comment.

> Although, did you apply the following command on the AIX machine ?

I will check it.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2020-05-18 13:06](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2398#issuecomment-630169870):

Now I see why

    OUTPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

(it is `OUTPUT_OPTIONS` not `BACKUP_OPTIONS`)  
is needed when one has

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://IP/share
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://IP/share

i.e. when OUTPUT\_URL is explicitly specified:

This is because prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh contains

    if [[ -z "$OUTPUT_OPTIONS" ]] ; then
        if [[ -z "$OUTPUT_URL" && -z "$OUTPUT_MOUNTCMD" ]] ; then
            ### There can be cases where it's intentionally empty.
            OUTPUT_OPTIONS=$BACKUP_OPTIONS
        fi
    fi

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020\_translate\_url.sh\#L48](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/default/020_translate_url.sh#L48)  
so OUTPUT\_OPTIONS inherits from BACKUP\_OPTIONS  
only if OUTPUT\_URL is not explicitly specified.

@mahmoudrafat  
to see what actually happens while the backup is made  
inspect your `backup.log` file.  
For debug information in the log file  
you must run rear with debug logging enabled  
like `rear -d -D mkrescue` or `rear -d -D mkbackup`

Hi Again,  
Today i test the recover but it stuck at this point i don't know wheres
the problem is because small size of backup or something else, i
investigated the log file but didn't find anything wrong.  
does anyone face the same problem?

@mahmoudrafat  
at this point "rear recover" is about to recreate the disk storage
layout  
which happens before the backup of the files is restored  
so this new issue in your recent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2398\#issuecomment-638808558](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2398#issuecomment-638808558)  
has nothing to do with what is in the backup.

To get an initial basic understanding about  
your particular actual disk storage layout and  
what "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" finds out about it  
we need the output of

    lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

or if that is not possible on SLES12 the output of

    lsblk -io NAME,KNAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

or if that is also not possible at least the output of plain

    lsblk

and additionally we need your particular

    var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

file.

Because you use ReaR 2.3 which is meanwhile rather old  
(from our ReaR upstream developer's point of view) and  
because we at ReaR upstream do not support old ReaR releases  
I would seriously recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code from within a separated directory as a test  
to find out if things work better with our current ReaR upstream  
master code compared to your installed ReaR version,  
see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how to do that.  
To run `git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git` you need  
the RPM package `git-core` that provides `/usr/bin/git`.
