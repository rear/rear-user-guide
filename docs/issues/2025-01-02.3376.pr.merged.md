Thanks, is a local DISK (USB-Disk) also possible ?

Hi @ds2k5 can you please share more context? What would you expect from
ReaR beyond what a plain `dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb` would accomplish?

mount /dev/sdb /mnt  
dd if /dev/mmcblk0 /mnt/sdcard.img

@ds2k5 well, yes. So I'm wondering what you expect from ReaR to
accomplish for RPI. It seems for me that doing what you said (`mount`,
`dd`) is much simpler than configuring ReaR with `BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE`.

That is why it would help me to better understand your use case and what
you expect from ReaR that you couldn't accomplish otherwise easily.

sorry my english poor....

Rear should do the job of DD but with less space need for image.  
But it should be a solution that the Backup could be written simple to
new sdcard  
if the 1.st SDCard is dead for example.

If you want the new SD card to be directly usable then it will need to
be at least as large as your original SD card. If you want to create an
image of the main SD card that takes up less space *before* you put it
onto a new SD card, then the `BLOCKCLONE` mode implemented in this PR
will do the job - which is why we ask for your feedback before merging
it.

@rear/contributors If there are no objections then I would like to merge
the PR by tomorrow evening?
