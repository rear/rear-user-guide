Can this error be caused by NFS mount permissions ?

    mkdir: cannot create directory `/tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs/rear': Permission denied

If you are root and root has no permissions it reminds me of
**root\_squash** problems.

Root cannot create a subdir prior to create parent dir. See below:  
mkdir errors on creating directory with -p option.  
With -p option works.  
when running rear mkbackuponly it 'StopifError' on the attempt to create
whole directory.

The parent dir is your mountpoint so it should exist (since it didn't
bail out when mounting, see below).

The problem is a permission denied creating a subdirectory inside the
NFS mount, which I think is because of permissions issues. The reason
you can create the directory afterwards is because at that point it had
been unmounted (and removed). Please try mounting the NFS mount
yourself, and creating a directory inside the NFS mount to verify that
this is indeed the problem.

From the client side the script 'rear mkbackuponly' is trying to create
*/tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs* in order to use it as the mount
point to the indicated nfs server. Below is the permissions of */tmp*.

When I manually create the nfs mount:

    acpic-s711.rcmp-grc.gc.ca:/global/data/images/ReaR 103212320 91064640   7953376  92% /tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs

And then try to create the 'rear' subdir under it:

    rear:/tmp # mkdir rear /tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs
    mkdir: cannot create directory `/tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs': File exists
    rear:/tmp # mkdir -p rear /tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs

Only works with -p option

    drwxrwxrwt  42 root root  4096 Aug 20 12:38 tmp

Thanks for help, appreciated.

> Only works with -p option

The command `mkdir -p` doesn't do anything if the directory already
exists. Just do the test:

    [dag@moria unoconv]$ mkdir /usr/bin
    mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/bin': File exists
    [dag@moria unoconv]$ mkdir -p /usr/bin
    [dag@moria unoconv]$ 

Also remark the error **File exists** which is not as the original
report **Permission denied**.

So please try the same by doing
`mkdir /tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs/rear` and
`mkdir -p /tmp/rear.JmxRUMCdqcvOtqA/outputfs/rear` instead (mind the
appended */rear*).

@mcamero Thanks for the update. Having a resolution is important for
users and future troubleshooting.

@jetwes Can you verify this is not caused by the same problem reported
by @mcamero ? If your NFS share is exported as **root\_squash**, the
root user on the NFS client will not have the proper rights on the
mounted NFS share (as root). All access will be reduced to anonymous
access (nobody) on the NFS server (even when, or rather, *specifically
because* you are root). You can test this by mounting the NFS share and
then trying to create a directory and/or file inside the mounted share.

BTW We may have to make this more obvious from the documentation and/or
modify the error message specifically when NFS is used and a
**Permission denied** error is returned. Before closing this ticket I
will create a feature request for this. I first like to see if this is
the same cause for @jetwes !

What are the permissions of nfs share ?

That sounds like a good plan. Enabling all the permissions on the subdir
rear of the nfs share eg /global/data/rear, was what fixed it for me.

@jetwes Do you still have this issue ?

No. It has been resolved.

Sorry for the late answer. I didn't try it again, because it reinstalled
the system and didn't had the time to check it again. I will get to this
as soon as i tried again.

Thx

Yes, this happens when the remote filesystem is exported with
"root\_squash", so root on the local system is unable to create dirs
below the /tmp/rear.\[blah\]/outputfs mountpoint. The workarouind is to
create a world-writeable subdir manually and register its location in
local.conf. Alternately, create a "no\_root\_squash" filesystem/export
for ReaR's use. At the risk of overcomplicating matters, perhaps ReaR
could offer to spawn a shell so that the user can ssh to the remote and
create the directory, then retry the mount/mkdir without being bounced
out of ReaR?

Just wanted to note that ReaR is intended to run unattended, e.g. from
a  
cron job. So spawning shell is for most use cases not a good idea.

Usually people set up ReaR to work properly and let it run by itself
after  
the initial setup.

So i hear. However, root\_squash'd nfs exports and lack of distincitve
(ie: date-appaended) save targets/dirs do make unattended operation kind
of unwieldy. I'd imagine that many people pull mkbackups selectively by
hand as systems undergo known changes - i know i do.

@cal-s Even if one does occasional backups using Relax-and-Recover,
setting up NFS correctly in advance is not an unreasonable expectation.
We should report to the user that root\_squash is the cause (and add it
as a tip in the documentation), but that's as far as our responsibility
goes. If permissions are the problem a different error could indicate
this, but remember selinux could also be causing us problems... To me
this is a support issue, rather than a technical issue to solve and so
we should make it easier for users to understand the problem. That's why
I do not consider it a bug.

**TODO:** Escalate better to the user
