@AmosMes Could you please update the issue with details about your
system (platform, architecture, and content of /etc/rear/local.conf)?

Hi,  
The platform is Debian 12 and architecture is 64bit.

The local.conf content is:

OUTPUT=USB  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "os" )  
USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE="1000"  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE="noip unattended"  
USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT=15  
USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=1  
COPY\_AS\_IS+=( /root/scripts )

The destination disk is nvme

By the way it is a Debian 12 with Proxmox installed on it.

@AmosMes Thanks for the replies. So, you boot from an USB disk, right?
Does it boot up?

Try again to create a bootable USB disk without the `KERNEL_CMDLINE` in
the local.conf file. And, then boot from the USB disk. Does it boot up
properly? Are you have a root prompt? Can you inspect the rescue system
resources before running `rear recover`...

Hi @gdha ,  
I boot from a local NVME installed on the server. It is configured as
USB .

I followed your instructions and I do not get a prompt.

I do get the same error as before, I cannot add a screenshot, it fails
in this stage:

    Loading kernel /EFI/BOOT/kernel ...
    Loading initial ramdisk /EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz
    error: out of memory.

    Press any key to continue...

@AmosMes Ok, add `FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )` to the local.conf and rebuild
the USB boot disk and then try to boot from it again. The rescue OS will
be much smaller. See if this helps?

Hi @gdha,  
Thanks a lot ... it works.  
Should I expect any issues because of the FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'no' ) line
?

Another question please:  
My backup disk is 1 TB in size and I would like to divide it to 2
partitions 1 is for data and the other is for the ReaR backup.  
Can it be done ?

@AmosMes Great news. As long as the USB rescue recovers the same system
then no extra firmware is needed.

Sure, you can divide your disk with 2 partitions. Just make sure that
you format the 1st partition again according the REAR-000 procedure you
followed before.

Thank you,  
will try to divide.

FYI  
a side note regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3417\#issuecomment-2697294823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3417#issuecomment-2697294823)

    As long as the USB rescue recovers the same system
    then no extra firmware is needed.

The point here is the exact meaning of the word 'extra'.

When you need some firmware on your original system  
to make its hardware work, then you need the specific  
firmware files which are used on the original system  
also inside the ReaR recovery system to be able  
to run the ReaR recovery system on the same hardware  
as the original system.

In particular network hardware and many GPUs  
(also iGPUs which are built-in in the CPU/APU package)  
are known to need firmware to make the hardware work, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3194](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3194)

But you do not need extra firmware files (i.e. additional  
firmware files than what is used on the original system)  
inside the ReaR recovery system to run it on the same  
hardware as the original system.

In contrast when you intend to run the ReaR recovery system  
on different hardware than the original system (e.g. to  
recreate your system on different replacement hardware)  
then you do a "migration" (onto different hardware)  
because your replacement hardware is not fully compatible,  
cf. "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

So to be able to do such a "migration" you should include  
all firmware into the ReaR recovery system that could  
be needed on different replacement hardware.  
See the FIRMWARE\_FILES config variable description  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf how to do that  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1820](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1820)

Because the ReaR recovery system runs in main memory  
(using a ramdisk) you need sufficient main memory  
to run even a bigger ReaR recovery system  
which contains lots of firmware files.

@gdha ,  
A question about 2 partitions.  
I used gdisk and divided the /dev/nvme0n1 to 2 partitions...
/dev/nvme0n1p1 and /dev/nvme0n1p2.  
When I run the command "rear -v format -- --efi /dev/nvme0n1p1" the
command is repartitioning the /dev/nvme0n1 and 1 partition is 1GB and
the other has the entire disk.

What am I missing in order to divide the disk as I want and have control
on the partitions?

@AmosMes you may hit a small bug in the rear format code of USB disks
with an already partitioned disk. As a work-around you have to partition
the USB disk and format the 1st partition manually with ext3, ext4 file
system. You can label it with REAR-000 afterwards with e2label. As such
you have the result you want.

Thanks,  
and what about the bootable partition?  
The rear format creates the bootable partition.

Indeed that will not work - suppose you better use a USB stick to boot
from and use the internal disk as archive target as a work-around.

The problem is that I don't have that as an option.  
Is there anything else to do as a workaround ?

@AmosMes  
regarding your question in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3417\#issuecomment-2696841554](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3417#issuecomment-2696841554)

    My backup disk is 1 TB in size and I would like to divide it
    to 2 partitions 1 is for data and the other is for the ReaR backup.
    Can it be done ?

See in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
the section about "OUTPUT=USB"  
therein the various USB\_... config variables in particular  
USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_PERCENTAGE  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1158](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.9/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1158)

By the way:  
Why do you specify `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="1000"` in your local.conf  
when the default is `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="1024"`?  
I.e. what do you intend to gain with a 24 MiB smaller  
size of the EFI system partition (ESP)?  
I wonder if you ever read usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf?

Only FYI in general:

In theory it could be possible to prepare an already used disk  
so that it is usable for ReaR but I think in practice this  
needs unreasonable trial-and-error efforts compared to using  
"rear format" from scratch with a pristine empty disk.

I recommend to use "rear mkbackup" only with a dedicated  
disk for ReaR. This is what basically all others do so this  
is proven to work reasonably well "out there in the wild".  
If you use a disk where also valuable other data is stored  
(e.g. a disk where already a previous backup is stored)  
something might go terribly wrong when writing a subsequent  
backup there (e.g. via "rear mkbackup") so in the end  
all might be lost on that disk.  
To be reasonably on the safe side I recommend to dedicate  
at least two disks only to ReaR and use them alternating  
so if one gets damaged during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
you still have the other one with the latest backup.

Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3398\#issuecomment-2647990654](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3398#issuecomment-2647990654)

A quick "googling" for "1TB USB disk" shows  
that ony can get one for about 50 Euros  
(up to about 100 Euros for some "better" ones)  
and a 500GiB USB disk for about 25 Euros.  
So I wonder if it is really worth the additional risk  
to use one same big USB disk for ReaR and other data  
than to Keep Separated Issues Separated "KSIS"  
(derived from the KISS principle)  
and spend money for a separated USB disk for ReaR  
(preferably two USB disks for alternating usage).

This is only my personal opinion how I recommend to do it.  
Of course you should do what fits best your specific needs.

Hi @jsmeix,  
Your point about the USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE="1000" is valid and I will
change that so thank you for that.

Do you think you'll be fixing the rear format bug ?

Not easily done as it was designed to work on one external USB disk.
Internal disks were not directly in scope and that would make everything
more complex.  
However, you could use a RAMDISK:

    OUTPUT=RAMDISK

    # We want our kernel and initramfs saved under /boot/ReaR and have an extention with "-ReaR"
    OUTPUT_PREFIX="ReaR"
    RAMDISK_SUFFIX="ReaR"

    # The RAMDISK will be created under /boot/$(hostname -s)/
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///boot

    # Use the same IP address(es) of the this system to be activated in the rescue OS
    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="y"

    # To be able to login via ssh
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="relax"

    # We do not want a ReaR archive, therefore, use the EXTERNAL setting for BACKUP:
    BACKUP=file:///your-internal-disk-mount-point

    # To save space limit what we need (no firmware and only the loaded kernel modules)
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( /your-internal-disk-mount-point )
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /your-internal-disk-mount-point )
    WRITE_PROTECTED_FS_LABEL_PATTERNS=( "REAR-DATA" )  # label your internal disk
