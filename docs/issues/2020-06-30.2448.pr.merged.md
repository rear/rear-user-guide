@rear/contributors

With three approvements I feel sufficiently encouraged  
to change my above well elaborated time schedule  
and "just merge" it right now :-)

I added an explanatory comment in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
that using the ...IfError functions can result unexpected behaviour in
certain cases.

Additional testing has shown that there was some more room for
improvements: c58dfb9f7f267917a4b0309a958c614316137840

A comment in the added code explains the underlying issue.

@OliverO2  
please tell me when you are finished so that I could merge it.  
(This is only FYI - no rush, take your time.)
