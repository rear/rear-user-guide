-   rear version: Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
-   OS version: OS\_VENDOR=Fedora  
    OS\_VERSION=23
-   rear configuration files: OUTPUT=USB  
    USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
    BACKUP=NETFS  
    BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
-   Brief description of the issue  
    The rear recover failed to restore the lone user of the system. Root
    account was restored.  
    The same rear configuration used to work on Fedora 23 LVM with rear
    1.17. I re-installed  
    Fedora23 recently and placed / and /home on Btrfs. The rear recover
    did restore the system.  
    I have the login screen with my lone user but could not login with
    the password. I am able to login  
    ROOT account and find the lone user. I reset the password of it and
    the same problem persisted.  
    The home directory was totally empty, which is also empty in the
    backup file. I spotted no error in  
    the backup log but found the errors in recover log:  
    2016-06-09 18:48:21 Including
    restore/default/90\_create\_missing\_directories.sh  
    2016-06-09 18:48:21 Restore the Mountpoints (with permissions) from
    /var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_permissions  
    chown: invalid user: 'ryan:ryan'  
    chown: invalid user: 'gdm:gdm'
-   Work-around, I do not have any

"/home on Btrfs" means that for usual tools "/home" behaves  
as if it was on a separated filesystem because btrfs subvolumes  
behave as if there were separated filesystems.

Accordingly you must explicitly specify to backup the content  
in "/home".

Cf. the btrfs example configs for SLE in  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf

I assume with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/873\#issuecomment-225536867](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/873#issuecomment-225536867)  
the issue is sufficiently solved.  
If not you can reopen it.
