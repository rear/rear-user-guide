##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested? RHEL 9 on s390x z/VM

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

For some reason, the `550_rebuild_initramfs.sh` script was not included
for s390x on Fedora/RHEL so the initrd was not regenerated after backup
restore on this architecture.

Since all other architectures were actually using the same script, let's
just move it one level up to fix this bug and to also simplify the
directory structure a bit.

The symlinks ( ppc, ppc64le ) to the script have been introduced in
\#1311 and s390 was then forgotten, because support for that arch got
introduced later. I have read
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311\#issuecomment-295266258](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311#issuecomment-295266258)
and I don't think that the issue described there prevents moving the
file up and removing the symlinks, and it is IMO the right thing to do,
because there is nothing architecture-dependent in initrd regeneration.
It will prevent this from being forgotten again when a new architecture
support is added (think ARM).

Regarding my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311\#issuecomment-295266258](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311#issuecomment-295266258)  
What I had meant was that we cannot have specific scripts  
that replace "default" scripts because all scripts will be run.

I think the crucial point is whether or not  
there is nothing architecture-dependent in initrd regeneration.

The problem is when there are already architecture-dependent  
sub-directories it indicates that there is something  
architecture-dependent in initrd regeneration  
or that likely ther can be something  
architecture-dependent in initrd regeneration  
so a contributor for some specific architecture  
will follow what is already there.  
As far as I understand  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311/files)  
it means that a architecture-dependent sub-directory  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/  
had been already there.

By the way:  
We may clean up all of those symlinks  
for the three different cases:

    # find usr/share/rear -ls | grep 550_rebuild_initramfs

    ... -rw-r--r-- ... 5397 ...usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh
    ... lrwxrwxrwx ...   32 ... usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/ppc64le/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh
    ... lrwxrwxrwx ...   32 ... usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/ppc64/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh

    ... -rw-r--r-- ... 5660 ... usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh
    ... lrwxrwxrwx ...   32 ... usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/ppc64le/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh

    ... -rw-r--r-- ... 4454 ... usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh

Yes, it had been already there, so I don't blame the authors of \#1311
for following the example. It has been since the beginning when it was
introduced (as
`usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh`) and I
believe that even then it was not necessary, because it did not contain
anything architecture-specific.

Further unifying the actual scripts

    finalize/Fedora/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh
    finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh
    finalize/Debian/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh

into one or two (as far as possible with reasonable effort)  
should be a separated cleanup task (as time permits).

In general I am against the Linux distribution specific  
sub-directories which we currently have in ReaR  
because usually same kind of things are  
rather same on different Linux distributions  
so in general I prefer one generic script  
that has Linux distribution specific differences  
only where needed.

In contrast when different kind of things are used  
(e.g. legacy GRUB versus GRUB2 or BIOS versus UEFI)  
then usually separated different scripts should be used.

@pcahyna  
I assigned this pull request to you  
because in its current form it belongs only  
to things in .../finalize/Fedora/...  
so you could merge it as you like.

Hi @jsmeix , thanks for looking. We can check the differences between
Fedora and SUSE scripts and determine if they are needed or not (some
tests on both sides will be required).
