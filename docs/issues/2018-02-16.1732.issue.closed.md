Hi @gdha, @jsmeix

Is there any particular reason why we are missing ReaR RPM for SLES12
SP3 ?

I enabled the missing SLES12 SP3 on OBS - it should have been builded by
now. I still need to update our Download page

I can now see SLES12 SP3 packages under:
[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE\_12\_SP3/x86\_64/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/SLE_12_SP3/x86_64/)

@gozora  
in general regarding a 'rear' RPM for a specific Linux distribution
version:  
Because ReaR is only bash scripts it should not matter in practice  
which 'rear' RPM you download and use because ReaR is meant  
to also work when you "git clone" the plain GitHub sources,  
cf. "it should not matter for which SUSE product you use ReaR" in
