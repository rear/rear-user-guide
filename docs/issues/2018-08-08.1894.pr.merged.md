-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Enhanced 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh so that now it dynamically finds
out  
what block device matches the RELAXRECOVER labeled ISO and  
create a symlink /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER that points  
to that block device unless such a symlink already exists.

Fixed the bug that a hardcoded 'RELAXRECOVER' value was used  
instead of using the value of the ISO\_VOLID config variable.

Provided user information messages when things do not look o.k.  
so that the user is at least made aware when the ISO content  
is not accessible during 'rear recover'.

@schabrolles  
thanks for your kind review!

With my last commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1894/commits/0c47fab08bff67994d1ff9335122fe71cf118745](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1894/commits/0c47fab08bff67994d1ff9335122fe71cf118745)  
I moved the basic code of the recovery system setup script
67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh  
into the mount\_url function 'iso' case plus additional enhancements
there with a user dialog  
if things are not o.k. and removed the no longer needed
67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1893\#issuecomment-411692041](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1893#issuecomment-411692041)

I tested it and so far things behave now much better for me than ever
before.

I use this etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
OUTPUT_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
BACKUP_URL=iso:///mybackup
SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="3"
KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
</pre>

I need `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` because without it  
I get on my SLES12 x86\_64 KVM system

where `mount: unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'`  
is exactly my example for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)  
see also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891\#issuecomment-410757405](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891#issuecomment-410757405)

When all is o.k. there is no visible difference (the difference behind
the scenes is  
that now the mount\_url function 'iso' case checks whether or not things
look o.k.).

Things just repair automatically when the
/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER  
does not point to a block device with filesystem label RELAXRECOVER  
if such a block device exists. I tested that by manually

<pre>
# ln -vsf /dev/doesnotexist /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
</pre>

before running 'rear recover'.

To test how things behave when there is no block device  
that uses the filesystem label RELAXRECOVER  
I disconnected the virtual CDROM drive from my SLES12 KVM system  
which leads in 'rear recover' to

<pre>
A symlink '/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER' is required that points to the device with the ReaR ISO image
UserInput -I RELAXRECOVER_SYMLINK_TARGET needed in /usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh line 436
Create symlink '/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER' that points to the ReaR ISO image device
1) /dev/cdrom is where the ISO is attached to
2) /dev/sr0 is where the ISO is attached to
3) /dev/sr1 is where the ISO is attached to
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
5) Continue 'rear recover'
6) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
</pre>

I went to the Relax-and-Recover shell to get any time I need,  
re-connected the virtual CDROM drive to my SLES12 KVM system  
and in the Relax-and-Recover shell I did (excerpts):

<pre>
rear> blkid
...
/dev/sr1: UUID="2018-08-09-13-23-35-00" LABEL="RELAXRECOVER" TYPE="iso9660"

rear> ln -vsf /dev/sr1 /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
'/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER' -> '/dev/sr1'

rear> ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Aug  9 13:33 /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER -> /dev/sr1

rear> exit
Are you sure you want to exit the Relax-and-Recover shell ? y
exit

</pre>

It should have also worked to re-connected the virtual CDROM drive  
while the 300 seconds timeout waiting and then select  
`3) /dev/sr1 is where the ISO is attached to`  
provided one knows that the re-connected virtual CDROM drive  
will re-appear as /dev/sr1 in the KVM system.  
In general I prefer the Relax-and-Recover shell to fix things  
because there I have any time I need and I can do all I like.

I slept over my last changes, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1893\#issuecomment-411771035](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1893#issuecomment-411771035)  
and nothing appeared over night so that I would like  
to merge it soon today unless there are objections.
