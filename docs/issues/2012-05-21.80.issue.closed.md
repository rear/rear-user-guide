This is related to previous sourcforge Fix ID 3483371. Adding the
StopIfFail function to the  
/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh. This function is used
in the last line of the  
/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh script.
The function will issue a  
failure if the exit code is higher than one. This is used because an
Exit code of 1 on a bprestore does  
not mean the whole restore is a failure. A temporary file not being
restored will cause this exit code to happen.

Added code at Line 126 of the
/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh. script:

StopIfFail() {  
\# If return code is greater than 1, bail out  
if (( $? &gt; 1 )); then  
Error "$@"  
fi  
}

We decided not to implement StopIfFail because it is very specific
(return code &gt; 1) so we prefer to implement an exception rather than
standardize it.
