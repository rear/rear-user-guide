Hi,

I have successfully backed up RHEL 5 OS vg over the network, when i boot
from boot iso i am unable to restore. I got a error saying "mount
command failed"

So i tried to mount the nfs manuually but that also didnot work, i got
the following error in /var/log/messages.

RPC: failed to contact portmap (errno -5)  
locked\_up: makesock failed, error=-5  
portmap: server localhost not responding, timed out

When i give netstat -ano

i could not find portmap running on the booted image.

@raju4244 did you need to start `portmap` manually to get the restore
going?
