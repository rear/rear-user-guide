[\#724 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/724) `closed`: Save and restore bash flags and options settings
============================================================================================================

Implemented simple functions GetBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands  
and ApplyBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands that are used  
in a fail-safe way via an explicit variable that stores the  
current bash flags and options commands and using  
that explicit variable to re-apply them, i.e. like

<pre>
      saved_flags_options_cmds="$( GetBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands )"
      ... [change bash flags and options]
      ... [do something]
      ApplyBashFlagsAndOptionsCommands "$saved_flags_options_cmds"
</pre>

Oops!

This pull request has documentation stuff from my other pull request
mixed in.

I will close this broken pull request.

Cool. Can you please use
`small_letters_and_words_separated_by_underscore` function naming?

More consistent with the remaining ReaR code.

Oops2!

I used function names as in \_input-output-functions.sh  
but
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
makes it clear:

<pre>
Function names are lower case, words separated by underline (_)
</pre>

Now I wonder if - and if yes - how to distinguish function names  
from variable names?

Globally used variables are uppercase (with words separated by underline
'\_') like SHARE\_DIR DISKLAYOUT\_FILE RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT

Locally used varaiables should be lowercase and marked with "local"
(also words separated by underline '\_') like "local backup\_path" or
"local syslinux\_modules\_dir".

I think distinguishing functions from variables is obvious from the
context how they are used so that both can have same syntax.

I wonder if we should distinguish globally used functions from locally
used functions by their naming syntax?

E.g. leading capitals for words in globally used functions like

<pre>
function Globally_Used_Function () {
    ...
}
</pre>

in contrast to

<pre>
function locally_used_function () {
    ...
}
.
.
.
locally_used_function ...
.
.
.
unset -f locally_used_function
</pre>

Do we actually have a problem here? I would like to keep the rules to
the absolue minimum...

I do not have a problem. I was only wondering and therefore I asked.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/726](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/726)
I use the function names get\_bash\_flags\_and\_options\_commands and
apply\_bash\_flags\_and\_options\_commands
