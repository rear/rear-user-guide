[\#3283 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3283) `open`: Improve output on missing libraries for systemd core lib
=========================================================================================================================

on `master` we now have

    Testing that the recovery system in /var/tmp/rear.AHBCO3wxs3FdARC/rootfs contains a usable system
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.so requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found'
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-core-255.so requires libsystemd-shared-255.so which was not found by 'ldd' but exists as /var/tmp/rear.AHBCO3wxs3FdARC/rootfs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/systemd/libsystemd-shared-255.so

thanks to \#3250 and I'd like to suggest a small improvement on it:

1.  strip the ReaR build including `.../rootfs` from the found library
2.  show these lines only in the log and not on the console, because
    this info is not actionable and we decided to assume that all is
    well if the missing lib is found somewhere.
