From my experience with "rear recover" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165\#issuecomment-272449196](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165#issuecomment-272449196)

I use

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
</pre>

I did several (5) times "rear mkbackup" and got  
(with the default USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=2)  
on the REAR-000 medium three backup directories

During boot I selected in the syslinux boot menue  
2017-01-13 14:29 backup

Then I run "rear -d -D recover" which results (excerpts):

In short:  
I got the backup restored that matches what  
I selected during boot in the syslinux menu  
and not the backup that I selected during "rear recover".

I wonder why there is that backup selection  
during "rear recover" when the right backup is  
already specified during boot in the syslinux menu?

If there is a reason for the backup selection  
during "rear recover" it seems it does not work.

@gdha  
do you know the reason for the backup selection  
during "rear recover" in case of backup on USB?

FYI:  
I did not change the backup selection during "rear recover" in  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
in my recent
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165)

I think I know why the backup selection during "rear recover" in  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
does no longer work:

"usr/sbin/rear -s recover" shows (excerpt)

<pre>
Source verify/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh
...
Source verify/USB/NETFS/default/540_choose_backup_archive.sh
</pre>

The right backup is set as RESTORE\_ARCHIVES in  
verify/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
but later  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
does not adapt RESTORE\_ARCHIVES so that it has no effect.

This means the issue is a regression since my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1071)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1069)

I need to implement RESTORE\_ARCHIVES in  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
provided there is a real reason for another backup selection  
during "rear recover" regardless that the right backup  
should have already specified during boot in the syslinux menu.

Furthermore that backup selection during "rear recover"  
makes it impossible to run "rear recover" unattended  
in case of backup from USB.

If at all that backup selection during "rear recover" should  
only hapen if RESTORE\_ARCHIVES is empty or  
its content cannot be found on the REAR-000 medium.

Hello @jsmeix ,  
I've used something like
[this](https://github.com/gozora/rear/blob/c6c046363615752c6bd132f33c877d02749dffe4/usr/share/rear/verify/USB/BLOCKCLONE/default/541_apply_user_choice.sh)
but it is more an workaround....

Yes, that is the basic idea but if I implement  
RESTORE\_ARCHIVES support in  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
I would implement support to select multiple archives  
because restore of multiple archives just works now  
with RESTORE\_ARCHIVES.

The code in  
verify/USB/NETFS/default/540\_choose\_backup\_archive.sh  
looks wrong because it sets "backuparchive"  
and not "restorearchive" what it was in the old code  
and what I have completely replaced by RESTORE\_ARCHIVES.

But that whole old code about "backuparchive" looks so ugly  
because in  
restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
there is

<pre>
# The RESTORE_ARCHIVES array contains the restore input files.
# If it is not set, RESTORE_ARCHIVES is only one element which is the backup archive:
test "$RESTORE_ARCHIVES" || RESTORE_ARCHIVES=( "$backuparchive" )
</pre>

What a mess of badly named and badly used variables!

I guess I need to rework the whole old code about "backuparchive"  
and replace it with something that at least I can understand  
to avoid more such regressions in the future :-(

In contrast to what I wrote last week above in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166\#issuecomment-272469071](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166#issuecomment-272469071)  
I think now that the "backuparchive" usage and implementation  
is actually o.k.- only the variable name should be uppercase, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165\#issuecomment-272814988](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1165#issuecomment-272814988)

I think meanwhile I understand why that backup selection  
dialog during "rear recover" is there:

It is not needed when one uses "rear mkbackup"  
where kernel, initrd, and backup are in one same directory  
but it is needed when one runs separated  
"rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackuponly"  
because then by default on USB kernel and initrd  
are in one timestamp directory and the backup  
is in another timestamp directory.

Because by default on USB there are more than one  
backup (via USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR) there should  
be a dialog during "rear recover" where the user can  
select what backup he likes to restore.

But I think that backup selection dialog should behave  
more user friendly and preselect the latest backup  
that can be found on the USB medium so that the user  
could just hit \[Enter\] to get the latest backup restored.

When only one backup is found on the USB medium  
there should not be such a dialog - just that one backup  
gets restored - because what else could the user do?

For me it does not work with separated  
"rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackuponly":

I did two times  
"rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackuponly"  
so that I have now on my REAR-000 medium

The syslinux.cfg files contain those menu labels:

<pre>

</pre>

For recovery I booted the syslinux menu label  
"2017-01-16 12:19 rescue image"

Then in the ReaR recovery system it fails as follows:

Initial bug is in 070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh that blindly sets

<pre>
++ backuparchive=/tmp/rear.B5LcS9D1ZfCXfJs/outputfs/rear/e205/20170116.1219/backup.tar.gz
++ RESTORE_ARCHIVES=("$backuparchive")
</pre>

regardless that there is no such file  
(the "1219" directory is from a "mkrescue")  
which then leads to 550\_check\_backup\_archive.sh  
not setting RESTORE\_ARCHIVES to the right backuparchive  
that is specified during 540\_choose\_backup\_archive  
via

<pre>
test "$RESTORE_ARCHIVES" || RESTORE_ARCHIVES=( "$backuparchive" )
</pre>

because RESTORE\_ARCHIVES is already set.

Accordingly this small change in 070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
makes "rear recover" works for me in this case:

@gdha  
many thanks for the information that this code was made  
as a special case (hack) for a special customer.

I will make it working reasonably well also for other users  
because that functionality is now there in ReaR  
so that it should work reasonably well in general.

Only a side note (I won't fix that):

It seems the default USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=2  
does not strictly work this way.

Continuing from the state what I had  
on my REAR-000 medium as shown in

I did one more "rear mkrescue" (timestamp "...1447")  
then a "rear mkbackup" (timestamp "...1057") and  
a "rear mkbackuponly" (timestamp "...1106") and  
now I have those files on my REAR-000 medium
