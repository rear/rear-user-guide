-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19-git
-   Brief description of the issue:
    `RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL="http://my_internal_server/$HOSTNAME.rear_config.tgz"`
-   Work-around, if any: add
    `REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" curl )` to `local.conf`

I think it would be beneficial if there was a prep script which does
this for you (automate as much as possible)

Yes, I forgot to put that on my todo list.  
The standard REQUIRED\_PROGS (i.e. currently 'curl')  
for RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL should be automated.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1229\#issuecomment-286772308](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1229#issuecomment-286772308)  
that reads (excerpt)

...
BTW, I would also not mind if ReaR would
take along curl and its SSL libraries if curl is present.
I think that curl is such a useful tool that we should
consider that (although wget is not included by default).
</pre>

I think I will simply add 'curl' to the default PROGS array  
because I also think that in the ReaR recovery system  
there should be by default a program so that the user  
can download things from remote whenever needed.

You'll probably also would want to take along the https support libs.

Thanks a lot, Schlomo

Then, The code on **usr/share/rear/init/default/010\_set\_drlm\_env.sh**

<pre>
PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" curl )

# Needed for curl (HTTPs)
COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /etc/ssl/certs/* /etc/pki/* )

LIBS=(
    "${LIBS[@]}"
    /lib*/libnsspem.so*
    /usr/lib*/libnsspem.so*
    /lib*/libfreebl*.so*
    /usr/lib*/libfreebl*.so*
    /lib*/libnss3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libnss3.so*

</pre>

Should be moved to a default place.

The code I've posted here is tested on SLES, Debian and RHEL (nss) with
HTTP & HTTPS.

@didacog Why were the libraries not picked up automatically? I'm pretty
sure **curl** does not need `/lib*/libsqlite3.so*`

@gdha in RHEL/CentOS curl is compiled with NSS support and the certs for
NSS are stored in sqlite DB in /etc/pki/nss/.... I've tested hard until
with all those libraries worked.

FYI:  
In a ReaR recovery system made on SLES12 SP2 system  
with plain 'curl' added to PROGS but without any specially  
included additional libs, i.e. made with the changes in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1248](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1248)  
I get

<pre>
# for l in libnsspem libfreebl libnss3 libnssutil3 libsoftokn3 libsqlite3 libfreeblpriv3 libssl libnssdbm3 ; do find / | grep $l ; done

/lib64/libssl.so.1.0.0
</pre>

In SLES and debian/ubuntu less libs are needed, but for RHEL/CentOS some
are required by NSS and I've added more for SSL and also
`COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /etc/ssl/certs/* /etc/pki/* )`

I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1248](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1248)  
as a hopefully first step in the right direction  
which works for me with plain 'curl' with plain HTTP.

I know nothing at all about whatever special  
https support libs for curl so that I cannot help  
in any way to get that properly implemented.

If possible I would like @didacog to implement  
special https support libs for curl properly via  
a separated pull request.

Without SSL also are required for RHEL/CentOS (nss):

<pre>
LIBS=(
    "${LIBS[@]}"

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1248](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1248)
merged  
I close this particular issue as "fixed/solved/done".  
Further adaptions and enhancements for advanced  
'curl' functionality like HTTPS support need to be done  
via separated issues and separated pull requests.

@gdha @jsmeix

to set default LIBS, ... for curl (SSL) the correct location is
**usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf**?

In that case i will send a PR with:

<pre>
# Needed for curl (HTTPs)
COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /etc/ssl/certs/* /etc/pki/* )

LIBS=(
    "${LIBS[@]}"
    /lib*/libnsspem.so*
    /usr/lib*/libnsspem.so*
    /lib*/libfreebl*.so*
    /usr/lib*/libfreebl*.so*
    /lib*/libnss3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libnss3.so*
    /lib*/libnssutil3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libnssutil3.so*
    /lib*/libsoftokn3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libsoftokn3.so*
    /lib*/libsqlite3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libsqlite3.so*
    /lib*/libfreeblpriv3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libfreeblpriv3.so*
    /lib*/libssl.so*
    /usr/lib*/libssl.so*
    /lib*/libnssdbm3.so*
    /usr/lib*/libnssdbm3.so*
)
</pre>

in `usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf`

and I will remove them from
`usr/share/rear/init/default/010_set_drlm_env.sh`
