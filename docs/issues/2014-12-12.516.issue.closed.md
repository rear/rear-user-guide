For ex, in case disaster strikes, the original location that stores the
backup is is not available anymore, how to tell rear to recover from a
non original source use for backup (suppose that all the backup files
are replicated/copied over).  
In my case I used NFS to backup, but since I have issue with NFS4
support by rear, how can tell rear to use the new place and not the
original one after transfering the backup files to a different place?

This is definitively very useful and flexible if rear can do it.

In the `/etc/rear/local.conf` or `/etc/rear/site.conf` file you can just
change the location of BACKUP\_URL in whatever you want.  
Also, if you are using NFSv4 you better also include
`BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"`

@bobbysch was your question answered, or do you need more info?
