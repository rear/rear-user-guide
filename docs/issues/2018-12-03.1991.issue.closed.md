Rear v 2.3,  
Ubuntu 18.04.1 x86\_64,  
DELL T330 SAS Raid5 - RD1000,  
BIOS, GRUB2

site.conf:

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB 
USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt
BOOTLOADER=GRUB2
USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=0
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_PROG=rsync
BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/proc/*' '/sys/*' '/media/*' '/tmp/*' '/u/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' '/var/lib/rear/output/*' '/var/log/rear/email/*' '/etc/rear/passwords' '/mnt/*' )
USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=10
BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" "--ignore-errors" )
</pre>

When a change is made that causes "rear -v savelayout" to do something,
then the next time you run "rear -d mkbackup", somewhere along the
process of creating the boot image, the file "$RUNTIME\_LOGFILE" is
either renamed or deleted causing line 18 in
output/USB/Linux-i386/830\_copy\_kernel\_initrd.sh to fail:

<pre>
cat "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" >"$BUILD_DIR/outputfs/$USB_PREFIX/$logfile_basename"
</pre>

The boot image is OK, but the missing file causes rear to error out and
the backup isn't performed.

Running the same commands again, right afterward, works as expected.

@lrirwin  
where are the `rear -D savelayout` and `rear -D mkbackup` debug log
files?

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

Figured it out. It was the automatic running of "/usr/sbin/rear udev"  
based on udev rules.  
When I swapped out an RD1000 and immediately ran my backup script, the  
timing of the renaming of log files was causing the issue.  
Commenting out the content in /lib/udev/rules.d/60-rear.rules was the  
solution.  
Thanks for all you do!

@lrirwin  
thank you for your feedback what the root cause was.  
Such explicit feedback is much appreciated.

Regarding the ReaR 'udev' workflow see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)

I think `etc/udev/rules.d/62-rear-usb.rules` is not installed, cf.  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/Makefile)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838\#issuecomment-219724335](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/838#issuecomment-219724335)

I wonder why you still have an automatic running  
of `/usr/sbin/rear udev` based on udev rules?

It was because I installed it from the Ubuntu 18 repository using
apt-get.  
The dpkg configure portion must have done it. apt list --installed
shows:  
rear/bionic,now 2.3+dfsg-1 amd64 \[installed\]  
And in /var/lib/dpkg/info/rear:amd64.list it contains:  
/lib/udev/rules.d/60-rear.rules
