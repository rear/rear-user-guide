Welcome to ReaR!

Just to satisfy my curiosity: Can you share your motivation for creating
your own backup tooling? ReaR already supports a lot of open source
backup tools, e.g. Duplicity, RBME, Borg, Baroes and of course it can
simply create an archive on a file share or on the USB media or even on
a DVD. What feature is missing from those?

What you want to achieve is actually very simple, please take a look at
\#3138 for an example of how I'm adding a new backup method (this one
only restores data because PPDM is a commercial backup tool that does
the backup on its own).

In general, you'll be adding some files under the following directories
under `usr/share/rear/`:

-   `prep` - prepare stuff for the backup or creating the rescue image
-   `backup` - to actually create a backup if you want to run that from
    within ReaR
-   `verify` - preparatins for the restore (runs in rescue system), e.g.
    start services or figure out what to restore
-   `restore` - actually restore the backup

The way ReaR is built allows you to simply drop files into the
appropriate folders, e.g. you could create your own `my-rear` package
that would depend on `rear` and add some more files with your stuff.

Hello,

I just experienced an SSD crash wiping the whole system drive unreadable
and to prepare for similar event in the future, I am determined to
implement an disaster recovery solution. ReaR topped the search results
and I am having the very same question than the OP.

The issue with traditional backup systems is that a disk has awful lot
of files that do not need to be backed up at all:

-   All application files and libraries: I would rather just save the
    list of packages (Ubuntu) installed and "recover" those by
    reinstalling those after the 1st stage system recovery.
-   The order of recovery should be such that the applications are
    installed first and only then settings (`/etc`) and `/home` would be
    recovered from a file backup. And even here I would like to be
    selective what backup (e.g. just container recipes, not containers
    itself)
-   I am a `btrfs` user and I probably would like to customize a bit how
    recovery is done i.e. what directory is a `btrfs` subvolume. But
    this is not that important since it can do these manually later.
