hi,

it seems as the default excludes we read from sesam configuration file:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh\#L25](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh#L25)

are disfunctional because the pathes from the configuration file contain
an trailing /.  
As such, tar wont match the pathes from the exclude file and they end up
in the generated  
ISO image.

A simple fix would be to remove the pathes via something like:

     FOO="/var/opt/sesam/var/log/lgc/"
     echo ${FOO%%+(/)}

Better alternative would probably be to add \* add the end of pathes
(lgc/\*) so directory  
itself is considered but no contents.

are there any rules for "bashisms" like these in the code or is there
already a function  
that could be used? I would prepare an PR to fix this issue,
accordingly. Thanks.

Proposed fix in my branch:

1.  read only the toplevel directory from the configuration file, in
    case someone has changed the installation paths for the application
    these are the only values that change
2.  default the rest of the directories to their location beneath the
    installation path, end with \* so only contents are excluded not the
    directories itself. Not sure if duplicate / in path causes issues
    during exclude, so i opted to to remove if existant and append
    during variable definition.

Via

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'trailing slash'

I found only one code place that mentiones 'trailing slash'  
which is in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh

    # accounting for possible trailing slashes in TARGET_FS_ROOT
    esp_mountpoint_inside="${esp_mountpoint#${TARGET_FS_ROOT%%*(/)}}"

which also works  
but `%%*(/)` looks less clear than `%%+(/)`  
because `%%*(/)` removes zero or more occurrences of trailing `/`  
while `%%*(/)` removes one or more occurrences of trailing `/`  
but why should zero trailing `/` be removed at all?

@abbbi  
I am wondering if code like

    SESAM_WORK_DIR="${SESAM_VAR_DIR%%+(/)}/var/work/*"

is really needed because - as far as I know - directory paths  
with duplicated slashes like

    //path///to/some/dir////

do not matter in Linux so `${SESAM_VAR_DIR%%+(/)}`  
could be unneeded and the simpler

    SESAM_WORK_DIR="$SESAM_VAR_DIR/var/work/*"

could also work, for example like

    # SESAM_VAR_DIR=//var///lib//rear///

    # SESAM_WORK_DIR="$SESAM_VAR_DIR/layout/config/*"

    # echo $SESAM_WORK_DIR
    //var///lib//rear////layout/config/df.txt //var///lib//rear////layout/config/files.md5sum

    ls $SESAM_WORK_DIR
    //var///lib//rear////layout/config/df.txt  //var///lib//rear////layout/config/files.md5sum

    # ls /var/lib/rear/layout/config
    df.txt  files.md5sum

?

i think the problem is, that tar is pretty picky about this in its
exclude list, as you can see it wont  
consider the second path with duplicate slashes in its exclude list:

    ~ $ tar -cz - --exclude=/tmp/testme/folder1/* /tmp/testme/| tar -ztvf -
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    -rw-r--r-- root/root   1048576 2023-03-20 16:18 -

@abbbi  
ah! - yes - I forgot that 'tar' is "in between" here.

@abbbi  
thank you for your issue report and for your fix!

Contributions for third-party backup tool support in ReaR  
are much appreciated because we at ReaR upstream  
usually do not have those third-party backup tools  
so we totally depend on contributions from people  
who use and know about third-party backup tools.

@jsmeix

hi,

i think we have to re-open as our internal CI has proven that now, where
the exludes work and are in place  
there is an issue with the sesam backup client service during ISO boot.
Usually the service starts automatically  
but now fails to start as the SESAM\_WORK\_DIR is excluded and its
unable to figure out its semaphore state.

    2023-06-29 14:19:18: Arguments: sm_main start
    2023-06-29 14:19:18: Daemons: ['qm', 'db', 'rmi', 'passd', 'sms', 'stpd', 'ctrl', 'sshd', 'sepuler', 'ui', 'sds']
    2023-06-29 14:19:18: Set file permissions...
    2023-06-29 14:19:18: qm                 : offline
    STATUS=ERROR MSG=semaphore is occupied by another process

This issue will only hit recent Sesam client versions, in older versions
the service was started in another  
way. Fix is probably to remove the SESAM\_WORK\_DIR from the exclude
list altogether.

I have fixed this in our labs and will wait until our next build and CI
cycle finishes so i can confirm and will create  
another Pull Request to fix the issue introduced.

@abbbi  
thank you for testing it!

I reopened this issue so we can continue here  
because its subject still matches.
