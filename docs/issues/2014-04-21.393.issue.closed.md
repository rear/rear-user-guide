@kiaina could you provide some more details on the hardware and drivers
requirements? Did you check the `rear.log` file whether all required
kernel drivers were copied as expected?  
Did you verify before kicking off `rear recover` is the hardware was
properly recognized?

@kiaina which kernel module is required by Dell Optiplex 9020? And, was
this module loaded in recover mode as well?

@kiaina use `lsmod` to list out the kernel modules loaded.
