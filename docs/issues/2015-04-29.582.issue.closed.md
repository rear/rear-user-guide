I would like to use Relax-and-Recover to restore onto a new Linux
server. The hardware configuration is different to the first server. I
don't have the new Linux server yet but would like to invest in one.
Before I do this, I would like to know if the bare-metal recovery is
independent of hardware.

You need to know the new HW a bit. Be aware migration from x32 to x64
might give issues, or even from x86 to ppc or arm = no go.  
Drivers that might be different need to be added manually to the array
MODULES.  
For the rest it should be possible, perhaps some tweaks are still
required after re-imaging.
