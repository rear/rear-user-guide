You can see it will not start on tty and it will be stuck on this for
ever.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    In the start add this line to the end  
    console=tty1 systemd.unit=<getty@tty1.service>

Add the following to your local.conf file and it will will work on tty1
every time without having to do the work

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="no"
    KERNEL_CMDLINE="console=tty1 systemd.unit=getty@tty1.service"

I noticed on my computer there is only one <getty@tty0.service>. there
is no <getty@tty1.service> so maybe there is an issue in the script
<getty@tty0.service>

    ls /usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty*
    /usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service  /usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty.target

    /usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty.target.wants:
    getty@tty0.service  serial-getty@ttyS0.service

In ReaR version 2.7 we got some new issues with serial console  
because of a fix for a bug with serial console setup before, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749\#issuecomment-1196427586](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2749#issuecomment-1196427586)  
which points to the subsequent issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)  
which shows a generic way how to get serial console setup right  
by manually specifying the right serial console setup, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843\#issuecomment-1196592017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843#issuecomment-1196592017)  
which I implemeted via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2699)

So for ReaR version 2.7 the best way is to manually specify  
the right serial console setup via the config variables

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICES_KERNEL
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX
    SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_GRUB

see the descriptions in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3094](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3094)

In current GitHub master code I implemented  
"Copy the console= kernel arguments from the original system" via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2961](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2961)

This should make serial console setup for the ReaR recovery system  
more user-friendly (provided the 'console=' kernel arguments from  
the original system are also right for the ReaR recovery system).

On
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"  
how you can have several ReaR versions in parallel  
each one in its own separated directory  
without conflicts between each other.

In general I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code  
because the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things  
and if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

The screenshot show many errors, so a bad `console` argument is probably
not the problem. The issue looks a lot like \#3017

@martinnaughton can you please check if the change in \#3079 fixes the
problem?
