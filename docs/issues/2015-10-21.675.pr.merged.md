I ran into some scenarios where it appeared that ReaR had hung, but in
fact it was running mkinitrd. This is confusing in particular when the
workflow dictates the user must hit enter to continue, and then mkinitrd
starts but produces no output for 30 seconds or more.

Currently the BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM workflow deals with this by running
usr/share/rear/restore/FDRUPSTREAM/default/29\_notify\_of\_delay.sh. But
it is probably better for all users to instead include on-screen
notification that mkinitrd is running.

If you guys would prefer to leave things the way they are, I am ok with
that.

@rowens275 I am a bit confused with your pull request as it tries to
push changes which were already applied. Perhaps your base is wrong? See
[http://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/](http://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/)
for a nice how-to...

I believe I had updated my base.

When I click on the "Files Changed" link here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/675/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/675/files)  
I see a single "echo" line added to
usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh and
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/17\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh

And the following file is being removed (it's no longer needed if the
two above changes are made):  
usr/share/rear/restore/FDRUPSTREAM/default/29\_notify\_of\_delay.sh

Do you see something different?
