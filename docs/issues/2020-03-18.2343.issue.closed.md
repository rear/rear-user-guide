Hi,  
We configured REAR for our SUSE server.  
when we take backup using command 'rear -d -D mkbackup' the command.
backup never finishes and in log we found below entries continuously  
(Rear Version : rear118a-1.18.a-8.3.x86\_64  
Ebiso Version : ebiso-0.2.4-1.23.x86\_64)  
Please find attached

@akashlate  
please provide us the information we ask for, see  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
You get that automatically when you click on the \[New issue\] button

In your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4349151/rear-mumhanaebg.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4349151/rear-mumhanaebg.log)  
I see (excerpts):

    Archived 29 MiB [avg 15120 KiB/sec]
    Archived 43 MiB [avg 14992 KiB/sec]
    ...
    Archived 1302 MiB [avg 24244 KiB/sec]
    Archived 1308 MiB [avg 23928 KiB/sec]
    ...
    Archived 2131 MiB [avg 13899 KiB/sec]
    Archived 2144 MiB [avg 13808 KiB/sec]
    Archived 2144 MiB [avg 13722 KiB/sec]
    ...

    Archived 2144 MiB [avg 203 KiB/sec]

so speed seems to decrease by a factor of 100  
from about 20000 KiB/sec to about 200 KiB/sec.

Because you use BACKUP=NETFS I guess  
it is perhaps your NFS server that gets somehow  
slower and slower in receiving the backup data?

In general:  
You use a rather old ReaR version 1.18 from 2016.  
I would first and foremost recommend to upgrade  
to a more recent ReaR version, see the sections  
"rear / rear116 / rear1172a / rear118a / rear23a"  
and  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"  
and  
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover"  
in

Because "no news is good news" I assume the root cause was found  
that let the backup become slower and slower in this particular case  
so the issue can be closed.
