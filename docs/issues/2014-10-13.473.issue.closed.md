Hello,

after restore process from actual github version of today I got
following error:

    Patching '/proc/3335/mounts' instead of 'etc/mtab'
    Installing GRUB2 boot loader

    WARNING ! For this system
    Debian/7.6 on Linux-i386 (based on )
    there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system or the code
    that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.

    Please contribute this code to the Relax-and-Recover project. To do so
    please take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize,
    for an example you can use the script for Fedora (and RHEL/CentOS/SL) in
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/20_install_grub.sh

    |          IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL A BOOT LOADER MANUALLY,              |

    |          THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL N O T BE ABLE TO BOOT !              |

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login' to access the recovered system.
    Please remember to mount /proc before trying to install a boot loader.


    Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.

btw the referenced file *Fedora/i386/20\_install\_grub.sh* isn't
available anymore ;)

But I have

    # find /usr/share/rear/finalize -type f  -name "*grub*"
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/22_install_grub2.sh
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/21_install_grub.sh

and also

    # find /usr/share/rear/finalize -type f -regex ".*/\(Debian\|Fedora\)/.*"
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Debian/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh

Is there an option or so to debug this problem to find the reason?

@Reiner030 thank you for notifying about our comment (need to correct
this). The uuid reference? Is this the case on your system in the
grub.conf?

I think the grubenv and perhapd some other files are also needed:

    wheezy $ find /boot/grub/ -type f | grep -v -e .mod -e .mo -e .img -e .lst
    /boot/grub/device.map
    /boot/grub/grubenv
    /boot/grub/unicode.pf2
    /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    wheezy $ find /boot/grub/ -type f | grep -e .mod -e .mo -e .img -e .lst | wc -l
    244
    wheezy $ find /boot/grub/ -type d
    /boot/grub/
    /boot/grub/locale
    /boot/grub/i386-pc

mmh, this was previous Debian Squeeze ^^... ... checking Debian wheezy
only install:

    wheezy # find /boot/grub/ -type f | grep -v -e .mod -e .mo -e .img -e .lst
    /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    /boot/grub/device.map
    /boot/grub/grubenv

    /boot/grub/efiemu64.o
    wheezy # find /boot/grub/ -type f | grep -e .mod -e .mo -e .img -e .lst | wc -l
    218
    wheezy # find /boot/grub/ -type d
    /boot/grub/
    /boot/grub/locale

and here the actual Ubuntu:

    trusty # find /boot/grub/ -type f | grep -v -e .mod -e .mo -e .img -e .lst
    /boot/grub/grubenv
    /boot/grub/unicode.pf2

I did a successful recovery of

    # lsb_release -a 2>/dev/null
    Distributor ID: Debian
    Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 7.6 (wheezy)
    Release:        7.6
    Codename:       wheezy

this morning with the modification I checked in yesterday.  
btw: `/boot/grub/grubenv` is already included I believe

I did not need to rebuild initramfs:

    update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-4-amd64
    /usr/sbin/mkinitramfs: 66: .: Can't open /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf

perhaps we need to COPY this to our rescue image?

mmh... there seems be a problem then.  
I tried now my first VMware based guest again to backup/restore with a
new build.

When I checked backup log I was astonished that my version string in
rear wasn't updated.  
Even if I made a "make clean; make deb" I got the wrong version from
some 14th again (the multiple strings from 14th came perhaps because I
forgot "make clean" there).  
Here some log of my try:

    $ make clean
    rm -f rear-1.16.1-git201410100921-git201410100921-git201410100921-git201410100921.tar.gz
    rm -f build-stamp
    make -C doc clean
    make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/rear/doc'
    rm -f unconv.8 *.html *.xml
    make -C user-guide clean
    make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/rear/doc/user-guide'
    rm -f *.html *.svg *.xml
    make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/rear/doc/user-guide'
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/rear/doc'
    $ make deb
    rm -f rear-1.16.1-git201410100921-git201410100921-git201410100921-git201410100921.tar.gz
    rm -f build-stamp
    make -C doc clean
    ...

So I checked it by deleting and checking out it completely new:

    $ LANG=C diff -rq rear-inital rear-aftercompile
    Files rear-inital/.git/index and rear-aftercompile/.git/index differ
    Files rear-inital/.git/logs/HEAD and rear-aftercompile/.git/logs/HEAD differ
    Only in rear-aftercompile: build-stamp
    Only in rear-aftercompile: rear-1.16.1-git201410171607.tar.gz
    $ LANG=C diff -rq rear-aftercompile rear-aftercleanup
    Only in rear-aftercompile: build-stamp
    Only in rear-aftercompile: rear-1.16.1-git201410171607.tar.gz
    $ LANG=C diff -rq rear-inital rear-aftercleanup
    Files rear-inital/.git/index and rear-aftercleanup/.git/index differ
    Files rear-inital/.git/logs/HEAD and rear-aftercleanup/.git/logs/HEAD differ

but this seems fine - when the "make clean" is not forgotten ;)

I uploaded my deb package to
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/n1k8717twpgq43j/rear\_1.16.1-1\_all.deb?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n1k8717twpgq43j/rear_1.16.1-1_all.deb?dl=0)

On my VMware guest I have installed:

    # duply -V
      duply version 1.8.0
      (http://duply.net)

      Using installed duplicity version 0.6.18, python 2.7.3, gpg 1.4.12 (Home: ~/.gnupg), awk 'GNU Awk 4.0.1', bash '4.2.37(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)'.
    # duplicity --version
    duplicity 0.6.18

The disk layout should be easy - the only thing is that I have swapped
last year the order of swap and root partition:

    # fdisk -l

    Disk /dev/sda: 12.9 GB, 12884901888 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1566 cylinders, total 25165824 sectors
    Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

    Partition table entries are not in disk order

But I got still same error (after fixing libs manually from issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/426](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/426)):

I try to test the same with my Vagrant / Virtualbox tomorrow.

ah for the Vagrant testing I have found my problem / when creating the
test env for the main repository I have made a mistake (but only for the
Vagrant version - not the above mentioned VMware guest problem):

    rear-test/rear$ git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/tyl0re/rear.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/tyl0re/rear.git (push)

My provision script is setup right but yet not checking for modified
remotes:

     # Github Repository_URL of ReaR:
     GIT_REPO="https://github.com/rear/rear.git"
     #GIT_REPO="https://github.com/tyl0re/rear.git"

=&gt; now fixed (also in
[https://gist.github.com/Reiner030/4b602289320f3c2ed4e7](https://gist.github.com/Reiner030/4b602289320f3c2ed4e7)
)

Vagrant backuo/recover now works better with included fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/426](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/426)
but there are still 2 problems

1.  with the known\_hosts file.  
    a) automatic restore didn't use / find it - but it's there:
    /root/.ssh/known\_hosts  
    b) manual run in the root login/shell works nice.

2.  recovered machine has problems to boot - it hung with

<!-- -->

    Loading, please wait...
    INIT: version 2.88 booting
    INIT: No inittab file found

    Enter runlevel: _

but manual set of runlevel didn't help.

mmh, having a cold is not the best thing to setup/diagnose things...  
When checking why 70-persistent-cd.rules was not found by restore
process I recognized that I had accidently excluded the folder in my

1.  known\_hosts / ssh access is only used when run manually

Perhaps I have some misunderstaning how ReaR works?  
So I tried manual resotre + grub setup - and found different variants of

Sorry, I still have no clue where here the problem is (in my setup) -
perhaps someone can test with my environment and see what is missing?
=&gt;
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/486](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/486)

=&gt; Yesterday I got in tmpfs size problem when restoring with duply -
I done a quickfix by resizing RAM from 2G to 4G in my testing
instance.  
I would check to fix the TEMP\_DIR problem
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/469](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/469)
but that could be a little easier if this problem and the inital "host
not found error" is already solved ;)

The ReaR Backup is a "nice to have" for my setups and I have higher prio
tasks next weeks.  
But I would try to check/help here to fix it finally.

When testing it this and vagrant task "together" I think i stumbled over
the solution.

-   you where right
-   i where right ;)

Why ?

-   I was testing it always in "autorecovery" mode
-   I bet you were testing it alway in "manual" recovery mode.

=&gt; if the recovery is run in "auto mode" there are some
environments/setups missing which e.g. didn't set $HOME so that ssh
didn't know about $HOME/.ssh/known\_hosts file and somehow grub2 is
missing also something.  
=&gt; This task can be then closed and we need another issue opened I
think?

@Reiner030 the vagrant setup is very interesting, but I would still like
know what the difference is between *auto mode* and *manual* mode,
especially what it means for the ssh and grub environment.

@Reiner030 what shall we do with this issue? Not sure where I can help
you with?
