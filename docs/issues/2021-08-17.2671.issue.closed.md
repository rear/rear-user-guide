-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    rear rescue over TFTP/NFS fails : Filestructure has wrong permission

On the share pxe use nfs a subdirectory, named with the backuped
hostname created with the permission 750.  
If you start a rescue via Pxe, it fails like "rear/tardis/tardis.kernel
failed No Fiel or Directory"

-   Workaround, if any:  
    The reason for this behaviour i've found in this file:  
    ../output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh:mkdir -p $v -m0750
    "${opath}" &gt;&2  
    If "0750" is changed to "0755" everythings looks good. The rescue is
    well done

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

@raspel01 nice catch - why not making a pull request for it?

Ok... Its the first time for me... I'll do my best...

I suppose it is due to root squashing? Should the backup be
world-readable, actually? I suspect there is some reason behind creating
it as `750` and not `755`.

That may be possible... But look in my /etc/exports:  
/mnt/filer/tftpboot/rear
10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no\_root\_squash,sync,no\_subtree\_check,fsid=9)  
All my Install-Images on this pxe-boot Server works like this...

I see. I would say that before creating a PR, it is needed to determine
what actually are the right permissions, because it is far from obvious.
Maybe owhership by root:nobody would do the trick?

@raspel01 is it a regression, that is, did it work correctly in earlier
releases? I suppose that a workaround would be to export the directories
with root squashing? But maybe it would lead to other problems.

You mean, the atftpd should startet with ownership root:nobody? To your
second answer: In Version 2.4 it is the same...  
But for me is this no question... I have a workaround for my systems.
You could close this issue...

No, I meant the directory should be owned by root:nobody, maybe. I think
it is a real issue and it should stay open. What workaround did you use?

The directory .../rear/<hostname>/... would created by rear... The
script, i point to in this issue, show the mkdir command with the option
-m750...

I think that directory should be neither world-readable nor
world-writable  
because it contains confidential data. In particular it may contain  
the backup of (almost) all files of the system.  
I added a comment via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/53ec3f39dcb50cd10ea752556dc8b273f78c45ef](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/53ec3f39dcb50cd10ea752556dc8b273f78c45ef)

As far as I see in in function output\_path() in
lib/global-functions.sh  
that directory can be a local path like `$path/${OUTPUT_PREFIX}`  
or a temporary mount-path like `${BUILD_DIR}/outputfs/${OUTPUT_PREFIX}`.

When it is a local path that directory must be neither world-readable
nor world-writable.  
Off the top of my head I don't know how things behave when it is a
temporary mount-path.
