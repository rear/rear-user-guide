<li>Bump minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3223">#3223</a></li>
<li>When SARIF files are uploaded by the <code>analyze</code> or <code>upload-sarif</code> actions, the CodeQL Action automatically performs post-processing steps to prepare the data for the upload. Previously, these post-processing steps were only performed before an upload took place. We are now changing this so that the post-processing steps will always be performed, even when the SARIF files are not uploaded. This does not change anything for the <code>upload-sarif</code> action. For <code>analyze</code>, this may affect Advanced Setup for CodeQL users who specify a value other than <code>always</code> for the <code>upload</code> input. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3222">#3222</a></li>

<h2>4.30.7 - 06 Oct 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>[v4+ only] The CodeQL Action now runs on Node.js v24. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3169">#3169</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.30.6 - 02 Oct 2025</h2>

</ul>
<h2>3.30.5 - 26 Sep 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>We fixed a bug that was introduced in <code>3.30.4</code> with <code>upload-sarif</code> which resulted in files without a <code>.sarif</code> extension not getting uploaded. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3160">#3160</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.30.4 - 25 Sep 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have improved the CodeQL Action's ability to validate that the workflow it is used in does not use different versions of the CodeQL Action for different workflow steps. Mixing different versions of the CodeQL Action in the same workflow is unsupported and can lead to unpredictable results. A warning will now be emitted from the <code>codeql-action/init</code> step if different versions of the CodeQL Action are detected in the workflow file. Additionally, an error will now be thrown by the other CodeQL Action steps if they load a configuration file that was generated by a different version of the <code>codeql-action/init</code> step. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3099">#3099</a> and <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3100">#3100</a></li>
<li>We added support for reducing the size of dependency caches for Java analyses, which will reduce cache usage and speed up workflows. This will be enabled automatically at a later time. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3107">#3107</a></li>
<li>You can now run the latest CodeQL nightly bundle by passing <code>tools: nightly</code> to the <code>init</code> action. In general, the nightly bundle is unstable and we only recommend running it when directed by GitHub staff. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3130">#3130</a></li>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.23.1. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3118">#3118</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.30.3 - 10 Sep 2025</h2>
<p>No user facing changes.</p>
<h2>3.30.2 - 09 Sep 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause language autodetection to fail. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3084">#3084</a></li>
<li>Experimental: The <code>quality-queries</code> input that was added in <code>3.29.2</code> as part of an internal experiment is now deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming version of the CodeQL Action. It has been superseded by a new <code>analysis-kinds</code> input, which is part of the same internal experiment. Do not use this in production as it is subject to change at any time. <a href="https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3064">#3064</a></li>
