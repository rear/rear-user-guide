##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1564](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1564)

-   How was this pull request tested? Making a recover on Baremetal
    server with SSD Samsung EVO NVMe disk

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: for NVMe
    devices the trailing 'p' in the Disk value (as in /dev/nvme0n1p that
    is derived from /dev/nvme0n1p1) needs to be stripped (to get
    /dev/nvme0n1), otherwise the efibootmgr call fails because of a
    wrong disk device name.
