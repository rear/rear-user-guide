Hi

I created rear file from an VM and i want to recover it on another VM
with below specifications:  
Both VM on ESX5  
OS is RHEL5.8

My local.conf is:

OUTPUT=ISO

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://192.168.41.5/tools/rear/

BACKUP\_PROG=tar  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS="--gzip"  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_SUFFIX=".gz"

BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' )

But when i'm trying to recover on destination VM i face below error:  
Error: Mount command 'mount -v -t nfs -o ro 192.168.41.5:/tools/rear
...' failed.

I know this rescue image's network don't work. but i cannot
troubleshooting because it doesn't have relevant script for checking
network status.

Please help me.

Thanks

ip addr and ip route should work and help you find out why you don't
have  
networking. Compare with the source system. Do you use Wifi? AFAIK we
don't  
really support that yet.

on boot level you can append options to kernel like `dhcp` to force DHCP
queries, or as an example `ip=x.x.x.100  gw=x.x.x.1 nm=255.255.255.0` to
define a fixed IP address during the rescue boot.  
Or, in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file define a variable
`USE_DHCLIENT=y` to achieve the same as using the `dhcp` option as
kernel argument.
