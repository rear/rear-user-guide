##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2500

-   How was this pull request tested? With an EFI USB disk

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: The
    GRUB2\_SET\_USB\_ROOT variable was used locally in script
    100\_create\_efiboot.sh. However, by adding it to the default.conf
    we are able to overrule the setting which was defined in the
    100\_create\_efiboot.sh script. Now, it can be added to the
    local.conf file with a more precise setting according the end-user
    requirements.  
    Furthermore, we also introduced the `insmod xzio` in the grub.conf
    file in case we were using the `REAR_INITRD_COMPRESSION=lzma`
    setting in the local.conf file.

Currently GRUB2\_SET\_USB\_ROOT is used at three places

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT'

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_grub.sh:
    # GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT is used in the create_grub2_cfg() function:
    GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT="search --no-floppy --set=root --label $USB_DEVICE_BOOT_LABEL"

    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/100_create_efiboot.sh:
    # GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT is used in the create_grub2_cfg() function:
    GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT="search --no-floppy --set=root --label $efi_label"

    usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh:
    test "$GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT" && grub2_set_root_command="$GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT"
    ...
    test "$grub2_set_root_command" || grub2_set_root_command="search --no-floppy --set=root --file /boot/efiboot.img"

I wonder if that variable should be really named with `_USB_` because  
this would mean it can only used in case of OUTPUT=USB  
but it seems its actual meaning is  
to generally specify the GRUB2 `--set=root` command  
regardless that currently this is maily used for OUTPUT=USB  
but the create\_grub2\_cfg function in lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
is currently also called in for OUTPUT=ISO  
in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
so perhaps some more generic GRUB2\_SET\_ROOT or  
GRUB2\_SET\_ROOT\_COMMAND would be a better name?

In general this shows again our currently somewhat messy  
recovery system bootloader setup code which needs to be  
generally cleaned up and overhauled as a separated task  
e.g. see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666)  
therein in particular item (a)  
"Consistent calling of the create\_grub2\_cfg function in all scripts"  
and

@jsmeix I agree it is a messy thing as a result of the many changes over
time. However, what I'm trying to fix for the moment is that
`search --no-floppy --set=root --label REAR-LABEL` is not bullet proof
enough (at least not with EFI booting).  
After many tests I think that
`search --no-floppy --set=root --file /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX86.efi` works best
on UEFI based systems (especially with USB booting). The ISO part uses
the same method I noticed.  
If we want to go for a more generic name then I think that
`GRUB2_SEARCH_ROOT_COMMAND` would even closer to the action? What do you
think?

GRUB2\_SEARCH\_ROOT\_COMMAND is perfect  
because it describes best what it actually does.
