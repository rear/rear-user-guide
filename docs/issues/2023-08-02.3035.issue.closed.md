-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956)  
there is  
lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
which seems to leak secrets with 'set -x', cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3034\#issuecomment-1662077184](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3034#issuecomment-1662077184)

For example the function encrypt\_base64 contains

    ciphertext=$(openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -pass pass:"$2" <<< "$plaintext" 2>&1); ret=$?

which leaks the password `$2` when 'set -x' is set  
like

    # ( set -x ; \
     password=PASSWORD ; \
     plaintext=plain_text ; \
     ciphertext=$(openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -pass pass:"$password" <<< "$plaintext" 2>&1) ; \
     ret=$? ; \
     echo $ret ; \
     echo $ciphertext )

    + password=PASSWORD
    + plaintext=plain_text
    ++ openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -pass pass:PASSWORD
    + ciphertext=U2FsdGVkX1/cEmESpmJJr0cblyHQ1AvAXvTkI9qArqk=
    + ret=0
    + echo 0
    0
    + echo U2FsdGVkX1/cEmESpmJJr0cblyHQ1AvAXvTkI9qArqk=

versus with proper stderr redirection to /dev/null for the openssl
command

    # ( set -x ; \
     password=PASSWORD ; \
     plaintext=plain_text ; \
     { ciphertext=$( openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -pass pass:"$password" <<< "$plaintext" 2>&1 ) ; } 2>/dev/null ; \
     ret=$? ; \
     echo $ret ; \
     echo $ciphertext )

    + password=PASSWORD
    + plaintext=plain_text
    + ret=0
    + echo 0
    0
    + echo U2FsdGVkX19ou3CqOsY3kQ3LDePzNIVeFVs3IPjcgpw=
    U2FsdGVkX19ou3CqOsY3kQ3LDePzNIVeFVs3IPjcgpw=

@kernins  
could you have a look here because you implemented  
authtoken-functions.sh  
via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956)

As an example I think the above command should be

    { ciphertext=$( openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -pass pass:"$2" <<< "$plaintext" 2>&1 ) ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV ; ret=$?

Regarding

    { SECRET COMMAND ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3006)

Currently SECRET\_OUTPUT\_DEV is only set in usr/sbin/rear  
so when ReaR system startup scripts in skel/default/etc/scripts  
call functions in lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
we must set SECRET\_OUTPUT\_DEV also for ReaR system startup scripts.

In particular encrypt\_base64() is called in  
skel/default/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks

So probably it is better - at least for now -  
to use hardcoded /dev/null to be fail-safe like

    { ciphertext=$( openssl aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -pass pass:"$2" <<< "$plaintext" 2>&1 ) ; } 2>/dev/null ; ret=$?

Regarding 'set -x' for ReaR system startup scripts:

'set -x' is set for the ReaR system startup  
scripts in /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/\*.sh  
by the initial startup script /etc/scripts/system-setup  
when "debug" is a kernel command line parameter  
which can be specified by the user when he boots  
the ReaR recovery system.

I don't know how scripts like  
/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks  
are called.  
I.e. I don't know if 'set -x' can be set  
for /etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks

According to

    # for f in $( grep '^function ' usr/share/rear/lib/authtoken-functions.sh | cut -d ' ' -f2 | cut -d '(' -f1 ) ; do echo $f found in ; find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep -l $f ; echo ; done

    usr/share/rear/lib/authtoken-functions.sh

    garbage_base64 found in
    usr/share/rear/lib/authtoken-functions.sh

all functions in lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
are only called in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks

So when 'set -x ' cannot be set for  
/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks  
then it seems all is OK regarding leaking with 'set -x'.

But I did not check possible leaking without 'set -x'.

Thanks for your finding!  
I'll take a closer look at it when the time permits, no ETA
unfortunately.

At a first glance, the only real/practical leak case I see theoretically
possible is that when attacker already has an access to both token &
device it was generated on (if token is TPM-bound) and/or token 2FA
password, which would mean he already can decrypt/unlock the drive. Then
either `set -x` leak (if it can be set) or manual token decryption in
CLI (if enabled, which shouldn't be the case) can reveal the actual Opal
passphrase.

`unlock-opal-disks` is run only in pre-boot volatile environment, all
secret user-input happens only in that pre-boot environment, and the
image is immutable (PBA-area is RO on locked drive)

@kernins  
thank you for your prompt reply  
and for your explanation.

I found another reason why the current sate is OK:

There is no log file for the ReaR system startup scripts.  
While the ReaR system startup scripts are running  
their stdin/stdout/stderr is the user's terminal  
(usually keyboard and screen).

In particular when 'set -x' is set for the ReaR system  
startup scripts, the 'set -x' messages appear only  
on the user's terminal.

So only the user who runs ReaR may see his own secrets  
on his own terminal.

If the user who runs ReaR works from remote  
he has to care himself as usual about the security  
of his remote connection (e.g. by using an encrypted  
remote connection method like 'ssh').

There is one thing left to do for me:

Because @kernins wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956\#discussion\_r1134731456](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956#discussion_r1134731456)

    Although authtoken-functions.sh are generic enough
    to possibly find some use also in ReaR context over time,
    I'd prefer to keep them self-contained and
    easily reusable outside of ReaR

As long as the functions in lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
are only called in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/unlock-opal-disks  
things are OK according to the reasoning above.

But if the functions in lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
would be called in other ReaR scripts,  
then those functions would leak secrets with 'set -x'.

So currently the functions in lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
are not properly implemented to be called in other ReaR scripts  
or even generically in whatever environment outside of ReaR.

Therefore I will add a comment at the beginning of  
lib/authtoken-functions.sh  
that explains the current state.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1f839f776bf4af0812d9acdbf41c425419b5875b](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1f839f776bf4af0812d9acdbf41c425419b5875b)  
this issue should be reasonably solved (at least for now).

@kernins  
again thank you for your prompt reply  
that helped me a lot to get this issue solved.
