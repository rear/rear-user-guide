Umounting fails because

    umount: /tmp/rear.Nam5Ymoj1A4mdx4/outputfs: target is busy.

but I cannot know why it is still in use by something.

Your `lsblk` output

    sdd      8:48   1 468,8G  0 disk
    ├─sdd1   8:49   1   200M  0 part
    └─sdd2   8:50   1 468,6G  0 part /tmp/rear-efi.YE74S

indicates that you may have your USB disk already mounted  
and that could interfere with what ReaR tries to do.

By the way:  
ReaR version 2.4 is rather old - from June 2018  
and many changes were done since then, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
so you may better first and foremost upgrade to our current version  
or at least "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#Testing\_current\_ReaR\_upstream\_GitHub\_master\_code](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Testing_current_ReaR_upstream_GitHub_master_code)

Thank you very much for your info (sorry i'm german an my english ist
rusty)

The lsblk output was made after rear has stopped. The only i did befor
was to run rear format and there befor sdd was unmount.  
But I did not unmount the USB stick between "format" and "mkbackup".

Anyway, i try to install latest version an run rear again.  
Thanky very much

Kaspersky Endpoint Security 11 for LINUX has to be stopped befor running
ReaR.

thank you for your feedback what the actual root cause was!

@blackjack65 How did you found this out? Any specifi error reported by
Kaspersky EPS?

First ReaR Version 2.6 was installed  
next run of ReaR caused same ERROR: Unmounting ...  
lsof /dev/sdd2 showed no process on /dev/sdd2 (sorry for my
english...)  
What process might on runtime of ReaR interfere with ReaR (or any
other)?  
Therefor I stopped Kaspersky (systemctl stop kesl) und run ReaR again.  
Now ReaR runs (but recover is not proofed yet)

Probably Kaspersky interfere with ReaR, because Kaspersky runs the
AntiCryptor task on the server.  
But I really don't know, sorry, it is (and was) only a guess...

Another idea what could make a USB drive "in use"  
that I experience on my homeoffice laptop with openSUSE Leap 15.2  
and its default Gnome desktop stuff:

Each time I plug in a USB drive it gets used by some automatism that
mounts it  
and provides a Gnome desktop notification asking what I like to do with
it.

Unfortunately ;-) I want to use it for ReaR so I need to umount it  
to get rid of that automatism that had mounted it automatically.
