**ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):**

ReaR 2.3

**OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
/etc/os-release"):**

Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic)

**ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
/etc/rear/local.conf"):**

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://ipaddr/volume/backup/"

**Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
guest or PoverVM LPAR):**

oVirt Virtual Machine, although having issues with it freezing when
booting from ISO, so for the moment being I'm using a Synology NAS to
create the VM and do the rescue (then export it to see if that works for
oVirt).

To elaborate, I get my ISO. I use the ISO on oVirt to boot to it, and
when it starts booting up after selecting "Rescue <hostname>" it freezes
after a few moments. No idea why. So, I have a Synology NAS can can spin
up machines, I create a VM there, boot to the ISO, works fine. But, then
I run `rear rescue`, and it tells me that the tar.gz is not readable.
It's pointing to some `/tmp` path. I don't get it.

**System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact ARM
device):**

x86\_64 architecture on both VM and Synology

**Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or ELILO
or Petitboot):**

UEFI

**Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
multipath (DM or NVMe):**

Virtual Disk, technically an SSD on both the oVirt Host and Synology

**Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):**

I'm trying to make backups for my VMs on oVirt. As described above, I've
had no luck with ISOs on oVirt. It comes up to the menu, select Rescue
<hostname>, and it starts loading, and freezes up. Thought it was maybe
my browser or ovirt viewer, even tried looking at it from another OS, no
dice.

At this point, all I really care about is if these backups actually do
work. So far, I can't prove that my backups are even working because I
can't rescue them. My alternative solution was to spin up a VM on my
Synology NAS, and do the rescue there, and then export that VM to an OVA
and see if the oVirt can take that image. It's a pain, but there aren't
a lot of good options for backup solutions for oVirt that I've found.

Anyway, I go through the menu on the Synology, I get to the prompt and
run `rear rescue` and it stops a moment later saying the tar.gz file is
not readable.

**Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug
log files):**

Hi,  
Your boot might be stuck because of missing kernel modules. You could
try with ReaR 2.5, which creates rescue system with all available
modules by default.

Did you mean `rear mkrescue` ?

Either way, I'd appreciate if you could provide us with debug output
from problematic sessions (`rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover`)

No, the `mkrescue` isn't the problem, it does that part just fine. It
creates the ISO.

When I'm booting off the ISO, and I get to the menu, login as root and
run `rear recover`, is when I'm getting issues.

I just tried with 2.5, same issue. Backup archive is not readable.

@dveleztx  
you posted an incomplete error message

    ERROR: Backup archive '/tmp/rear.FXto7PceFQdH2hF/outputfs/hostname/backup.tar.gz'

which makes it needlessly hard for us to find out  
where in the ReaR scripts it comes from,  
I guess it is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh\#L65](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh#L65)  
and you wrote a non existing command "rear rescue"  
which makes it needlessly hard for us to understand  
what you are talking about.

I am a bit confused by your description about what kind of hardware  
("hardware" could be also virtual hardware) and network environment  
you use while you run "rear mkrescue" versus "rear recover".

First and foremost ReaR is meant to  
recreate the system on "same hardware", cf.  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

So if you try to recreate on incompatible replacement "hardware"  
(i.e. when you do a so called "migration" with ReaR) various issues  
will get into your way depending on how exactly your particular  
replacement "hardware" behaves incompatible.

Furthermore `rear mkrescue` won't create any backup, cf. `man rear`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
so if you really did only `rear mkrescue` but never `rear mkbackup`  
you would not yet have any backup.

Finally see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
that reads (except)

@dveleztx  
could you elaborate on the part about

    ISOs on oVirt. It comes up to the menu, select Rescue ,
    and it starts loading, and freezes up.
    Thought it was maybe my browser or ovirt viewer

in particular how "your browser" is related there.  
I am not a oVirt user and I will certainly not investigate  
what that thingy is or how it behaves in detail.  
According to  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVirt)  
it is from Red Hat so you may have to contact them  
if there are issues with booting ISOs via oVirt "in between"  
cf.
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925)

    It is always possible to add another level of indirection.

and perhaps also "Paravirtualization" at

@jsmeix  
I'm a bit confused, `rear rescue` a non-existent command? It says to try
`rear rescue` when I boot into the ISO and login as root. I've even
followed a few tutorials where people do the same thing.

One of the few I saw is seen here:
[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red\_hat\_enterprise\_linux/7/html/system\_administrators\_guide/ch-relax-and-recover\_rear](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-relax-and-recover_rear)

So, the process is this:

1.  I ssh into my VM, I run the `rear -v mkrescue` and this creates an
    ISO on my backup server.
2.  I create another VM where I go to perform a rescue, and I use the
    ISO that is on my backup server to boot into it.
3.  A menu comes up with some options, the first of which is
    `Rescue <hostname>`, I select that. It goes through a process of
    loading and then there's a login prompt
4.  I login as root, and there is a message that says to run
    `rear rescue`, I run that, and that's where I get my errors.

I will try performing a `mkbackup`. I will give it a try here in a
moment and see the results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To elaborate on the oVirt piece:

My VMs that I'm backing up are on oVirt, and I run my `mkrescue` on
there. So, when I do a rescue, I create a new VM with the exact same
settings and I start it by booting into the rescue ISO. For some reason,
when I select `Rescue <hostname>`, it starts loading and then freezes.

My assumption is that it's the Viewer app, the application that allows
you to "console" into your VM. But, I discovered that wasn't the case, I
tried several and they all show the console to be frozen. I thought
maybe it was a browser issue as well, that is also not the case.

That part I'll have to investigate.

I'll update soon, thanks!

I was able to rescue on my test. I did the rescue on my Synology NAS.
Instead of doing `mkrescue`, I did `mkbackup` as you recommended. You
are right, I feel like some of the tutorials I followed are a bit dated.
My fault for not completely finish reading the docs. One of them I did
see and I missed literally the last paragraph that would have saved me.

Thank you @jsmeix !

@dveleztx  
thank you for your feedback how you made it work.  
It helps us to understand if ReaR works reasonably well  
or if we may need to do some further improvements.

I cannot find a `rear rescue` command mentioned  
in our ReaR upstream source files  
neither in our current master sources  
nor in what we released as ReaR version 2.3.

All I can find are things like

    ReaR rescue/recovery system
    ReaR rescue system
    ReaR rescue image
    ReaR rescue entry
    REAR rescue mode

so as far as I can see our sources look good.

Also in the third-party documentation of Red Hat  
[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red\_hat\_enterprise\_linux/7/html/system\_administrators\_guide/ch-relax-and-recover\_rear](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-relax-and-recover_rear)  
I cannot find a `rear rescue` command mentioned.  
Also there they only talk about the rescue sysem or the rescue image  
so as far as I can see also this Red Hat documentation look good.

@jsmeix

I just realized that I meant `rear recover`, not `rear rescue`, this
command only occurs when booting into the rescue ISO. I've been
consistently mis-typing it, sorry about that!!

Thank you for your frank feedback!  
Now I know I am no longer the only one on planet Earth  
with such kind of sticky misapprehension :-)
