Firs of all sorry for not using the template (not that I'd be a rebel or
something ;-)), but this is rather a question about rear code.  
After checking the issue \#828 , I've thought about helping with UEFI
USB boot support.

I've checked existing code for UEFI USB written by @gdha and realized
that most of the work is already done. Only thing left is fill UEFI
(FAT) partition with boot loader and create some fancy config for it.

For this reason I'd like to know your opinion on what is the best way to
do this.

My initial question would be:  
Where to put code for mounting the UEFI (FAT) partition?

In **10\_mount\_output\_path.sh** we have

    ...
    mount_url $OUTPUT_URL $BUILD_DIR/outputfs $OUTPUT_OPTIONS
    ...

If I'm not wrong this mounts the main (non FAT) partition only.  
Would it be OK for you add the code here?

Offhandedly (i.e. without any thorough analysis right now)  
I would prefer to implement all what is needed for that  
particular functionality in one single block of code  
(regardless if that block of code is added to an  
existing script or added via a separated script).

For my generic reasoning why I would prefer it this way  
remember how we both together achieved to greately simplify  
and cleanup the code for creating an UEFI bootable iso image  
during
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/810)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/816](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/816)

Accordingly I suggest that you (at least as an initial  
starting point) simply implement all what is needed  
in one single block of code (or whatever else is easiest  
for you to implement it). If that somehow does not work  
or looks too ugly we could adapt it as needed later.

In the end I think that everybody first and foremost  
greately appreciates your contribution to make  
"rear format --efi" really working regardless  
how exactly you implemented it.

I assign that issue to me.  
Regardless that I am not at all a UEFI expert  
I will care about the issue to get it into rear  
(just like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/816](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/816)).

@gozora @jsmeix As far I can remember the `rear format --efi` works
already (and is part of the *format* workflow). What is not yet done is
as @gozora mentioned is adding boot code + and executables. New code
(scripts) should be added to directory
`usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/ `, but keep in mind that you will
have 2 partitions now on the USB device (one vFAT and another ext3) - so
you need to be careful where to copy where of course. And, extlinux is
not required. Therefore, the current scripts could conflict with you
want to achieve. This was also one of the reasons why I stopped. The
effort became bigger then on the first impression.

Yes, correct `rear format --efi` works as charm.  
Yesterday I was able to manually construct UEFI bootable USB and
successfully run restore. As @jsmeix mentioned I'll try to put together
some code and create pull request for further discussion.

Thanks for your inputs so far!

@gozora  
many thanks for you valuable contribution

No problem with that.  
Can we keep this issue open until this part is done as a place where we
can communicate?

Yes, I will keep this issue here open  
until we agree that it is done.

So we should have now working USB EFI boot for elilo.  
As always feel free to test and comment.

I'll try to put together support for both grub versions (0.97, 2.0) ...

Now the commit is complete and should work regardless on bootloader
version.

More testing is always welcomed ;-)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/837](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/837)  
I regard this issue as done.

If bugs with USB EFI boot support might be detected later  
they can be handled as separated issues.

@gozora  
again many thanks for your various  
valuable contributions to rear!
