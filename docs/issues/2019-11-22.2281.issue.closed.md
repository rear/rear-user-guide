-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

rear recover failed. There are two entries in the disk\_mappings file:

    Current disk mapping table (source => target):
      /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 => /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776
      /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 => /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775

LUN 360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 is swap partition  
LUN 360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 is system partition.

The first create\_disk\_label & create\_disk\_partition is OK but the
second fails.

    BUG in /usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh line 1078

It seems that there is a problem with the current\_disk variable in the
create\_disk\_label function.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    The possible workaround is to delete the line corresponding to the
    swap, restore the system partition and after the reboot recreate the
    swap.

@musyl  
before I try to dig around in your logs (as time permits)  
I would like to know what output you get for the following commands:

    lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

and

    findmnt -a

to get an overview of your block devices and filesystems structure.

Furthermore please also attach your `disklayout.conf` file  
that "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" had created  
usually as `var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`

On a quick first glance things look as follows to me:

The sequence of the `create_...` calls  
(some `create_device btrfsmountedsubvol` are cut here):

    # grep '+ create_' rear-svrlsta101-0.log

The functions where `current_disk="$disk"` is set are  
in usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh  
`create_disk_label()` and `create_disk_partition()`

The `delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones` function  
is only called in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
after the `create_partitions` call that calls `create_disk_label`  
and for each partition on that disk `create_disk_partition`.

The sequence of only the `create_disk_label`  
`create_partitions` and `create_disk_partition`  
calls in rear-svrlsta101-0.log is

    # grep '+ create_' rear-svrlsta101-0.log | egrep 'create_disk_label|create_partitions|create_disk_partition'

    ++ create_partitions /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 msdos
    ++ create_partitions /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos
    +++ create_disk_label /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 msdos

    +++ create_disk_label /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos

which looks somehow wrong because I would expect to see

    create_disk_label /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos

before

    create_partitions /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos

and I think this wrong looking sequence is the reason why things fail.

I think it is right that "rear recover" errors out with that BugError
because  
I think the sequence how things are created could be wrong here.

But I am not at all a multipath expert so things could be rightfully  
different when multipath is used?

@musyl

only as a basically blind test because we have some recent fixes  
regarding multipath in our current GitHub upstream master code  
I would like to ask you to try out our current master code  
as described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Those recent fixes regarding multipath are  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2235](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2235)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0584c3287aade755bc2f4e4a70fffc8467b59eb8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0584c3287aade755bc2f4e4a70fffc8467b59eb8)  
which might make a difference here  
and additionally  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2237](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2237)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/84d74a3646c99f3a78a9b20ac57c5935af6c4888](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/84d74a3646c99f3a78a9b20ac57c5935af6c4888)

I think my "quick first glance" in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281\#issuecomment-557574289](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281#issuecomment-557574289)  
is a contradiction in itself because I wrote (excerpts)

    the `create_partitions` call that calls `create_disk_label`
    and for each partition on that disk `create_disk_partition`
    ...
    I would expect to see
    `create_disk_label ...`
    before
    `create_partitions ...`

but because `create_partitions` calls `create_disk_label`  
the ordering `create_partitions` before `create_disk_label` is right.

So - as far as I see - for one same disk the expected ordering is

    create_partitions
      |-> create_disk_label
      |-> create_disk_partition (first one on that disk)
      ...
      '->create_disk_partition (last one on that disk)
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones

But as far as I see now it seems this sequence of function calls  
can run simultaneously for more than one disk at the same time  
cf. in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281\#issuecomment-557574289](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281#issuecomment-557574289)

    +++ create_disk_label /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos

instead of the expected sequence

    ++ create_partitions /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 msdos
    +++ create_disk_label /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 msdos
    +++ create_disk_partition /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 primary 1 1048576 34360786943
    ++ create_partitions /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos
    +++ create_disk_label /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000775 msdos

With the intermixed sequence things can mess up  
because the `current_disk` variable is a global variable  
that is used as some kind of semaphore to  
synchronize creating partitions on a disk.

@rmetrich  
I fear this issue here might reveal a possibly severe issue  
since the `create_partitions` function in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
does no longer emit the actual `parted` calls directly but only  
indircet function calls `create_disk_label` and
`create_disk_partition`  
which could somehow (I do not yet see how) lead to intermixed  
creation of partitions on more than one disk at the same time?

@rmetrich  
thank you for your notification!

You really do not need to be sorry for being kept busy with other stuff.

For me it is basically the same, cf. my

Currently I fail to see how device recreation things could run in
parallel.

As far as I see by plain looking at the code all seems to happen
sequentially.

Nowhere I spotted a subshell or something like that, starting at  
layout/prepare/default/540\_generate\_device\_code.sh  
that calls `create_device` (in lib/layout-functions.sh)  
that calls `create_$type "$device"` which is here

    # cat rear-svrlsta101-0.log | grep '+ create_device'

    ++ create_device /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776 multipath
    ++ create_device /dev/mapper/360060e8007e39e000030e39e00000776-part1 part

But I think I may have found something else:

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281\#issuecomment-557574289](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281#issuecomment-557574289)  
I wrote

    The `delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones` function
    is only called in
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh
    after the `create_partitions` call 

I think it means `delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones`  
must be called after any `create_partitions` call  
but that is not the case because `create_partitions`  
is also called in two other scripts:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'create_partitions'

    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120_include_raid_code.sh:    create_partitions "$device"
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/210_load_multipath.sh:        create_partitions "$device" "$label"

therein in the `create_raid` and `create_multipath` functions.

@rmetrich  
when my assumption is right  
that `delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones`  
must be called after any `create_partitions` call  
then it is perhaps best to add the  
`delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones` call  
into the `create_partitions` function to ensure that  
`delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones`  
is always called at the end of each `create_partitions` call?

But even if this is right it does not explain the unexpected  
ordering of the `create_...` function calls in the log  
that at least look as if there happens intermixed creation  
of partitions on more than one disk at the same time.

I followed the "Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"

@musyl  
thank you for your feedback!

The next test with our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
that you could try out is according to what I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281\#issuecomment-558081653](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281#issuecomment-558081653)  
to add a `delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones` call  
after the `create_partitions` call in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/210\_load\_multipath.sh  
in the same way as it is currently done for the non-multipath case  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
so that it will look like the following (excerpt)

    function create_multipath() {
        ...
            create_partitions ...
            cat >> "$LAYOUT_CODE" <<EOF
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones
    EOF
        fi
    }

Then re-do "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" and afterwards  
trest if now "rear recover" perhaps works for you.

If re-do "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" is too laborious or time consuming for
you  
you could - in particular for a test - also modify the ReaR scripts  
from within the ReaR recovery system. To do that  
boot the ReaR recovery system and log in as 'root'  
and then - before you run "rear recover" - you can  
modify any ReaR scripts as you like.  
Cf. the section "Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)"

    even temporary quick and dirty workarounds
    are relatively easily possible

    ### Create multipath devices (at least partitions on them).
    function create_multipath() {
        local component device size label junk
        read component device size label junk < <(grep "^multipath $1 " "$LAYOUT_FILE")

        fi

I performed a backup and then a recover, but the recover loop in the
diskrestore.sh script.

Oups ! Excuse me ! I'm sorry I didn't see my mistake.  
The recover worked but I see that the swap partition type is 'Linux'
(0x83) and not 'Linux swap / Solaris' (0x82) as defined at installation.

@musyl  
thank you for your prompt replies!

Off the top of my head the swap partition type issue is normal  
(I think I also had it on my test systems and it works nevertheless)  
but feel free to report it as a new separated GitHub issue  
so that we can have a closer look because ReaR should  
recreate the system exactly as it was before (as far as possible).

Will the modification of script 210\_load\_multipath.sh be implemented

Should I close the incident, or should I let you handle it?

my pleasure!

The fix for this issue will be included in ReaR 2.6 and

Hi,  
Sorry for taking so long, I'm very busy these weeks.  
I'm very confused by the code, I don't understand why, when creating a
software raid of multipath, we call create\_partitions(), this will be
done later anyway from my understanding.

tell nothing about why `create_partitions` is needed to be called  
so my usual forensics method did not directly help here.

But the commits from @schabrolles at least mention  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449)  
so perhaps therein is a reason that explains  
why `create_partitions` must be called  
separatedly in case of multipath.

The comments where `create_multipath` was removed and re-added are  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449\#issuecomment-324578476](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449#issuecomment-324578476)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449\#issuecomment-325021108](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449#issuecomment-325021108)  
where the latter reads (excerpt):

    you are right regarding create_multipath()
    function... we finally REALLY need it.
    I do additional test which confirm
    it cannot work without it (partition are not created)

So the question is why are partitions not created  
in case of multipath when there is no `create_multipath`  
function that calls `create_partitions`?

My blind guess is that it may boil down to how the  
dependency handling of the disk layout components  
works in ReaR ( shudder ;-)

Thank you. This puzzles me. I don't understand why `multipath` and
`disk` are considered different.  
A `multipath` device is just a disk ...  
Currently the code when having a multipath device is "old-style",
explaining the issue. Probably `create_multipath` should call
`create_disk` internally.

I need to set up 2 reproducers:

-   a multipath system

Both cases do not execute through create\_disk, hence the failures.

I could progress a bit today:

-   a software raid CAN have partitions, /dev/mdXXX is a standard block
    device

But I doubt a multipath device may have (except the underlying disk of
course).
