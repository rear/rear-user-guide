@lzaoral  
thank you for this enhancement!

I will test how it behaves on SLES systems  
with their rather complicated default btrfs structure.

Offhandedly I think the main problem is  
possibly mounted btrfs snapshot subvolumes, see  
"When btrfs is used with snapshots ...  
then usual backup and restore cannot work." in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#btrfs](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#btrfs)

I.e. when there are mounted btrfs "thingies"  
listed as 'btrfsmountedsubvol' in disklayout.conf  
that are also listed as '\#btrfssnapshotsubvol'.

For example a disklayout.conf on SLES15-SP5 (excerpts)

    btrfsdefaultsubvol /dev/sda2 / 268 @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
    ...
    #btrfssnapshotsubvol /dev/sda2 / 272 @/.snapshots/2/snapshot
    #btrfssnapshotsubvol /dev/sda2 / 273 @/.snapshots/3/snapshot
    #btrfssnapshotsubvol /dev/sda2 / 274 @/.snapshots/4/snapshot
    ...
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 / rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=268,subvol=/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot @/.snapshots/1/snapshot
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /.snapshots rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=267,subvol=/@/.snapshots @/.snapshots
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=265,subvol=/@/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi @/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /root rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=262,subvol=/@/root @/root
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /opt rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=263,subvol=/@/opt @/opt
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /home rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=264,subvol=/@/home @/home
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /boot/grub2/i386-pc rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=266,subvol=/@/boot/grub2/i386-pc @/boot/grub2/i386-pc
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /srv rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=261,subvol=/@/srv @/srv
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /tmp rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=260,subvol=/@/tmp @/tmp
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /usr/local rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=259,subvol=/@/usr/local @/usr/local
    btrfsmountedsubvol /dev/sda2 /var rw,relatime,space_cache,subvolid=258,subvol=/@/var @/var

For example assume in addition to @/.snapshots/1/snapshot  
that is the current system snapshot which is mounted at /  
also  
some other snapshots of the system like  
@/.snapshots/2/snapshot and @/.snapshots/4/snapshot  
are mounted e.g. at /snapshot2 and /snapshot4

Then a 'tar' backup would contain the system files  
basically three times:

1.  the files of what is mounted at /
2.  the files of what is mounted at /snapshot2
3.  the files of what is mounted at /snapshot4

So the backup would be basically about three times  
as big as if only what is mounted at / was backed up.

But during 'tar' restore there is no deduplication  
so the restore would basically need about three times  
the disk space as the original system needed.

I am not a btrfs expert at all, but is it possible to distinguish
snapshot subvolumes from "normal" (non-snapshot) subvolumes? Then we
could save this subvolume metadata (snapshot yes/no) and do something
based on the information when recreating and restoring. First we would
probably just skip snapshots, later we could do something more
intelligent if possible.  
It is definitely possible to distinguish snapshots from regular
filesystems (filessytems are equivalent to btrfs subvolumes) in ZFS. It
is also possible to recognize snapshots from regular volumes in LVM.

Only an offhanded thought:

I fear btrfs normal subvolumes versus btrfs snapshot subvolumes  
is only one example of a very generic problem when by default  
every mounted "thingy" is included in the 'tar' backup:

I think it is in general possible that one same  
"mountable thingy" can be mounted at the same time  
at different mount points e.g. at '/here' and '/there'.

When '/here' and '/there' are included in a 'tar' backup  
things may get restored twice as distinct sets of files  
and not as one same set of files that is mounted two times  
under the mountpoint directories '/here' and '/there'.

Tomorrow I will experiment a bit with that.

Perhaps we can by default have every mounted "thingy"  
included in the 'tar' backup  
BUT  
we may need some check for duplicates in the 'tar' backup  
i.e. something that detects when one same "mountable thingy"  
will become included in the 'tar' backup more than once.

Currently I am exploring how 'tar' behaves in general  
when exact same files are provided as 'tar' arguments  
to be archived.

It seems 'tar' behaves well forgiving in this case:

    # mkdir test

    # cd test

    # echo foo >foo

    # tar -cvvvf test.tar foo foo
    -rw-r--r-- root/root         4 2024-03-08 09:41 foo
    hrw-r--r-- root/root         0 2024-03-08 09:41 foo link to foo

    # tar -tvvvf test.tar
    -rw-r--r-- root/root         4 2024-03-08 09:41 foo
    hrw-r--r-- root/root         0 2024-03-08 09:41 foo link to foo

    # mkdir untartest

    # cd untartest/

    # tar -xvvvf ../test.tar
    -rw-r--r-- root/root         4 2024-03-08 09:41 foo
    hrw-r--r-- root/root         0 2024-03-08 09:41 foo link to foo

    # ls -l
    total 4
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4 Mar  8 09:41 foo

So perhaps only mounted btrfs snapshot subvolumes  
added to 'tar' arcives cause real problems in practice.  
In this case btrfs snapshot subvolumes should be excluded  
by default from being added to what 'tar' should archive.

I think it is OK if a user mounts the same stuff  
at different mount points and ReaR includes those  
mount points by default in the 'tar' backup  
then it is up to the user to manually exclude things  
as needed from his backup.

I disagree that it is an example of this problem. Snapshots are not the
same thing mounted at different places. They are different things
mounted at different places - snapshots exist because their content is
(at least in principle) different.

One filesystem mounted at more places can occur as well, and it will
result in an explosion of backup data, but it restoring it twice then
should not result in an increase of the size of the restored system,
only in a slower restore, because you keep restoring to the same
filesystem.

I would not try to solve these two problems in the same way (cf. RFC
1925 item 5).

It thinks that the doubled file names are different names for the same
files (i.e. hardlinks), which is not entirely correct - not sure if it
can have some unwanted consequences or not.

Yes.

The whole point of my experiments with 'tar' here  
is to find out if my "fear" above is true or not and  
in general to better understand what we have to deal with.

If it is actually only one root problem  
then this root problem should be solved  
(instead of solving each of its instances).

If it is actually several separated problems then  
each separated problem should be solved separately.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-1985290555](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-1985290555)  
indicates that it is several separated problems  
(but this is only my very first test in this area).

From my experiments with 'tar' in the past I know that  
'tar' behaves deterministically (i.e. as programmed and  
documented when reading the whole 'tar' manual carefully)  
but that could appear rather often 'unexpectedly'  
(i.e. different than what one may expect offhandedly), e.g.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911\#issuecomment-1398346148](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911#issuecomment-1398346148)

That's an interesting idea. For multiple identical arguments to `tar`,
tar duplicates the backup and considers the secondary copy as a hardlink
to the first copy. I checked that the same happens when there is a
filesystem mounted multiple times:

    # mkdir /mnt/mount1
    # mkdir /mnt/mount2
    # mount /dev/vdb /mnt/mount1
    # mount /dev/vdb /mnt/mount2
    # touch /mnt/mount1/foo
    # ls -l /mnt/mount2/foo
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 0 Mar  8 07:36 /mnt/mount2/foo
    # tar cvvf /dev/null /mnt/mount1 /mnt/mount2
    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 1969-12-31 19:00 /mnt/mount1/
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2024-03-08 07:36 /mnt/mount1/foo
    tar: Removing leading `/' from hard link targets
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 1969-12-31 19:00 /mnt/mount2/
    hrwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2024-03-08 07:36 /mnt/mount2/foo link to mnt/mount1/foo

Is the same happening with different btrfs snapshots mounted at
different mountpoints? I.e. does tar consider files in different
snapshots (originally same, but possibly different when they have been
modified since the snapshot was taken) as hardlinks to the same file?

Thank you for the feedback, @jsmeix! I'll amend the code to skip backup
of all mounted btrfs snapshot subvolumes.

The duplication of files in backup when a filesystem/btrfs subvolume is
mounted more than once is a different (though related) issue, therefore,
I suggest to resolve it separately.

I tested it with SLES15-SP5  
with the default btrfs structure  
on a QEMU/KVM test VM:

    # lsblk -ipo NAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINTS
    NAME        TRAN TYPE FSTYPE   SIZE MOUNTPOINTS
    /dev/sda    ata  disk           15G 
    |-/dev/sda1      part            8M 
    |-/dev/sda2      part btrfs     13G /var
    |                                   /usr/local
    |                                   /root
    |                                   /tmp
    |                                   /srv
    |                                   /boot/grub2/i386-pc
    |                                   /opt
    |                                   /home
    |                                   /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi
    |                                   /.snapshots
    |                                   /
    `-/dev/sda3      part swap       2G [SWAP]

I was in particular interested how things behave  
with the "well known" (to SLES users) SUSE specific

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( $( findmnt -n -r -o TARGET -t btrfs | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash' ) )

manual setting in etc/rear/local.conf  
cf. conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
so I have

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.178.66/nfs
    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( snapper chattr )
    PROGS+=( lsattr )
    COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper /etc/snapper/config-templates/default )
    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /boot/grub2/i386-pc /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi /home /opt /root /srv /tmp /usr/local /var )

With that I got duplicated things in the backup.tar.gz

To make ReaR behave backward compatible for SLES users  
and because it seems to be "the right thing" in general  
I implemented  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3177](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3177)

With this additional changes I get no longer  
duplicated things in the backup.tar.gz  
BUT  
I did not yet test "rear recover".  
This will be done next week.

Is it a regression with this PR, or did you get duplicated entries in
backup.tar.gz even before? What are the duplicated entries? Aren't you
missing `BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE="yes"`? (but then you should probably add
`/boot` to `BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE` unless on SLES you have `/boot` as part
of `/`).

I tested ZFS and the same files in a snapshot and in the original
filesystem do not show up as hardlinks to the same file in the `tar`
output. Of course, although Btrfs is in many ways analogous to ZFS, it
can behave differently in details like that.

    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-1985907542](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-1985907542)
-   \[ \] avoid `sort -u` , to be replaced by `uniq_unsorted` in \#3177
-   \[ \] test recovery with the SUSE-specific BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE
    setting

-   \[ \] test snapshots: does tar consider files in different snapshots
    (originally same, but possibly different when they have been
    modified since the snapshot was taken) as hardlinks to the same
    file?

-   \[ \] exclude snapshots from backup:

Hi @jsmeix can you please have a look? I believe the first four items in
the checklist above are for you (the second only partially, you
implement `uniq_unsorted` in \#3177 and then @lzaoral will use it here).
Is the task list ok?

@pcahyna  
I will have a look.

First I would like to implement `uniq_unsorted`  
or perhaps even better named `unique_unsorted` cf.

so that @lzaoral could use it here.
