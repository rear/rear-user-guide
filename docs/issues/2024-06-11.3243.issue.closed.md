-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    2.7

We have a logic, that creates a so called `dummy` logical volume to make
sure there is always a minumum amout of storage free in the os volume
group to use with snapshots.  
The creating and deleting of this special logical volume is noticed by
the `rear checklayout`.  
That is technically right because that is in fact a layout change, but
we would like to ignore those changes.  
This is because we have the following cronjob daily run on our systems:

    /usr/sbin/rear checklayout
    if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then
       TMPDIR=/tmp /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    fi

As you can see, a `rear mkrescue` is triggered, when the checklayout
checks a difference.  
Is it possible to ignore the creation/deletion of one specific logical
volume?  
Maybe that the checklayout command is printing out the difference (is
there a parameter to do so?), so that it could be evaluated by the
cronjob and the decision weather it needs to run a `rear mkrescure` is
done more whisely and not only done by the returncode?

@damm620  
I never tried out what you ask for  
so the following is only what I assume:

In general all ReaR config options are  
(more or less well) described in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

According to what I found in default.conf  
there is only EXCLUDE\_VG but there is no EXCLUDE\_LV  
which you would need to only exclude a LV.

What may work (not yet tested by me) to exclude a LV  
is using the more generic EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS array.  
In this case you need to inspect your  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
and your  
var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf  
how your 'dummy' LV of your 'os' VG is stored,  
for example in disklayout.conf it could be like

    lvmvol /dev/os dummy ...

with a matching entry in disktodo.conf like

    todo /dev/mapper/os-dummy lvmvol

so in this example

    EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS+=( /dev/mapper/os-dummy )

in etc/rear/local.conf should result  
that the 'dummy' LV gets excluded/disabled:  
In disklayout.conf the entry gets commented out and  
in disktodo.conf the entry gets marked as 'done'.

But this would result that your 'dummy' LV  
may not get recreated during "rear recover"  
which depends on how the LVM things are recreated:

When LVM things are recreated by using  
the modern/default 'lvm vgcfgrestore' method,  
then LVM things get recreated as stored in  
var/lib/rear/layout/lvm/system.cfg  
and there things are not excluded which are  
specified via EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS.  
So when LVM things get recreated via 'lvm vgcfgrestore'  
your 'dummy' LV should get recreated during "rear recover"  
regardless that you excluded it via EXCLUDE\_COMPONENTS  
(which is actually a bug in ReaR).

In contrast when LVM things get recreated by using  
traditional/fallback 'vgcreate/lvcreate' commands,  
then LVM things get recreated as stored in  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
and therein your 'dummy' LV is commented out  
so in this case your 'dummy' LV will  
not be recreated during "rear recover".

thanks for your detailed answer. I will try this and give you feedback.

That the dummy lv will maybe not restored is not that munch of a problem
:)

@jsmeix

It seems to be working pretty fine. Thank you very munch!

One last question:  
After adding the `EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS` parameter do we need to run a
mkrescue?  
In my tests it seems to be that way.

@damm620  
in general when you change a ReaR config setting  
you should run at least "rear mkrescue".

Additionally you should also think about  
making a new backup, cf. the two parts about  
"ensure your backup is consistent" in the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In this specific case you needed "rear mkrescue"  
to create a new var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
because "rear checklayout" also creates a new  
temporary .../rear.XXXX/tmp/checklayout.conf  
and compares that with the already existing  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf from "rear mkrescue"  
so to get both same you need the excluded things in both,  
cf. usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500\_compare\_layout.sh

@jsmeix

As I did not find it quickly in the code:  
Are lvm snapshots excluded by default from the `checklayout` process?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2024-06-19 07:33](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3243#issuecomment-2177959925):

@damm620  
I am not a sufficient LVM expert  
to answer questions about "LVM snapshots" properly.

In general there is no special 'checklayout' process.  
In particular there are no special exclusions for 'checklayout'.  
What "rear checklayout" does is to create a new temporary  
.../rear.XXXX/tmp/checklayout.conf  
exactly the same as the normal  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
is created by "rear mkrescue"  
and then "rear checklayout" compares both files.

So the question  
"Are lvm snapshots excluded by default from the checklayout process?"  
should be - as far as I understand things - equivalent to  
"Are lvm snapshots excluded by default?"

You could verify that by checking your normal  
var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
that was created by "rear mkrescue"  
whether or not LVM snapshots are excluded therein.

According to the code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220\_lvm\_layout.sh

    {
    ...
        lvm lvs --separator=':' --noheadings --units b --nosuffix -o $lvs_fields | sort -n -t ':' -k 4 | while read line ; do
    ...
            origin="$( echo "$line" | awk -F ':' '{ print $1 }' )"
            # Skip snapshots (useless) or caches (dont know how to handle that)
            if test "$origin" ; then
                echo "# Skipped snapshot or cache information '$line'"
                continue
            fi
    ...
    } 1>>$DISKLAYOUT_FILE

for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220\_lvm\_layout.sh\#L266](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/220_lvm_layout.sh#L266)  
LVM snapshots should get hardcoded excluded  
from var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
and you should get comments of the form

    # Skipped snapshot or cache information '...'

in your var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
that show what LVM snapshots are excluded.
