@gozora likes to implement a new kind of "backup" method:

<pre>
BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE
</pre>

It is not an usual file-based backup/restore method.

This new kind of "backup" method does not work  
on files but on whole disk partitions, see  
[https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block\_clone](https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block_clone)

It is a prerequirement for NTFS support

@gdha  
I added you as assignee because I like to know  
what you think about it.

In general I like it when ReaR is enhanced so that it is  
useful also in non-standard environments.

As far as I understand @schlomo in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078\#issuecomment-262832981](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-262832981)  
I think he agrees to have a backup method  
that can take care of all the non-Linux stuff.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158\#issuecomment-271826895](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1158#issuecomment-271826895)  
"It is working piece of code currently"  
so that from my point of view (we are directly after ReaR 2.0 release)  
[https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block\_clone](https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block_clone)  
should be "just merged" now (the sooner the better)  
so that other users can test it with the  
current GitHub master code.

@gozora  
I assume your BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE implementation  
works strictly separated from other currently working stuff in ReaR  
so that no regressions are expected for currently working stuff.

Some initial notes on your  
[https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block\_clone](https://github.com/gozora/rear/tree/block_clone)

It looks as if BLOCKCLONE\_SOURCE\_DEV  
can currently contain only a single block device node  
which means BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE is currently  
limited to a single disk (or a single partition?).

I wonder if BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE should be  
enhanced to also work on multiple disks  
(or multiple partitions on multiple disks?)  
or if this is not needed because via multiple backups  
with multiple config files one can get the same result?

I fail to understand from the comments in default.conf  
if BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE is meant to work on a whole disk  
(i.e. for all partitions on that disk) or if it is meant to work  
for a single whole partition on a disk that could contain  
also several other partitions?

In other words:

If one has one disk /dev/sda  
with /dev/sda1 an ext4 Linux partition  
and /dev/sda2 a NTFS Windows partition  
how is then BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE  
meant to be used?

If one has two disks /dev/sda and /dev/sdb  
with /dev/sda1 an ext4 Linux partition  
and /dev/sdb1 a NTFS Windows partition  
how is then BACKUP=BLOCKCLONE  
meant to be used?

Hello @jsmeix,  
First of all thanks for checking!

This is correct, if user wants to backup multiple partitions, I've fully
relied on multiple backups feature.  
In my scenario I've backed up windows which resided on 2 partitions as
follows:

    rear -C windows_boot mkbackuponly
    rear -C windows_data mkbackuponly

Where BLOCKCLONE\_SOURCE\_DEV for *windows\_boot* was /dev/sda1 and for
*windows\_data* /dev/sda2.

It doesn't matter if you set whole disk or partition for backup. One of
BLOCKCONE tools is `dd` so in theory you can backup image of whole disk
if you like.

You will ignore /dev/sda1 as most probably it will be subject of
standard ReaR backup method like NETFS and you use separate config file
for /dev/sda2 similar to my *windows\_data* example above.

Maybe you can check
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078\#issuecomment-264712525](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-264712525)
. There is my initial configuration described.

I'll provide you configuration for two disks scenario later today.

@jsmeix sorry I've messed up!  
The comet listed earlier is for two disk scenario.

This
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078\#issuecomment-266287176](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1078#issuecomment-266287176)
should be for window/linux sharing same disk

Sorry for that!

Could you describe those two main use cases  
in a preliminary documentation document  
(or for now only in default.conf - as you like)  
so that interested users have initial example configs?

100% yes, writing documentation is planned for this week, hope I can
make it.  
Once I have it, I'll create pull request against upstream ReaR so you
can decide its next destiny.

Happy to hear that @jsmeix !

BTW, do you know about other users than @danboid who would be interested
in backing up "exotic" filesystems ?

Currently I don't know about other users - and in particular  
I myself do not use Windows or other "exotic" systems ;-)

I'm advocate of "three windows R" policy:

1.  Retry
2.  Reboot
3.  Reinstall

But this was a nice challenge, so I took it ;-)
