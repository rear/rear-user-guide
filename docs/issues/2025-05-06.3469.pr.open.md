-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/global-functions.sh  
for the umount\_mountpoint\_retry\_lazy function  
add a comment that shows an example  
why enforced umount raises its own specific troubles:  
Enforced umount may corrupt data  
when it disrupts a writing process, e.g. see  
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7878707/how-to-unmount-a-busy-device>  
which reads (excerpts)

    umount -l /PATH/OF/BUSY-DEVICE
    umount -f /PATH/OF/BUSY-NFS
    ...
    NOTE/CAUTION
    These commands can disrupt a running process,
    cause data loss OR corrupt open files.
    Programs accessing target DEVICE/NFS files
    may throw errors OR could not work properly
    after force unmount.

@jsmeix Thank you Johannes for the updated comments - makes it much
clearer. However, wait with the merge until I'm done with my umount
function.
