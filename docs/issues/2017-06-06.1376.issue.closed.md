So I'm running into the "Filesystem for device '/dev/sdXN' could not be
found' issue that I'm seeing reported by a few other users but thus-far
I can't seem to figure out why or how to fix it.

Steps that I'm using:

1.  Attach USB drive and run `rear format /dev/sdb` (log not attached as
    this is completing without issue).
2.  Build the rescue image and send it to the USB drive using
    `rear -v -d -D mkrescue` since I use Bareos for backup.

I've tried adding `sleep 10` to the `850_make_USB_bootable.sh` script
both before and after it tries to parse the filesystem type from
`/proc/mounts` and I see the drive mounted during those sleep periods
and can parse the type using the same grep command from another ssh
session.

However, for some reason the script is unable to.

@bingham-ctx  
only an offhanded (and untested) idea:

Can you replace the sophisticated Perl regular expression

<pre>
grep -E "^($USB_DEVICE|$REAL_USB_DEVICE)\\s"
</pre>

in the 850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh script by something simpler  
e.g. a simple native grep extended regular expression like

<pre>
grep -E "^$USB_DEVICE |^$REAL_USB_DEVICE "
</pre>

and try out if that makes it work?

FYI:  
one may like to use more sophisticated syntax for the space  
character in the grep extended regular expression but  
I think that won't help in the end because the subsequent

<pre>
cut -d' ' -f3
</pre>

requires single space as delimter - otherwise it results:

<pre>
# echo 'foo  bar  baz' | cut -d' ' -f3
bar
</pre>

@phracek

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh
</pre>

tells me that you replaced 'grep -P' with 'grep -E' via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c0eaef1a3afb4ec9d5981b9501ff7c1c9edc8fce](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c0eaef1a3afb4ec9d5981b9501ff7c1c9edc8fce)

Can you tell more about that change and the  
reasoning behind?

In particular why 'grep -P' was replaced with 'grep -E'  
but the sophisticated Perl regular expression is still used?

@jsmeix  
Your suggestion to change `850_make_USB_bootable.sh` to use the grep
extended regex yielded a successful execution of the `mkrescue` command.
The debug log for the mkresuce is attached.
[rear-devlamp2.log.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1059364/rear-devlamp2.log.txt)

Still trying to confirm that the resulting USB drive is usable. Most of
my systems are VMware VMs and getting them to boot to a USB is proving
more difficult than I expected.

By a very quick initial search only via

<pre>
find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ | xargs grep 'grep.*\\s'
</pre>

I found the following cases of grep with Perl regular expressions

<pre>
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_autoexclude_usb.sh:
        local usb_mntpt=$(grep -E "^$REAL_USB_DEVICE\s" /proc/mounts | cut -d" " -f2 | tail -1)

usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh:
usb_filesystem=$(grep -E "^($USB_DEVICE|$REAL_USB_DEVICE)\\s" /proc/mounts | cut -d' ' -f3 | tail -1)

usr/share/rear/prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_check_usb_disk.sh:
StopIfError "USB device '$USB_DEVICE' is already mounted on $(grep -E "^$REAL_USB_DEVICE\\s" /proc/mounts | cut -d' '
 -f2 |tail -1)"
</pre>

but there are probably much more...

@bingham-ctx  
regarding VMware VMs and getting them to boot to a USB:  
This is a separated issue and I would like to not mix up  
that separated issue with this issue here.  
For each separated issue open a separated GitHub issue.  
But I think making VMware VMs to boot to a USB  
is not a ReaR issue.

I also found this grep with Perl regular expression in  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh

<pre>
function get_usb_syslinux_version {
    for file in $BUILD_DIR/outputfs/{boot/syslinux,}/{ld,ext}linux.sys; do
        if [[ -s "$file" ]];  then
            strings $file | grep -E -m1 "^(EXT|SYS)LINUX \\d+.\\d+" | cut -d' ' -f2
            return 0
        fi
    done
    return 1
}
</pre>

but currently I don't know how to fix it properly  
because I don't know enough about the context.

@gdha

<pre>
git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
</pre>

tells that you replaced here the grep -P with grep -E via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a7e001ef10f3a3dd95247ac8954097c270aeda26](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a7e001ef10f3a3dd95247ac8954097c270aeda26)  
which also lists several other places where  
grep with Perl regular expression is used.  
The reason was
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/565](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/565)  
Could you have a look at those code places and  
try to replace Perl regular expressions with  
native grep (extended) regular expressions?

According to how I understand the Red Hat issue

<pre>
SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/grep from using
the 'execmem' accesses on a process.
</pre>

[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1079534\#c8](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1079534#c8)  
and  
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1079534\#c15](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1079534#c15)

<pre>
This comes from pcre
...
Just observing that grep doesn't use PROT_EXEC in mmap(),
but libpcre does.
</pre>

plain replacing 'grep -P' with 'grep -E' does not fix anything  
unless also the regular expression is converted from  
a Perl regular expression into a native grep (extended)  
regular expression.

@jsmeix, regarding your comment about USB & VM boot... yeah. I agree
that the USB/VM issue is a separate issue and likely not an issue with
ReaR. I only brought it up because I'm still trying to test the built
USB since the suggested change. Apologies for any confusion or
implication that I was clouding this issue. I'll continue testing that
issue and will open another issue if I feel I've sufficiently eliminated
other potential causes.

Still trying to get a bare metal test box that I can use to test the
whole shebang (`rear format`, `rear mkrescue`, and boot to USB followed
by Bareos recovery) after the suggested modification.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1378](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1378)
merged  
some perl regexp should now be fixed  
but others still need to be checked and also fixed,

@gdha  
cloud you please have a look here - if time permits.  
Perhaps something more could be fixed for ReaR v 2.2.  
But if not could you postpone it to ReaR v 2.3?
