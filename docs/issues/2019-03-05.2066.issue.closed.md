Hello ,  
Im stuck trying to exclude directories (not whole filesystems) from one
of our backup media servers, I need that in order to get the iso file
smaller, so I put into my local.conf :  
`BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/usr/openv/netbackup/client/*' '/usr/openv/pack/*' '/usr/openv/logs/*' )`

But when I launch rear I get that output :

    2019-03-05 12:20:24 Files being excluded: dev/shm dev/oracleasm dev/.udev dev/shm/* /etc/pki/tls/private /etc/pki/CA/private /etc/pki/nssdb/key*.db /us /openv/netbackup/bin/xbp

So it seems like he is not excluding the sub-folders

Not sure if its related but /usr/openv is a filesystem mount

    root@DELZP042-PRO:/root# df -Ph /usr/openv/ 
    Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on 
    /dev/mapper/vg00-lv_nbu   20G  6.9G   12G  37% /usr/openv

My local.conf :

I do not use NBU (Symantec/Veritas NetBackup)  
because I do not have any kind of proprietary software  
like third-party backup tools but I assume  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE is not supported for BACKUP=NBU  
because this are the only ReaR scripts that use BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE

    # find usr/share/rear -name '*.sh' | xargs grep -l "BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE"
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/320_autoexclude.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/TSM/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/YUM/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh

See the `BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION` section in `man rear`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)

See also usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf (excerpts)

    # Internal BACKUP stuff
    ##
    # These settings apply to all cases of internal Relax-and-Recover backup
    ...
    # BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE is an array of strings that get written into a backup-exclude.txt file
    # that is used e.g. in 'tar -X backup-exclude.txt' to get things excluded from the backup.

but you do not use a ReaR internal backup method but  
the third-party `BACKUP=NBU` method, see also the section about  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Hello, thanks for the reply, I realized here I have a defined variables
with the paths :

    root@DELZP042-PRO:/root# grep -Ri logs /usr/share/rear/* \| grep NBU 
    /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NBU=( "/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/*" "/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpjava*" "/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/xbp" '/usr/openv/netbackup/client/*' '/usr/openv/pack/*'  )
    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/RHEL6-NETFS-of-NBU-master-example.conf:BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/usr/openv/tmp/*' '/nbu/logs/openv/logs/nbdisco/*' '/nbu/logs/openv/logs/nbsvcmon/*' '/nbu/lo gs/openv/logs/nbrmms/*' '/nbu/logs/openv/logs/nbsl/*' ) 

So I have edited this file the `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` and I
placed the directories I wanted to exclude, now it seems to be working .

May I ask if I can append those directories from my os.conf or my
local.conf in some way since I understand the file
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf is not supposed to be modified

If you add these variables in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file then they
will over-rule the ones defined in the default.conf file

I realize that syntax is bash ?? Its an asociative array ?? If I do in
my local.conf

    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NBU=( ${COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_NBU[@]}  "/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/*" "/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpjava*" "/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/xbp" '/usr/openv/netbackup/client/*' '/usr/openv/pack/*'  )

I understand it will work as expected

@flechoide  
basically all in ReaR is bash, also config files  
are sourced and executed as bash scipts.

Normally ReaR does not use associative arrays - only indexed arrays.  
But I know nothing about how NBU stuff is implemented in ReaR.

In general `COPY_AS_IS` variables mean totally different things  
than backup related stuff - but I know nothing about NBU and  
how NBU stuff is implemented in ReaR.

Ok, I understand, I thank you all for the help, finally I was able to
implement the backup and it worked as expected with the
COPY\_AS\_IS\_EXCLUDE\_NBU variable into the local.conf file from
/etc/rear .

Please the case can be closed
