Some context - Packit builds were configured in PR \#2145 , and this was
a long time ago, so contributors may have forgotten what it is. Packit
is a service which does automatic rebuilds of RPMs from the GitHub Git
sources. If enabled on PRs, it can serve as a CI (to ensure that the
change does not break the build and also optionally run some tests).

The original PR \#2145 mentions that " the main packit task is to update
Fedora package with the latest upstream releases", but this part has not
been configured here. This addresses the concern arising back then about
"building a released ReaR version versus building our current (possibly
unstable work-in-progress) upstream master code" - we are not going to
blindly sync the upstream master branch to Fedora, don't worry.

You may notice that there is no build information about any build or
test made by Packit attached to this PR. That's because the
Packit-as-a-service application that performs the builds triggered by
any PRs has not been enabled on the ReaR repo. I'll enable it shortly
(unless there is an objection from @rear/contributors) - without it, the
Packit configuration is not really useful. (What actually happened is
that without the builds enabled, the Fedora build stopped working as the
spec file bitrot - that's the reason for one of the commits which adds
BuildRequires. The PR is a bit misnamed since the added requirement to
spec file is not just for Packit - it is for any Fedora build, Packit is
merely a build service that exposes the problem.)

For now, until the service is enabled, the linked PRs in @antonvoznia 's
repo show how will a successful build and a failing build look like.

One may note that this PR does not touch anything Packit-specific.
That's right - packit has been configured already, so this PR fixes and
then enhances (by adding the `%check` section to run `make validate`)
the spec file that can be used to build Fedora packages anywhere (not
just in Packit).

@jsmeix can you please verify that the change does not break
openSUSE/SLES builds, as the same spec file is used for them and for
Fedora? Maybe Packit could be used to test builds for openSUSE as well,
since in COPR (the build service used by Packit) I see the possibility
of building in these buildroots:  
`opensuse-leap-15.2-aarch64 opensuse-leap-15.2-x86_64 opensuse-leap-15.3-aarch64 opensuse-leap-15.3-x86_64 opensuse-tumbleweed-aarch64 opensuse-tumbleweed-i586 opensuse-tumbleweed-ppc64le opensuse-tumbleweed-x86_64`.
Would any of them be useful?

@pcahyna  
normally the openSUSE Build Service should "just build" anything  
with a regular RPM spec file so with a `%check` section that calls  
something in a "normal" way the package should still "just build".  
If not we can further adapt things as needed.

@jsmeix I think it will be useful if Packit builds also RPMs for
openSUSE if it is able to. This way we will know immediately when the
builds start failing. As I am not familiar with openSUSE versioning and
requirements, which builds among opensuse-leap-15.2-aarch64
opensuse-leap-15.2-x86\_64 opensuse-leap-15.3-aarch64
opensuse-leap-15.3-x86\_64 opensuse-tumbleweed-aarch64
opensuse-tumbleweed-i586 opensuse-tumbleweed-ppc64le
opensuse-tumbleweed-x86\_64 should I enable?

I would like to enable Packit on the repository so that the
configuration is actually useful. But it looks that only organization
owners can do this. @gdha could you please enable it according to the
instructions in

@pcahyna  
I think to only see when the builds start failing  
it should be sufficient to let it build only on  
opensuse-leap-15.3-x86\_64 and  
opensuse-tumbleweed-x86\_64

My reasoning:  
The openSUSE Leap base system is inherited from  
SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (SLE15)  
so the openSUSE Leap base system is rather traditional.  
In contrast openSUSE Tumbleweed is a rolling release  
of more or less the latest available software versions.  
Because ReaR is only bash scripts building should not depend  
on hardware architectures so I think only x86\_64 is sufficient.

On the other hand to provide binary RPM packages  
which openSUSE users can install with `rpm` on their systems  
one may have to build it for all available openSUSE systems  
(regardless that ReaR is only bash scripts).  
The reason is that different `rpm` versions in different  
openSUSE versions may produce different binary RPM packages  
so whether or not a binary RPM package can be installed  
on an openSUSE version can depend on which openSUSE version  
the binary RPM package was built.  
For example RPM's internal data compression method may differ  
so a binary RPM package that was built on a newer openSUSE version  
could not be installed with `rpm` on an older openSUSE version  
(because an older `rpm` may not support a new compression method).

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819)  
I added the changes of this pull request there via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/87ddeeaed6f225005ae19998fece6f1d5366eda6](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819/commits/87ddeeaed6f225005ae19998fece6f1d5366eda6)  
and now the automated Packit build test works there!

So
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819)  
may obsolete this pull request here  
in particluar because there is a comment  
in packaging/rpm/rear.spec why that  
`BuildRequires: make` is there ;-)

@jsmeix indeed, Packit builds now work, I have triggered a rebuild on
this PR manually. Thank you @gdha for enabling Packit on the repository!

(Now until the spec is fixed (this PR or
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2819)),
future PRs will trigger a failing Fedora RPM rebuild.)

The comment is not entirely correct: any Fedora build now requires a
build dependency on `make`, Packit merely exposes the problem.  
Anyway, I don't think that an explanation of this dependency is needed.
The build uses `make` so it is natural that it needs `make`, which is
expressed as a build dependency. It was merely an "accident" that older
versions of Fedora had `make` always installed in the buildroot and
therefore an explicit dependency was not needed.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your explanation why `BuildRequires: make`  
is a generic thing so no specific comment is needed here.
