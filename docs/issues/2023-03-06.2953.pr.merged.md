I think this needs to be done only if DEBUG is set, at least until the
actual problems are solved. Otherwise it will scare users. (I mean
specifically the \`LogPrintError statement.)

And maybe give it 999 (to make clear that it should run at the very
end)?

I avoid ultimate range boundary numbers like 001 and 999  
because there might something appear in the future  
that needs to be done at the very very beginning  
or at the very very end.

One small note: would it make sense to refer to `prep/README` also in
the error message?

Currently this is only an initial first step.  
As long as the actual problems are not solved  
only a normal info message is shown in debug modes  
that must not scare users who use our current  
work in progress GitHub master code.

No objections, please go ahead.

About user who use ReaR from Git master: I actually would like show the
info to exactly those users. They surely don't expect a stable product
(our last release is stable) and will have to accept that our master is
also changing and evolving, and that things are changing.

With that, I believe it to be much more important to create strong
visibility rather than hiding this.

I actually plan to simply move the code from prep to rescue that
modifies the rescue image, andI believe that the risk of doing so is
manageable.

I close this one as "fixed/solved/done" because  
the current intent of this pull request is done, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2953\#issuecomment-1457779482](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2953#issuecomment-1457779482)

Further enhancements after the actual problems got solved  
will happen via separated subsequent pull requests as needed.

I actually disagree with this reasoning. If I am using ReaR master
branch from GitHub, and I see a new error message like this, I will
assume it is a regression. But it is not a regression, we just started
to detect a problematic condition that has existed for a long time. So
the message is confusing.

IOW: why do we, developers want to create strong visibility for problems
that are detected by internal checks? Because we want users to report
them. But in this case, we already know about the problem, so reporting
it will be useless (and will only waste our and the reporter's time).

I agree with making the problem visible, but only after solving it for
known problematic cases, so that "typical" user of the development code
will not encounter this unless the problem is reintroduced.

I had it in my mind all the time  
but I forgot to tell it here:

After the actual problems got solved  
it will become a BugError() when  
at the end of the 'prep' stage ROOTFS\_DIR is modified  
(i.e. when ROOTFS\_DIR is not still empty)  
because that is a bug in our ReaR code.

This issue does not belong to normal users because  
there is nothing what a user could normally do when  
at the end of the 'prep' stage ROOTFS\_DIR is modified  
(except fixing the ReaR scripts but this is not what we expect  
that users should normally do for us - which does of course  
not mean that we do not appreciate bugfix contributions from users).

I think therein you actually meant

    ... so that "typical" user of the development code
    will NOT [instead of "it"] encounter this
    unless the problem is reintroduced

@jsmeix yes, sorry for making a typo that inverted the meaning of what I
