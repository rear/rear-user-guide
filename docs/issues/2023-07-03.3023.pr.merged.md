Follow up fix for issue \#3018

After the excludes have been fixed tests with more recent sesam client
verisons have shown that the service fails to startup during recovery
image boot due to missing semaphore files. Removing the sesam work
directory where those information is stored from the excludes solves
this problem.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge this trivial fix today afternoon  
unless furious and scaring objections appear ;-)
