@gdha  
I fixed non-ASCII characters in doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
and I would like that you have a look.

If it is o.k. for you I think it should be merged soon  
so that you could further work on doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
for the 1.19 release.

@jsmeix Be aware that **release-notes.txt** is pulled from the web (via
w3m - see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process))
- I never edit this file directly. If there are non-ASCII charecters
then we should fix this in
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-1-19.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-1-19.md)

Damn!  
I did all my changes in vain :-(

Got one step further:

According to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
only

<pre>
w3m -dump -cols 78 http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-1-19 >rear-release-notes.txt
</pre>

is insufficient and you can get arbitrary encoding in the w3m output  
depending on your current locale settings and on undocumented  
black magic in w3m.  
E.g. for me:

<pre>
export LC_ALL=POSIX
export LANG=POSIX
w3m -dump -cols 78 http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-1-19 >rear-release-notes.txt
file rear-release-notes.txt
rear-release-notes.txt: UTF-8 Unicode English text
</pre>

One needs to actively convert the w3m output into the  
desired encoding:

<pre>
export LC_ALL=POSIX
export LANG=POSIX
w3m -dump -cols 78 http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-1-19 | iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT -o rear-release-notes.txt
file rear-release-notes.txt
rear-release-notes.txt: ASCII English text
</pre>

But now one gets in rear-release-notes.txt things like

<pre>
  o Integrates with internal backup solutions such as:
      ? GNU tar (BACKUP=NETFS, BACKUP_PROG=tar)
 </pre>

so that one additionally has to replace the '?' mark  
with a reasonable ASCI character e.g.:

<pre>
w3m -dump -cols 78 http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-1-19 | iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT | sed -e 's/^      ? /      - /' >rear-release-notes.txt
</pre>
