-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I am testing BMR for Linux in a virtual environment.  
We are using Rubrik CDM for backup and recovery.  
I was able to =generate ISO and backup the ISO using Rubrik and
successfully downloaded it.

Later tried booting the ISO as a NEW VM and tried to boot the same VM
using ISO but it does not bot just stuck and gives me black screen.  
Could someone advise ow to successfully boot the ISO in a vcenter env?

-   Workaround, if any:
