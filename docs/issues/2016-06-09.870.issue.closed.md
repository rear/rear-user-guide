BTW: Adding

the live rescue system on the USB device, because the backup options are
used there as well.)

I assign it to me because it is about SUSE  
regardless that I am not at all a NFS expert.

Regarding "failed to run /usr/sbin/sm-notify":

@GCChelp  
please check if /usr/sbin/sm-notify exists in the  
rear recovery system.

You can add missing things for rpc.statd to the rear  
recovery system via things like

<pre>
REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" prog1 prog2 )
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /path1/file1 /path2/file2 )
</pre>

in /etc/rear/local conf - cf.  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf

This way it should be possible to make rpc.statd  
working in the rear recovery system.

Regarding "BACKUP\_OPTIONS ... prevents the creation of the live rescue
system on the USB device":

I submitted a speparated issue

@jsmeix  
Thanks for the quick response!

Yes, sm-notify is missing in the recovery system. I manually fumbled it
into the initrd with cpio, but your advice using the configuration
setting is much more straight forward.

I will try the REQUIRED\_PROGS variable and let you know.

I like that you test if it also works for you when you  
set a non-empty dummy OUTPUT\_OPTIONS  
in your case something like

<pre>
OUTPUT=USB
USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_URL=nfs://nfsserver/backups/rear
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
OUTPUT_OPTIONS="nodiratime"
</pre>

To see only how things are mounted run

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

and afterwards grep for 'mount\_url' in the rear log file.

@jsmeix  
Manually adding sm-notify with the REQUIRED\_PROGS variable worked. At
least it worked so far that sm-notify is now contained in the rescue
system file system.

Nevertheless, recover still fails with

Adding  
`BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"`  
to site.conf changes nothing.

Regarding your dummy OUTPUT\_OPTIONS suggestion, I will try this too and
post the results.

It could become a lengthy step by step process  
with some trial an error until you have all you need  
in the recovery system so that rpc.statd can run there.

The "No such file or directory" messages indicate that  
you need to add more programs and/or files to  
REQUIRED\_PROGS and/or COPY\_AS\_IS  
to get all needed pieces for rpc.statd into the  
recovery system.

Additionally and/or alternatively you might have to adapt  
the rpc.statd setup (i.e. its configuration files and/or the  
command line options how it is started) to get it running  
within the limited possibilities of the recovery system.

Bottom line:  
Currently the default rear recovery system  
does not well support running rpc.statd therein  
(sometimes it works sometimes not)

@jsmeix  
I just noticed that on my workstations with openSUSE 13.1 rpc.statd is
running with the --no-notify option:

> ps -elf | grep rpc.statd | grep -v grep

> 5 S statd 1733 1 0 80 0 - 9020 core\_s 11:45 ? 00:00:00

Unfortunately, this option is not derived from a configuration file, but
is hardcoded in the startup script...

Could this be useful in ReaR rescue system as well? How could this be
done?

This was not the kind of 'support' I meant. In fact, this page led me to
this GitHub repo and I signed up just for Rear.  
I was rather referring to e.g.
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)
, where an official stable release is offered for openSUSE 13.1, amongst
others...

Wow interesting and comprehensive article. Thanks for the link!
Nevertheless, I will need some more time to go through this extensive
stuff.

I already made some of those steps...  
By explicitly adding some more entries I came a bit further:  
`COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" /var/lib/nfs/sm /var/lib/nfs/sm.bak /var/lib/nfs/state )`

Now, rpc.statd still complains

> rpc.statd: Failed to open /proc/sys/fs/nfs/nsm\_local\_state: No such
> file or directory

The man page of sm-notify states that /var/lib/nfs/state is the NSM
state number and /proc/sys/fs/nfs/nsm\_local\_state is the kernel's copy
of the NSM state number.  
But there even isn't a /proc/sys/fs/nfs/ directory in the rescue system.
As this is a virtual file system, it does not work to copy it over with
COPY\_AS\_IS ...

Any ideas how we could get this into the rescue kernel?

> Any ideas how we could get this into the rescue kernel?

Seems to come with the lockd kernel module. It even is available in the
rescue system and I can load it with modprobe . After loading it,
/proc/sys/fs/nfs/nsm\_local\_state is present!

How can I configure ReaR such that the lockd kernel module gets loaded
automatically?

I think we need a proper NFS prep script to cover the dependencies (with
NFSv4 there are more daemons and alike we need in the rescue image).  
@GCChelp `LOAD_MODULES=( ${LOAD_MODULES[@]} lockd )` would do the trick

@gdha  
Unfortunately not.  
Neither  
`LOAD_MODULES=( ${LOAD_MODULES[@]} lockd )`  
nor  
`LOAD_MODULES=( "${LOAD_MODULES[@]}" lockd )`  
worked. The module doesn't get loaded automatically.  
Whereas I can manually do this with `modprobe lockd` without any
problem.

Is there anything I can check to find out what's (going) wrong?

nowhere in the rear sources I find "LOAD\_MODULES".

@jsmeix  
Thanks for the clarification!  
Unfortunately, the MODULES\_LOAD variant doesn't work either. :-(

The lockd module is present and can be loaded manually. But it does not
get loaded automatically.

I created the rescue media with debugging output, but didn't find a
problem in the log. Nor did I find anything related in dmesg output
after booting the rescue media.

Any hints where I can find enlightenment or what specifically I should
search for?

I like to get a summary of your current state:

Please post your complete /etc/rear/local.conf file.

Additionally post what exact comands you have to run  
manually in the recovery system so that afterwards  
"rear recover" works successfully for you.

Finally I like to know what kind of system your NFS server is.  
Only a blind guess: Perhaps there is something special  
with your NFS server that leads to those isssues?

Then I can try to reproduce it (but do not expect too much

I never claimed that "rear recover" was working... It still fails with  
`ERROR: Could not start rpc.statd !`

It's a Hitachi HNAS 4080 high performance storage system. We mount the
NFS file systems via plain NFS3 protocol and it's working like a charm
together with dozens of openSUSE workstations and SLES servers (plus
machines with SGI/Irix).

This is what one of the NFS mounts look like in the running system:

    # mount | grep :/home

    nfsserver:/home on /home type nfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,vers=3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=155.250.43.213,mountvers=3,mountport=4048,mountproto=tcp,local_lock=none,addr=155.250.43.213)

We use TCP for NFS. I tried to mount a filesystem with "proto=udp"
instead: works fine as well.

My NFS server is an openSUSE Leap 42.1 system  
(which is also the virtualization host for  
that openSUSE 13.1 virtual machine)  
with this /etc/exports

<pre>
/nfs    *(rw,no_root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
</pre>

For my general testing setup  
see "First steps with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I think this particular isue here is something special  
otherwise there should be other user reports like this.

I feel there is very little what I can really do here  
because I think a NFS expert and/or a RPC expert  
is needed to further analyze it.

What I can do is basically only blind guesswork.

I do not have it in my recovery system

But nevertheless, I can manually mount the NFS file system, if I do it
without locking:  
`# mount -o nolock nfsserver:/backups /mnt`

And it looks very much like your mount output from above, only IP
addresses and \[rw\]size differ!

@GCChelp

in your initial comment

but in your later comment

I never claimed that "rear recover" was working... It still fails with
ERROR: Could not start rpc.statd !
</pre>

and now you wrote

<pre>
I can manually mount the NFS file system
</pre>

I am confused.

When you can manually mount the NFS file system  
withut a running rpc.stad then it matches your  
initial comment that "ln -s /bin/true /bin/rpc.statd"  
should help to get "rear recover" working.

Or in other words:

When you can manually mount the NFS file system  
withut a running rpc.stad then it should help  
to simply disable the currently hardcoded  
error exit if it "Could not start rpc.statd !".

The "Could not start rpc.statd !" is only in  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/05\_start\_required\_daemons.sh

<pre>
        rpc.statd
        StopIfError "Could not start rpc.statd !"
</pre>

and if you change that to something like

<pre>
        rpc.statd
        LogPrintIfError "Could not start rpc.statd !"
</pre>

it would only log the error message to the rear log file  
and additionally print the error message on the terminal  
but  
it would no longer abort at that error.

Does then "rear recover" work for you?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/891](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/891)  
it is no longer fatal when RPC status rpc.statd is unavailable  
so that it does no longer error out with  
"Could not start rpc.statd !"

Instead it now only shows a message like  
"RPC status rpc.statd unavailable  
(you may have to mount NFS without locking 'nolock')."

@GCChelp  
please test it it works better for you with  
the current rear GitHub master code.

@jsmeix  
Trying to catch up some loose ends here...

For completeness sake: I repeated my experiments with an NFS server
based on openSUSE 13.1.  
Same results. Non of the problems seem to be related to the special NFS
server.

> I am confused.

Sorry to confuse you. ;-)  
I meant it did not yet work for me the automated way. And not to
success.  
My manual workarounds only led me one step further.

But even with them I don't get a working system with "rear recover": It
runs and finishes. But when I try to boot the recovered system, it fails
because GRUB 2 is not configured correctly. That doesn't really surprise
me, because we are still using GRUB 1 (legacy)... But I suspect, this
would be substance for another (new) issue?

Yes, with this workaround "rear recover" runs successful!  
(Finally leading to an unbootable machine, see above...)

And with this workaround I even no longer need any definition of
REQUIRED\_PROGS, COPY\_AS\_IS and MODULES\_LOAD in my configuration!

When I can manually mount the NFS file system with "-o nolock", why
can't rear do this when I define  
`BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"`  
in site.conf?

@GCChelp

Regarding GRUB 2 versus GRUB legacy:  
Please submit a new separated issue.  
Again post your /etc/rear/local.conf file in the new issue.  
Do "rear -d -D recover" and afterwards when you are  
still within in the recovery system get the rear log file  
out of the recovery system, see  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover (rear)" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
Then inspect the rear log file for messages which could be  
of interest reagrding the incorrect bootloader setup and  
post those log messages in your new separated issue.

Regarding

<pre>
    rpc.statd
    LogPrintIfError "Could not start rpc.statd !"
with this workaround "rear recover" runs successful
</pre>

This means that
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/891](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/891)  
avoids this particular issue here.  
Accordingly I close this issue here as "fixed"  
(actually it is "avoided").

Regarding

<pre>
When I can manually mount the NFS file system with "-o nolock",
why can't rear do this when I define
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
</pre>

"rear recover" did not reach the point where it would mount  
the NFS file system because it aborted when "rpc.statd"  
failed to run.  
Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/891](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/891)
it is no longer  
fatal when "rpc.statd" fails to run so that "rear recover"  
can proceed to mount the NFS file system and then  
it does it with the BACKUP\_OPTIONS (at least for me)  
see my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/870\#issuecomment-225876504](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/870#issuecomment-225876504)

<pre>
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
...
In my "rear -d -D recover" log file the NFS mount comand is
