### My use case

Based on skimming a few of the issues in this forum I suppose that the
most of the folks submitting issues for “rear” are sophisticated Linux
users, probably developers, who like solving thorny technical problems.
I am a novice Linux user who prefers to avoid dealing with technical
problems.

I have one particular need I would like your help with: I want to clone
my installation of GalliumOS [A fast and lightweight Linux distro for
ChromeOS devices.](https://galliumos.org/) on a Acer C720 to a second
(different) Acer C720.

In other words, I want to avoid having to spend a few hours
reconfiguring a fresh installation of Gallium OS so that it is
customized to my taste. That’s it. In other words, I am **not** a Linux
sys admin responsible for a complex heterogeneous network. I have
already perused the web for a few hours. I found pages such as the
following: [Easiest way to move complete linux install from one SSD to
another?](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/37uoya/easiest_way_to_move_complete_linux_install_from/).
But I still haven't implemented an effective, let alone elegant,
solution.

I tried “dd”, Clonezilla, and Redo Backup and Recovery. “dd” sort of
worked but not quite. I used “dd” to clone the SSD from the first Acer
C720 to a USB stick. I then inserted the USB stick into a second
(different) Acer C720. I then used “dd” to clone the data from the USB
stick to the SSD of the second Acer C720. I then restarted the second
Acer C720. It worked fairly well. I was actually pleasantly surprised
initially. But I experienced too much glitchy behavior that would likely
become very annoying if I were to need to deal with it on a day-to-day
basis. As for Clonezilla and [Redo Backup and
Recovery](http://redobackup.org/), I failed to create a backup with both
of them.

Frankly, I would ideally like to find an application that works like
[UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.github.io/) in reverse and in particular
(not like UNetbootin which, for the sake of this analogy, works sort of
forward and in general) which has a very simple graphical user
interface. But I don't mind copying and pasting a set of straightforward
commands into a Terminal.

For some reason `udevd` did not create the symbolic link to
`/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000` from your USB device. However, as a
work-around you could use `BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdc1` instead (if sdc1
is your USB device of course).

Thanks for your help.

I followed your instructions. As a work-around I used
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1 (because sdb1 is my USB device). Below are
the error messages I received this time:

Thanks for following up with me.

I have not knowingly install syslinux and syslinux-extlinux.

I did use Gparted to format my USB device and set the flag to boot.
Wouldn't that make my USB device bootable?

@Yekutiel Use `apt-get install syslinux` and `apt-get install extlinux`
before running rear. Within rear format the USB disk as
`rear format /dev/sdc` (where /dev/sdc is your USB disk - change this if
required)

Thanks again for your help. I successfully ran
`apt-get install syslinux` and `apt-get install extlinux`. That was
trivial except for realizing I needed to prepend `sudo`.

I guess maybe it might be helpful to others if that information were up
on
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

I was unsure what this means:

> Within rear

In a Terminal I entered `cd rear/` `rear format /dev/sdb` (my USB drive
is **sdB** which I verified by opening Gparted to check my drive names).
I also tried `rear format /dev/sdb` without changing to the rear
directory.

As I suppose you realize, neither seemed to work. I took a shot in the
dark... and apparently I missed.

I poked around a bit and noticed the following on my internal SSD
**/home/ken/rear/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/** but that seems to
contain information Rear uses, not an interface for a user to run.

By the way, I was able to boot from the USB drive to what appeared to be
the "standard Rear interface" I was hoping to see a menu choice that
said, "If you want to back up your entire internal drive to a removable
drive, choose this!"

I'm a novice who aspires to remain a novice in this domain yet back up
his entire SSD to a USB. Like most novices who are uninterested in
technical details, I want simple choices. If it takes 2 hours instead of
2 minutes for my SSD to back up to my USB that doesn't bother me much at
all. In this case I care about ease and effectiveness, not efficiency.

I hope I do not offend you by opining that I suppose Rear might become
very widely used by ordinary Linux users if it had a very easy way for
ordinary Linux users to back up their entire internal storage device to
a removable storage device. I suppose doing this on Rear might seem very
easy to you, but you are almost certainly not an ordinary Linux user. I
can imagine Rear adding a menu to Gparted that said something like:
"Disaster Recovery." Under that would be a choice: "Create a backup."
Then users would choose a source drive and a destination drive.

Sure, what I am proposing would be a very different project than Rear.
But it would be much for accessible for those of us non-technical Linux
users.
