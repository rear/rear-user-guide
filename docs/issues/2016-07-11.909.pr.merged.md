Tries to fix
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ec871676b7cdc52461574200c8a54867d0cfb37](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/0ec871676b7cdc52461574200c8a54867d0cfb37)  
by changing 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
so taht the code that always loads modules  
in /etc/modules is always run.

Now it works well for me.

In particulat I verified with the additional "debug" kernel  
command line parameter for the rear recovery system that  
now 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh runs the code  
that loads all modules in /etc/moidules.

I just merge it because I think it is now at least  
somewhat better than before (even if it is perhaps  
not yet fully perfect).

There is a small thing left where I don't know  
how it is actually meant to work:

At the end of 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
I left the "modprobe -q dm-mod" call as is  
which means this modprobe call is now also always  
done because it does no longer simply "return" in  
the "systemd-udevd case" but now it runs through  
to the end of the whole script:

<pre>
RESCUE f121:~ # lsmod | grep dm
dm_mod                110780  0 
</pre>

I only assume this modprobe call was also meant  
to be always done but I don't know.

git forensic via

<pre>
git log -p usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh
</pre>

shows that the unconditioned "modprobe -q dm-mod" call is there  
at the very end since 40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
was created (i.e. before the "systemd-udevd case" was  
added on top of it) which indicates that the "modprobe -q dm-mod"  
call is really meant to be done in any case (I assume when  
the "systemd-udevd case" was added on top of it it was  
forgotten to deal with the "modprobe -q dm-mod" call).

FYI:

<pre>
git blame -w usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh
</pre>

shows it was this git commit: 844d50b75ac4b7722f4fee7a5ee3350b93f3adb7

@schlomo  
many thanks for your question!

I think now I understand the reason for my confusion in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/626\#issuecomment-125125263](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/626#issuecomment-125125263)  
(excerpt)

<pre>
In gereral I noticed at that time that in the rear recovery system
I had more than 100 kernel modules loaded while in my original
system I had something about 40 kernel modules loaded.
From my point of view this indicates that there is something
wrong in general in the rear recovery system that it has much
more kernel modules loaded than in the original system...
</pre>

I don't know a mandatory reason why the explicitly specified modules  
must be loaded after the udev automatism.  
My change was only meant to get the explicitly specified modules  
loaded at all.  
I did not intend to change the odering of what happens when in  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh  
so that I simply added loading modules from /etc/modules  
below the already existing udev loading code.

But I could imagine a reason why the explicitly specified modules  
may sometimes have to be loaded after the udev automatism:

If the explicitly specified modules were loaded before the  
automated udev loading, the explicitly specified modules list  
(i.e. the MODULES\_LOAD array) may have to be  
"somewhat complete" which means it may need to specify  
all needed modules from the very beginning in the right ordering.

In contrast when the udev automatism runs first  
the basic stuff should be automatically loaded so that  
the MODULES\_LOAD array could contain only  
additionally needed modules.

I think in theory the module dependencies should  
always automatically load all needed modules from the  
very beginning in the right ordering  
but perhaps in practice some module dependencies  
are implemented only via udev rules nowadays?

Currently usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
is very terse about how MODULES\_LOAD is meant:

<pre>
# Enforce to load these modules in the given order in the rescue/recovery system:
MODULES_LOAD=()
</pre>

Currently it only means that MODULES\_LOAD=( foo bar )  
will load first 'foo' and then 'bar' but it does not tell  
if that also means that 'foo' will be the very first module  
that gets loaded in the rescue/recovery system.

I think to make MODULES\_LOAD really powerful  
its meaning should be that the modules that are  
specified therein will be the very first modules  
that get loaded in the rescue/recovery system.

Furthermore I would like to have a switch so that the  
user can - if needed - skip the automated udev module  
loading for example via a special module name like

<pre>
MODULES_LOAD=( 'foo' 'bar' 'skip_automated_udev_module_loading' )
</pre>

but this makes implementation a bit awkward because I  
would have to check everywhere for that special value.  
Perhaps I prefer a separated config variable to  
skip the automated udev module loading.

Because I think I know now the root cause why the loaded  
modules in the recovery system do not match the ones  
in the original system, I will fix it and clean it up and  
enhance it so that - if needed - the user has the final  
power to specify exactly what modules will be loaded  
in what ordering in the recovery system.

@jsmeix please wait with your effort till I am done with my changes in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/schlomo-2017-06](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/schlomo-2017-06)
(and feel free to look there and comment). Maybe you don't need to do
anything at all.

I already took out one sort which should fix the ordering.

In my experience modules auto-load their dependencies without problems.
In this example I had `mptspi` in the `MODULES_LOAD` array and it
auto-loaded all the other SCSI and MPT modules.

I would really prefer to keep things simple here. That means that we use
`MODULES_LOAD` to really mean **load these modules before anything else
in this order** which is my current implementation. This also most
closely reflects what the distros do with the modules inside their
initrd. They are also loaded before the main system comes up and loads
udev or systemd-udev. Therefore I don't see any need to make
`MODULES_LOAD` contain some magic before and after. And I for sure
wouldn't build that without a specific use case where our current code
does not work.

I am actually much more worried about us supporting
[systemd-modules-load.service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-modules-load.service.html)
properly. Do we start that? Does systemd start it when we copy it into
the rescue system? Unfortunately a quick look did not enlighten me on
these questions, our boot process is already too complex.

FYI, on my Ubuntu 17.04 `/etc/modules` is also loaded by
`systemd-modules-load` via a symlink:

    $ ll /etc/modules-load.d/
    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   58 Jun 15 17:48 ./
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4558 Jun 20 10:25 ../
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  119 MÃ¤r 21 19:36 cups-filters.conf
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   10 Apr 13 19:10 modules.conf -> ../modules

I am afraid I know basically nothing at all about  
systemd related things in the recovery system.

I fully agree to load the MODULES\_LOAD modules  
before anything else in this order.

I watch your changes in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/schlomo-2017-06](https://github.com/rear/rear/compare/schlomo-2017-06)  
and I am in particular happy how loading the specified  
modules first in any case makes the code simpler  
(no longer duplicated code) and better!

@schlomo  
I think in your  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh

<pre>
if ! grep -q $module_to_be_loaded $recovery_system_etc_modules ; then
</pre>

should be more specific to avoid that substrings match,  
e.g. think about module names like 'parport' and 'parport\_pc'.  
When 'parport\_pc' is already in $recovery\_system\_etc\_modules  
no 'parport' would be added because the substring 'parport'  
matches 'parport\_pc'.

excellent catch - thanks a lot! (please ignore the last commit there, it
was wrong and I pulled it back).
