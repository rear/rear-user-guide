==========================================================================================================================

I have added a couple of lines that ensures password login being
possible when SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD has been set.

The reason for not adding to end of sshd\_config as proposed is due to
any Match blocks that could be used in sshd\_config needs to be at the
very end of the file - thus only a complete in-place line substitution
should be done (and looks cleaner as well).

Info on Match blocks:

I like this version much more than appending it to the end :-)
