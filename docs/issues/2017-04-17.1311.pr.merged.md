Here is a first proposal of a `500_rebuild_initramfs.sh` script for RHEL
(based on dracut).

To avoid any side effect, I put it in
`finalize/RedHatEntrepriseServer/ppc64le`.  
But we will have a lot of duplicates soon as we may need the same kind
of file for ppc64, x86\_64 and other...  
I think the way to manage the rebuilding of initramfs could be the same
per distro... what do you think ?

@schabrolles  
in general use symbolic links for duplicated files  
e.g. like what we currently already have

<pre>
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE_LINUX/ppc64/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh
</pre>

There is a general problem with how the SourceStage function  
in lib/framework-functions.sh sources files  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241\#issue-214078298](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241#issue-214078298)

The SourceStage function basically sources all scripts  
that match below a directory so that one cannot have  
a generic default script like  
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
plus distribution/architecture specific scripts like  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
or  
usr/share/rear/finalize/RedHatEnterpriseServer/ppc64/500\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
that are run instead of the generic default script:

<pre>
# echo hello >usr/share/rear/finalize/default/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh
# usr/sbin/rear -s recover | grep rebuild_initramfs
Source finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh
Source finalize/default/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh
</pre>

Therefore we cannot have generic default scripts  
but must use specific scripts for all Linux distributions  
and architectures even if most of them would be identical.

@schabrolles  
perhaps for RHEL and similar distributions (e.g Fedora and Centos)  
it helps to also clean up the SetOSVendorAndVersion function  
as I did in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1241)
for SUSE  
to get common OS\_VENDOR string?

FWIW:  
The root cause why I did the SetOSVendorAndVersion  
cleanup for SUSE was that  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/i386/170\_rebuild\_initramfs.sh  
was not run "out of the box" by ReaR - i.e. when plain ReaR was  
installed without an appropriate /etc/rear/os.conf file that contains

<pre>
OS_VENDOR=SUSE_LINUX
</pre>

@schabrolles even though probably only RHEL is used on PPC, maybe better
put your additions in /Fedora/ subdirectories to be together with the
other generic RHEL/Fedora scripts. That will also enable CentOS users to
benefit from your improvement.

@jsmeix let's keep the OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR discussion in \#1241

The current concept is based on additive thinking, we go from very
generic (default) to distro & version OR distro & arch specific
(RedHatEnterpriseServer/7 OR RedHatEnterpriseServer/i386) with several
steps inbetween. The idea is to put each script in a "as generic as
possible" place.

@schlomo As you've suggested, I've moved the build\_initrd files for
POWER to Fedora directory and it works.

Right now, initrd is rebuilded only on storage driver changes:

    # Skip if there is nothing to do.
    # During "rear recover" 260_recovery_storage_drivers.sh creates $TMP_DIR/storage_drivers
    if ! test -s $TMP_DIR/storage_drivers ; then
        Log "Skip recreating initrd: No needed storage drivers ('$TMP_DIR/storage_drivers' is empty)"
        return 0
    fi
    # During "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" 260_storage_drivers.sh creates $VAR_DIR/recovery/storage_drivers
    if cmp -s $TMP_DIR/storage_drivers $VAR_DIR/recovery/storage_drivers ; then
        Log "Skip recreating initrd: '$TMP_DIR/storage_drivers' and '$VAR_DIR/recovery/storage_drivers' are the same"
        return 0
    fi

But in the case we migrate from systemA to systemB (booth
BOOT\_OVER\_SAN), driver will be the same, but wwids will have changed.
=&gt; Need to update initramfs to update `/etc/multipath/wwids` file.

Can we use `is_true $MIGRATION_MODE || return 0` instead ?

I think recreating initrd only if some drivers changed it
insufficient.  
It basically calls for errors later when booting the recreated system.

I think by default initrd should always be recreated to be on the safe
side.  
ReaR can never verify all possible reasons why initrd must be
recreated.  
Only in special known cases recreating initrd could be skipped  
automatically by ReaR.

On the other hand when recreating initrd fails during "rear recover"  
this should not be a hard error abort because often the recreated  
system boots with the initrd that was restored form the backup, cf.  
the LogPrint "WARNING ..." messages in the rebuild\_initramfs scripts.

Probably best is to add a new boolean config variable  
REBUILD\_INITRAMFS=""  
which defaults to "yes" if not specified be the user  
so that by default it works fail safe but still the user has the  
final power to decide whether or not ReaR recreates the initrd.

@jsmeix I don't know if I can use a link to
`finalize/Fedora/i386/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh` as the 2 script doesn't
look the same here.

`finalize/Fedora/i386/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh` use dracut, but not
`finalize/Fedora/i386/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh`.

dracut seems to be the prefered way to regenerate initrd in rhel... but
I don't know the reason why
`finalize/Fedora/i386/170_rebuild_initramfs.sh` is not using it.... (may
be there is a good one ...)

I think mkinitrd is the traditional executable to recreate the initrd  
which still works also when dracut is used so that mkinitrd is the  
generically working way to recreate the initrd also on old systems  
where no dracut is used.

Ok, So let me try to use `i386/170_rebuild_initramfs` based on mkinitrd,
I will add my multipath addition and test it on POWER.  
If it work, we can use only one script for all.

@jsmeix it seems to work well by using link :  
`finalize/SUSE_LINUX/ppc64/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh`
and
`finalize/SUSE_LINUX/ppc64le/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh`

`finalize/Fedora/ppc64/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh`
and
`finalize/Fedora/ppc64le/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh -> ../i386/500_rebuild_initramfs.sh`  
tested with RHEL6 (ppc64) and RHEL7.2 (ppc64le).

@jsmeix I would like to move the multipath configuration (before
creating ramdisk) to a separated script usable by other distro/arch
`finalize/GNU/Linux/430_create_multipath.sh`.

This should simplify the `500_rebuild_initramfs.sh` and let it focus on
rebuilding initramfs.

@schabrolles  
and see my above comment  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311\#pullrequestreview-33787588](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1311#pullrequestreview-33787588)  
"LogPrint messages missing when programs in chroot fail".

Ultimately it is your decision whether or not to show  
LogPrint messages when something failed  
or error out in such cases  
or ignore when something failed (as it is now).

From plain looking at 430\_create\_multipath\_config.sh  
it seems the code therein works somehow like

<pre>
if MULTIPATH_SETUP_NEEDED ; then
    do_stuff_to_setup_multipath
fi
</pre>

which looks as if on the one hand it is required  
that do\_stuff\_to\_setup\_multipath runs successfully  
but on the other hand it is silently ignored when it fails.
