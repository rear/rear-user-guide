(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

### create a backup using the internal NETFS method, using 'tar'

BACKUP=NETFS

### write both rescue image and backup to the device labeled REAR-000

BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?  
    pretty sure legacy

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    when booting from the USB stick, systemd-udevd.service failed to
    start  
    w/out udev the LVM names were not updated in /dev and the LVM create
    was unable to proceed

-   Work-around, if any:  
    I found this,
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/601](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/601)  
    and when I created the symlinks per the script, udev was able to
    start

@bmarshmn  
your described workaround indicates that the script  
usr/share/rear/build/Debian/610\_jessie\_link\_systemd\_lib.sh  
is not run in your case when you run  
"rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue".

To check that run

<pre>
rear -s mkrescue | grep ' build/'
</pre>

which shows what 'build' stage scripts are run in your case.

On **Ubuntu** I get:

    # rear -s mkrescue | grep jes
    Source build/Debian/610_jessie_link_systemd_lib.sh

The script does run. Or, it is an USB issue or something is wrong with
the script? Ubuntu tests performed by me are ISO and PXE not USB, so I
cannot tell  
@bmarshmn Any further input from your side?
