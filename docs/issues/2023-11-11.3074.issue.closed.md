I have a Self Encrypted Disk (SED). I'd like to use `sedutil` to lock
the disk, but I want the password to be sealed in the TPM module on
board the system, instead of in ATA BIOS.

Essentially I want the Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA) image to pick up
the password from the TPM automatically upon boot.

Is this even possible?

If you manage to do this with your regular Linux system then ReaR should
also be able to do it, can you please share the CLI commands to do so?

@Strykar  
I am not a PBA (OpalPBA) user  
so I cannot actually help with PBA issues.

We at ReaR upstream got  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2956)  
that mentiones "TPM2-assisted encryption".

If this is what you mean, then you need  
our current ReaR GitHub master code, cf.  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" on

@jsmeix I didn't mean to be obtuse, this was really a *is this even
possible* type of question based off

-   [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16089](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16089)
-   [https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/merge\_requests/461](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/merge_requests/461)

Mostly since sedutil appears to have little traction or interaction on
Github

@Strykar  
I never used 'sedutil'  
so I really cannot answer such questions.  
I only liked to point to something that I found  
but I don't know if that matches what you are looking for.
