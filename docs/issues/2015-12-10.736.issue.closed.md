Hello,  
I want to use the internal SD-Card of the HP DL360g9 for rear recovery
media in UEFI boot (with booting from SD-Card) environment.  
Is it basically possible boot the DL360g9 from SD-Card in UEFI?

If OUTPUT=ISO we can use this for UEFI boot via iLO virtual Media. I try
to write the ISO-file to the SD-Card but it can't boot. (Didn't try in
Legacy Mode)

If OUTPUT=USB we can only boot in Legacy Mode.  
Is it possible to recover a UEFI system with rear if it booted in Legacy
Mode?

THX :-)

Perhaps see
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq)
How to create a bootable USB disk from an ISO image  
However, rear itself is not capable (yet) to make an UEFI bootable
SD/USB disk.
