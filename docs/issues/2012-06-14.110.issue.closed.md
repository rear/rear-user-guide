Something discussed before that I am adding so we don't forget about it.

Currently some scripts are written for a specific distribution, or even
a specific distribution release and that's something that's hard to
maintain in general. No single distribution (version) should be handled
uniquely, but rather implementations should be based on capabilities.

Why ? Because it's hard to maintain very specific exceptions, especially
since we don't know (in advance, or in retrospect) whether other
distribution (versions) suffer from the very same problem. That's why
adding a specific path to a list of paths in general is a better
solution than to create a list of paths per distribution (version), even
if the majority of the paths are not specific to one single
distribution. (Of course we should document each and every item in a
listing like that )

Currently **OS\_VERSION** is mostly unused, and we should get rid of the
very few exceptions in the code.

**OS\_VENDOR** however is used widespread and getting rid of these is
probably a long-term work.

List of occurrences:

    $ grep -r OS_VERSION . | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u

    ./doc/user-guide/02-getting-started.txt
    ./packaging/rpm/rear.spec
    ./usr/share/rear/build/default/99_update_os_conf.sh
    ./usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    ./usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/23_run_efibootmgr.sh
    ./usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh
    ./usr/share/rear/lib/dump-workflow.sh

and

    $ grep -r OS_VENDOR . | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
    ./build/default/99_update_os_conf.sh
    ./conf/default.conf
    ./finalize/default/89_finish_checks.sh
    ./finalize/Linux-i386/23_run_efibootmgr.sh
    ./lib/config-functions.sh
    ./lib/dump-workflow.sh
    ./lib/framework-functions.sh
    ./lib/validate-workflow.sh
    ./rescue/default/01_merge_skeletons.sh

IMO we have no issue (anymore)

no feedback received - assuming we all agree then - ok to close
