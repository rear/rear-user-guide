##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `rear mkrescue` on a RHEL 9 system without any ISO image tool
    installed

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    xorrisofs is supposed to be the preferred method, so mention it
    first among the suggested tools that the user can install to produce
    an ISO image if none is found.

By the way:  
I don't think it is a real "Bug Fix" but an enhancement.  
I think a real bug is when something does not work as intended  
(which could also be a message that tells something falsely).
