And what are the relevant bits from your  
/var/log/rear/rear-s3pac-lta2.log  
when you reproduce it using the -d or -D option?

The "chroot bash test failed" comes from  
usr/share/rear/build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
therein from that code:

<pre>
# The chroot bash test ensures that we have a working bash on our rescue image
if ! chroot $ROOTFS_DIR bash -c true ; then
        KEEP_BUILD_DIR=1
        BugError "ROOTFS_DIR '$ROOTFS_DIR' is broken, chroot bash test failed."
fi
</pre>

Accordingly the relevant bits from your  
/var/log/rear/rear-s3pac-lta2.log  
are the debug output messages while the  
usr/share/rear/build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
script runs.

Hello @dakoide,

I can only guess what is wrong here, but my assumptions might help
someone.  
I went through your log and found indeed some interesting entries:

    /usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh: line 80: $LAYOUT_DEPS: ambiguous redirect
    ++ :
    /usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh: line 84: $LAYOUT_TODO: ambiguous redirect
    ++ local type dev remainder name disk disks vgrp dm_vgrp lvol dm_lvol part mp fs bd nmp temp_nm
    ++ read type remainder
    +++ cat

Lets start from the end. `cat` you see as last output originates from
*layout-functions.sh* and it looks like:

    while while read type remainder ; do
    ...
    done < <(cat $LAYOUT_FILE)

You got ReaR hanging (most probably) because $LAYOUT\_FILE is not set.

It is similar with *ambiguous redirect* message, as bash will throw
*ambiguous redirect* (among other) when target for redirection does not
exist.  
To summarize, you are heaving all these trouble because $LAYOUT\_DEPS,
$LAYOUT\_TODO and $LAYOUT\_FILE were not set.

Normally these variables should be set by script
*layout/save/GNU/Linux/10\_create\_layout\_file.sh*, in your case
however, I don't see any script from *GNU/Linux* section being launched
and that will be a problem I guess.

Unfortunately, this launching mechanism of ReaR is a bit mystery for me,
but I'm sure @gdha or @jsmeix will know exactly why your copy of ReaR
skips *GNU/Linux* section.

Just a Hail marry shot, but do you have *lsb* package installed on your
wheezy ?

    root@debian:/etc/rear# dpkg -l | grep lsb
    ii  lsb-base                         4.1+Debian13+nmu1           all          Linux Standard Base 4.1 init script functionality
    ii  lsb-release                      4.1+Debian13+nmu1           all          Linux Standard Base version reporting utility

@gozora  
your analysis of the user's  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/685137/rear-s3pac-lta2.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/685137/rear-s3pac-lta2.txt)  
is right.

The usrer's  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/685137/rear-s3pac-lta2.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/685137/rear-s3pac-lta2.txt)

and the matching code is in  
usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh

<pre>
    : > $LAYOUT_DEPS
...
    : > $LAYOUT_TODO
</pre>

that are apparently called with empty LAYOUT\_DEPS  
and LAYOUT\_TODO variables regardless that normally  
those variables have been set before in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/100\_create\_layout\_file.sh  
as

<pre>
LAYOUT_DEPS=/root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/diskdeps.conf
LAYOUT_TODO=/root/rear/var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf
</pre>

but in the user's  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/685137/rear-s3pac-lta2.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/685137/rear-s3pac-lta2.txt)  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/100\_create\_layout\_file.sh  
is not sourced.

I have no idea why  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/100\_create\_layout\_file.sh  
is not sourced for this particular user.

My blind guess is that the ReaR installation  
of this particular user is broken.

I.e. I think this is not a bug in ReaR itself.

@dakoide  
I would recommend to re-install ReaR to ensure  
all its files are there as expected.

If you like I would even recommend to use the  
current newest ReaR Github code as follows:

How to test the currently newest rear GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

@dakoide  
better use both '-d' and '-D' to get full logging, e.g.:

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
and
rear -d -D recover
</pre>

In general regarding ReaR you may also have a look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regardless that it is about SUSE, the information therein  
about ReaR applies in general.

Again I'm not sure here, but ReaR should launch *GNU/Linux* part if
`uname -o` returns corresponding string.

@dakoide can you please check what `uname -o` shows on your system?

@gozora  
many thanks for your help!  
I had that OS\_\* variables magic forgotten.

@dakoide  
to debug OS\_\* variables magic in addition to  
report what "uname -o" shows on your system  
also change in your usr/sbin/rear the line

<pre>
SetOSVendorAndVersion
</pre>

to

<pre>
set -x
SetOSVendorAndVersion
exit
</pre>

and re-run "usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkrescue"  
and provide the log file.

@gozora  
only a guess but I have the dim feeling this issue  
may become another nice example how badly things fail  
in a totally unexpected way at a totally weird place  
when scripts are not run with "set -e -u -o pipefail",

I just had an information: for an application to work on this server
there has been modification of /bin/uname ,The problem may come from
there

Here is what has been done

Outch!

That is not very fortunate solution!  
Anyhow, I bet that if you revert your changes back (or replace all
`uname` occurrence in ReaR with `uname-OLD`) all should be working fine.

The root cause os not in ReaR but an incompatible  
modified standard program (uname).  
Accordingly the issue is invalid for Rear.  
But by design ReaR is made of pure bash scripts  
so that appropriate adaptions can be relatively easily done  
in ReaR to make it work even under non-standard conditions.

@gozora  
many thanks for your very useful help here!

Regarding the hack in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1151\#issuecomment-270694991](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1151#issuecomment-270694991)

In usr/sbin/rear the uname command is called after  
the config files have been read.

Because all of ReaR is bash scripts also the config files  
are sourced and executed as bash scripts, cf.  
"Character encoding" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so that it should also work to have in etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
shopt -s expand_aliases
alias uname=uname-OLD
</pre>

or whatever more elaborated workaround is needed like

<pre>
if system_uname="$( type -P uname-OLD )" ; then
    shopt -s expand_aliases
    alias uname=$system_uname
fi
</pre>
