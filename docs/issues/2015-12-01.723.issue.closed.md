Could you downgrade the dependency on portmap also to a recommend? If
nfs-client is already a Recommend then having a hard dependency on
portmap is unnecessary and only leads to a rpc daemon running
unnecessarily. Having to disable the portmapper manually is cumbersome.

@itsbo It makes sense. I'll make the necessary changes.
