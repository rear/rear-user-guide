Now e.g. during "rear mkbackup"  
a code line in /usr/share/rear/path/to/foo.sh like

<pre>
BugError "Unexpected bar"
</pre>

would show this to the user:

<pre>
ERROR: 
====================
BUG in /usr/share/rear/path/to/foo.sh:
'Unexpected bar'
--------------------
Please report this issue at https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
and include the relevant parts from /var/log/rear/rear-xxx.log
preferably with full debug information via 'rear -d -D mkbackup'
====================
</pre>

I think it helps a lot to have the source file where  
BugError or BugIfError was called directly visible  
for the user so that he could directly edit that file.

If there is no furious objection, I will merge it soon...

Strange:  
I have changed the BugError function in  
/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
but that change is not in this pull request.

I found my mistake:  
I had really changed  
/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
(i.e. the one with the leading '/') instead of  
usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
(i.e. the one in my GitHub checkout directory).
