-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / Git

-   If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you
    can't upgrade: First trying to run Ubuntu out of the box. Will
    happily try 2.7 or master when asked to.

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"): Ubuntu 22.04

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

<!-- -->

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=file:///media/myuser/EXT-PLATTE-1TB/rear
    AUTOEXCLUDE_AUTOFS=y

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR): KVM guest

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): x86\_64

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): automounted USB device

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Ubuntu out of the box automounts any USB storage that gets attached
under /media/myuser/$LABEL\_OF\_DEVICE\_OR\_PARTITION.

I can prevent that with `LABEL=REAR-000 none none noauto 0 0` in
`/etc/fstab` for the USB stick to create the ISO. But I do not wish to
prevent this for the backup device because it holds other stuff too that
shall stay visible to the (non-enlightened) user.

ReaR shall just use `/media/myuser/EXT-PLATTE-1TB/rear` during
`mkbackup` but needs to mount `/dev/disk/by-label/EXT-PLATTE-1TB` to
`/media/myuser/EXT-PLATTE-1TB` of whatever suitable path during
`recover`.

Using BACKUP\_MOUNTCMD fails at start of `mkbackup` with "already
mounted".  
Using `BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/EXT-PLATTE-1TB` also fails
with "already mounted".

So my question is: how do I get ReaR to accept a mounted path as
BACKUP\_URL during `mkbackup` but to mount it by itself during
`mkrescue`?

Offhandedly (i.e. without any testing)  
I would try to use bash scripting in etc/rear/local.conf  
to make things behave different when you run ReaR  
on the original system versus on the replacement system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/etc/rear/local.conf)

In the recovery system /etc/rear-release is unique  
(it does not exist otherwise) so you can

    test -f /etc/rear-release

to find out whether or not you are in the recovery system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/lib/recover-workflow.sh\#L23](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/lib/recover-workflow.sh#L23)

What I do not know is how to make ReaR accept  
an already mounted path as BACKUP\_URL  
without trying to mount it.  
I fear you have to modify certain scripts.

@jsmeix I ended up with writing a wrapper script around "rear mkbackup"
which does several checks (USB stuff actually attached) and does the
necessary umount.

@robertdahlem  
thank you for your feedback how you solved it in your case  
so others can see what a possible solution could be.

@jsmeix I added my wrappper script so it can be used as an example by
others. Unfortunately, GitHub only accepts several extension, so one has
to remove the ".txt" suffixes.
