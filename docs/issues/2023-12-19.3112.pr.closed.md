In sbin/rear  
find out if we're running inside the recovery system  
and if yes call 'dmesg -n \[4-7\]' depending on  
verbose and debug modes for ReaR.

In contrast to what I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3107\#issuecomment-1855732184](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3107#issuecomment-1855732184)  
I set here  
`dmesg -n 4` as minimum i.e. in non verbose mode  
`dmesg -n 5` in verbose and debug mode  
`dmesg -n 6` in debugscript mode (with '-D' option)  
`dmesg -n 7` onyl with the long '--debugscripts' option  
because dmesg log level 7 shows lots of (mostly useless)  
informational messages that are normally not helpful  
for debugging issues during 'rear recover'  
but those many informational kernel messages  
disturb the intended ReaR recovery messages and  
in particular those needless kernel messages make  
the intended ReaR recovery messages scroll away  
out of sight too soon on console, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3107\#issuecomment-1855783591](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3107#issuecomment-1855783591)  
because I think the usual default is dmesg log level 7

In general:  
If 'dmesg -n 8' (or something else) is needed  
it can be called via PRE\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
so what we set here is only the default behaviour.

Wouldn't it be better (more modular) to put the code into a script under
`usr/share/rear/setup/default`, instead of directly into `sbin/rear`?
That way you can also avoid checking whether we are inside the recovery
system, because the `setup` stage is executed only in the workflows that
run in the recovery system (true, it is not 100% the same thing, one can
run `rear mkbackup` in the recovery system, but it is not usual).

@pcahyna  
thank you for your proposal.  
I didn't consider doing it via a specific stage.  
I will have a look if that works sufficiently fail-safe.  
I mean:  
It must never happen that we may accidentally change  
the dmesg log level on the original system.  
I also find relying on /etc/rear/rescue.conf somewhat uncertain.

> dmesg -n 6 in debugscript mode (with '-D' option)  
> dmesg -n 7 onyl with the long '--debugscripts' option

is it necessary to introduce a difference between `-D` and
`--debugscripts` options? The manual page says:

           -D
               debugscript mode (log executed commands via set -x - also sets -v
               and -d)

           --debugscripts SET
               same as -d -v -D but debugscript mode with set -SET

so there should be no difference between `-D` and `--debugscripts`
except for the possibility to specify other `set` flags. The manual page
would need to be changed, but I would actually prefer to not introduce
another (unrelated) difference.

me too. I already saw `/etc/rear/rescue.conf` in the original system
(bad idea to do it, of course).

Argh!  
Now I see it (thanks to your above comment with the setup stage):  
lib/recover-workflow.sh contains

    # In the recovery system /etc/rear-release is unique (it does not exist otherwise)
    # cf. init/default/050_check_rear_recover_mode.sh
    test -f /etc/rear-release ...

I.e. I confused /etc/rear/rescue.conf with /etc/rear-release

I think I will move the "set 'dmesg -n \[4-7\]' code" from sbin/rear  
to init/default/050\_check\_rear\_recover\_mode.sh  
because this is a generic piece of code  
where the distinction between recovery system  
and original system is implemented.

init is sourced always though: `SourceStage "init"` in `sbin/rear`. I
would find it safer (double check) to put it into `setup`, but it does
not matter too much.  
EDIT: you can put it into the
`case "$WORKFLOW" in (recover|layoutonly|restoreonly|finalizeonly|mountonly|opaladmin|help)`  
branch, and it has the same effect, but the effect then does not
correspond to the stated purpose of the script (check recover mode).

Consider the above only a minor remark. I don't like putting more code
into `sbin/rear`, a script under `usr/share/rear` is fine if it does the
job.

In sbin/rear we have already

    RECOVERY_MODE=""
    ...
    # Check if we are in recovery mode:
    test -e "/etc/rear-release" && RECOVERY_MODE="y" || true
    readonly RECOVERY_MODE

which was introduced by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f035085e26d22ce154cadd0c887e312cf954fab5](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f035085e26d22ce154cadd0c887e312cf954fab5)  
but meanwhile RECOVERY\_MODE is no longer used anywhere.

I will use RECOVERY\_MODE for the "set 'dmesg -n \[4-7\]' code"  
regardless where that code will be implemented.

According to init/default/050\_check\_rear\_recover\_mode.sh the
workflows  
recover layoutonly restoreonly finalizeonly mountonly opaladmin help  
can run within the recovery system  
but not all of them do `SourceStage "setup"`  
(opaladmin and help do not `SourceStage "setup"`).

So the question is whether or not `dmesg -n [4-7]`  
should be called for all workflows that  
can run within the recovery system  
or only for those workflows that  
can run within the recovery system  
and do `SourceStage "setup"` ?

Of course it does not matter whether or not `dmesg -n [4-7]`  
is called for the help workflow within the recovery system.

But should `dmesg -n [4-7]` be called for the opaladmin workflow  
when it is run within the recovery system?

@pcahyna  
regarding your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3112\#issuecomment-1862714194](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3112#issuecomment-1862714194)

    I already saw /etc/rear/rescue.conf in the original system
    (bad idea to do it, of course).

Interestingly  
prep/default/100\_init\_workflow\_conf.sh  
appends its initialization content  
to $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf  
but fortunately prep/default/005\_remove\_workflow\_conf.sh  
had an existing $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf removed  
but unfortunately build/GNU/Linux/100\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
may later overwrite $ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/rear/rescue.conf  
by copying an existing /etc/rear/rescue.conf  
from the original system.

Fortunately I am not too greedy so I won't dig deeper here  
because I fear waking up daemons lurking in the dark, cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria\_(Middle-earth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth))

    The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for mithril,
    and disturbed a demon of great power:
    a Balrog, which destroyed their kingdom

@pcahyna  
after sleeping on it I decided to follow your proposal  
to implement it in a 'setup' script in particular because  
the remaining workflows that can run within the recovery system  
opaladmin and help run with 'dmesg -n 5' from /etc/scripts/boot  
so all workflows that can run within the recovery system  
run with a reasonable default dmesg level.
