##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    Personally I ( @jsmeix ) consider such kind of additional
    auto-detection  
    functionality in ReaR as **Low** impact - provided there is a config
    variable  
    where the user can specify what he wants and ReaR obeys.

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Desktop,  
    cf.
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368\#issuecomment-644663685](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368#issuecomment-644663685)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

While ReaR already does DHCP auto-detection during `mkrescue` for a
number of configurations, the Network Manager flavor on Ubuntu 20.04
Desktop is not supported. This leads to DHCP not being auto-enabled and
usually a rescue system which is not accessible remotely.

This patch adds the required Network Manager auto-detection:

    2020-06-16 10:18:24.532781411 Including prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh
    2020-06-16 10:18:24.572542776 Detected an active Network Manager connection 'Wired connection 1' set up via DHCPv4
    2020-06-16 10:18:24.573677590 Auto-enabling DHCP on the rescue system

It is an isolated section which has been tested on two different Ubuntu
20.04 bare-metal installations, one of them on a notebook with wireless
and wired interfaces.

As I was wondering why this issue did not come up on Ubuntu 18.04
Desktop, which also uses Network Manager, I looked up a ReaR log file on
18.04:

    2020-04-30 21:02:36.477033150 Including prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh
    2020-04-30 21:02:36.490915411 Detected an active DHCP client process
    2020-04-30 21:02:36.492331285 Auto-enabling DHCP on the rescue system

Interestingly, `/etc/netplan` looks identical on 18.04 and 20.04:

    # Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system
    network:
      version: 2
      renderer: NetworkManager

@gdha @jsmeix since we've agreed on change freeze (except bugs), I'm not
sure about what milestone to set here ...

V.

For now I set ReaR 2.6 milestone and  
added @gdha so he could also have a look.

Personally I would "just merge" it into ReaR 2.6 because  
as far as I see it is separated additional code that behaves fail safe  
and it is only about additional DHCP autodetection functionality  
so when that additional code does not work  
there is no regression - again: only as far as I see.

@gdha  
I would like to merge it tomorrow morning  
if there are no objections.

@OliverO2  
as long as this one is not merged I cannot add your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368\#issuecomment-644663685](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368#issuecomment-644663685)  
to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear-2.6)

If and only if you have time for it could you test the same as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368\#issuecomment-644663685](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2368#issuecomment-644663685)  
but without the additional code here (i.e. with current plain master
code)  
and instead specify `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` in local.conf?

Did a quick test of master fb23c5d711af9ee505a9b03ea7324a098f90891d:

Without `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"`:

    2020-06-16 13:01:29.885796061 Including prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh
    2020-06-16 13:01:29.904263879 Including prep/GNU/Linux/220_include_lvm_tools.sh

With `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"`:

    2020-06-16 13:05:42.945151029 Including prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh
    2020-06-16 13:05:42.946588136 Enabling DHCP on the rescue system (USE_DHCLIENT='yes')
    [...]/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 476: type: dhcpcd: not found
    2020-06-16 13:05:42.951037123 Including prep/GNU/Linux/220_include_lvm_tools.sh

As expected, the second version did start dhclient and an IP address was
assigned correctly.

@OliverO2  
thank you so much for your prompt test  
that verifies `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` works as expected.

@OliverO2 @jsmeix merging allowed for 2.6

@gdha thank you for your review and your explicit comment  
that merging for ReaR 2.6. is ok for you.

Therefore I will merge it in about 30 minutes  
unless there are objections.

@OliverO2 @gozora @gdha  
thank you all for getting this issue solved for ReaR 2.6.
