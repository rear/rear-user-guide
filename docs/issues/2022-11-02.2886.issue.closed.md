-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I performed a test restore of the rear backups in another VM.

The test restore completed fine.

However, after re-attaching the disk to the original system  
I noticed that the label had changed from REAR-000 to REAR-0001,  
not really a big deal, I changed it back.

But I had two backups and they have disappeared!

The directory containing the backups is now empty!

I took screenshots of the restore process, which I have in a word
document, which I can upload if reviewing the restore process might
provide some insight into what has happened.


-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

I believe that the recovery process leaves a log under /var/log/rear in
the recovered system, which would be better than a document with
screenshots. Can you have a look if the log is there, please? Also there
should be a symlink to it in `/root`.

Well I've managed to locate the backups. So that's a relief.

But there is still an issue.

Prior to dismounting the disk and doing the restore, the mount point for
the external disk was:  
/media/zen/REAR-000

Now when I issue:  
lsblk

The mount point has again reverted to:  
/media/zen/REAR-0001

Why would this be happening?

I had used USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR only once  
some longer time ago for a test.

Without checking any details here in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9919852/rear-Ubuntu-DR6-recover.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9919852/rear-Ubuntu-DR6-recover.log)  
I see

    2022-11-02 21:32:51.139179300 Creating  EFI Boot Manager entry ...

so UEFI is used and that seems to contradict what is described  
about USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR in default.conf

    # Number of older rescue environments or backups to retain on USB.
    # What is more than USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR gets automatically removed.
    # This is only supported when EXTLINUX is used as bootloader for USB
    # see USB_BOOTLOADER and output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
    # and this setting is ignored when USB_SUFFIX is set (see above).
    USB_RETAIN_BACKUP_NR=2

I have no idea why "rear recover" changed what is on the USB disk  
(the USB disk content has to be sacrosanct during "rear recover")  
in particular why the label changed from REAR-000 to REAR-0001.  
A "rear -D recover" debug log file may have helped here.

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
in general regarding "better safe than sorry"  
see section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads in particular (excerpt)

    It is your task to ensure your backups
    are kept safe at a sufficiently secure place.
    In particular the place where ReaR writes
    a new backup (e.g. a NFS share or a USB disk)
    is not a really safe place to also keep old backups
    (arbitrary things might go wrong when writing there).

Again:  
Of course during "rear recover" nothing of what there is  
on the USB disk should ever be changed by ReaR.

If you say that the label has changed, is it literally that in the
output of `dumpe2fs /dev/sdb2` you see `REAR-0001` instead of `REAR-000`
? Concerning the disappearing backup, do you mean that the files
backup.tar.gz have disappeared, or something more?

I.e. is the USB now completely empty, or are only some files missing?

It turned out that the contents of the USB is intact.

Somehow the details in /etc/fstab were messed up and the auto-mount of
the disk had changed to /media/zen/REAR-0001 rather than
/media/zen/REAR-000

So, even when I had changed the mount manually, next time the mount had
changed and I had not realised that at the time.

Thanks for the update. Can we close this issue then?

By the way, I believe that mountpoints under /media are usually not
referenced in fstab, the system mounts removable devices there
automatically. Shouldn't that be the case?

I’m still learning Linux, so I can’t comment about “usually”, but in my
case they’re. And the fact that entry was changed really messed me
about.

I mean, the right thing might have been to not reference the disk in
/etc/fstab at all and referencing it there could be the mistake. What
was the problematic line in fstab?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62083231?v=4" width="50">[ZENAdmin-Ops](https://github.com/ZENAdmin-Ops) commented at [2022-11-03 09:51](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2886#issuecomment-1301859501):

Well, I’ve modified the entry now, but the mount point had a “1”
appended and I didn’t initially realise that the fstab entry had
changed.

I did notice that the mount point had changed. Manually changed it, then
assumed that it was “fixed”.

Then after a subsequent restart of course the mount point changed
because of the fstab entry, but I wasn’t aware of that initially and it
didn’t occur to me that the mount point in fstab had changed. Which then
lead me to making conclusions which were false.

Anyway, that’s a mistake that I won’t repeat. If a mount point does
change in future, I will check fstab.

That’s an interesting question.

You might have a point there.

yeah, I do not know the details of removable device automounting either,
but my understanding has been that they get mounted without any fstab
entry. (I have seen them mounted under an user-specific path in `/run`
instead of system-wide `/media` though, which is probably not what you
want.)
