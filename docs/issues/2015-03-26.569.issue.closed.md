Hi

There were some commits a while ago
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/41efc97eb7141c30455df45a871b98cd08e09fa7](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/41efc97eb7141c30455df45a871b98cd08e09fa7)
to add UEFI integreation support to mkbackup / mkrescue. You've changed
several scripts which make use of the `ISO_FILES` variable, basically by
replacing the extension of the `ISO_FILES` variable to multiple `cp`
commands.

Finally the creation of the ISO image was replaced by using the current
directory (which contains all the copied files) instead of the
`ISO_FILES` variable:

        -R -J -volid "$ISO_VOLID" $EFIBOOT -v -iso-level 3 .  >&8
        ##-R -J -volid "$ISO_VOLID" $EFIBOOT  "${ISO_FILES[@]}"  >&8

The problem is, that users will still have some ISO\_FILES defined in
`/etc/rear/local.conf` (for example inclexcl files for the dsmc client)
and `rear dump` will still report them.

I think we need to add / copy the files & directories from ISO\_FILES to
the tmp directory for the ISO creation as well. Do you agree?

Cheers  
Domi

@domibarton Thank - are you only missing files you added to the array
ISO\_FILES manually in local.conf?
