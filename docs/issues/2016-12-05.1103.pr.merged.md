New SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS variable  
lists those workflows that are allowed to run simultaneously  
but cannot use LOGFILE.lockless as the LOCKLESS\_WORKFLOWS.  
Instead the SIMULTANEOUS\_RUNNABLE\_WORKFLOWS  
get a LOGFILE with PID because simultaneously runnable  
workflows require unique logfile names, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1102)

Additional enhancements and fixes in usr/sbin/rear:

CONFIG\_APPEND\_FILES that are not in CONFIG\_DIR  
get added to COPY\_AS\_IS to get them copied into the  
recovery system.

Moved progress subsystem enablement  
(i.e. source $SHARE\_DIR/lib/progresssubsystem.nosh)  
and enablement of debug output of the progress pipe  
after the user config files had been read, because  
otherwise a PROGRESS\_MODE setting in a  
user config file is not used when defining the  
progress functions inprogresssubsystem.nosh

With that changes  
"Multiple simultaneous backups and/or restores"  
work well for me.
