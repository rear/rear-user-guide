Currently when I try:

    sudo rear mkrescue -v

I am seeing error:

    ERROR: Bacula File Daemon is missing
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 450_check_BACULA_client_configured.sh:
      2023-10-29 14:05:17.322313872 Including prep/BACULA/default/450_check_BACULA_client_configured.sh
      /usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh: line 476: type: bacula-fd: not found

I am sure that this is not a bug, rather an error in my current
configuration.

I'm hoping to obtain some advice.

My long-term goal is to be able to perform a restore using bextract as
described here:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)

Perhaps ideally, a largely automated restore.

However, at the moment, as I'm still working out the steps, I want to
perform the restore manually, step-by-step.

And specifically, right now, understand what I need to do to resolve the
above error.

Thank you.  
VW

Hello,

I'm sure that this is not a bug, rather it is a configuration issue.

I'm trying to configure a Bacula recovery environment as per the
scenario described here using
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)
using bextract.

After advice on how to complete the configuration.

Thanks

VW

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
only FYI (I did not yet have a look at your issue):  
I found out what went wrong why  
all your entered information was "missing"  
in your initial description here.  
Your entered information was not lost.  
You changed our template Markdown source text  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
to something like

    <!-- Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

    [your entered information]

where the initial `<!-- ` is Markdown syntax  
for "begin of comment block" so all your entered information  
became a Markdown comment which is not shown.  
I fixed it by removing the initial line

    <!-- Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

When you remove that comment block

    <!-- Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

    Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue.
    (quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

you must remove that whole comment block.

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
I am not a BACKUP=BACULA user so I cannot actually help  
with Bacula backup specific issues.

In general regarding issues with third-party backup tools:  
Usually we at ReaR upstream do not use third-party backup tools  
so usually we cannot reproduce issues with third-party backup tools.

Nevertheless we try to help as good as we can from plain looking at the
code.

In your case I guess the reason might be that you have

    PROGS_BACULA=( ... )

which overwrites the defaults contents of the PROGS\_BACULA array  
from usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf and possibly other places  
in ReaR with only what you specified.

Normally users won't overwrite ReaR's defaults  
but only append additional things if needed like

    PROGS_BACULA+=( this_additional_program that_additional_program )

I see that your

    PROGS_BACULA=( ... )

is the same as in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
so theoretically this should work, in particular  
because both contain 'bacula-fd' so the error message

    bacula-fd: not found

seems to indicate that either you don't have a 'bacula-fd'  
program installed or you have it installed at a place  
where ReaR cannot find it.

I don't know where (i.e. in which path/directory)  
the 'bacula-fd' program is normally installed.

The matching piece of code in  
prep/BACULA/default/450\_check\_BACULA\_client\_configured.sh  
in ReaR 2.6 is

    has_binary bacula-fd
    StopIfError "Bacula File Daemon is missing"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/450\_check\_BACULA\_client\_configured.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/450_check_BACULA_client_configured.sh)  
and the has\_binary function in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh runs

    type $bin 1>/dev/null && return 0

so 'type bacula-fd' does not find a 'bacula-fd' command.

Hello,

bacula-fd is located at:  
/opt/bacula/bin

And I have this entry in local.conf:  
BACULA\_BIN\_DIR=”/opt/bacula/bin”

I have tried commenting out this line:  
PROGS\_BACULA=( bacula-fd bconsole bacula-console bextract bls bscan
btape smartctl )

Has made no difference

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
you use ReaR 2.6 where in particular  
prep/BACULA/default/400\_prep\_bacula.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/400\_prep\_bacula.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/400_prep_bacula.sh)  
does not yet contain `export PATH=$PATH:$BACULA_BIN_DIR`  
which is in the current one (with much other enhancements)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/400\_prep\_bacula.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/BACULA/default/400_prep_bacula.sh)  
via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d6681f2ed16d2506e89326d4acf403406931d617](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d6681f2ed16d2506e89326d4acf403406931d617)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2152](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2152)

So you need to upgrade to the current ReaR 2.7.

See  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

Additionally see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" on  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how you can have several ReaR versions in parallel  
each one in its own separated directory  
without conflicts between each other.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In general I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code  
because the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things  
and if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

Hello,

I have downloaded Rear 2.7

According to the readme I can install manually via: make install

I try:  
sudo make install

I get:  
Command not found

I had a look at Makefile, which looks like a script.

So, I tried:  
chmod +x Makefile  
sudo ./Makefile install

I get:  
./Makefile: 4: SHELL: not found  
./Makefile: 7: .NOTPARALLEL:: not found  
./Makefile: 9: DESTDIR: not found

./Makefile: 18: version: not found  
./Makefile: 18: BUILD\_DIR: not found  
./Makefile: 20: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")

Can you clarify how I install this release?

Thanks

@ZENAdmin-Ops

neither  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)  
nor  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
talks about `make install`.  
The program 'make' is a software development tool  
which is primarily meant for software developers.

When you don't have `make` installed  
try an alternative installation method  
that works in your particular environment,  
for examples see the above URLs.

I am not a Debian user so I cannot tell you  
how to install software on Debian.

For example ReaR 2.7  
as openSUSE Build Service package  
for Debian 11 for 64-bit x86\_64 "amd64" systems  
seems to be available as `rear_2.7-0_amd64.deb` at  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/Debian\_11/amd64/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/Debian_11/amd64/)

Cf. "openSUSE Build Service packages" on  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

But for testing something I would recommend  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code",  
see what I wrote above.
