-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hello,

I'm trying to perform an automated / unattended restore.

So, ideally the following occurs without any human intervention

-   ISO boots
-   GRUB boots to Relax and Recover without Secure Boot (at the moment I
    have to choose this myself - 1st boot menu option)
-   login root automatically (working)
-   rear recover automatically (working)
-   run my restore script automatically (not working)

I currently have the script configured in POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS
(clearly this is wrong)

Rear is at the rear shell, just waiting  
This is where I need the do\_restore.sh to be executed

-   Then reboot, and boot into the restored system (3rd / default boot
    menu option)

Two questions

1.  Are there options in Rear to control Grub menu, or do I need to
    investigate configuring Grub myself?
2.  How to automatically run my restore script in the Rear shell

@ZENAdmin-Ops

regarding `ISO_DEFAULT="automatic"`:

This is only when SYSLINUX boots the ISO image on BIOS systems,  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L905](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L905)

We have GRUB2\_DEFAULT\_BOOT when GRUB2 is used  
to boot the ReaR recovery system, see in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3339](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3339)

Regarding "run my restore script automatically":

What does your restore script do?  
Does it do the whole system recreation from scratich  
including storage setup (i.e. disk partitioning,  
creating filesystems and mounting them at /mnt/local)  
then restoring the backup  
and finally installing the bootloader, cf. the section  
"Disaster recovery means installation (reinstalling from scratch)" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
OR  
does your restore script only restore the backup?

Because you use

    POST_RECOVERY_COMMANDS=(/opt/bacula/scripts/rear/do_restore.sh)

I assume your restore script only restores your Bacula backup.

I am not a BACKUP=BACULA user  
so I cannot really help with BACKUP=BACULA specific issues.

Can you explain why you need a selfmade restore script  
to restore your Bacula backup?  
Or in other words: Can you explain why the current implementation  
in ReaR to restore the backup with BACKUP=BACULA  
does not work for your needs?  
I.e. what does not work or what functionality is missing in  
usr/share/rear/restore/BACULA/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/restore/BACULA/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/restore/BACULA/default/400_restore_backup.sh)

From plain looking at the code in  
restore/BACULA/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
it looks as if it behaves rather interactive  
so it seems the current BACKUP=BACULA implementation  
may not (yet) support unattended restore?  
But I could be wrong and misunderstand how  
restore/BACULA/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
actually works.

Hello,

You're correct, the restore script only restores the backup.

I'm restoring the Bacula server, so I don't have access to the Bacula
system to perform the restore, only the Bacula backups.

Seemed easier to write my own script to perform the restore in this
scenario, but use Rear to create the volumes and mount etc.

If I were to use a different backup option when building Rear, are there
some that provide more automation options, which I could utilise to meet
my needs?

Thanks

@ZENAdmin-Ops  
because I am not a BACKUP=BACULA user  
I cannot try out things on my own  
so I would prefer to solve this issue  
in two separated steps:

First a manual restore of the Bacula server  
with your backup restore script.

When this works the next step is  
to get that done in an unattended way.

An offhanded untested proposal  
how to manually restore the Bacula server  
with your backup restore script:

Because  
restore/BACULA/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
does not do what you need  
you cannot run "rear recover" with BACKUP=BACULA.

To manually restore a backup we have  
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
which interrupts "rear recover" after formatting  
and mounting the filesystems and expects the backup data  
was properly restored to continue "rear recover".  
So you have to do something to restore your backup  
manually before continuing,  
see its description in default.conf  
for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2641](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2641)

What BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does is implemented in  
restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200\_prompt\_user\_to\_start\_restore.sh  
for ReaR 2.7 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200\_prompt\_user\_to\_start\_restore.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/200_prompt_user_to_start_restore.sh)

So with BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
after formatting and mounting the filesystems  
you get a ReaR shell (that runs within "rear recover")  
where you can run your backup restore script  
or you specify your backup restore script as  
REQUESTRESTORE\_COMMAND  
so you have your backup restore script call  
available in the command history in that ReaR shell.

To run a script in the ReaR recovery system  
you normally must explicitly include  
the script plus all what it needs to run  
in the ReaR recovery system  
usually via

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/script ... )

In your case your backup restore script is  
/opt/bacula/scripts/rear/do\_restore.sh  
and you have

    COPY_AS_IS_BACULA+=(
    ...
    /opt/bacula/scripts
    )

so /opt/bacula/scripts/rear/do\_restore.sh should be  
automatically included in the ReaR recovery system.

During "rear mkbackup" you use BACKUP=BACULA  
but for "rear recover" you have to change that  
to BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE before you run "rear recover".

So after booting the ReaR recovery system  
log in there and first manually replace  
BACKUP=BACULA with BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
in /etc/rear/local.conf  
and then run "rear recover".

@jsmeix

I was able to get this working as I would like

Thanks!
