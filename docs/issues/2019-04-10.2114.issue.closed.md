hi,

we from SEP ship a component that implements our own SSH backend. This
component fails to correctly work if /dev/shm is not mounted in the
recovery image, for example:

      File "/usr/local/sesam-ssl-101/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 754, in run
      File "sm_sshd.py", line 387, in handle_connection_thread
      File "/usr/local/sesam-ssl-101/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/__init__.py", line 218, in Queue
      File "/usr/local/sesam-ssl-101/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/queues.py", line 63, in __init__
      File "/usr/local/sesam-ssl-101/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/synchronize.py", line 147, in __init__
      File "/usr/local/sesam-ssl-101/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/synchronize.py", line 75, in __init__
    OSError: [Errno 38] Function not implemented

after mounting /dev/shm, the needed python libraries work:

` mount -t tmpfs none /dev/shm/ -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec`

so question: would it be also useful for other components in the
recovery image to mount /dev/shm by default to make components depending
on shared memory work out of the box?

As a note: this only seems to happen on systems not using Systemd
(SLES11 for example) as systemd by default does mount /dev/shm with
defaults.

I think that it is a good idea to enable shared memory by default and
don't see the harm in it.
