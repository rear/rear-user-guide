See Issue \#528

The TSM\_RESTORE\_FILESPACE\_NUMS defaulted to all known filespaces  
which might not be desired if the filesystem was not recovered  
as part of the rescue image. This change still allows to choose  
any filespaces that TSM knows about but will default to only those  
that are part of the rescue image.

-   Created new TSM\_FILESPACE\_INCLUDED\_NUMS array which is now used  
    as the default for the TSM\_RESTORE\_FILESPACE\_NUMS
-   Populated the MOUNTPOINTS\_TO\_RESTORE variable with those  
    fileystems that were excluded from the rescue image because TSM  
    does not recreate those by default
