Triggered by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2239071913](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2239071913)  
I tried to make sense how  
skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh  
is meant to work but I fail to understand it.

As far as I see we at SUSE do no longer provide dhcpcd  
at least not in openSUSE Leap but likely since earlier  
so I cannot try out dhcpcd with reasonable effort  
(I use only dhclient).

In  
prep/GNU/Linux/210\_include\_dhclient.sh  
I noticed

    # We made our own /etc/dhclient.conf and /bin/dhclient-script files (no need to copy these
    # from the local Linux system for dhclient). For dhcpcd we have /bin/dhcpcd.sh foreseen.

In  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
there is

            case "$DHCLIENT_BIN" in
                ...
                    (dhcpcd*)
                            "$DHCLIENT_BIN" ${DEVICE}
                        ;;

but I think this cannot work  
because from plain looking at the code in  
skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh

    if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
      logger -s -p local0.err -t dhcpcd.sh "wrong usage"
      exit 1
    fi

it exits when there are less than 2 arguments.

@rear/contributors  
could you please (as time permits) have a look here?

I'm wondering which distros actually use dhcpcd by default instead of
dhclient?

@pcahyna @lzaoral  
do you know if Red Hat or Fedora based distros  
may use dhcpcd instead of dhclient?

FYI regarding SUSE and openSUSE:

In openSUSE Factory (i.e. SUSE's "head of development"  
wherefrom openSUSE Tubleweed gets built)  
there is since 11. July 2024 a new package 'dhcpcd'  
see  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/dhcpcd](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/dhcpcd)  
and  
[https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1185096](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1185096)  
where the latter tells about a reason behind:

    New dhcp client package to allow replacing of the
    deprecated dhclient from dhcp-server in e.g. cloud-init.

So in future SLES versions there will be likely 'dhcpcd'  
but that is not something I worry about right now.

When 'dhcpcd' will be in a future SLES version  
I will have a look how that actually behaves - but  
not earlier because currently I have other things to do  
which have higher importance / priority than that.

@jsmeix Yes, they even have to. Our `rear` packages already use it on
Fedora and RHEL 10 because `dhclient` is removed in RHEL 10 and
deprecated in Fedora:

@lzaoral  
thank you for your prompt reply!

I think hereby you "won the price" to have a look  
how skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh is meant to work ;-)

Would you mind when I assign this issue to you?

Sure! Me or @pcahyna can take a look. But beware that I have zero
knowledge how `dhcpcd` work. I have just swapped the `Requires:` in the
spec file and it worked automagically with rear out of the box. ðŸ˜„

@lzaoral  
my current only problem for the ReaR 3.0 release is  
to find out if in skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh  
sourcing the HostInfoFilePath e.g /var/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-eth0.info  
is sufficiently safe - in particular if that may  
(by chance, by accident) source third party code?  
Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh\#L24](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh#L24)

@lzaoral  
interestingly - as far as I understand it - your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3295\#issuecomment-2247867440](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3295#issuecomment-2247867440)  
seems to prove that the 'dhcpcd' code in ReaR  
"just works" in practice  
(regardless that from plain looking at the code  
at least I do not understand how it works).
