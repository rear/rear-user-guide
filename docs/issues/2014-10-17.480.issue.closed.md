hi:  
I am using scientific linux 6.5 x86\_64 version with two sata
harddisk.  
rear version is 1.16.1 comes with EPEL.  
when I use rear recover to restore systems with linux software raid, I
met several issues. since these issues are related, I put them together.

if the disks already has foreign mdadm partition on it, rescue media
will activate them. so the disk partition will fail since the disk is
busy locked by mdadm.

even the disks are clean, when rear use parted to make a partition, udev
will immediately call "/sbin/mdadm" to start md daemon, so the disks is
busy locked by mdadm again and rear will fail  
since it can not make another partition. to fix the problem, I need to
"rm /lib/udev/rules.d/65-md-incremental.rules" before recover.

. mdadm is safe now. but rear will fail with every "partprobe -s"
command. rear add "sleep 1" before every "parted" command, but it forgot
to add "sleep 1" before every "partprobe". udev  
will interrupt and cause busy if without "sleep 1".

these problems show at logs like this:

Print 'Creating partitions for disk /dev/sdb (msdos)'  
test 1  
echo -e 'Creating partitions for disk /dev/sdb (msdos)'  
parted -s /dev/sdb mklabel msdos  
sleep 1  
parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart '"primary"' 1048576B 210763775B  
sleep 1  
parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 boot on  
parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 raid on  
parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart '"primary"' 210763776B 2000398843903B  
sleep 1  
parted -s /dev/sdb set 2 raid on  
partprobe -s /dev/sdb  
Warning: WARNING: the kernel failed to re-read the partition table on
/dev/sdb (Device or resource busy). As a result, it may not reflect all
of your changes until after reboot.  
2014-10-16 08:38:17 An error occurred during layout recreation.

I try to fix these problems. the logic is stop mdadm (like stop lvm
which rear will do) and pause udev when necessary. so rear don't need to
"sleep 1".

patch below:

hey - I would be very grateful if you could make a pull request - life
is  
so much easier (for me at least:)

hi:  
i am sorry. this is my first time using GitHub. I will try to learn the
concept of pull request.

I had also first some problems - I found no good howto for it...  
The steps are mostly:

1.  fork the repo (rear/rear.git)
2.  make a branch from your repo (tbsky/rear.git) for each pull request
    you would made
3.  make your changes for a topic in the branch...
4.  create over github (or your gui tool ) an pull request to original
    repo  
    4a) If there is discussion/modification needed you can add then to
    the branch till it's ready to merge
5.  destroy the branch after merge

(something forgotten?)

hi Reiner030:  
thanks a lot for your hint! I am studying how to use rear. after I am
familiar with rear, I will try to learn how to use pull request.

@tbsky let me know if you need help with git?

is it working with your patch on the master repo?

yes it is working!!

As issue \#508 states it does not work as expected I'm afraid. Will
re-open this issue for further tracking.  
Furthermore I believe the fix was especially for mdadm related devices.
Perhaps we should re-arrange the if block.  
Also, I noticed that `udevadm control --stop-exec-queue` always return
an error (perhaps because return code is 2 on Fedora21 beta). On the
shell it works, but return code is 2 as well.

hi:  
under RHEL6 "udevadm control --stop-exec-queue" and "udevadm control
--start-exec-queue" return 0. so there maybe something changed in
fedora21 beta.  
and udev is not only affected mdadm. there are many "sleep 1" code when
rear make disk partition.  
if we don't "sleep 1" then udev will break rear sometimes (please see my
first post) . so I think pause udev is easier, just how to pause it..

@tbsky I can confirm it works well under Fedora 21. Thank you for all
the work you've put in this issue.
