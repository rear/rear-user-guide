Trying to restore a backup of a system booting with multipath +
software  
raid, at the rescue prompt, after starting multipathd or executing
"rear  
recover", the multipath devices are not found.  
This is due to mdadm building the array at boot, preventing multipath  
from grabbing the disks later.

Solution: Disable automatic building of software raids (mdadm) by  
ignoring the corresponding udev rule.

Tested on RHEL7 and RHEL6.  
**Requires additional testing on Ubuntu and SLES (sorry I don't have  
these).**

@rmetrich Just wonder what the impact is for those who rely on software
RAID rebuild? What are the risks?  
@jsmeix And how will SLES systems behave?  
@schabrolles What are your thoughts as SME?

With this, the software raid is not rebuilt automatically upon boot.
Since ReaR is supposed to recreate all the partitions, this should in
fact be expected to have no rebuild.  
I cannot test on SLES, @jsmeix is there some dev licence I could get
somehow to be able to set up some SLES VM also?

@rmetrich You can download any SLES ISO and use it for 60 days (with
full powers)

@rmetrich Were you able to download SLES and use it?

@gdha Working on that. This needs fixes (different udev rule number at
least).

-   SLES11 doesn't need this
-   SLES12 needs this (mds are automatically created)

Unfortunately the rule is different than on RHEL/Fedora.

I propose to comment out the ARRAY lines in `/etc/mdadm.conf`, which
makes no array to be built automatically.  
However, if the admin wants to build them, then he will have the
configuration in place by looking into `/etc/mdadm.conf`.

Tested on RHEL7 and SLES11 and SLES12.

I think the actual generic solution would be an early "cleanupdisk"
script  
cf.

@rmetrich Please check the comment from @jsmeix - if that is cleared out
we can accept the PR for 2.4
