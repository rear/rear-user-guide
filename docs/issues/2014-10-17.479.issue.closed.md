    %if %{!?sles_version:1}0
    Requires: lsb
    %endif

According
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build\_Service\_cross\_distribution\_howto](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto)
it is obsolete, we better use `suse_version` instead.  
While we are busy we better fix the `OS_VERSION` variable for SuSe as
well (now it is commented out).  
And most likely we can replace `lsb` by `lsb-release`?
