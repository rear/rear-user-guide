By storing the hostname in /etc/hostname (lowercase) Arch Linux will
automatically set the host name in the recovery environment. See issue
\#1254

So clean and simple that I cannot imagine  
what could go wrong so that I "just merge" it.

The thing that can go wrong are systems / Linux distributions where
`/etc/hostname` (lowercase) exists and that don't automagically set the
system and shell hostname from it.

Perhaps we could have a script that is run  
during recovery system startup or at least  
during "rear recover" (e.g. in usr/share/rear/verify/ )  
that checks if $HOSTNAME is the vaule of  
/etc/HOSTNAME or /etc/hostname  
and if not explicitly sets it to that value  
as it happens now in /etc/scripts/boot  
which is no longer run in case of systemd  
as far as it seems to me, cf.

Another situation where this can go wrong is a non Arch Linux where the
user has created both `/etc/hostname` and `/etc/HOSTNAME` on their
source system.

Now Rear will assume `/etc/hostname` does the host name setting magic.
Where the system actually might need `/etc/HOSTNAME`.

Do we need to address such exceptional cases?

If the answer is yes, then

to run some scripting to repair the situation, seems ok.

Murphy's law:  
I wrote  
"So clean and simple that I cannot imagine what could go wrong"  
and things went wrong (in particular on SLES12):
