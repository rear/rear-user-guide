Dear folks,

we want to evaluate REAR, and want to backup a restoreable USB image to
Bareos, so we can just recover that to another machine, and recover from
there.

Is there a way to pipe the output of REAR into another process?

Thanks!

@namezero111111 Why not using `BACKUP=BAREOS` directly? See example

Does doing so backup the recovery image to bareos, too?  
We would also like to be able to restore without network connectivity so
we can restore to test environments.

@namezero111111

Isn't it easier to do whole backup (ReaR recovery system + OS data) to
USB ?

Mhh... ok. Maybe this was phrased in an unfortunate way.  
We are trying to use Rear to have a full BMR of some CentOS6/7 machines.
This backup should be completely in Bareos, including the (custom?) boot
image for each machine.  
As an additional benefit, we would like to be able, if the necessity
arises, to be able to restore random machines in isolated environments
where they will not have access to the original Bareos server druing
restore.

For many machines, we backup the images directly from VMware to achieve
these goals. However, in some cases this option is not available for a
varietly of reasons, so we are looking into an alternative in these
cases.

My untested first idea is to not change ReaR  
but to use ReaR as it is meant to be used  
and do the intended things "outside" of ReaR  
something like the following

Configure ReaR so that "rear mkrescue" stores  
the results on the local disk.

Configure the backup so that the "rear mkrescue"  
results are also included in the backup.

Run the backup directly if an external backup tool is used  
or run "rear mkbackuponly" if an internal backup tool is used  
to get a backup that also contains the "rear mkrescue" results.

Background information:

There is no feasible way (with reasonable effort)  
to pipe the output of ReaR into another process  
because ReaR does not write its output as a single  
stream of dats to a single file descriptor that could be  
redirected into a pipe.

Note that stdout and stdin are redirected into the ReaR log file,  
cf. "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

"rear mkrescue" produces various regular files,  
the so called RESULT\_FILES (see default.conf).

ReaR supports to send the RESULT\_FILES via  
mail (see default.conf).

ReaR does not support to output the RESULT\_FILES  
as a data stream via a file descriptor that could be  
redirected into a pipe.

"rear mkbackup" produces the RESULT\_FILES  
plus whatever specific kind of backup (files)  
that depend on the particular backup program  
that is called by ReaR and how support for that  
particular backup program is implemented in ReaR,  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in

@namezero111111  
in general regarding questions about third-party backup tools (like
Bareos)  
you should better directly ask those who make the third-party backup
tool.  
In particular I do not use any third-party backup tool so that  
I cannot answer any question about third-party backup tools.

You can combine ReaR, [DRLM](https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm) and
BareOS.  
DRLM provides DR over network (PXE) and manages ReaR installations. You
can export/import DRLM images (rear backup + boot img PXE) from/to
different servers(clients) for testing, migrations or installations from
template DR image, then You can get those backups with BareOS from
/var/lib/drlm/arch in DRLM server with a standard BareOS backup job on a
convenient backup window.  
DRLM keeps a configurable number of DR images at disk, olders are
removed, you can always restore any older DR image from BareOS to any
DRLM server, import it to a DRLM client and recover it.

Hope this can help you.

Regards,  
Didac

Ok thank you for all your expert advice. We will try the suggestions in
a test environment and report back!
