-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Prepare USB bootstick

    rear format  -- --efi /dev/sdX
    rear mkrescue

Bootstick works on the server it was created on. But **ONLY THERE**!

There are 2 other identical servers.  
When trying to boot either,

    - GRUB starts;
    - choose "unsecure boot"
    - system freezes after showing
        Loading kernel /EFI/BOOT/kernel ...
        Loading initial ramdisk /EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz

-   Workaround, if any:

Stick to ReaR Version 2.6-4.  
Using that version, everything runs smoothly.  
So imho there exists no hardware-oriented problem concerning  
the other servers that are failing with version 2.7-1!

@guru4712  
could you describbe in more detail what you mean with

    There are 2 other identical servers.

    - system freezes after showing

What kind of UEFI booting do you need on  
those 2 other identical servers?  
With or without Secure Boot?

Only an offhanded bind shot in the dark  
(because I am not at all an expert in UEFI booting):

To me this looks somewhat contradicting because  
it seems two bootloaders get installed (GRUB2 and SYSLINUX)  
and witing a MBR on a GPT disk seems to be at least useless.

@guru4712  
I suggest you may read through the whole  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829)  
because that lists my BIOS and  
UEFI (without Secure Boot) dual boot experience.  
Perhaps you notice some difference between how things  
behaved for me versus how it behaves for you  
which may help us to find the root cause  
why it does not work in your specific case.

Let me first clarify the situation: there are 3 identical servers. Only
EFI boot is possible.  
On one of them, the rescue system is built and then tested for restore
purposes on the others.  
Astonishing enough, the resuce stick boots **only** on the
**particular** server the stick was just built on, not on the others.

\#2829 brougth no help: I am not dealing with dual boot situation, since
the hardware needs EFI.

After adding "nomodes" to the kernel line in grub.cfg the server simply
gets stuck.

After adding "vga=normal" to the kernel line in grub.cfg the server
changes console output: already shown lines widen (see picture) and
server gets stuck. This is identical to the behavior without
tweaks.![CaptureScreen during boot

Refined investigation. Upgraded to RHEL 8.6, because former versions
contain a nasty bug:  
when booting directly into graphical mode, one cannot enter rescue mode
- console freezes.  
If there was an working SSH-connection, it can be used to change run
level again (and so freeing console).  
Workaround: boot into multiuser-mode. From there any other mode is
reachable.  
RH admitted a bug in GDM but refused to backport since 8.5 is out of
support.

Made EFI-rescue-sticks on 2 beforementioned servers called C3770 an
C3772.

-   Each server can boot from the rescue stick it produced itself;
-   trying to boot on the other server fails showing the picture shown
    in comment above;
-   both rescue sticks boot successfully on an old PC (Compaq Pro 6305
    SFF).

[c3770-mkrescue.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9672943/c3770-mkrescue.log)  
[c3772-mkrescue.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9672951/c3772-mkrescue.log)

It is most disappointing that booting fails on hardware-identical twin
but works on completely different metal.  
And again, Version 2.6-4 is fine!

Any idea for further investigation?

I remember seeing some HP (maybe back at gen8 or even older) issues
similar to this.  
If I remember correctly it was some combination of firmware bugs and EFI
or GPT.  
you may try:

-   firmware updates
-   legacy bios boot instead of efi
-   msdos partition table instead of gpt
-   msdos table + legacy boot

beside that your kernel version or bootloader version may be involved.  
so you may try:

-   a different kernel version
-   a different bootloader (grub?) version
-   a non grub bootloader (syslinux) - or grub if you used syslinux
    before

also some firmware may expect certain partition positions, sizes or
filesystem types (which would be a bug there as well).

As stated before, EFI is mandatory.

-   Updated OS to RHEL 8.6 with patches as from 2022-10-27
    (kernel-4.18.0-372.32.1.el8\_6.x86\_64);
-   updated firmware to V5.0.0.13 - R.1.22.0 as from 2022-08-25
    (latest).

No improvement at all !

I do not understand how to change the bootloader used by REAR.  
By what means? Any variables?

I think I have reproduced this by accident when testing/finding \#2884
.  
extlinux was showing the two lines for loading kernel/initrd but looked
like it was not booting. Not sure if the output was just not shown on
the console or if it was actually hanging. I also kind of ignored it
since I tried extlinux with vfat boot partition - so modified rear
code.  
Since the grub bootloader variation is also not working with efi at the
moment (see \#2883 ) this is a bit of a problem.

you should be able to manually fix the boot device (if it is a disk or
usb device) by installing for example grub manually.  
In case of a iso or such that is not so easy.

I would like to defend GRUB, since same machines with identical OS work
fine using ReaR 2.6-4 !  
So what happened to ReaR in transition to version 2.7 ?

I think the newer grub versions are more picky also a lot of rear code
changed of course and new bugs may have been introduced.  
I am however not sure yet if this issue is acutually due to that or
something else.
