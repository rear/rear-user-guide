Hi,

Not always but happens on some systems, for now I have it on
centos6/cloud Linux and on Debian 7.11. As far as I figured problem was
always but became fatal since 1.19. It cannot detect **bootloader** so
no `/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader` file than fail. Example:

    rear -d -D mkrescue
    Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-toronto2.log
    Creating disk layout
    ERROR: 
    ====================
    BUG in /usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/450_check_bootloader_files.sh:
    'Unknown bootloader () - ask for sponsoring to get this fixed'
    --------------------
    Please report this issue at https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
    and include the relevant parts from /var/log/rear/rear-toronto2.log
    preferably with full debug information via 'rear -d -D mkrescue'
    ====================
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-toronto2.log for details
    You should also rm -Rf /opt/bacula/bacula4hosts/rear/tmp/rear.EfqwRdTCr9dM8ss
    Terminated

if I do  
`echo "GRUB" > /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader`

works well

    grub --version
    grub (GNU GRUB 0.97)

    lsb_release -a
    LSB Version:    :base-4.0-amd64:base-4.0-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-noarch:printing-4.0-amd64:printing-4.0-noarch

    Description:    CloudLinux Server release 6.8 (Oleg Makarov)

As far as I figured non of rules in
`/usr/share/rear/prep/default/500_guess_bootloader.sh` works.

    file -s /dev/sda
    /dev/sda: x86 boot sector; partition 1: ID=0x83, active, starthead 2, startsector 128, 524287872 sectors, code offset 0xb8

then

    4+0 records in
    4+0 records out
    2048 bytes (2.0 kB) copied, 6.456e-05 s, 31.7 MB/s

noting and no `/var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader` as result.

Ah - it seems  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1038](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1038)  
is back - now with centos6/cloud Linux and Debian 7.11

Perhaps instead of the default case (\*) BugError  
we should use (GRUB|GRUB2) as default case in  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh ?

On the other hand "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" should  
better abort to be on the safe side in case of doubt  
about the used bootloader than to blindly proceed  
hoping for the best that GRUB/GRUB2 is acually used,  
cf. "Try to care about possible errors" at

no there it see GRUB2 for my case it's empty. Let me know if I need to
provide anything else to investigate.

@maximvolgin Could you run `dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=8 | strings` ?  
And what does `rear dump` display? And out of curiosity what is the
content of `/etc/rear/os.conf`?

Noting :(

    dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=8 | strings
    8+0 records in
    8+0 records out
    4096 bytes (4.1 kB) copied, 0.000110388 s, 37.1 MB/s

`echo $(hexdump -v -n 2 -e '/1 "%02x"' /dev/sda) fab8`

according all docs I able to found "fab8" means no boot loader, but it's
bootable and active:

    file -s /dev/sda
    /dev/sda: x86 boot sector; partition 1: ID=0x83, active, starthead 2, startsector 128, 524287872 sectors, code offset 0xb8

and definitely that VM booting some how :)

full MBR:

    echo $(hexdump -v -n 512 -e '/1 "%02x"' /dev/sda)

really strange maybe related that it's VM.

Sorry for maybe stupid question, but I'm not much into all these fancy
cloud things ...  
The thing is that for example my virtual server provider is using custom
linux images, which matches his needs. So MBR on my server looks empty
too:

Ok just got confirmation from onapp devs: there some vms booting from
some floppy image onapp/tools/grub.img and I do not see it inside VM. So
maybe I force set /var/lib/rear/recovery/bootloader to grub then where
REAR able to detect it it redefine. At list will not be fatal error.

Thanks for help!

@maximvolgin One more question, did you ever made successful restore of
your onapp servers with ReaR?  
I'm asking because once ReaR finishes its operation one of the thing
that it does is installation of boot loader. So I was wondering if
everything booted fine for you ...

It's my pain, I have no way to try by myself. But my boss premised me to
provide me with staging onapp where I'll have full access to play with
it soon. But that problem is on only a few VM of hungers.

Well, boss is boss no arguing here:-).  
My humble guess would be that only benefit you have from ReaR is backed
up data.  
For my virtual server all i do for backup is simple `tar` and in case of
disaster, I just deploy new VM from vendor provided image and restore
data from tarball ...

V.

We used REAR cause it much more stable and usable than BMR provided by
bacula Enterprise and it's open for customization for our needs.

:-) Nice to hear that!  
Anyhow, good luck with solving your problem!

I think this issue is not actually a bug in ReaR  
but in contrast ReaR is right to error out when it  
cannot determine the used bootloader.

@gdha  
perhaps we should change this  
default case (\*) BugError  
into a  
default case (\*) Error  
?

yes it's not really bug

Regarding

It sems this VM is booted via a method that is outside of the VM.

I wonder when a system is booted with a method outside of  
that system, does then ReaR need to install any bootloader  
inside that system?

For example if a traditional system is booted form an external  
removable medium (e.g. a rescue system on a CDROM),  
does then ReaR need to install a bootloader inside that system?

But perhaps it is a minor bug in ReaR when ReaR aborts with a  
message about a bug in ReaR when it is not a bug in ReaR.

From experience with my provider, I'm not even allowed to boot my own
ISO image into machine, all I can use are vendor provided images ...

yes but it often is used for VM migration

@jsmeix I would keep the `BugError` so at least we are getting informed
of weird setups by some vendors. We could add this variant to the not
supported list (by default)?

@maximvolgin concerning your BACULA mods - are these worth sharing?

@gdha  
perfectly o.k. for me to keep that BugError.

@gozora  
strange, I use QEMU/KVM virtual machines on my workstation  
and I am allowed to do what I want there because I am 'root' ;-)

Lucky you :-), I'd wish I can become root one day :-D at least on one
server.

@gdha  
should we just close this issue as a very special corner case  
or should we document it or should we perhaps implement  
some autodetection of this special case and error out then?

@jsmeix Good idea to close this issue - we do not need to do anything as
it is not listed as a supported OS anyhow.
