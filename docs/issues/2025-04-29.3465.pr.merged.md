-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Cleanup**

Since  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/44381c52f7eba66dd2897ab1f1d6a64aaecb94cb>  
there is in default.conf

    SECRET_VARIABLES=( $( grep ... $SHARE_DIR/conf/default.conf ... ) )

which fails in etc/scripts/system-setup during

    source /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf ...

with this error message during recovery system startup

    grep: /conf/default.conf: No such file or directory

because SHARE\_DIR is not yet set in system-setup  
but it gets set directly afterwards.

SECRET\_VARIABLES is currently only used in lib/dump-workflow.sh  
but "rear dump" is allowed inside the ReaR recovery system  
so this issue could be a real bug.

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?

Tested on my test VM and now ReaR recovery system startup  
shows no longer an error message (and also "rear recover"  
still "just works" for me).

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
set ReaR path variables early because they are used  
e.g. SHARE\_DIR is used in default.conf  
and use ReaR path variables (SHARE\_DIR / CONFIG\_DIR)  
also in system-setup instead of hardcoded paths.

@jsmeix What was the content of `/etc/rear/rescue.conf` - perhaps we
should add it in there?

@gdha  
I think today I won't find time for it and  
tomorrow is public holiday in Germany  
and I am on vacation on Friday  
so (hopefully) next week...

Accordingly I postpone merging to next week.

@gdha  
my etc/rear/rescue.conf

    # initialize our /etc/rear/rescue.conf file sourced by the rear command in recover mode
    # also the configuration is sourced by system-setup script during booting our recovery image

    BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS=( --anchored --xattrs --xattrs-include=security.capability --xattrs-include=security.selinux --acls )
    # The following 2 lines were added by 210_include_dhclient.sh
    USE_DHCLIENT=yes
    DHCLIENT_BIN=dhclient

    # The following lines were added by 490_store_write_protect_settings.sh
    WRITE_PROTECTED_IDS=(  )
    WRITE_PROTECTED_FS_LABEL_PATTERNS=( )

    # All set NETFS_* variables (cf. rescue/NETFS/default/600_store_NETFS_variables.sh):
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=
    NETFS_PREFIX=localhost
    NETFS_RESTORE_CAPABILITIES=([0]="No")

I do not understand what you mean with your question  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3465#issuecomment-2839063740>

I.e. how is my change here related to the rescue.conf file?

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
provided there are no severe objections.
