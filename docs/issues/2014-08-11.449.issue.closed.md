Hi,

Kindly let me know if there is any way for extending the /boot File
system in Suse by using Rear.  
We have very low space in /boot fs, due to this we are unable to perform
the suse Upgrade. Kindly help us out.

`rear` is a disaster recovery tool - if you clone your disk to another
system you might be able to increase the /boot partition size

If you have a working ReaR setup then you can probably tweak the
disklayout  
info on the recovery media to recover the system with a different
/boot  
size.

You could also extend ReaR to initially record a tweaked disklayout if  
/boot is too small. I think that we could accept a patch from you with
such  
a function if it is an optional feature.
