How do you set TSM Management class to backup REAR ISO Files ?

Can you name TSM REAR ISO files with Date / Time in the name? ( Example:
rear-server123-20160204-101600.iso )

The reason I ask this is because our default TSM management class is 3
copies over 2 months.

Should we be running "rear -v mkbackup" everyday so we can recover a
server the from the night before?

You could redefine the `ISO_PREFIX="rear-$HOSTNAME"` in the local.conf
file if you like.  
However, if you are using TSM there is no need to create an ISO image
every day. Unless you would like to avoid automatic removals within TSM
(retention days).

If I run TSM REAR ISO backups less frequently, lets say weekly on a
Sunday, but the server breaks after that TSM REAR ISO backup, lets say
the following Wednesday, can I recover the night before's Tuesday server
using the TSM REAR ISO from the previous Sunday? ( Can I recover based
on dates even though the TSM REAR ISO may not have been created on a
certain date ? )

Another concern I have is if disks are added or removed or if networking
has changed on a server after the TSM REAR ISO weekly was created. Can I
still use the TSM REAR ISO to recover the system?

@mperry999 rear ISO rescue image does *not* contain any backup. Restore
is always done via TSM.
