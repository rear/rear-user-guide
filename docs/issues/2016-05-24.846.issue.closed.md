Hello,

I installed REAR on a Server. When I try to run "rear -v mkbackup" It
gives the output as

    `Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-eul2e1.log
    Creating disk layout

    ERROR: BUG BUG BUG!  ROOTFS_DIR '/tmp/rear.RPoUCQycgh21105/rootfs' is broken, chroot bash test failed. 
    === Issue report ===
    Please report this unexpected issue at: https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
    Also include the relevant bits from /var/log/rear/rear-eul2e1.log

    HINT: If you can reproduce the issue, try using the -d or -D option !
    ====================
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-eul2e1.log for details
    You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.RPoUCQycgh21105
    Terminated

But, This is isn't my concern for now, I'll ask about this bug as my
next question. My primary concern is, I dont have any earlier REAR Image
of this server. But when I run "rear checklayout" it returns error code
0. Which means there is no change from the previous Image. But there was
no image created since day 1. Why is it behaving so ?

@akshaysarraf2016 what did you see in the log file?  
You can always run `rear savelayout` and check the files under
`/var/lib/rear/layout`  
I guess you will find a cron entry `/etc/cron.d/rear` which run
checklayout
