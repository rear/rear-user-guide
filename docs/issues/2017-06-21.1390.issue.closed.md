At least @schlomo and @jsmeix are  
dreaming about a future ReaR major version  
that does away with all the old stuff to make  
the code much simpler if we could limit support  
to "nowadays usually used stuff".

I have a hopefully useful idea how we could get rid of all old stuff  
in a particular part of the ReaR code (but it is a core part of ReaR):

@rear/contributors Proposal could be that after we release **ReaR 2.5**
we start working on a new branch for **ReaR 3.0**. If a sub-release for
**ReaR 2.x** would still be necessary that would be still possible of
course, but on a sponsored basis?

See the discussion in \#699 about empty arrays, which are not well
supported in bash 3, and using them properly needs requiring bash 4.
