Most projects use make for creating a new distribution, an RPM package
or a DEB package from a source tree.

It could be useful to use the same methodology that packagers are used
to by having a Makefile that has the following targets:

-   install
-   uninstall
-   dist
-   rpm
-   deb

During the `make dist` or `make install` phase we could check bash
syntax, and we could even provide a `make test` target for unit testing.
