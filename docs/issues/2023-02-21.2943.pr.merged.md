##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Full backup and recovery on RHEL 8 s390x VM with 4 DASDs: 2 in the
    root VG, one for storing the backup and one that was not included in
    the backup (`ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( rootvg )` was set). Verified that the
    extra VG and the disk with the backup survived recovery and that
    DASDs were properly mapped during recovery (in a situation where the
    correct disk mapping is not an identity map).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The s390x architecture needs some unique handling of disks (called
    DASDs - Direct Access Storage Devices) during layout restoration.
    The DASDs need to be enabled, otherwise they are not recognized as
    block devices, and then to get formatted (at low level), unless they
    are formatted already, before they can be partitioned. The current
    code to do this suffers from several problems.  
    Formatting of the disks is controlled by the `dasdfmt` directive in
    the disklayout.conf file. This directive is emitted for all dasds,
    regardless of whether they should be included in the layout. While
    there is component exclusion code that comments out the "disk" lines
    for unused disks automatically, the `dasdfmt` lines for unused disks
    stay in the layout file, which later causes the unused disks to be
    reformatted unconditionally. Crucially, this includes the disk with
    the backup (one must use network backup storage because of this).
    Moreover, when the user is prompted to confirm the disk layout file
    and layout recreation script, it is too late, because the formatting
    code is unconditionally executed very early, before the rest of
    processing of the layout, and is not part of the disklayout.sh
    script.  
    As the formatting code runs early, it is also not affected by disk
    mappings, so when the device names change, formatting will be
    applied to wrong disks.  
    Another problem is that obtaining the disk entry from the `lsdasd`
    command output uses a simple `grep` command. Unfortunately, this
    breaks for more than 26 DASDs, because `grep dasda` will also match
    `dasdaa`, `dasdab` etc., so multiple lines will pass through the
    filter instead of just one and break the format of the
    disklayout.conf file.

This PR does the following changes:

-   Simplify syntax of dasd\_channel directive. The previous syntax had
    some useless fields, like the major:minor number and status.
-   Fix obtaining the entry from lsdasd output
-   Eliminate the "dasdfmt" directive, merge its fields into the "disk"
    directive. This has the advantage that the exclusion code eliminates
    the "disk" lines for unused disks automatically and thus prevents
    them from being reformatted (in addition to preventing them from
    being repartitioned). Unfortunately it means that the format of the
    "disk" directive now depends on the disk label type: `dasd` disks
    have extra fields that other disk types don't have.
-   Generate the DASD formatting code as a separate script and let the
    user confirm it before it gets executed. Heavily inspired by the
    disk wiping code (it is similarly destructive), but executed during
    the "layout/prepare" stage and not during the "layout/recreate"
    stage. The reason is that unformatted DASDs do not have their size
    in bytes known (it depends on format), but other scripts in the
    "layout/prepare" stage need to know the disk sizes (e.g. for
    resizing partitions). The script is generated after the mapping code
    has mapped original to current disk devices, ensuring that we format
    the correct DASDs. Reformatting can be switched off entirely by
    setting the `FORMAT_DASDS` variable to a false value.
-   The heuristics in disk comparison and mapping script will now be
    less accurate, because it won't know the current sizes if disks are
    not formatted. Since the DASDs have permanent identifiers (virtual
    device number) that can be used to reliably identify disks, pass
    this information to the mapping code in a variable called
    DISK\_MAPPING\_HINTS and use them there in preference to the usual
    device name and size comparison.
-   Since DASD enabling and DASD formatting code are now separate and
    the former is non-destructive, run it also for "rear mountonly".
    This fixes "rear mountonly" on s390x.

@mutable-dan I believe you are the original author of the S/390 code -
can you please have a look?

WOW!  
Looks like a severe improvement.

@pcahyna  
I have a question because you wrote

    The heuristics in disk comparison and mapping script
    will now be less accurate

Will it be less accurate only in case of DASD disks  
or will it be less accurate in general?

My fear is that a possibly disastrous automated mapping  
might happen when it is less accurate in general.

@pcahyna  
do I understand it correctly that this pull request  
enhances ReaR towards official basic support for IBM Z  
that is limited to DASD disks and perhaps some other  
limitations?

Only in case of DASDs, because the loss of accuracy results from the
loss of size information on unformatted DASDs at this point, due to
low-level formatting being performed after mapping. This is not an issue
for disks that do not need low-level formatting.

It is limited to virtual machines using z/VM hypervisors, I have no idea
whether the code would work in a LPAR or under KVM.

Concerning disks, the other choice of disks on IBM Z are SCSI disks
accessed using Fibre Channel (FCP). My limited understanding is that the
SCSI disks do not need any special handling compared to SCSI disks on
other architectures, so they might "just work", but I have not tested
them.

And yes, with these changes I would not consider ReaR support
"preliminary" anymore (on the supported configurations).

We have too many open PRs that could be merged IMHO, so I'll just go
ahead and merge this now.

@pcahyna maybe you can follow this up with some documentation changes to
update the support status of s390x?

@schlomo thanks, sorry for my belated reply. As @jsmeix said - the
scripts to confirm and rerun the generated DASD format scrips are
adapted from existing scripts, especially in the case of
`400_run_dasd_format_code.sh`. I have not tested it in entirety - I
believe have I tested editing and confirming the script, but not
rerunning it in case it has failed. I trust this part because it was
adapted from prior code with only minimal changes. That's why I have not
followed your style suggestions: they would increase the difference from
the original script and thus increase the risk of introducing a bug.

Ideally all the boilerplate (the state machine) should be shared and
only the messages, file names etc. would change, but I don't see how to
do that easily, especially in shell.

Yes, I totally understand that. Let's hope that there will be more users
testing this and provide us feedback
