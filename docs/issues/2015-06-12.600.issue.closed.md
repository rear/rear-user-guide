hi,  
on my newly installed debian jessie system binutils is not within the
standard installation for a ssh server only. As such strings is missing
from the system. If so, you will not the following error message during
mkrescue:

2015-06-12 12:16:10 Including prep/default/50\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
/var/opt/sesam/var/lib/rear/usr/share/rear/prep/default/50\_guess\_bootloader.sh:
line 15: strings: command not found

its the section where it tries to write the bootloader information. May
not be critical but i think  
it would be better to really fail out with a proper error message if the
script is missing an  
executable?

@abbbi should bail out from the start now...
