(rear 27) seems to make ineffective TMPDIR *inside* rear configuration,
eg. `/etc/rear/local.conf`. However:

    $ grep -R TMPDIR /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/
    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/rescue-and-backup-on-same-ISO-image-example.conf:TMPDIR=/mnt2/tmp

It seems `TMPDIR` should be changed to `TMP_DIR` here.

    $ rpm -q rear27a
    rear27a-2.7-150500.3.3.1.x86_64

This was already fixed in GitHub master code  
on Feb 27 2024 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9793364ba85aac019f367f45f906e55e2e4d4648](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9793364ba85aac019f367f45f906e55e2e4d4648)

@jirib

in general I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code  
because the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things  
and if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how you can try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
without conflicts with your already installed ReaR version.
