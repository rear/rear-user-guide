My environment:

<pre>
Testing date: 2015-12-01
Operating system: Debian 8.2 (jessie)
Package: rear_1.17.2_all.deb
</pre>

During a USB recovery phase, rear was unable to mount USB device.
Decided to drop to shell when offered a menu for my next action. Found
root .bash\_history file already populated with a few entries presumably
as a troubleshooting aide for administrators.

<pre>: : : : : WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE EXPECTED HERE?
vi /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh   # View/modify disk restore script
vi /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  # View/modify disk layout configuration
less /var/log/rear/rear-myhost.log   # View log file
loadkeys -d     # Load default keyboard layout (US)
rear recover    # Recover your system
</pre>

Issue: Could not view diskrestore.sh because the script was missing

<pre>
vi /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh   # View/modify disk restore script
</pre>

@jk04au these are simply some examples so that the history is not empty
to start with. When you haven't started a recovery operation then the
`distrestore.sh` script does not yet exists.  
It is as it is...
