-   rear version - 1.19-git201612161033
-   OS version - Debian GNU/Linux testing (stretch)
-   file `/etc/rear/local.conf` is empty, `/etc/rear/site.conf` is like

<!-- -->

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    BACKUP_URL=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

In file `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` I have set

`USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=gpt`

and created the rescue system with

`rear -v format /dev/sdb`  
`rear -d -D mkbackup`

The resulting device is not bootable - I get the message 'Missing
operating system'

With `USB_DEVICE_PARTED_LABEL=msdos` everything works as expected, I
cannot see anything spurious in `/var/log/rear/rear-debianrear.log`

I did not check any detail - for now only a blind guess:  
See in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf the  
section about "USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER".

@jsmeix, @gdha  
Maybe you could consider extending ReaR issue templete with:

-   Boot type: \[ Legacy BIOS | UEFI \]

Setting `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=0` in `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`
did not change the behaviour

I meant setting USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1  
according to what default.conf describes:

<pre>
USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER=1  means we want UEFI ISO image ...
</pre>

@gozora  
what do you mean with "extending ReaR issue template"?

@jsmeix  
Just to add another question for user that submits new issue. Because it
is not always obvious from configuration if user have Legacy or UEFI
boot.  
Let me demonstrate :-) :

@dwerner1  
Are you using Legacy BIOS of UEFI boot?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2017-01-05 13:32](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1153#issuecomment-270644584):

I'm using legacy BIOS

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12116358?u=1c5ba9dcee5ca3082f03029a7fbe647efd30eb49&v=4" width="50">[gozora](https://github.com/gozora) commented at [2017-01-05 16:05](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1153#issuecomment-270681129):

Got it!

For me this is bug in ReaR.  
The problem is that `gpt` needs different mbr code and flags than msdos
.

Try following (**I'm assuming your USB device uses /dev/sdb** if not
please change it accordingly)

-   Plug your USB device (no need to mount it)
-   Backup your current MBR  
    `dd if=/dev/sdb bs=440 count=1 of=./usb_mbr_backup.img`
-   Locate file called *gptmbr.bin* . Something like this should work
    for you:  
    `dpkg -L syslinux | grep gptmbr.bin`
-   Replace current MBR (created by ReaR) like:  
    `dd if=<full_path_to_gptmbr>/gptmbr.bin of=/dev/sdb bs=440 count=1 conv=notrunc`
-   Set correct flags for USB boot partition  
    `parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 boot off`  
    `parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 legacy_boot on`

Final output should look something like this:

    # parted /dev/sdb print
    Model: Kingston DT microDuo (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sdb: 7751MB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags: 

    Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
     1      17,4kB  7751MB  7751MB  ext3         primary  legacy_boot

Now you should be able to boot.

V.

Just to make this a bit clearer for me -

I had started this issue with

.... and created the rescue system with

`rear -v format /dev/sdb`  
`rear -d -D mkbackup`

If I had been creating an UEFI enabled USB device, I had rather started
the issue with these lines

`rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdb`  
`rear -d -D mkbackup`

Don't wanna be the inch pincher here :-)

I'm a bit confused now - is there something I can do to get this
working? Or is there something that needs to be fixed/enhanced in
rear?  
I have just installed `rear_1.19-0git201701041156`

@jsmeix @gozora  
many thanks for your attention!

`parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 boot_legacy off`

tells me

`parted: invalid token: boot_legacy`

But it is bootable and shows the menu!! Cool input @gozora ;-)

Yes, because that is wrong, who told you to set such flag? :-)

It should be:

    parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 boot off
    parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 legacy_boot on

Sorry for that!

@dwerner1  
With

merged, current ReaR code should work for you without modifications
mentioned in

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1157](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1157)  
merged into current ReaR GitHub master code  
it should now "just work".

@dwerner1  
I would appreciate it if you coud test if it really  
"just works" with current ReaR GitHub master code  
and provide feedback.

How to test the currently newest rear GitHub master code:

Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# cd rear

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -v format /dev/sdX

# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

(replace /dev/sdX with your acual device file).

I can confirm that the just pulled git version runs as expected! I would
like to install that on a remote server as soon as possible. Are you
gonna publish a deb package of `Relax-and-Recover 2.00 / Git` in the
closer future?

@dwerner1  
Just note, I don't believe that this fix will be available in ReaR 2.0
as it was released prior this issue. ReaR 2.1 looks more likely ...

as always your contribution to ReaR is very valuable!
