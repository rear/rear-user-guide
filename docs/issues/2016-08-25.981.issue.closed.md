-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): CentOS
    release 6.7 (Final)

Is it possible to change the network-settings on boot of the
rescue-image? I would like to try the restore with bacula on a local VM
but the network-configuration contains an IP that does not belong to my
network so the network is unreachable.

@e-it sure - just like you do on a production system you can use `ip` or
`ifconfig` to modify your network settings.

Okay, so I got it to work doing:

    ifconfig eth0 192.168.10.123 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    ip route add 192.168.10.1 dev eth0
    ip route add default via 192.168.10.1

But: Now I see that there is only one name server (127.0.0.1) - the
director's host name can not be resolved this way. Is there any way to
get a public name server into the config?

@e-it  
when you use the newest GitHub master code  
there is support for NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
so that you can define in etc/rear/local.conf whatever  
commands you need for networking setup in the  
recovery system, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/dev/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/dev/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
how NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
is meant to work and for some examples how it works see

@e-it You can edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file as well, or use @jsmeix
suggestion.

Hm, but if I edit the resolv.conf I would have to restart the networking
- and /etc/init.d does not contain a networking-init-script or am I
wrong?

@e-it changes in /etc/resolv.conf should take effect immediately. No
need to restart networking.

regards,

@e-it can this issue be closed?

Yes, thanks. The changes in `/etc/resolv.conf` do not take effect
immediately, but it's possible to edit `/etc/hosts`
