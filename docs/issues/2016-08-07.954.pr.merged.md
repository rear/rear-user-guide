Hello all,  
I've managed to find (hopefully) universal solution to boot ReaR on UEFI
based systems without endless (and as I've learned pointless) chasing
after grub.cfg when **GRUB\_RESCUE=y**  
The idea behind this pull request is simple:  
*Don't modify grub.cfg but rather create separate UEFI boot entry.*

**UEFI "Relax-and-Recover" boot entry motivation:**  
If UEFI boot is in use, we will not modify grub.cfg, but setup
"Relax-and-Recover" entry in UEFI boot menu instead. This looks to be
simplest and safest approach since finding out what mechanisms were used
to boot OS in UEFI mode, looks to be near to impossible.  
One could argue that efibootmgr/efivars can tell you, however this entry
is not mandatory and OS could be booted using default values or
startup.nsh.  
Once UEFI loads Grub2 hell breaks loose, as Grub2 can load whatever
arbitrary configuration file anywhere on the system or configuration
file can be even embedded in bootx64.efi (and friends) as file or
memdisk. Unfortunately there seems to be no reliable way how to track
this back.

This code should work regardless on distribution or whether you have
Secure Boot enabled or not.

I did testing on:

-   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1 (Secure boot)
-   Debian GNU/Linux 8.4 (jessie)
-   CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Secure boot)

Hope it will prove useful in the future...

V.

@gdha  
regarding UEFI I fully trust @gozora and  
because he tested it on SLES, Debian, and CentOS  
I would just accept it for Rear 1.19  
provided @gdha you agree.

@gozora  
in particular I like your "quite long comment" very much!

@gozora  
I assume in case of UEFI support for  
GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER does not make sense.  
If my assumption is right I would document in default.conf  
that GRUB\_RESCUE\_USER is only supported for GRUB2  
with Legacy BIOS booting.

@jsmeix yes, that is correct for this version of code.  
If there is a need for it in the future, I can implement password
authentication.  
Should not be that hard...

I consider no exited objection from @gdha until now  
as tacit consent so that I merge it now.
