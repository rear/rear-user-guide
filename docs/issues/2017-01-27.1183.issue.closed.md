Hum, does it work with `OUTPUT=BOOTP`?? I cannot remember we ever
implemented this. I guess you meant `OUTPUT=PXE`?  
Anyhow, thanks for reporting it and the fix. I will review it soon.

No, BOOTP is my extension which I need in project/environment where PXE
is not an option.  
It's based on PXE code.

@gdha  
I have zero experience with PXE or BOOTP  
so that I cannot really help with such issues.  
If
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1184](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1184)  
looks o.k. for you please merge it.

@petr-gansel Could you explain the difference between BOOTP and PXE - I
am curious...

@petr-gansel  
regarding your "BOOTP is my extension" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1183\#issuecomment-275997673](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1183#issuecomment-275997673)

If you think your extension could be also useful for  
other ReaR users, we would very much appreciate it  
if you could contribute it to Relax-and-Recover, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
and see also "How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" at

@petr-gansel I am curious also...  
I thought that should be the same (no changes) in PXE code in ReaR and
just setting: allow bootp; in dhcpd.conf should work for PXE and BOOTP
clients.

Or you're only talking about syslinux menu file generation code in ReaR?
Because the initrd and kernel should work the same.

Thanks in advance!

It's really nearly the same as PXE, the only difference is that I'm
generating /etc/bootptab entry for bootp server.  
The reason why I'm doing this is that I don't have either PXE or DHCP
server but using AIX NIM with a BOOTP server as a restore service
provider.

Ok, is what I thought. Thanks!

May you can take a look at DRLM Project
([www.drlm.org](http://www.drlm.org)). Is a central management tool for
ReaR similar to NIM, but manages ReaR deployments easier.

Regards,

@petr-gansel What shall we do with your

Because of possible backward incompatible changes in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1184](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1184)  
I post-pone it for a later release after 2.1 (for now for 2.2).

Due to no feedback I remove the release commitment.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1184](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1184)  
I also close this one as "won't fix / can't fix".
