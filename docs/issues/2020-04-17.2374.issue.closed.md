Currently BACKUP=YUM does not support BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2371\#issuecomment-614852816](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2371#issuecomment-614852816)  
that reads (excerpts):

    ... support for BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED
    (and its related config variables) is missing in
    backup/YUM/default/500_make_backup.sh
    while it seems to be there in
    restore/YUM/default/410_restore_backup.sh
    and in
    restore/YUM/default/405_recreate_users_and_groups.sh

    I don't see something about backup encryption in
    https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/14-ZYPPER-and-YUM.adoc

To avoid that users falsely use BACKUP=YUM  
with BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED set  
which results an unencrypted backup but the user  
may think his data is safely encrypted in his backup  
ReaR now errors out in this case via
