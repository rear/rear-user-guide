I wonder if the new user config variable name `UDEV_RULE_FILES`  
is sufficiently specific because it is used only  
`to replace the network MAC addresses`.

Therefore I think it should be named more specific  
e.g. something like `UDEV_NET_MAC_RULE_FILES`  
so that we could later add other `UDEV_..._RULE_FILES`  
user config variables if we need them.

We may omit the `_FILE` part to make it a bit shorter  
and use something like `UDEV_NET_MAC_RULES`  
because all udev rules are stored in files so that a `FILES`  
addon does not provide actually needed information.

My reasoning behind is that we cannot change existing user  
config variable names (without causing regressions for users)  
so that our user config variable names must be future proof.
