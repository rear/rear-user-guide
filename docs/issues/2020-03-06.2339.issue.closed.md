@oscarkcho  
at least on first glance  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4304699/storage.layout.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4304699/storage.layout.txt)  
looks normal and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4304703/rear-test01.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4304703/rear-test01.log)  
does not show somehing that is obviously going wrong  
so we neeed to dig deeper step by step:

Can you also attach your

    /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

file?

Careful with possible secrets therein (e.g. `password` values)  
if you use encryption, cf. "Disk layout file syntax" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

See the section "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads in particular (excerpt):

    Additionally the files in the /var/lib/rear/ directory
    and in its sub-directories in the ReaR recovery system
    (in particular /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
     and /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh)
    are needed to analyze a "rear -d -D recover" failure.

Try to run "rear -D recover again", found stopped in same "ERROR: No
filesystem mounted on '/mnt/local'. Stopping.". Then tried to ignore and
rename of /usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/250\_verify\_mount.sh
to 250\_verify\_mount.sh.bak to let recover program ignored this step,
and data recover can go on and restored

Finally, another problem occurred after data recover as the bootloader
cannot be installed successful. Followed the instruction to manual
install bootloader, but failed.

    |  IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL A BOOT LOADER MANUALLY,  |
    |  THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BOOT.     |
    ---------------------------------------------------

    You can use '\''chroot /mnt/local bash --login'\''
    to change into the recovered system.
    You should at least mount /proc in the recovered system
    e.g. via '\''mount -t proc none /mnt/local/proc'\''
    before you change into the recovered system
    and manually install a boot loader therein.

@oscarkcho  
a first look at your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4310685/rear-test01\_recover.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4310685/rear-test01_recover.log)  
shows while
/usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh  
is running (i.e. while the diskrestors.sh script is run) in particular  
only those `component_created` messages

    +++ component_created vgchange rear
    +++ component_created /dev/sda disk
    +++ component_created /dev/sda1 part
    +++ component_created /dev/sda2 part
    +++ component_created /dev/sda3 part

so you only got sda with its plain partitions recreated  
but I don't see messages about creating partitions on sdb  
and then RAID setup and LVM setup and creating filesystems.

There are using the same hardware for the rear backup and restoration
test, the hardware original have two harddisks with raid 1 setup, we
were taken out 1 harddisk to keep as the bootable image to avoid system
crash, another harddisk is using for rear restoration. So there are only
1 harddisk during the rear recover.

Would like to know what if using two harddisks with raid 1 for rear
backup, there must need two harddisks for rear recover? Would like to be
only 1 harddisk, the rear recover was not successful as difference to
original hardware config?

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before, see  
"Goal: Recreate a destroyed system" and  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and in most cases ReaR is used in this way.

When the replacement hardware ("hardware" could be also virtual
hardware)  
where "rear recover" will be done is different compared to the original
hardware  
where "rear mkbackup" had been done it is no longer plain disaster
recovery  
but then it is a system migration what we call "migration" in short.

System migration is not done so often so that it is neither as well
tested  
nor as well supported as the "recreating exactly as before" case.  
For example ReaR does not fully support to migrate the bootloader, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1437)

From my personal perception "system migration with ReaR"  
is more and more asked for by ReaR users.  
In particular migration from one kind of hardware to another  
kind of hardware and here mainly migration from physical  
hardware to virtual hardware i.e. "P2V"  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical-to-Virtual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical-to-Virtual)  
but that also does not (and often cannot) "just work", cf.  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-November/003626.html)

In your case it seems you like to recreate a RAID1 system  
on replacement hardware that cannot do RAID1 which is  
certainly something that cannot work "automagically".  
In general see the section  
"Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

When your disk layout on your replacement hardware is different  
compared to the original system, you must at least adapt in your  
ReaR recovery system that is running on your replacement hardware  
your disklayout.conf, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
before you run "rear recover" on your replacement hardware.  
Usually you also have to adapt /mnt/local/etc/fstab afterwards  
because your /mnt/local/etc/fstab is the restored one from  
your original system that usually does no longer match your  
changed disk layout on your recreated system.

if you need I think you can still add further comments  
here in GitHub regardless that the issue is closed.
