from manpage:  
OUTPUT\_URL=rsync://  
Write the image using rsync and the RSYNC protocol (SSH only).

The information provided above does not make sense since rsyncd is used
on remote side, no ssh is involed altogether with this option. This also
changes the path needed to be used from remote path to rsync module and
path in it.

BACKUP=RSYNC

@todoleza the rear man page is missing a section around **rsync**, we
will enhance this a bit to be more precise. OTH - what is wrong in your
opinion?

@todoleza  
regarding "BACKUP\_URL="rsync://..."

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/899](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/899)
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/919](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/919)

In current rear master I have implemeted a test for  
known valid BACKUP\_URL schemes, see \#842  
so that one can no longer specify invaild  
BACKUP\_URL schemes.

@gdha  
I think that '(SSH only)' should be omited altogether because it does
not make sense. You need to either use rsyncd module for path
specification or normal path for ssh transport. Examples here:  
`"rsync://root@host::rear"`, `"rsync://root@host/srv/rear"` would be
good to have there.

Man page and default.conf were already updated. Still need to check the
user docs.
