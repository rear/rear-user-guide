Current rear GitHub master  
on a from scratch installed SLES12-SP2-beta5  
with its default btrfs structure using  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf  
as template for etc/rear/local.conf

"rear mkbackup" just works but  
"rear recover" fails with:

<pre>

and in the rear log file there is:

It seems as always in SLE12 they changed something  
in the default btrfs setup on SLE12 from SP1 to SP2  
(before they had changed it from SLE12 GA to SP1)  
so that as always I need to adapt and enhance rear  
to make it work (hopefully in a generic way)  
for all the various different kind of btrfs structures.

FYI:  
With ext4 it "just works" also on SLES12-SP2-beta5  
(using usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf  
as template for etc/rear/local.conf).

Since SLES12-SP2 there is by default another '.snapshots'  
normal btrfs subvolume that appears in disklayout.conf as

<pre>
btrfsnormalsubvol /dev/sda2 / 281 @/.snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines
</pre>

When one manually disables that in the rear recovery system  
in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf as

<pre>
#btrfsnormalsubvol /dev/sda2 / 281 @/.snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines
</pre>

then "rear recover" succeeds on SLES12-SP2.

The code that needs to be enhanced is in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_mount\_subvolumes\_code.sh

<pre>
        # In case of SLES 12 SP1 special btrfs subvolumes setup
        # skip setup of the normal btrfs subvolume '@/.snapshots' because
        # that one will be created by "snapper/installation-helper --step 1"
        # which fails if it already exists:
        if test -n "$SLES12SP1_btrfs_subvolumes_setup" ; then
            test "$subvolume_path" = "@/.snapshots" && continue
        fi
</pre>

so that it also excludes @/.snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines

But then that subvolume is missing after "rear recover".

In the original system it is there:

<pre>
# btrfs subvolume list -a /
...
ID 281 gen 139 top level 259 path @/.snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines
...
</pre>

After "rear recover" it is missing.

The .snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines subvolume  
is not created during initial system installation by YaST  
via usual "btrfs subvolume create".  
This is expected because usually all those 'snapshot' stuff  
is somehow magically done by 'snapper'.  
Now I need to find out what 'snapper' stuff is missing  
during "rear recover" to also get that  
.snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines  
subvolume back.

On the original system that .snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines  
subvolume is not mounted so that it is perhaps not really needed.  
At least for me it seems 'snapper' still works normally on the  
recreated system.

I remove 'bug' from that issue because it can never ever be a bug  
when 'rear recover' fails because of special changes in newest  
Linux distribution's fancy default setup.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/950](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/950)
merged  
'rear recover' seems to work sufficiently well for me  
so that I set it to be 'fixed'.

Nevertheless I keep that issue open until I better know  
about that .snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines  
subvolume.

Now I know about that .snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/machines  
subvolume:

That ".../var/lib/machines" subvolume is falsely created  
in SLES12 SP2 beta5 - probably by systemd, cf.  
[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196541](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=196541)  
and  
[https://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=113b3fc1a8061f4a24dd0db74e9a3cd0083b2251](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=113b3fc1a8061f4a24dd0db74e9a3cd0083b2251)

Therefore there was nothing wrong in rear - even more:  
It was "rear recover" that detected that wrong subvolume!

FYI:

Regarding how to create a btrfs subvolume in compliance  
with the SLES12 default brtfs structure (i.e. how to create a  
btrfs subvolume as the other SLES12 subvolumes are created):

Creating btrfs subvolumes in the SLES12 default brtfs structure  
results falsely created btrfs subvolumes when one uses plain  
"btrfs subvolume create /path/to/new/subvolume":

<pre>
# btrfs subvolume create /var/lib/mysubvol
Create subvolume '/var/lib/mysubvol'
# btrfs subvolume list -a / | grep mysubvol
ID 304 gen 1453 top level 259 path @/.snapshots/1/snapshot/var/lib/mysubvol
</pre>

This way one gets /path/to/new/subvolume below that particular  
snapshot subvolume that is currently mounted at '/'.

Therefore such a falsely created subvolume must be removed:

<pre>
# btrfs subvolume delete /var/lib/mysubvol
Delete subvolume (no-commit): '/var/lib/mysubvol'
</pre>

To create a btrfs subvolume in compliance with the SLES12 default  
brtfs structure one must create it below the '/@/' directory  
but that directory is not accessible unless one mounts  
the whole btrfs at its root subvolume somewhere:

<pre>
# mkdir /tmp/btrfsroot
# mount -t btrfs -o subvolid=0 /dev/sda2 /tmp/btrfsroot
# ls /tmp/btrfsroot
@
# btrfs subvolume create /tmp/btrfsroot/@/var/lib/mysubvol
Create subvolume '/tmp/btrfsroot/@/var/lib/mysubvol'
# btrfs subvolume list -a / | grep mysubvol
ID 305 gen 1460 top level 257 path <FS_TREE>/@/var/lib/mysubvol
# mkdir /var/lib/mysubvol
# mount -t btrfs -o subvolid=305 /dev/sda2 /var/lib/mysubvol
# findmnt -t btrfs -o TARGET,SOURCE
TARGET                    SOURCE
/                         /dev/sda2[/@/.snapshots/1/snapshot]
...
|-/tmp                    /dev/sda2[/@/tmp]
| `-/tmp/btrfsroot        /dev/sda2
...
`-/var/lib/mysubvol       /dev/sda2[/@/var/lib/mysubvol]
</pre>

Now it is correctly created and accessible:

<pre>
# echo hello1 &gt;/tmp/btrfsroot/@/var/lib/mysubvol/hello
# cat /var/lib/mysubvol/hello
hello1
# echo hello2 &gt;/var/lib/mysubvol/hello                
# cat /tmp/btrfsroot/@/var/lib/mysubvol/hello
hello2
# umount /tmp/btrfsroot
# rm -v /var/lib/mysubvol/hello
removed '/var/lib/mysubvol/hello'
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/966](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/966)
merged  
this issue should now be solved in a more generic  
and a more fail-safe way.  
At least for me it now runs like clockwork.
