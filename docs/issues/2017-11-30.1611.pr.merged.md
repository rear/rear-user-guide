For issue \#731 we tried to avoid the usage of `lsb_release`, therefore,
we try to extract all required info from `/etc/os-release`, or
`/etc/system-release`, or `/etc/issue` before falling back to
`lsb_release`.  
In later stadium we will also write the `/etc/rear/os.conf` file instead
of being auto-created by installing the rpm. For Debian or Ubuntu that
did not happen. So, that is one of the reasons to harmonize the creation
of `/etc/os.conf`.

This PR is **not** complete, but I wanted to push it forward for your
comments etc...

Because all reviewers approved it  
I would merge it soon today  
to get it into ReaR 2.3.

Would like to make some more updates before I push into rear-2.3. Will
do this today

@rear/contributors May I clean up the **rear.spec** file which auto
creates the `os.conf` file, or shall we wait to do this after the
release of 2.3?

@gdha  
because rear.spec for the "official" rear RPMs for SLES  
and openSUSE is independent of rear.spec in OBS  
I don't mind what you prefer for rear.spec in OBS.

I assume when os.conf is created by rear.spec (during build time)  
it ensures that the right build-tim values are hardcoded/predefined  
which could be more fail-safe provided users install a matching  
rear RPM package but on the other hand this way most users  
won't test if the run-time automatism via SetOSVendorAndVersion()  
actually works.
