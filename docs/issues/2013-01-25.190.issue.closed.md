[\#190 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/190) `closed`: EXCLUDE\_BACKUP entries ignored
================================================================================================

I define NETFS backup and set

EXCLUDE\_BACKUP=( fs:/depot fs:/backup fs:/tmp fs:/var/crash fs:/usr/sap
fs:/oracle fs:/sapdb )

But excludes are ignored, everything under vg defined in
"ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG" just goes to tarball.

tar is called like

    tar --warning=no-xdev --sparse --block-number --totals --verbose --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system --ignore-failed-read --gzip -X /tmp/rear.dOQ0LSN2sSRgxUa/tmp/backup-exclude.txt -C / -c -f /tmp/rear.dOQ0LSN2sSRgxUa/outputfs/eahlx01/backup.tar.gz / /boot /home /opt /oracle /tmp /usr /usr/sap /var /var/log /var/opt /depot /var/crash /var/log/rear/rear-eahlx01.log

and exclude file only lists

    #cat /tmp/rear.dOQ0LSN2sSRgxUa/tmp/backup-exclude.txt
    /tmp/*
    /dev/shm/*

If that commit didn't fix it, please reopen.

You were also trying to exclude `lvmvol:/dev/vg00/lv_depot`. We should
document the syntax better. If you had used
`lvmvol:/dev/mapper/vg00-lv_depot` at least /depot would have been
excluded.

Thanks, the fix works fine.  
I added that lvmvol: as I got impression from the code, that only
underlying devs are treated in EXCLUDE\_BACKUP, but as it did not work
either, have just opened issue without further searching.

Now I know, /dev/mapper/ path to lvol device should have been used..
