HI, i have updated Relax-and-Recover to 1.17.2 vers. OS SlES 11sp3.  
When i make rear -v mkrescue and rear saving ".iso" file to NSR, backup
job freezes on networker side and wait for writeable tape in NSR pool
which i didn't specify in /etc/rear/local.conf.  
local.conf:  
OUTPUT=ISO  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "system" )  
BACKUP=NSR  
NSR\_DEFAULT\_POOL\_NAME=TSTSYSBOOT00

So it must be saved to TSTSYSBOOT00 but rear saved to another. Why rear
did incorrect choose? How i can definitely set pool name for ".iso" save
and pool which will use for recovery data?

thnks

Please see issue: NSR POOLNAME variable \#640  
I've made a patch that supports exactly that. Last Posting

works now!
