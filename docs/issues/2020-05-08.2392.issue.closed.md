In current ReaR GitHub master code we have the user config variables  
GRUB2\_MODULES and GRUB2\_MODULES\_LOAD  
for installing GRUB2 as recovery system UEFI bootloader.

Those user config variables are not in a released ReaR version, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2293\#issuecomment-564439509](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2293#issuecomment-564439509)

Because of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764)

    Switch to grub2 (grub-mkrescue)
    for creating the recovery ISO image

we may in the future use GRUB2 also  
as recovery system BIOS bootloader.

Therefore I would like to rename the current generic  
GRUB2\_MODULES and GRUB2\_MODULES\_LOAD  
into UEFI specific  
GRUB2\_MODULES\_UEFI and GRUB2\_MODULES\_UEFI\_LOAD  
so that later we could additionally have BIOS specific  
GRUB2\_MODULES\_BIOS and GRUB2\_MODULES\_BIOS\_LOAD  
if needed and on top of that we could even have  
GRUB2\_MODULES and GRUB2\_MODULES\_LOAD  
that apply for both cases if that would make sense.

The rename must happen before the ReaR 2.6 release  
so I add the label "blocker" to this issue.

With

merged  
this issue is fixed.
