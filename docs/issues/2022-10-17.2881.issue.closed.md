@kazi-md-munam  
the last item

    Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files)

is missing,  
i.e. you need to attach a

    # rear -D mkbackup

debug log file `/var/log/rear/rear-localhost.log`  
so we can (hopefully) see therein what the actual error behind is why
ReaR

    Could not copy /tmp/rear.EuPg57S6kXbLPM9/tmp/initrd.cgz to /tmp/rear-efi.yegNr//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz

I also try **rear -D mkbackup** But it's show same Error

I used this command for format my USB **sudo rear format -- --efi
/dev/sdb** \[/dev/sdb is my USB location\]

Your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9799206/rear-localhost.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/9799206/rear-localhost.log)  
tells it all:

    cp: error writing '/tmp/rear-efi.yegNr//EFI/BOOT/initrd.cgz': No space left on device

See `USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE` in your usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

In ReaR 2.4 usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L685](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L685)  
this was by default

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="200"

which is too small for nowadays bigger ReaR recovery systems.  
The initrd.cgz contains the whole ReaR recovery system  
(the recovery system runs inside a RAM disk).

In curent ReaR 2.7 usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1053](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1053)  
this is meanwhile by default

    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE="1024"

see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1205](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1205)  
for background information why it increased all the time.

So you should set an appropriate USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE  
as you need it in your etc/rear/local.conf  
and then re-do

    # rear format -- --efi /dev/sdb

to get your USB disk partitioned with a bigger ESP  
(this will overwrite all what there is on your USB disk)  
and then re-do

    rear mkbackup
