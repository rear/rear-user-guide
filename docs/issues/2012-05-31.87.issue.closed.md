From: Steve Mitchell  
I too had the bprestore start, the job would get queued on our netbackup
server but nothing would ever restore.

I tracked it down to an issue on how the code for NBU was implemented in
ReaR.

The code assumes that netbackup is started from xinetd.

We use Netbackup 7 on RHEL 5 and RHEL6 and we do not have xinetd
installed. On our servers it’s started with /etc/init.d/netbackup script
and rc links.

With Netbackup 7 and above it does not need xinetd.

See the official doc by Symantec :
[http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH135628](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH135628)

So I did a work around to manually run the vnetd and bpcd commands and
now the restores work fine.

In the /usr/share/rear/rescue/NBU/default/45\_prepare\_xinetd.sh file
right after the xinetd (line 9) I added the following :

    if [ ! -f /etc/xinetd.d/vnetd ]; then

            /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/vnetd -standalone

    fi

    if [ ! -f /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd ]; then

            /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd -standalone

    fi

The other small issue is that bpcd would not start for us because of a
missing directory /usr/openv/var/vnetd.  
So to fix this simply do a “mkdir
/usr/share/rear/skel/NBU/usr/openv/var/vnetd” on your server.

Now do a new “rear mkrescue” and try that iso. It worked for us.
