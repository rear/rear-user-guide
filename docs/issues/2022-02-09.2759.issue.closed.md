In current GitHub master code we have since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7a944cf059135a044940408bbdc9c0c77c299322](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7a944cf059135a044940408bbdc9c0c77c299322)  
the new disklayout.conf keyword `raiddisk`

Currently that violates the documented "Disk layout file syntax" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
that reads in particular

    None of the component keywords is a leading substring of another
    component keyword (e.g. disk is not a leading substring of opaldisk)
    so that one can get the lines that belong to a particular component
    via simple commands like

    grep ^keyword /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

I prefer to keep that simple grep method over  
keeping backward compatibility in disklayout.conf  
so I need to rename 'raid' into 'raidarray'  
and of course adapt all code that uses the 'raid' keyword.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/53757eab1447c712fb7c8e44be9c8b3b3ffd9faa](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/53757eab1447c712fb7c8e44be9c8b3b3ffd9faa)  
I describe that one cannot rely on backward compatibility.

@rear/contributors  
please tell me when you think I should not rename 'raid' into
'raidarray'.
