Reported by Shabahang Elmian on the mailing list:

Partition id of the swap partition is not updated properly. It should be
82.

Parted does not show the swap flag on Linux. We need to fall back to
sfdisk.

on RHEL clones the `blkid` command will show the label

Since it is too risky to modify the layout code at this time, I am
moving this issue to the v1.15 milestone.

code `./layout/save/GNU/Linux/24_swaps_layout.sh` contains `swaplabel`
and `blkid` calls which covers most - think it is ok to close this one
