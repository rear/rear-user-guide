@jsmeix excellent suggestion - why did I not thought of it?

@jsmeix No, not really - you prefer to have it outside the block? I do
not expect we need it any further.

@gdha  
implement it just as you like - it works well at both places.

I myself would move it out of the "writing output to DISKLAYOUT\_FILE"
block  
because determining `docker_is_running` is not "writing output to
DISKLAYOUT\_FILE"  
but that is a matter of personal taste.
