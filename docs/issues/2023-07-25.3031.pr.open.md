-   How was this pull request tested?

I tested it same (on same VMs) as I did in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1643774477](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1643774477)  
but now with the changes here  
Secure Boot with OUTPUT=USB works for me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In output/USB/Linux-i386/100\_create\_efiboot.sh  
add Secure Boot support for OUTPUT=USB by using  
SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER as first stage Secure Boot bootloader
BOOTX64.efi  
and using grub\*.efi as second stage Secure Boot bootloader files  
in the same way as already done for OUTPUT=ISO  
in output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh  
see

My current implementation here is just a first step.  
The whole code looks somewhat convoluted  
and needs at least some more generic cleanup  
to make it easier to further develop things in this area.

First things first:  
I will not clean up the whole UEFI and Secure Boot code  
via this pull request.  
Via this pull request only what is needed  
to get Secure Boot support with OUTPUT=USB  
in the current code environment  
should be implemented.

Later - as needed and as time permits - I would like  
to clean up step by step the whole UEFI and Secure Boot code.

In particular currently I do not like that  
via SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is overwritten  
because that makes it needlessly hard (at least for me)  
to understand the UEFI and Secure Boot code  
because it is not clear if in a particular piece of code  
UEFI\_BOOTLOADER means a non-Secure-Boot bootloader  
OR  
if UEFI\_BOOTLOADER means a Secure Boot first stage bootloader  
AND  
in the latter case the user cannot configure  
the Secure Boot second stage bootloader.  
I would like to Keep Separated Items Separated - "KSIS" ;-)

@pcahyna @rear/contributors  
could you please -as time permits - have a look here?

I would very much appreciate it if you could test it  
on non-SUSE Linux distributions, in particular RHEL  
and perhaps also Ubuntu and Debian.

@pcahyna @rear/contributors  
I have a question regarding the  
Secure Boot second stage bootloader files:

Currently those are (hardcoded) all files  
that match the bash globbing `grub*.efi`  
in the directory where SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is.

I wonder if it is more fail-safe to use all `*.efi` files  
in the directory where SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is,  
probably even all `*.efi` files with ignore case matching?

@pcahyna @rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon  
unless there are objections.
