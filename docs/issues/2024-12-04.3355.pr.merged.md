@prolez  
thank you for your enhancement for ReaR!

We are currently in the final process of releasing ReaR 2.8,  
cf. <https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238#issuecomment-2516532775>  
so we cannot include this PR in the current ReaR 2.8.  
We will have a look for the subsequent ReaR 3.0.

I am not a SED user so I cannot try out things on my own.  
I can only comment from what I notice form plain looking  
at the code changes of this pull request in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3355/files>

I notice `at_password` and when I see something like  
"password" or "encryption" or "key" in the code  
it indicates the code deals with some kind of "secret value"  
and then I am wondering if the code deals sufficiently well  
with secrets.

See the inital comments in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
currently online at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L13>  
how to deal sufficiently well with secrets.

See also the function LogSecret() in  
usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
currently online at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L462>

See also our "Relax-and-Recover Security Architecture" document at  
<https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture>  
which reads (excerpt)

    To facilitate protecting secrets even from
    verbose tracing of the Bash scripts (set -x),
    it is important to wrap statements
    that handle secrets like this:

    # set a variable with a secret
    { VAR='secret_value' ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

    # use the variable with the secret
    { COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

For an example how the latter is used see  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh  
online at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh>

For an example how the latter is used to get user input  
in a confidential way, see the comment of the UserInput function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
currently online at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L1090>

To verify that your code deals sufficiently well with secrets  
run it in ReaR debugscript mode with '-D' e.g. like

    # rear -D mkrescue

and then carefully inspect your ReaR log file  
and verify that no secret value appears therein.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for your feedback!

I based this development on the OPAL\_PBA\_TKN functionality, which is
only used in the mkopalpba function.  
The mkrescue function does not utilize this functionality, so I am
unable to debug it like this.  
The password is managed the same way (like OPAL\_PBA\_TKN) in the PBA,
which resides in the shadow MBR.  
I believe this implementation is correct and safe, but I could be
mistaken.

The way Secure Boot works in combination with TPM2 is it attempts to
measure different parts of the hardware and software during boot, the
measured hashes are stored in registers called "PCR registers". The
correct way to use TPM is to create a sealed and encrypted object in TPM
which will only be released when the specified PCR measurments are the
expected measurments to prove that the hardware or software has not been
tampered with.

From what I can see in the patch, this uses the TPM as a database and it
can be fetched regardless of whether the hardware/firmware/boot software
has been tampered with (For instance had UEFI configuration changed to
disable Secure Boot or had the firmware/hardware modified in any way).

I'm not an expert in TPM2 but it seems to require the creation of keys
first:

> tpm2\_createprimary -C o -c primary.ctx

And then you can seal the token in TPM based on PCR measruments:

> echo -n "&lt;your\_token&gt;" | tpm2\_create -C primary.ctx -u key.pub
> -r key.priv -L "sha256:0,2,7" -a
> "fixedtpm|fixedparent|noda|adminwithpolicy" -i -

And load the sealed and encrypted object into TPM:

> tpm2\_load -C primary.ctx -u key.pub -r key.priv -c sealedobject.ctx

The "sha256:0,2,7" specifies that the token is sealed based on PCR0 PCR2
and PCR7, and if these TPM registers contain unexpected hashes then the
system has been modified/tampered with and the token will not be
released from TPM to unlock in PBA. It is also necessary to allow the
user to configure which PCR values to bind to, as different computers
have different security requirements and configurations.

I'm unsure if TPM2 works with multiple primary keys but you can check
how systemd-cryptenroll stores the LUKS2 password in TPM to enable
automatic authentication during boot, bound by PCR measurments:

> systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=7+8 /dev/$DEVICE

<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/cryptenroll/cryptenroll-tpm2.c>

A new TPM2 context is created or reused if already present
(tpm2\_create, but it uses an abstraction layer Tpm2Context instead of
calling the shell commands):

> r = tpm2\_context\_new\_or\_warn(device, &tpm2\_context);

Without sealing the key, it defeats the purpose of using TPM when the
keys are released regardless of whether the system has been modified, or
had the disk changed just to fetch the password from TPM.

@paulalesius Regrettably, my schedule doesn't permit me to develop and
test this approach for now. Could you take it on, as I believe it is a
better solution?

@prolez This seems the last open item for you (updating the document).
Once that is done we can merge this PR - thanks for your contribution.

@gdha Sorry for the response time... I wanted to position myself in the
same area as the AuthToken container management, but I couldn't locate
it. Should we consider adding a new section for : Storing and reading
Self Encrypted Disk (SED) password automatically on boot? (either from
an external device or from the TPM)
