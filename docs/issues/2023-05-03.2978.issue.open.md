-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4

-   If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you
    can't upgrade: The system in question is required to use CentOS 7,
    and ReaR version 2.4 is the most up to date for that system.

-   OS version: CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"): Is this part of the form asking me to paste
    my configuration file here? I'm not sure what to put here. I'm
    attaching at the end.

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR): VM

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): I'm not sure

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): I'm not sure

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

This note (below) in deafult.conf seems to say that I can change the
name of my backup to include the date, as is already done with
differential and incremental backups. However, when I set
`BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE` to the value written there, it only has the effect
of changing the name of the resulting backup log file. It does not
change the name of the backup itself.

    # One might even create a dynamic name like BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup_$( date -Iseconds )"
    # in particular one can use BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="$( date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M' )-F"
    # to get the same full backup file name for BACKUP_TYPE="" as what is used
    # for BACKUP_TYPE=incremental and/or BACKUP_TYPE=differential (see below).

With `BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE` unset or set to `""` and after running
`rear mkbackuponly` the result is:

-   the backup destination folder will be location/systemname/backup
-   the backup logfile will be backup-date.time.log.gz

With `BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE` set to
`"backup_$( date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M' )-F-anytexthere"` and after running
`rear mkbackuponly` the expected result is:

-   the backup destination folder will be
    location/systemname/backup\_date-time-F-anytexthere
-   the backup logfile will be backup\_date-time-F-anytexthere.log.gz

However the actual result is:

-   the backup destination folder will be location/systemname/**backup**
-   the backup logfile will be
    backup\_date-time-F-anytexthere\*\*-date.time\*\*.log.gz

In my understanding, the comments in default.conf imply that setting
`BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE` will allow one to change the name of the backup
file, but this does not seem to happen, even with the provided example
used exactly. Without dynamically named backups, when
`rear mkbackuponly` is run, the previous backup is overwritten. This is
not the behavior I want.

I was also expecting the backup log to inherit the string in
`BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE` exactly, but that doesn't seem to be the case. If
this is as intended, I suppose it's alright to have a redundant datetime
stamp, but it would be nice to be able to control this exactly.

How can I exactly specify the name of each:

-   full backup file
-   backup log

?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

-   Workaround, if any: None found

@milleld1

your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11391181/local.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/11391181/local.txt)  
contains (without comments):

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup_$( date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M' )-F"
    BACKUP=RSYNC
    BACKUP_URL=rsync://otherhost/home/rearbackupslocation
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/mnt/16G_thumb_drive' /SOMEDISKIDONTNEED )}

I am not a 'BACKUP=RSYNC' user but as far as I see in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500_make_rsync_backup.sh)  
the BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE value is used in case of BACKUP=RSYNC  
only to store the rsync log file as `${BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE}.log`  
but the rsync destination is hardcoded as

    ... ${RSYNC_PATH}/${RSYNC_PREFIX}/backup

So it seems you have to set the config variable  
RSYNC\_PREFIX to specify the rsync destination prefix  
but with current code you cannot configure  
the hardcoded 'backup' sub-directory.

See the section about "BACKUP=RSYNC" in conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1793](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1793)

The current behaviour is now better explained in default.conf via

The hardcoding of directories to always end with `/backup` is
problematic for me because when rsync tries to `mkdir`, it will fail
without the `--parents` or `-p` option. I don't believe there's a way to
specify to rsync that you want it to use that option with mkdir. But
more generally, I simply want to control where rear puts the backup
file. Is there a different way users are meant to do this? I can't have
rear overwriting every backup it makes.

P.S. If not to change the location of the backup, what is the
RSYNC\_PREFIX option intended to be used for?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2023-05-05 12:46](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2978#issuecomment-1536209964):

As far as I understand it RSYNC\_PREFIX is meant  
to specify the location of the backup,  
but with current code only the prefix can be specified  
and the actual location is ${RSYNC\_PREFIX}/backup

I am not a 'rsync' user so I cannot properly answer  
questions about particular 'rsync' behaviour as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2978\#issuecomment-1535338662](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2978#issuecomment-1535338662)

I am wondering why different RSYNC\_PREFIX values  
like 'this' and 'that' would not work  
to get different 'rsync' destinations like  
'location/this/backup' and 'location/that/backup'  
i.e. I am wondering why the hardcoded suffix 'backup'  
causes a problem - but I am not a 'rsync' user  
so I may misunderstand things.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132502509?v=4" width="50">[milleld1](https://github.com/milleld1) commented at [2023-05-09 20:09](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2978#issuecomment-1540826062):

I can explain why the hard coded suffix `/backup` is problematic.

If you set `RSYNC_PREFIX="this"` then the final directory will be
location/systemname/this/backup

If location/systemname/this already exsits, but .../backup does not,
it's okay. Rysnc will internally use mkdir to create .../backup inside
.../this  
However, if location/systemname/this doesn't exist yet, the rsync
command will fail. It cannot create more than one directory layer at a
time. I think you'll see this is the case if you try to use the
configuration file I provided. The error log says exactly the problem.

Now mkdir actually has an option to cover this case. It is `--parents`
or `-p`. But rsync doesn't offer us an option to include that mkdir
option. We cannot access the mkdir command internal to rsync's
operation.

You might think we can just do this step ourselves before ReaR calls
rsync. But we aren't actually making a directory with a static name like
location/systemname/this/backup. We want a dynamic name that includes a
datetime stamp. This also makes sure that ReaR is using a different
every time, so that the backups are not overwritten.

I think If I end my configuration file with some arbitrary script that
ensures the directory that needs to exist has already been made, it
should work. But how will I know what its name is? ReaR is going to
generate that name dynamically, but I don't know where or when. If I
only include the hour in the directory name, there stands a good chance
that this may work as long as we aren't near the top of the hour. But
this is just not good enough precision. I need it to work every time so
that this can be set on a schedule and left alone.

Do you understand now the problem I am trying to solve?

@milleld1  
only an offhanded and untested idea:

Does it perhaps somehow improve things for you  
when you replace in your  
usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh  
script the hardcoded '/backup' with '$BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE'?

In theory that should result that with

    BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup_$( date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M' )-F-anytexthere"

you get the backup destination folder

    location/systemname/backup_date-time-F-anytexthere

Likely there are some more code places where  
such a hardcoded '/backup' needs to be replaced  
with '$BACKUP\_PROG\_ARCHIVE' to make this actually work.  
For example it seems such a hardcoded '/backup' is also used in  
usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/200_make_prefix_dir.sh)  
In current GitHub master code this script is moved to  
usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh

The backup logfile will be (as before)

    backup_date-time-F-anytexthere-date.time.log.gz

The additionally appended second 'date.time' comes from  
usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/700\_copy\_backup\_log.sh

    # copy the backup.log & rear.log file to remote destination with timestamp added
    Timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d.%H%M)
    ...
    ... ${RSYNC_PATH}/${RSYNC_PREFIX}/${BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE}-${Timestamp}.log.gz

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/700\_copy\_backup\_log.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.4/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/700_copy_backup_log.sh)

But when `BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="something_non_static"`  
works to get a rsync backup into a  
'location/systemname/something\_non\_static'  
directory, then there is the problem how to restore  
from a non-static directory during "rear recover".  
Having during "rear recover" something like

    BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup_$( date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M' )-F-anytexthere"

in etc/rear/local.conf cannot work because there is no directory  
with the current timestamp when "rear recover" is running.  
So to restore from a non-static directory you need to edit  
etc/rear/local.conf before you call "rear recover" and specify  
the right directory with an existing static timestamp like

    BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE="backup_existing_timestmp-F-anytexthere"

@pcahyna  
could you perhaps have a look here as time permits?

I ask you in particular because some time ago  
you did some code changes also for BACKUP=RSYNC  
(in particular
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2831))  
so perhaps you are more familiar with how that actually works?
