Hi

Because the ISO image contains confidential informations, we had to
ensure the image is only readable by root. AFAIK by default there is no
chmod/chown of the generated ISO image, so the files will be created
with default permissions.

As the umask will be used for new files / default permissions, it might
be interesting to set the umask to a "secure" value before any (ISO)
files will be written:

    --- usr/share/rear/output/default/01_set_umask.sh       1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000000 +0100
    +++ usr/share/rear/output/default.patched/01_set_umask.sh   2013-03-05 13:35:35.000000000 +0100

this might impact the backup methods after creating the ISO image.
Wouldn't it be easier just to execute a `chmod 400` on the ISO image
itself?

Yes that would be possible too.

But as long as the ISO file isn't finally written (and chmod'ed
afterwards), the "attacker" has access to the already written data.
Hence a chmod after the data is written isn't as secure as setting the
umask before anything is created.

There's a workaround by creating an empty ISO file, execute a
`chmod 400` and write the ISO image afterwards to the protected file.
Might be secure, but chmod man page says:

> The effect on file descriptors for files open at the time of a call to
> chmod() is implementation-defined.

I think `umask 077` is the right way to go. It works in our environment,
though I don't know if every other backup method / environment is
working as well. Might have an impact for additional files.

Btw. we're `chmod` / `chown` the generated ISO file to our dedicated
backup user after everything ran successfully.
