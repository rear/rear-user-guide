Spelling corrections  
BORG\_\* variables renamed to BORGBACKUP\_\* to avoid collisions with
Borg.  
When ReaR uses Borg as back end, it defaults to "none" compression to be
aligned with Borg defaults.

I have a question:  
Now there is is default.conf

<pre>
BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION="none"
</pre>

I assume this enforces "none" compression for rear  
regardless what the users may have set in its Borg  
configuration (I assume the user can configure  
a compression that Borg should use), cf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037\#discussion\_r84023889](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037#discussion_r84023889)  
where I assumed that with an empty  
BORG\_COMPRESSION=""  
the Borg default gets used.

Bottom line: I wonder if

<pre>
BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION=""
</pre>

would be more in compliance with Borg?

@jsmeix , exactly *none* compression is enforced now. I guess this is
not right thing to do :-(.  
`BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION=""` will not however work as value is appended
like this  
`borg create --compression <BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION> ..` so it would
throw syntax error.

I'll think about some way how to solve this.

Thanks for checking!

ehm, not sure if it is clear from above text, but user can change
compression setting e.g. `BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION="zlib,9"` in
*local.conf*

Of course the user can specify what he wants in local.conf  
but my point and Thomas Waldmann's point in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037\#discussion\_r83887959](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1037#discussion_r83887959)  
is that when the user does not specify anything,  
then rear should use Borg in its default mode.

In other words:  
When the user does not specify anything in rear,  
rear should not specify something special for Borg.

Ok, I'll correct it.
