##### Pull Request Details:

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? Tested a recovery with bacula
    until `bconsole` is executed

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

With this change, the bconsole output is sent to FD 7, which is stdout.
Previously the output was sent to FD 1 which is redirected to the ReaR
log.

@rmetrich  
I don't know how `bconsole` behaves but in general according to  
the sections "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr"  
and "It should be possible to run ReaR unattended" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
I would run all commands that (possibly) do user dialogs  
(i.e. all \[possibly\] interactive commands)  
with the original stdin, stdout, and stderr file descriptors  
when usr/sbin/rear was launched like

    COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8

@rmetrich I assigned the PR to you as I assume that it is linked to a RH
case?

Seems even more robust, thanks!

Yes, this is

@rmetrich  
as it seems you can run `bconsole` and see how it actually behaves:  
What about adding a `Log` message to have something about it  
in ReaR's log file like

    if bconsole 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8 ; then
        Log "bconsole finished with zero exit code"
    else
        Log "bconsole finished with non-zero exit code $?"
    fi

to make it easier to see what happened when someone  
(e.g. we at ReaR upstream) must analyze a ReaR issue  
only with what there is in the ReaR log file.

I suspect that BAREOS will need the same fix:
