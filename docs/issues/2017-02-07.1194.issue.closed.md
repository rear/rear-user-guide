#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    rhel 7.3
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):
-   Are you using legacy BIOS of UEFI boot?  
    no
-   Brief description of the issue:

I want Rear to use the local dir to back up to. I don't have an NFS
server available to I want to change these lines so it will backup to a
local mount I have.

However everything I tried does not seem to work.  
For example:

OUTPUT\_URL=/storage  
BACKUP\_URL=/storage

df  
/dev/mapper/rootvg-storagelv 5232128 33072 5199056 1% /storage

I tried to export from the system itself to see if that would work. No
luck with that either  
ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=4,nolock
my.ip.here:/storage /tmp/rear.Mqr2qwJ69eH1t8G/outputfs' failed.  
Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-pmisa2532.log for
details  
You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.Mqr2qwJ69eH1t8G

It is exported unrestricted  
exportfs  
/storage <world>

-   Work-around, if any:

I ran a default local.conf file (empty) and it ran  
/var/lib/rear/output/rear-mysystem.iso was created. but not the other
files. Or if they were I have no idea what dir they are in.

I dont know if this file will work or not yet. I am thinking it will be
missing things as it came back way to fast from other backups i have
done.

I was expecting to see a dir like this  
mysystem\]\# ls  
backup.log README rear.log VERSION  
backup.tar.gz rear-mysystem.iso selinux.autorelabel

Hi @unix1adm,

I'm not sure if backup to local storage is a good idea...  
You can however try `BACKUP_URL=file://`

For more info please read
[documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc).

This was just for a test. Not a perm thing.  
I tired the suggestion you had and it did not work.

Message: Problem transferring files to file:/storage  
I think the issue is this is a dir and it needs a file name here.

Thank you for the link. This is different than the one I found on
goolge. I will review.

It is odd when I try it in the ENV that has NFS enabled i get more files
and I am able to rebuild systems fine.

When I try to do it to a local storage location I only get the ISO file
not the other files listed above.  
Maybe because it is NFS it created more files?

Ill see if I can boot this ISO to see if it works as expected or not.

So I tried the recovery CD and as i suspected it did not work. It is
looking for the tar/gz file that never seems to be created.

You are changing backup parameters too quickly for my taste.  
I've tried to do backup on local disk. (despite my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1194\#issuecomment-278053647](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1194#issuecomment-278053647))  
I've used following config file:

    centos:(/root)(root)# cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS

    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/rear

    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" )
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/mnt/*' )
    EXCLUDE_BACKUP=( ${EXCLUDE_BACKUP[@]} fs:/crash fs:/usr/sap fs:/oracle )
    EXCLUDE_MD=( $(grep -o -E '^md[0-9]+' /proc/mdstat) ) # exclude all md devices
    COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} /sbin/sysctl /etc/sysctl.conf /sbin/if* /etc/sysconfig/network )
    GRUB_RESCUE=n

Backup was stored on local disk `/dev/sdb`

    centos:(/root)(root)# df -h /mnt/rear/
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sdb1       5,0G 1007M  4,1G  20% /mnt/rear

`rear mkbackup` produced:

    centos:(/root)(root)# ll /mnt/rear/centos/
    total 997788
    drwxr-x--- 2 root root       114 feb  7 20:59 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 root root        19 feb  7 20:36 ..
    -rw------- 1 root root   4519561 feb  7 20:59 backup.log
    -rw------- 1 root root 853743016 feb  7 20:59 backup.tar.gz
    -rwx------ 1 root root       202 feb  7 20:55 README

    -rw------- 1 root root       275 feb  7 20:55 VERSION

Once I've destroyed system, booted ReaR rescue/recovery system from
*rear-centos.iso* and run `rear mkrescue`, ReaR worked just fine.

Forgive me for jumping in the middle of this conversation, but if
@unix1adm is using `BACKUP_URL=file:/storage`, I don't think that
adheres to the proper syntax.

Shouldn't it be `BACKUP_URL=file:///storage` with three slashes if
/storage is an absolute path?

Thank you for that info. What I am trying to do it backup to a
directory. /storage is a directory not a file.  
The backup creates multiple files. So I cannot give it 1 file name.

Still researching the syntax for that.

For example ::  
$ls  
.lockfile backup.log rear.log  
README backup.tar.gz selinux.autorelabel  
VERSION rear-myserver.iso

All I am getting created is the .iso file. The .tar.gtz and other files
never get created localy when I try to backup to /storage.

If I use NFS it works fine. However NFS is not always available on the
test system so I wanted to just do it locally to test a few things.

@unix1adm  
*file://* in this case more describes "protocol" that flat Linux file.
*file://* prefix only tells rear that backup will be stored on local
disk.

> Still researching the syntax for that.

As @N3WWN already pointed out. If you want to store your backups into
*/storage* directory use `BACKUP_URL=file:///storage` in your
*local.conf*.  
In some cases it might be a good idea to exclude */storage* from backup
(to avoid never ending backup story) e.g. add
`BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/storage/*' )` to
*local.conf*

@unix1adm Be aware if `/storage` is a directory beneath `/` then it will
never work (forbidden to use `/` as archive target). Make sure it is a
separate mounted file system.

@gdha Thank you yes /storage is its own lv and mount point.

@gozora thank you yes I was concerned about backing up the backup
itself. Never a good idea.  
I did try the BACKUP\_URL=file:///storage but did not work the way I was
hoping it to.

next week.

Hi sorry it has been a while since I updated this.  
We found a bug and reported it back to Red Hat and they were working on
it.  
It was resolved with the release that sent out with Rhel 7,.4.
