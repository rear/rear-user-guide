-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2020

-   How was this pull request tested? Tested by customer

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

When a system has many multipath devices (547 disks, 272 x 2 paths),
creating the ReaR rescue takes several hours. This is due to:

-   the `get_device_name()` function to scan all multipath devices
    multiple times without caching the information (legacy code, when
    kernel has no `/sys/block/<dev>/dm/name` node)
-   the `get_device_name()` function to scan the multipath devices even
    if there is no need for that
-   the collect of unused `/sys/class/fc_transport` information

With these optimizations, the ReaR rescue takes a few minutes only.

@schabrolles Could you please test also on one of your systems with
multipath

Internal report from Red Hat QA:

    tests using multipath instead of lvm (simulating the original problem more closely):

         yum install rear device-mapper-multipath
         modprobe scsi_debug max_luns=2 num_tgts=200 add_host=3 vpd_use_hostno=0
         mpathconf --enable --with_multipathd y

    wait for multipath to settle
         multipath -l | wc -l
    should show 3200, if less, wait more

         time rear -v -d -D mkrescue

    takes 42 min without the fix, 2min 33s with the fix.
