Can you share log file created by `rear -d -D mkrescue` ?

I found the following reason of failure:

    ++ cat /tmp/rear.bJdwyiQdEmhyZ5F/tmp/bootloader
    ++ Log 'Displaying the raw bootloader info of device /dev/sda:'
    LUKS

    ++ myBOOTloader=
    ++ case $myBOOTloader in
    ++ BugError 'Unknown bootloader () - ask for sponsoring to get this fixed'

Your disks are encrypted with LUKS and our detection procedure does not
work in that case (it seems).  
The best advise I can give you at this moment is to define `BOOTLOADER=`
in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file.

@gdha  
if easily possible we should add a test for such a LUKS encrypted boot
device  
and error out with an explicit meaningful Error() message in this known
case  
instead of the fallback BugError() when we do not know the reason why.

@gdha thanks, I'll declare it explicitly in the conf.

Apparently defining BOOTLOADER="GRUB2" in the local.conf doesn't bypass
the bootloader check, and it still fails for the same reason...

@refrain  
you have ReaR version 2.00 which is too old for that.

My first attempt to implement BOOTLOADER support was  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1262)  
that happened in March 2017  
but ReaR 2.00 was released in January 2017 according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

Try out if a more current version works better for you, cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)

I would also recommend to try out our current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code as follows:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

I recommend to try out our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in older  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in older ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your older ReaR version.

@jsmeix thank you, I will try working with the latest version

@refrain If you can give us feedback on the results of your tests with
the latest github master that would be splendid.

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779)  
LUKS encrypted disks are skipped when guessing bootloader  
so that it could still detect (guess) the bootloader on other  
non-LUKS-encrypted (i.e. unencrypted) disks and if nowhere  
one could be guessed it fails in the same way as before.

Furthermore I enhanced the "Hah!IdontNeedEFI" case  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1752)  
so that now it also detects other non-EFI bootloaders  
(in particular also `GRUB2`).

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779)
merged  
I consider this issue to be sufficiently fixed.

@refrain  
because I cannot test myself if
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1779)  
really works (because I do not use LUKS)  
please test our latest ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
for both cases

1.)  
without BOOTLOADER="GRUB2" in local.conf  
where "rear -D mkrescue" should fail for you with messages like

<pre>
Cannot autodetect bootloader on LUKS encrypted disk (found 'LUKS' in first bytes on /dev/sda)
Cannot autodetect bootloader on LUKS encrypted disk (found 'LUKS' in first bytes on /dev/sdb)
Cannot autodetect what is used as bootloader, see default.conf about 'BOOTLOADER'
</pre>

2.)  
with BOOTLOADER="GRUB2" in local.conf  
where "rear -D mkrescue" should work for you with a message like

<pre>
Using specified bootloader 'GRUB2'
</pre>

and provide feedback whether or not ReaR actually behaves this way for
you.
