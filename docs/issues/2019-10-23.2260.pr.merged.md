-   Type: **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2245](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2245)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    The AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH was not tested  
    because I cannot test multipath.  
    The cleanup of the get\_partition\_number function  
    was tested by `rear -D mkresue` on my test system  
    and it results the same disklayout.conf as before.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Using `is_true "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH"`  
instead of `[[ "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH" =~ ^[yY1] ]]`  
according to "Relax-and-Recover functions" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Additionally a cleanup of the `get_partition_number` function:  
When the comments talk about `bug` then `BugError` should be called.  
Plus hopefully more comprehensible comments,  
cf. "Code must be easy to understand" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

@schabrolles  
perhaps you find time to have a look at it?  
But don't worry if not.

@gdha  
could you have a closer look at the get\_partition\_number function
here?

Could perhaps the current

    test $number -le 128 || BugError "Partition $partition is numbered '$number'. More than 128 partitions are not supported."

be changed into a user notification

    test $number -le 128 || LogPrintError "Partition $partition is numbered '$number'. More than 128 partitions can cause issues (GPT must be sufficiently large)."

On the other hand I know that relatively often ReaR errors out at that
place  
when weird other errors before had been ignored and it blindly
proceeded  
until it finally errors out here - so we may better keep that error exit
here  
as some kind of generic safeguard against bugs in ReaR elsewhere?

I would keep the BugError for the time being until we fully understand
what is going on in that piece of code in combination with weird setups
people have...

Only a side note:  
How comprehesible messages in `rear -D mkrescue` debug log  
become once explanatory variable names are used

    +++ get_partition_number sdb7
    +++ local partition_block_device=sdb7
    ++++ echo sdb7
    ++++ grep -o -E '[0-9]+$'
    +++ local partition_number=7
    +++ test 7 -gt 0
    +++ test 7 -le 128
    +++ echo 7
