==================================================================================================

Hi!

When running "rear recover" one has to enter the timestamp where you
want the Point-In-Time recovery  
or hit the ENTER key. Hitting the ENTER key IMHO should restore from the
last Full backup and all  
incremental backups afterwards to get a complete system recovery. But
actually it restores only the  
last backup, be it Full or incremental only.

I would change
/usr/share/rear/restore/NBU/default/40\_restore\_with\_nbu.sh to not set
the start-date  
option when running bprestore. For example:

ARGS="-B -H -L /tmp/bplog.restore -8 -R /tmp/nbu\_change\_file -t 0 -w 0
-C ${NBU\_CLIENT\_SOURCE} -D ${NBU\_CLIENT\_NAME} -f
$TMP\_DIR/restore\_fs\_list"

This would also lead to the removal of the Get\_Start\_Date function.

Regards,  
Wolfgang

The Get\_Start\_Date function was added by someone (forgot who) for a
purpose so I wouldn't remove it blindly. We just need to improve the
code in such way if no valid date is given that a full restore will be
requested. Makes sense, no?

Well, the important part is to get the last Full Backup. The current
code blindly gets the last backup image without knwoing if its full or
incremental. to do it right we have to replace the bplist command (by
bpclimagelist) and code around it. This will lead to a complete new
Get\_Start\_Date function. And this will change the semantic of the
function.

Investigated the Get\_Start\_Date function again. All it does is list
the backup times of a filesystem  
in the last 5 days. Eg.:

     u1ru173 ~ # LANG=C bplist -C u1ru135.lksdom21.lks.local -l -s `date -d "-5 days" "+%m/%d/%Y"`
     dr-xr-x--- root      root                0 Sep 03 11:29 /root/
     dr-xr-x--- root      root                0 Sep 02 09:48 /root/
     dr-xr-x--- root      root                0 Aug 28 17:18 /root/
     dr-xr-x--- root      root                0 Aug 28 17:18 /root/
     dr-xr-x--- root      root                0 Aug 28 17:18 /root/

What you cannot see here is that all of these backups are incremental
only!

Then `Get_Start_Date` grabs the first line and converts the timestamp
into the "mm/dd/yyyy" format and returns it to the caller where it is
fed to `bprestore` as start date.

This could be done easier (and safe) with `bpclimagelist`:

     u1ru173 ~ # bpclimagelist -client u1ru135.lksdom21.lks.local -t Full
     Backed Up         Expires       Files      KB     C Sched Type      Policy
     ----------------  ---------- -------- ----------- - --------------- ------------
     08/31/2014 06:49  09/14/2014   142141    10695915 N Full Backup     OS_LINUX_TESTSYSTEM
     08/24/2014 06:48  09/07/2014   140883    10175090 N Full Backup     OS_LINUX_TESTSYSTEM

Here you have the timestamp in the first column. You don't have to
mangle the output and can hand it  
over to bprestore as it is. But: you get the exact same behavior without
feeding any timestamp at  
all to bprestore!

So because Get\_Start\_Date function is of no use I would remove it.

if you go that path (which is ok for me as it looks solid) then do not
forget to add `bpclimagelist` into the file `conf/default.conf` and
adapth the line
`COPY_AS_IS_NBU=( /usr/openv/bin/vnetd /usr/openv/bin/vopied /usr/openv/lib /usr/openv/netbackup /usr/openv/var/auth/[mn]*.txt )`  
Looking forward to a pull request '-)

I am too busy at work today. I think you get the pull request tomorrow.

@wzwei will you introduce `bpclimagelist` later on to replace
in-time-restores?

Point-In-Time Recovery is O.K. the way it's implemented. Therefore we
don't need bpclimagelist.

OTOH we could implement bpclimagelist and present the listing to the
recovery user prior to date selection. This would make life easier as
there is no need to have a look at Netbackup Console when doing a
recovery.

BTW, the bpimagelist command is already included in the rescue images.
It resides in the bin directory under /usr/openv/netbackup.
