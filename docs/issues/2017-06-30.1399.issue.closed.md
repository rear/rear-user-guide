For ReaR 2.3 I will implement  
to a reasonable initially usable extent some general  
major user input/output behavioural improvements  
plus a general cleanup of user input/output code  
(i.e. special cases will not be implemented for ReaR 2.3).

The goal regarding input/output behavioural improvement is  
to implement what is needed that ReaR can run fully unattended  
but the goal is not that ReaR 2.3 will be prepared to be able to  
run fully unattended in any case (cf. "no special cases" above).

A related issue regarding running ReaR unattended is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1366)

The goal regarding user input/output cleanup is that  
for user input/output only dedicated ReaR functions  
should be used so that we have a central point where  
user input/output functionality is implemented and maintained.

A related issuse regarding input/output cleanup is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)

It is a precondition for ReaR to run fully unattended  
that needed user input values can be predefined  
so that user input requests can be autoresponded.

To ensure the right autoresponse happens for each particular  
user input request the new UserInput function should be used  
(instead of just feeding input values into STDIN hoping  
the right value arrives at each particular user input request).

See the UserInput function documentation in  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh)

While I am implementing the user input/output cleanup  
and improvements there could be regressions  
mainly because STDOUT is redirected to the log file, cf.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398\#issuecomment-315318878](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1398#issuecomment-315318878)  
this issue here is no longer for ReaR v 2.2 but for ReaR v 2.3.

During SUSE Hack Week 16  
I intend to primarily work on this issue, cf.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1573](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1573)
merged  
"some usual" user dialogs in "rear recover" use now UserInput()  
that 'rear recover' can run unattended in "some usual" cases.

The next step is to use UserInput() in "some usual" user dialogs  
during ReaR recovery system startup (mainly the dialog that  
asks what network interface card should be used even if there  
is only one network interface card).

But that could become more complicated because I cannot  
"just source" usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
during recovery system startup (to get the UserInput function)  
because that script does not contain only function definitions  
but it also contains low-level ReaR initialization code like  
exit task setup and stdin/stdout/stderr redirections  
which should be split from \_input-output-functions.sh  
cf.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1583](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1583)
merged  
the most hindering user dialog during recovery system startup  
(i.e. the network MAC adresses migration dialog)  
runs now by default (i.e. without an etc/rear/mappings/mac)  
unattended when possible:

If there is only one old MAC and only one new MAC  
then the old MAC is automatically mapped to the new one.

When there are more MACs ReaR will not blindly guess  
what the right mapping could be so that in this case  
by default (i.e. without an etc/rear/mappings/mac)  
a user dialog is shown (as it was before).

In any case the user could and can predefine in  
/etc/rear/mappings/mac what mapping should be done  
during recovery system startup and a predefined mapping  
was and is done automatically without a user dialog.

Accordingly the sophisticated UserInput() is not needed  
in this case (i.e. for the network MAC adresses migration), cf.

Sufficiently done for ReaR 2.3.

Remaining things can be fixed for ReaR 2.4 or later  
as time permits and as users ask for it.
