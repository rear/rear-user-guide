-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Due to this, the `grep` must be adjusted to not expect a trailing blank
at the end of the line.  
This is typically used when migrating a PV to another disk while it
already exists on the first disk. In such case, the uuid cannot be
reused.

Example of disklayout.conf line before removing the uuid:

`lvmdev /dev/rhel /dev/sda2 w6XFUx-DeeL-uAEY-0nEn-1A3o-pLp1-qcwYdO 12345678`

When removing the uuid (and unused size), the current code was breaking
if there was no trailing space:

`lvmdev /dev/rhel /dev/sda2<space>` : OK  
`lvmdev /dev/rhel /dev/sda2` : BAD

The new code also supports the second line, which is better for
robustness.

@rmetrich  
could you explain in more detail how it happens that things go wrong  
because I think I see what could go wrong here but I fail to
understand  
the way how things go wrong - i.e. I fail to imagine what happens here  
`when migrating a PV to another disk while it already exists on the first disk`.

In general since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1871](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1871)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1872\#issuecomment-405842853](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1872#issuecomment-405842853)  
I learned to be extra careful when using `grep -w` because the actual  
word separator characters in `grep -w` could be different compared to  
what one might naively expected it to be.

I think the root cause of issues with `grep -w` in ReaR is that  
the word separator characters in `grep -w` are much more than  
the usually expected bash word separator characters in $IFS  
that are usually assumed in ReaR.

For example how `grep -w` could result more matches than expected

<pre>
# echo -e 'foo first this-that \nfoo second this ' | grep '^foo .* this '
foo second this 

# echo -e 'foo first this-that \nfoo second this ' | grep -w '^foo .* this'
foo first this-that 
foo second this 
</pre>

Simply put I like to verify that introducing `grep -w` here could not  
lead to some more new and unexpected issues than it tries to avoid.

@jsmeix the `grep -w` works for us here, because the 3rd field is the
lvmdev device, which doesn't contain a dash which is considered as a
word boundary.  
Here we will have `/dev/sda` for example.  
Initiallly the `grep` was done with a trailing space (e.g. `/dev/sda `)
to avoid catching other devices starting similarly, such as `/dev/sdaw`.
`grep -w` works for these cases also:

    $ LAYOUT="$(echo -e "lvmdev /dev/myfirstvg /dev/sdaw\nlvmdev /dev/mysecondvg /dev/sda\nlvmdev /dev/mythirdvg /dev/sda1\nlvmdev /dev/myfirstvg /dev/sdax some-uuid somesize\nlvmdev /dev/mysecondvg /dev/sda2\n")"

    $ echo "$LAYOUT"
    lvmdev /dev/myfirstvg /dev/sdaw
    lvmdev /dev/mysecondvg /dev/sda
    lvmdev /dev/mythirdvg /dev/sda1
    lvmdev /dev/myfirstvg /dev/sdax some-uuid somesize
    lvmdev /dev/mysecondvg /dev/sda2

    $ PVNAME="pv:/dev/sda"
    $ echo "$LAYOUT" | grep -w "^lvmdev.*${PVNAME#pv:}"
    lvmdev /dev/mysecondvg /dev/sda

My point is that all characters that are not letters, digits, or the
underscore  
are word separators for `grep -w` which means that in 'lvmdev' entries  
the device value must always contain only letters, digits, or underscore
characters  
to be reliably treated as one word by `grep -w`.

I assume traditional kernel device names like /dev/sda or /dev/sda1  
are o.k. here regardless that also '/' is a word separator for
`grep -w`  
but I wonder if the device value in 'lvmdev' entries is always  
a traditional kernel device name.

With `grep -w` things could easily break if the device value in 'lvmdev'
entries  
could be also a symlink name in one of the /dev/disk/by-\*/ directories.

To stay on the safe side I would prefer to `grep -E` for the two known
cases  
which are `"^lvmdev .* $VAR "` or `"^lvmdev .* $VAR\$"` as far as I see.

For example like

<pre>
# VAR="this"

# echo -e 'foo first this-that \nfoo second this \nfoo third this-that\nfoo fourth this' | grep -E "^foo .* $VAR |^foo .* $VAR\$"
foo second this 
foo fourth this
</pre>

(plus a comment in the code why that two cases can happen ;-)

By the way:  
I tried to specify ' ' and the '$' meta-character in some kind of grep
character class  
or bracket expression but I failed so that I falled back to using 'grep
-E' with two  
separated mostly same expressions.

You're right, let me rework this.

It seems on Friday my brain is already somewhat slow but  
meanwhile even I found out how to specify it simpler in grep:

<pre>
# VAR="this"

# echo -e 'foo first this-that \nfoo second this \nfoo third this-that\nfoo fourth this' | grep "^foo .* $VAR *$"
foo second this 
foo fourth this
</pre>

i.e. specify the stuff after $VAR as none, one, or more spaces until the
line ends.

@rmetrich  
a little riddle: one thing is missing.  
If you don't know what, I could add it.

@rear/contributors  
please have a look at the code.  
If there are no objections from you, I would like to merge it tomorrow.

@rmetrich  
thank you for making ReaR more fail-safe.
