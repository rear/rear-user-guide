#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    any

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):  
    any

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):  
    any

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    any

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    any

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    any

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):  
    any

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):  
    any

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I'd like to understand the recover process exactly when there are
    incremental backups associated.  
    If I have a full backup (*-F) and several incremental backups files
    (*-I) and if I recover, what backup file(s) are used by default and
    how can I decide what specific incremental backup file to get point
    in time recovery?

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

@bobbysch I actually never used this feature in ReaR, but there is quite
a long comment about this topic in
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1105-L1173).
Check it out, maybe it will be helpful.

Kind of another approach to incremental backups (and also
de-duplication) can be (starting with ReaR 2.0)
[BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) integration.
Some details on how to configure ReaR with BorgBackup can be find
[here](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#rear-with-borg-back-end).

@gozora: Thank you for pointing me to that exact place in the
documentation.  
According to the documentation:

    "rear recover" will restore first the latest full backup
    that exists plus all incremental backups in the
    ordering as they were made after the latest full backup

So I guess if I only want to restore part of the incremental backups, I
have to move away others to a different place before launching the
recover process.

@bobbysch  
to understand really exactly how things work in ReaR  
the only way that really works is to read the ReaR scripts.

Regarding incremental and/or differential `tar` backup see the script  
usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/070_set_backup_archive.sh)

This script is run during "rear mkbackup" and  
the same is also run during "rear recover" via its symbolic link  
usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/070\_set\_backup\_archive.sh

In general restoring only parts of a series of incremental `tar`
backups  
would result an incosistent global state of all what is restored.  
But in special cases when you know exactly what you do  
the result is exactly what you requested.
