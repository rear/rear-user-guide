For background information see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260)  
and its generic "parent"-issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259)

For this specific issue here see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285)  
and therein in particular for DRLM see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2244575251](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244575251)

The function drlm\_import\_runtime\_config  
in lib/drlm-functions.sh  
may source third party code via

    source $DRLM_CFG

where the DRLM\_CFG file content  
could be even downloaded from a remote host.

@didacog @rear/contributors  
it should be verified before the ReaR 3.0 release  
if third party code could be sourced here  
or if all is reasonably safe.

Hello @jsmeix

This sources the rear config provided from DRLM over the network from
the DRLM client configs.

Is completely safe to keep that source.

Hello @didacog

do I understand it correctly that what is sourced here  
is basically same as a local etc/rear/local.conf file  
(and other usual ReaR config files)  
but with DRLM those configs are stored on a DRLM server  
which is basically the whole idea behind DRLM  
to have various ReaR configs of various clients  
stored and managed centrally on a DRLM server?

@jsmeix, correct! you nailed it! ;)

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1bce22e721ae1901ad56b119229ea7c5450abe83](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1bce22e721ae1901ad56b119229ea7c5450abe83)  
I added in lib/drlm-functions.sh a comment  
that explains how DRLM sources ReaR config files  
to make it clear that all is OK with doing

    source $DRLM_CFG

I removed the "critical/security/legal" label from this issue  
because it is no longer "critical/security/legal", cf.
