Some Linux distribution (like sles11) has a version of multipath which
return an error when `dm-multipath` kernel module is loaded but no
multipath devices are detected.

This produce an exit to `rear_shell` waiting for UserInput.

I propose to change it to a UserInput with 30s delay in order to avoid
to block the recovery process when `BOOT_ON_SAN=yes` but no multipath
device are found (in case of migration for example).

@schlomo,

-   originally, this script only activate multipath if the Backup system
    was multipath (which was not enough in case of V2P).  
    The following line was already present is this version of script and
    was activated if multipath loading return a non 0 value.

<!-- -->

    rear_shell "Did you activate the multipath devices?"

My concern here is that on some older Linux distribution (like sles11)
multipath return an non 0 value if no multipath device is discovered. It
is not the case with rhel7 or ubuntu16.04.  
It could be a normal situation (as you said P2V). In this case, during
recovery sles11 will exit to rear-shell after the following LogPrompt,
and wait for user action (no other explanation/guidance).

    Failed to activate multipath, or no multipath device found.
    rear>

Again, there is no issue with newer multipath version (rhel7 for
example). multipath return 0 if it runs without error and no multipath
device discovered.

I just would like to improve the user experience by having a better
message for this "non critical" error (no multipath discovered) and
avoid to block a recovery (with a timeout).

What about this one :

    Failed to activate multipath, or no multipath device found.
    Choice: 
    1) multipath is not needed, please continue recovery. (you should update your rear conf to remove BOOT_ON_SAN). 
    2) Enter into rear-shell to debug multipath. (manually run "multipath -r" command)
    (default 1) 
    (timeout 30 seconds)

Here is an updated version with menu (inspired from @jsmeix work on
`300_map_disk.sh`).

if `multipath` command failed, user will get this menu:

@schabrolles  
I do appreciate it so much that you use the new UserInput  
function because I need testing and feedback to improve it.

Ideally I would like to have the UserInput function in a stable  
and well usable state for the ReaR 2.3 release but if we need  
more time for testing and enhancing it until it really works  
sufficiently well for us it is also perfectly o.k. for me.

@jsmeix @schlomo

The objective here was to really "warn" the user about a possible
configuration cleanup. (after a P2V for example). It is a "literally"
warning :-) ... But I'm open to suggestion.

Messages to the user should be either informational or actionable.
WARNING is neither nor so it doesn't help the user. IMHO in this
specific case we should mention it but not make a fuss. If the user gets
tired of the manual step in his recovery he will also notice the message
and act. If he doesn't care then we also don't care.

Simply put:  
I think currently the "Multipath is not needed" case  
does not behave well, see also in the "rear recover" log in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449\#issuecomment-323789500](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449#issuecomment-323789500)

<pre>
Choice:
1) Multipath is not needed, please continue recovery.
...
Continuing 'rear recover' by default
...
multipath activated
</pre>

i.e. the "multipath activated" message that does not match  
the decision that "Multipath is not needed" indicates  
that things do not work perfectly clean in this case.

@schabrolles  
many thanks for all your efforts with all our various  
comments and improvement requests.  
Not it looks o.k. from my point of view  
so that you could merge it if you like.

Unfortunately (for you) I cannot restrain  
to add one more comment:

I wonder about the outermost 'if' clause.  
Currently the script has the form

<pre>
if CONDITION1 || CONDITION2 ; then
    # Setting up multipathing
fi
function create_multipath() {
   ...
}
</pre>

The trailing function definition looks somewhat strange to me.

What looks even more strange to me is that I can find  
'create\_multipath' only in that function definition  
but I cannot find where it is ever called.

@schabrolles  
could you add a comment why the create\_multipath function  
is defined (i.e. needed) in any case even if neither CONDITION1  
nor CONDITION2 is fulfilled or remove that create\_multipath  
function definition if it is really nowhere needed.

and have both STDOUT and STDERR also in the log use

<pre>
LogUserOutput "$( COMMAND 2>&1 )"
</pre>

@schlomo  
I tried to also use LogPrint/LogUserOutput as wrapper  
for commands that need unser input with

<pre>
touch /tmp/foo
LogUserOutput "$( rm -vi /tmp/qqq /tmp/foo /tmp/QQQ 0<&6 2>&1 )"
</pre>

but that let ReaR fail (it just exits at that rm command).  
I have to use

<pre>
touch /tmp/foo
LogUserOutput "$( rm -vi /tmp/qqq /tmp/foo /tmp/QQQ 0<&6 1>/dev/tty 2>&1 )"
</pre>

which works on the terminal

<pre>
e205:~/rear.master # usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
rm: cannot remove '/tmp/qqq': No such file or directory
rm: remove regular empty file '/tmp/foo'? y
removed '/tmp/foo'
rm: cannot remove '/tmp/QQQ': No such file or directory
</pre>

but that does of course no longer produce agruments  
for the LogUserOutput function so that there is  
nothing in the log.

Do you have an idea how to get STDOUT and STDERR  
also in the log when commands need user input?

@jsmeix you are right regarding `creat_multipath()` function.  
This function was there before I start working on ReaR... But no script
is calling it....

I remove it and made a test with sles11-sp4 (V2P: non-multipath to
multipath) =&gt; OK

@jsmeix I would have expected something like `1>&7 2>&8` or such in your
`rm` example. Although for me this doesn't make much sense, I would
expect us to use `LogPrint` only for stuff that doesn't need user input
because that would be user input that ReaR cannot automate.

If we have the need to `LogPrint` the result of a command more often
then I would suggest to create a new function `LogPrintExec` or
`LogPrintCommand` or `LogPrintRun` that simply runs `$@`

As usual sleeping over it helped:

Caution with 'create\_...' functions!

Many of them look as if they were only defined  
because one cannot find where they are callled,  
for example also the create\_disk function:

<pre>
# find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ | xargs grep 'create_disk'

usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux
/100_include_partition_code.sh:create_disk() {
</pre>

Many 'create\_...' functions are not called by their full name.  
Instead the are called indirectly via things like 'create\_$type'  
where $type evaluates e.g. to 'disk' 'part' 'fs' 'swap'  
(i.e. $type is a component type in disklayout.conf)  
by more generic 'create\_...' functions  
in lib/layout-functions.sh for example like

<pre>
create_device() {
    local device="$1"
    local type="$2"
    ...
    if type -t create_$type >/dev/null ; then
        create_$type "$device"
    fi
</pre>

By the way:  
This is another nice example for RFC 1925 item 6a  
cf.
[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1925.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1925.txt)  
"It is always possible to add another level of indirection."  
Personally I think that is the ultimate root cause  
of 90% of the problems and the other ultimate root cause  
for also 90% of the problems is RFC 1925 item 5  
which means (assuming stochastical independence)  
that 81% of the problems have RFC 1925 items 5 and 6a  
together as their ultimate root cause...

In a "rear -d -D recover" log file things look like  
(excerpts that show only the 'create\_...' functions):

<pre>
+ source /usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/540_generate_device_code.sh
++ create_device /dev/sda disk
++ type -t create_disk
++ create_disk /dev/sda
++ create_partitions /dev/sda msdos
++ create_device /dev/sda1 part
++ type -t create_part
++ create_device /dev/sda2 part
++ type -t create_part
++ create_device fs:/ fs
++ type -t create_fs
++ create_fs fs:/
++ create_device swap:/dev/sda1 swap
++ type -t create_swap
++ create_swap swap:/dev/sda1

+ source /usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200_run_script.sh
+++ create_component vgchange rear
+++ create_component /dev/sda disk
+++ create_component /dev/sda1 part
+++ create_component /dev/sda2 part
+++ create_component fs:/ fs
+++ create_component swap:/dev/sda1 swap
</pre>

@schabrolles  
accordingly you need to carefully double-check that the  
create\_multipath function is really no longer ever needed  
in particular on a system that uses multipath  
or more generally when there are active components

<pre>
multipath ...
</pre>

in disklayout.conf (the line starts with 'multipath ').

Note that components in disklayout.conf can be  
deactivated by commenting them out e.g. like

<pre>
# multipath ...
</pre>

Deactivating components in disklayout.conf can happen  
automatically by "rear recover" (e.g. when the original system  
had multipath but on the replacement hardware or after a  
system migration multipath is no longer needed.  
Deactivating components in disklayout.conf can also be  
done manually by the user either by manual editing disklayout.conf  
in the ReaR recovery system before he runs "rear recover" or  
during "rear recover" in migration mode when there are those  
dialogs that let the user edit disklayout.conf.

Deactivated components must be ignored  
which is - as far as I see - a bug in

<pre>
create_multipath() {
    local multipath device
    read multipath device junk < <(grep "multipath $1 " "$LAYOUT_FILE")
    create_partitions "$device"
}
</pre>

because it greps for "multipath" which also finds "\# multipath".  
Normally I would expect it to be

<pre>
    read multipath device junk < <(grep "^multipath $1 " "$LAYOUT_FILE")
</pre>

to get only the active '^multipath ' components in disklayout.conf.

@schlomo  
yes, to run an interactive command with the original STDIN,  
STDOUT, and STDERR one should use e.g. as in

<pre>
touch /tmp/foo
rm -vi /tmp/qqq /tmp/foo /tmp/QQQ 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

The '0&lt;&6' is currently not needed because STDIN is not  
redirected - I prefer the whole '0&lt;&6 1&gt;&7 2&gt;&8' term  
to be on the safe side and to make it 100% clear  
that "all I/O via the original FDs" is meant.

This way it "just works" on the user's terminal

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
rm: cannot remove '/tmp/qqq': No such file or directory
rm: remove regular empty file '/tmp/foo'? y
removed '/tmp/foo'
rm: cannot remove '/tmp/QQQ': No such file or directory
</pre>

but then nothing is in the log.

Things get somewhat tricky when one wants to have  
all output both on the user's terminal and in the log.  
Then a 'tee' process in between is needed.

@schabrolles

another special thing in ReaR in verbose mode (rear -v)  
is that then in usr/sbin/rear theer is

<pre>
# Set the variables v and verbose to be used in called programs
# that support the '-v' or '--verbose' options like
# "cp $v ..." or "rm $verbose ..." and so on:
v=""
verbose=""
if test "$VERBOSE" ; then
    v="-v"
    verbose="--verbose"
fi
</pre>

Accordingly commands that support '-v' or '--verbose'  
should usually be called as

<pre>
COMMAND $v
</pre>

or

<pre>
COMMAND $verbose
</pre>

Because on my SLES11 and SLES12 systems  
"man dmsetup" shows "-v" and "--verbose"  
I suggest you may call dmsetup with $verbose like

<pre>
    # Search and list mpath device.
    if is_true $list_mpath_device ; then
        LogPrint "Listing multipath device found"
        LogPrint "$(dmsetup ls --target multipath $verbose 2>&1)"
    fi
</pre>

except dmsetup verbosity is explicitly not wanted in this case  
(perhaps then dmsetup may show too much that is not helpful).

@schabrolles  
initially you had started this with 5 lines of code changed  
and it had become some kind of a monstrous thing  
because of all our comments, improvement requests,  
and side-topics.

I do very much appreciate your endurance here  
that in the end results a totally overhauled script  
that looks now very nice and clear.

I hope you agree that this result is worth all those efforts.

@jsmeix no problem at all... I do appreciate your careful review /
feedback (same for you @schlomo)

-   you are right regarding `create_multipath()` function... we finally
    REALLY need it.  
    I do additional test which confirm it cannot work without it
    (partition are not created)  
    In fact my server reboot properly after my previous test because the
    partition were already there (no need to recreate them) But If I
    wipe the disk before the recovery with `dd`, it fails to create LVM
    because no partition are created ... which is normal ....

-   Thanks for the info about `$v` and `$verbose`. I try
    `dmsetup ls --target multipath -v` but it seems to have no impact on
    the output (sles11-sp4):

<!-- -->

    # dmsetup ls --target multipath
    mpatha  (252, 0)
    # dmsetup ls --target multipath -v
    mpatha  (252, 0)

I commit again with the function `create_multipath` back in place.

I think if we already had the early "cleanupdisk" script

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)  
such kind of accidentally positive testing results

@schabrolles  
what about the possible bug in the create\_multipath()  
function as I wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449\#issuecomment-324874100](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449#issuecomment-324874100)

For me the current create\_multipath() function looks strange  
(somehow knotted regrading $1 and $device).  
As far as I understand what it should do  
I would use something like

<pre>
# Define the create_multipath() function in any case
# even if there is neither '^multipath' in disklayout.conf
# nor BOOT_OVER_SAN is true (cf. the above condition)
# to be on the safe side if create_multipath() might be
# also needed in whatever other circumstances:
function create_multipath () {
    local device=$1
    if grep "^multipath $device " "$LAYOUT_FILE" 1>&2 ; then
        Log "Found multipath device $device: Creating partitions on it"
        create_partitions "$device"
    fi
}
</pre>

@jsmeix

-   Agree that the way this function was written is strange and should
    be re-written as you propose

2 additional question:

-   Why do you redirect output of `grep` to stderr ? (I guess it should
    be related to the logging...)
-   In some circumstance, the log message "Found multipath device
    $device: Creating partitions on it" could be strange....

if you migrate from Multipathed to Not Multipathed system,

-   entry "multipath mpatha ....." is created in layout.conf

-   After booting to the Rescue media on the target system (not
    multipathed) and starting the recovery, the device `mpatha` in the
    layout file is migrated to `sda` by the device-migration scripts.  
    Then the message "Found multipath device **sda**: Creating
    partitions on it".... The weird thing is that sda is technically NOT
    a multipath device ... Everything is working fine : we need to
    create the partition on a device (multipath or not). It is just the
    Log message generated that is a bit strange in this case.

@schabrolles  
in general I redirect STDOUT to STDERR to get  
command output that is not really meant for the user  
not on the user's terminal but instead in the log file.  
I perefer '1&gt;&2' over '1&gt;/dev/null' because in general  
ReaR should not destroy information.  
In general the intent is to have all information  
of a "rear ..." run in the log file so that reading the log file  
(and only the log file) is sufficient to get full information  
what happened.  
Therefore I prefer e.g. 'grep ... 1&gt;&2' over 'grep -q ...'.  
Only if a command output is really not useful or even  
misleading, then '1&gt;/dev/null' and/or '2&gt;/dev/null'  
should be used preferably together with a comment why  
redirection to /dev/null makes sense in this case, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395\#issuecomment-311916095](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395#issuecomment-311916095)

Thanks for your explanation how the Log message  
could become plain wong and therefore misleading.  
Feel free to adapt it as you like, e.g.

<pre>
Log "Found device $device: Creating partitions on it"
</pre>

or

<pre>
Log "Found current or former multipath device $device: Creating partitions on it"
</pre>

or whatever you prefer (ultimately it is your code).  
In general misleading Log messages are not critical  
because Log messages are not shown directly to the user  
in contrast to LogPrint or even LogUserOutput messages.

I think this is another example how one can make "good" code  
even with the bash programming language where I often  
hear from colleagues when I tell them about ReaR that  
the first thing they would do is to completely rewrite it  
in a "real programming language" - of course they never  
contributed anything to ReaR - they are blabbering rubbish  
without understanding anything about why bash is perfectly  
"the right thing" for ReaR.
