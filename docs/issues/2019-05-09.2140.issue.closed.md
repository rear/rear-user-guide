We use currently at many places in the documentation the word `media`  
when we usually mean only a single piece of data carrier  
e.g. one ISO image that is burned onto one DVD.

E.g. `rear help` shows (excerpts)

     mkbackup        create rescue media and backup system
     mkbackuponly    backup system without creating rescue media
     mkrescue        create rescue media only

I wonder if we should use the word `medium` consistently  
when we usually mean only a single piece of data carrier like

     mkbackup        create rescue medium and backup system
     mkbackuponly    backup system without creating rescue medium
     mkrescue        create rescue medium only

According to what I read for the English word `medium` at  
[https://dict.leo.org/german-english/medium?side=left](https://dict.leo.org/german-english/medium?side=left)

    medium  - pl.: mediums, media  [TECH.]

it means in German

    das Medium pl.: die Medien/die Media

But for French (I do not speak French) what I see at  
[https://www.linguee.com/english-french/search?source=auto&query=media](https://www.linguee.com/english-french/search?source=auto&query=media)  
there also the English `media` seems to mean more than one data
carrier  
but for the English `medium` the results at  
[https://www.linguee.com/english-french/search?source=auto&query=medium](https://www.linguee.com/english-french/search?source=auto&query=medium)  
seem to not show something that means "a single data carrier"  
but I do not speak French so I do not really understand it.

I also wonder if the word `media` or `medium` is actually correct  
because I think ReaR cannot create the actual data carrier but  
instead ReaR creates some kind of image of an actual data carrier.  
At least that is true for `OUTPUT=ISO` while for `OUTPUT=USB`  
I think ReaR creates the actual data carrier (i.e. the ready-to-use  
USB stick with the bootable ReaR recovery system on it).

Therefore I wonder if the term `rescue media` or `rescue medium`  
should be used at all because the word `media` or `medium` is  
actually misleading.

Perhaps a more generic term like `rescue system`  
or a bit more specific term like `ReaR rescue system`  
or what I personally prefer `ReaR recovery system`  
should be used?

Reasoning why I prefer  
`[ReaR] recovery system` over `[ReaR] rescue system`:

From my point of view the meaning of `rescue system` is  
a static bootable generic minimal system that can be used  
to do generic and basic things to "revive" an existing system.

But a normal `rescue system` is usually insufficient to fully recreate  
a system from scratch on bare metal.

Perhaps by luck all nedeed tools are included in the `rescue system`  
to recreate the storage layout and perhaps by even more luck a tool  
is included to restore the backup provided by even more more luck  
one can access the backup that might be located on whatever  
server in whatever complicated (enterprise) network environment  
(virtual LAN, teaming, WTF... ;-)

In contrast the most important value of ReaR is that its  
`ReaR recovery system` is exactly there to fully recreate  
a system from scratch on bare metal because intentionally the  
`ReaR recovery system` is not just a static generic `rescue system`  
but a specifically made bootable minimal system to fully recreate  
a particular system in its particular network environment with  
its particular backup/restore software from scratch on bare metal.

Simply put:  
A `ReaR recovery system` is so much more than a usual `rescue system`  
that it deserves a specific proper name

    ReaR recovery system

where its name matches ReaR's ultimate purpose `rear recover`.

As a backward compatible compromise I use often initially
`ReaR rescue/recovery system`  
(and in subsequent text parts I use `ReaR recovery system` or only
`recovery system`)  
so users who are used to use `rescue system` for the
`ReaR recovery system`  
will not get confused that `ReaR recovery system` may mean something new
and different  
and new users get a hint that the `ReaR recovery system` is a special
kind of `rescue system`.  
It also explains why the command is `rear mkrescue` to make the
`ReaR rescue/recovery system`  
(if that command was named e.g. `rear mkrecovery` its name would
conflict with `rear recover`).

@jsmeix asked on the SUSE internal \#susedoc RC channel, so:

-   "media" can be either a regular plural or a singular mass noun.
    However, this appears to very much depend on what is meant by the
    word "media."

-   In the SUSE doc team, we use the Merriam-Webster dictionary as our
    reference. The relevant parts of the definitions for medium and
    media are:  
    (cf.
    [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medium](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medium))

> *medium* \[...\]
>
> -   2 : a means of effecting or conveying something: such as  
>     \[...\]
>     -   b. (plural usually *media*)
>         -   (1) : a channel or system of communication, information,
>             or entertainment — compare *mass medium*  
>             \[...\]
>         -   (4) : something (such as a magnetic disk) on which
>             information may be stored

> *media* (Entry 1 of 4) \[...\]
>
> -   2 : a medium of cultivation, conveyance, or expression *Air is a
>     media that conveys sound.*  
>     especially : \[medium sense 2b\]

While the back reference to *medium*-2b at the end of the definition for
media makes the situation a bit mushier, I think the general and more
accepted advice is to use "medium" (sing.), "media" (pl.) in this case.

(To be honest, I think the back reference in the definition for *media*
is a mistake and should actually go to *medium*-2a which has a very
similar example sentence.)

Ftr--I have no power to reopen this issue, as I am not a member of the
ReaR org on GitHub.
