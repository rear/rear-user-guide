@prolez  
thank you for your enhancement for ReaR!

We are currently in the final process of releasing ReaR 2.8,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238\#issuecomment-2516532775](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3238#issuecomment-2516532775)  
so we cannot include this PR in the current ReaR 2.8.  
We will have a look for the subsequent ReaR 3.0.

I am not a SED user so I cannot try out things on my own.  
I can only comment from what I notice form plain looking  
at the code changes of this pull request in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3355/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3355/files)

I notice `at_password` and when I see something like  
"password" or "encryption" or "key" in the code  
it indicates the code deals with some kind of "secret value"  
and then I am wondering if the code deals sufficiently well  
with secrets.

See the inital comments in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L13](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L13)  
how to deal sufficiently well with secrets.

See also the function LogSecret() in  
usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L462](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L462)

See also our "Relax-and-Recover Security Architecture" document at  
[https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture](https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture)  
which reads (excerpt)

    To facilitate protecting secrets even from
    verbose tracing of the Bash scripts (set -x),
    it is important to wrap statements
    that handle secrets like this:

    # set a variable with a secret
    { VAR='secret_value' ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

    # use the variable with the secret
    { COMMAND $SECRET_ARGUMENT ; } 2>>/dev/$SECRET_OUTPUT_DEV

For an example how the latter is used see  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh  
online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500_ssh.sh)

For an example how the latter is used to get user input  
in a confidential way, see the comment of the UserInput function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L1090](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L1090)

To verify that your code deals sufficiently well with secrets  
run it in ReaR debugscript mode with '-D' e.g. like

    # rear -D mkrescue

and then carefully inspect your ReaR log file  
and verify that no secret value appears therein.
