@moonSymph  
the message `Could not find directory /boot/grub.` was from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/630\_install\_grub.sh\#L61](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/630_install_grub.sh#L61)

    test -d "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/boot/grub" || Error "Could not find directory /boot/grub."

that is meanwhile fixed, see below  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2337\#issuecomment-593913279](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2337#issuecomment-593913279)

I.e. it actually means `Could not find directory /mnt/local/boot/grub`  
which is about the `boot/grub` directory within the restored target
system  
while your `cd /boot/grub` is within the currently running ReaR recovery
system.

So it seems during your backup restore `boot/grub` was not restored  
which is perhaps because `boot/grub` was not included in your backup?

Hello Jsmeix,

Thanks for answering.. do i need to add any configuration to include
/boot/grub on the newly mount point during the creation of ReaR iso?

I've attached the log which was created during recovery.  
[rear-localhost.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/4284619/rear-localhost.log)

@moonSymph  
what is in the ReaR recovery system below `/mnt/local`  
after "rear recover" are the restored files from your backup.  
When the `boot/grub` files are not there you likely do not  
have them in your backup so you need to get them included  
in your backup.

I am not a BACKUP=CDM user so that I cannot tell you what to do  
or how to set up things to get the `boot/grub` files included in  
your backup.

I use BACKUP=NETFS with the default `tar` backup program  
and I have the `boot/grub` files included in my backup  
(in my case I get `boot/grub2` because on \[open\]SUSE  
GRUB2 files are installed in `grub2` sub directories while  
on Red Hat GRUB2 files are installed in `grub` sub directories).

@DamaniN  
could you have a look here?  
Of course only as time permits.

@moonSymph, How did you install ReaR? Was it from the OS package
installer or did you clone the current version of this repo and use
`make install`. ReaR 2.6 has not been released yet which is where CDM
will be supported by the package installers. Instead you must clone this
repo and then run `make install`.

From the logs it appears that ReaR is going directly from the `restore`
phase to the `finalize` phase. With CDM support enabled it will pause
and allow you to recover files from Rubrik CDM to `/mnt/local`. I see no
CDM messages in the logs which leads me to believe that the wrong
version of ReaR in installed.

hello guys, I manage to solve this by using the rear from github.. by
the way is there a specific script to extract the Linux server disk
mapping and layout without having to make the iso? the iso size is
pretty huge and if there is a lot of Linux server it gets bigger if I
were to keep iso for each and every Linux host.. I was thinking to just
extract the layout and using a golden image but edit the disk layout
with the extracted disk layout as a reference..

@DamaniN  
thank you so much for your help!

@moonSymph  
thank you for your prompt confirmation that it works for you.

I am wondering if there might be a minor bug in ReaR  
that it does not sufficiently check and error out  
when an unsupported backup method is specified  
but I cannot reproduce it.

For me with `BACKUP=QQQ` in my etc/rear/local.conf  
`rear mkrescue` did not show a message or errors out  
but `rear mkbackup` did error out with

    ERROR: The BACKUP method 'QQQ' is not known to ReaR.

as it should in  
usr/share/rear/backup/default/005\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/default/005\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/default/005_valid_backup_methods.sh)

@DamaniN  
might it somehow happen that with `BACKUP=CDM`  
backup/default/005\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh is not run  
or its code does not error out?

Hmmm... I think I found a generic issue:

For most external backup methods `rear mkbackup` is useless,  
cf. the section "BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION" in `man rear`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
so for most external backup methods only `rear mkrescue` is used  
and that does not check if a valid backup method is specified.

At least for me moving  
`usr/share/rear/backup/default/005_valid_backup_methods.sh`  
to  
`usr/share/rear/prep/default/035_valid_backup_methods.sh`  
lets both `rear mrbackup` and `rear mkrescue` error out  
when an unsupported backup method is specified.

I think the issue is fixed via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8eb72c1d845d2b91fa76f18d47c74454ed5432ec](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8eb72c1d845d2b91fa76f18d47c74454ed5432ec)

@moonSymph  
if you like to test our current master code with that fix  
see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

You would have to specify a wrong backup method  
e.g. a typo of the value like `BACKUP=CDN`  
to test if "rear mkrescue" errors out

Unfortunately a typo of the keyword like `BAKCUP=CDM`  
cannot be recognized because default.conf sets

    BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE
