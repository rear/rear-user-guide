    but with the change here it works now for me:

    ++ test -d /var/tmp/rear.LEl5cQbfB1jzo68/outputfs

    rmdir: removing directory, '/var/tmp/rear.LEl5cQbfB1jzo68/outputfs'

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Use double quotes to get the variable evaluated in

@pcahyna  
could you have a look here if my quoting is right now?

The remove\_temporary\_mountpoint calls are now in this pull request

    usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh:
                remove_temporary_mountpoint "$BUILD_DIR/outputfs" || BugError "Directory $BUILD_DIR/outputfs not empty, cannot remove"

    usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh:
        AddExitTask "remove_temporary_mountpoint '$mountpoint'"
        remove_temporary_mountpoint "$mountpoint" && RemoveExitTask "remove_temporary_mountpoint '$mountpoint'"

I think the

    AddExitTask "remove_temporary_mountpoint '$mountpoint'"
    RemoveExitTask "remove_temporary_mountpoint '$mountpoint'"

already evaluate right.

This looks correct, thanks, and sorry for having introduced this bug.

Both "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" work for me  
so I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
if there are no objections.

The correction here in this pull request causes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)

I still like to merge this pull request tomorrow afternoon  
because it corrects code that did not work as intended.

The false ERROR ".../outputfs not empty, cannot remove" when OUTPUT\_URL
is unset  
is (almost) certainly not caused by the corrected code in this pull
request  
but has a different root cause that needs to be fixed separatedly.

@pcahyna  
if you agree the change in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676\#issuecomment-915133176](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676#issuecomment-915133176)  
to make `scheme_supports_filesystem()` more fail-safe  
which fixes
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)
for me  
could be added here so that this pull request could fix  
both
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)

Tomorrow I retest if things work for me with all the changes here  
and if yes I would like to commit it as is to get  
both
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)  
fixed to have a better working ReaR upstream master code.

Then we have time for more cleanup and improvements  
to make things more fail-safe in general (without actual issues).

I tested with all the changes here and things work well for me.

I tested "rear -v mkbackup" and "rear -v recover" with a "normal"
local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.122.1/nfs
    ...

I tested "rear -v mkrescue" with a minimal local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO

So I will merge it right now.

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for all your valuable help here!  
You made me understand the root cause of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2676)  
and you made me understand how one could make functions  
working more fail-safe even when `set -eu` is active.  
It is much appreciated.
