The `/etc/rear/duplicity.conf` file defined DUPLICITY as backup method,
but on our *client* VM we already had the `duply` executable and a valid
*duply conf* file, therefore, automatically `duply` program is used
instead of `duplicity` executable. Do not get confused about this.

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    `/sbin/rear -v -C /etc/rear/duplicity.conf mkbackup` hanged. See
    excerpt of the log:

It was waiting on a **yes** entry, which was not visible unless after
pressing Ctrl-C in the log file.

-   Work-around, if any: Modified script
    `prep/DUPLICITY/default/200_find_duply_profile.sh`  
    line 42 to become `echo yes | duply "$DUPLY_PROFILE" status >&2`
    (added the *echo yes |*)

If we re-run then it is works from that point on.

Noticed during recovery that duply cannot start the recovery due to:

    2018-01-01 07:29:47.208252397 Including verify/DUPLICITY/default/250_check_duply_profile.sh
    Start duply v1.11.3, time is 2018-01-01 07:29:47.

    Sorry. A fatal ERROR occured:

    '/etc/duply/duply-client/conf' not found.

According URL
[http://duply.net/wiki/index.php/Duply-documentation](http://duply.net/wiki/index.php/Duply-documentation)
we should

> Superuser root can place profiles under '/etc/duply'. Simply create  
> the folder manually before running duply as superuser.  
> Note:  
> Already existing profiles in root's home folder will cease to work  
> unless they are moved to the new location manually.

However, if you run `duply TEST create` it will create the conf file
under `/root/.duply/TEST/` directory and not in `/etc/duply/TEST`.
Strange, and not according the documentation.

The work-around has been implemented and works fine. Will close this
issue for now.
