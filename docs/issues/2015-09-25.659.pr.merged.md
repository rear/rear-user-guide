@rowens275 Could you also write a small section of documentation which
we could add to
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/usecases](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/usecases)
? Thanks - all bits help ;-)

Should I post the documentation here, or add it as a file in my pull
request?

You may add it as a pull request with this issue if the documentation is
part of rear product itself or as a pull request to the web-site
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com)
if you want to add or modify some web pages. Thanks!

I will provide doc for the website and doc to be included in ReaR.
Should I be updating rear-release-notes.txt or do you guys do that?
Should I update rear-presentation.adoc to add to the list of Back-up
backends? Do you prefer the ReaR doc be in the same pull request, or
should I upload a "doc" branch?

For each GitHub Repo we need one pull request. One for rear itself (and
the included documentation files) and another one for the
rear.githhub.com website repo to update the stuff on the website. Feel
free to add the info you seem appropriate with a link to your product.

OK, the rear pull request should be ready. I will work on the
rear.github.com pull request now.
