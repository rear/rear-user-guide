This code is really hard to test in VirtualBox as it cannot boot
automatically from the 2nd hard disk (and map that to BIOS hd0).

It solves the more obvious use cases but could need further improvement
in some corner cases. For example I added the systemd
`/etc/modules-load.d/` stuff but couldn't test if it actually works,
maybe we need to update our systemd units in `skel`.

@gdha please have a look. I think that with this the 2.2 release is
ready.

I rebased onto master and will merge this evening if I don't get
feedback.
