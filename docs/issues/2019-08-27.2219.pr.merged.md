…sh and 810\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh otherwise in case of OUTPUT=PXE,
mounting the NFS will fail

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [\#2216](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2216)

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `rear -v mkbackup`

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    If the NFS server is running AIX, BACKUP\_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    has to be specified.  
    This also works fine when using OUTPUT=ISO and BACKUP=NETFS.  
    However in case of OUTPUT=PXE, mounting the NFS will fail with
    "mount.nfs: Remote I/O error" because in 800\_copy\_to\_tftp.sh and
    810\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh there is no $BACKUP\_OPTIONS specified
    when "mount\_url" is issued.  
    I have added $BACKUP\_OPTIONS to the line with mount\_url in
    800\_copy\_to\_tftp.sh and 810\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh otherwise
    in case of OUTPUT=PXE, mounting the NFS will fail.

@gdha  
I am still not in the office and will not be for some more weeks  
so I cannot actually work on ReaR.
