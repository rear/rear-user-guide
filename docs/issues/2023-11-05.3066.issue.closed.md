-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I can not see any hard drive in the list. I have a NVMe ssd 1TB that
    i would like to restore the back up to  
    I also tried this in VMware and it does not show a basic SCSI device
    i added when booting  
    i cant even load up the other usb stick that has the backup.tar.gz
    file

You can see all the is loaded here:

Am i missing something that needs to run so devices are seen an I can
run the mount command? Also to see the available hard disks.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    None at the moment. i have tried loading the module with modprobe
    but the disk to not load

I see this guy had a similar issue but they said it was the device.

with further investigation I just tried the default rescue and the
rescue image didnt show up the disks available.

@martinnaughton

what do

    lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

and

    lsmod

show on your original system?

See MODULES\_LOAD in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
how to enforce to load modules in the recovery system  
and see  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
for an example how MODULES\_LOAD could be used

    # Have all modules of the original system in the recovery system with the
    # same module loading ordering as in the original system by using the output of
    #   lsmod | tail -n +2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | tac | tr -s '[:space:]' ' '
    # as value for MODULES_LOAD (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/626):
    #MODULES_LOAD=( )

In general:  
When a Linux distribution uses a special init system  
(i.e. not the usual systemd as in Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu)  
then things could get rather complicated and tricky in ReaR  
(up to impossible in practice with reasonable effort),  
cf.

Debian uses systemd by default, doesn't it?

@jsmeix, why did you mention a special init system (not systemd) ? Is
there anything in the issue that indicates that anything else than
systemd is in use? I don't see this.

@martinnaughton How did you get to this point, anything unusual? I see
you have also filed issue \#3065. Is it related? Is it on the same
machine? Do you get this problem after applying the workaround mentioned
in \#3065 ?

@pcahyna  
Thank you for also having a look and your correction!

I simply didn't look carefully and I did not remember  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3017)  
but I did remember that there were no devices in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2955](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2955)  
which led me into a totally wrong direction.

So this is a good example of Linus's law  
(which is actually Eric S. Raymond's law):  
"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".

@martinnaughton, can you please retest with the current Git devel
checkout (master branch)? I strongly suspect I fixed the problem
together with \#3065
