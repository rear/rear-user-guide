Automatic recovery does not work with the Rubrik CDM integration. Users
must use the manual recovery option and answer various questions.

prompt.

ReaR should automatically recover the latest backup from the original
cluster using the fileset used to back up with ReaR.

-   Workaround, if any:

None

    debug log files):

@DamaniN  
thank you for your continuous usability improvements of BACKUP=CDM.  
I appreciate ReaR usability improvements very much.

With 'ReaR usability' I do not mean that ReaR should "just work"  
even for arbitrary unexperienced end-users,  
cf. "Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

With 'ReaR usability' I mean for example things like

    Do not "simply abort" but let the user retry if possible

for example as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2253](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2253)  
and (even more important) things like

    Try hard to care about possible errors

and

    It should be possible to run ReaR unattended
