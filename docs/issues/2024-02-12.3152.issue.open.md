Rear 2.7
--------

hi,

it appears that

`finalize/SUSE_LINUX/i386/550_rebuild_initramfs.sh`

makes use of the "mkinitrd" executable. This executable has been moved
to a special package on SLES15 SP5 called  
`dracut-mkinitrd-deprecated`, which seems to be optional and may not be
existent on the system backed up.

In reality it seems this "mkinitrd" exectuable is just an wrapper
shellscript to call dracut, see the following  
discussion:

[https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WKZFPUPW3BQ4GYLI4HIWLJDWANUOBLIT/](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WKZFPUPW3BQ4GYLI4HIWLJDWANUOBLIT/)

However, as the executable may be missing, this can result in recovery
to spoil:

    2024-01-10 13:38:11.294431793 Running mkinitrd...
    2024-01-10 13:38:11.298370613 WARNING:
    Cannot create initrd (found no mkinitrd in the recreated system).
    Check the recreated system (mounted at /mnt/local)
    and decide yourself, whether the system will boot or not.

maybe it would make sense to implement an fall-back to dracut commands
if mkinitrd is not available:

`dracut -f --regenerate-all `

@pcahyna thanks, it may make sense to either port these changes to the
SUSE related parts too, or use common code base for this?

I can reproduce it.

    Running mkinitrd...
    WARNING:
    Cannot create initrd (found no mkinitrd in the recreated system).
    Check the recreated system (mounted at /mnt/local)
    and decide yourself, whether the system will boot or not.

    Installing GRUB2 boot loader...
    Determining where to install GRUB2 (no GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES specified)
    Found possible boot disk /dev/vda - installing GRUB2 there

Nevertheless the recreated system boots well for me  
as expected because I recreated on 100% compatible  
replacement "hardware" (on a same VM) so the same initrd  
from the original system should still work.

I will have a look how to solve it properly.

@abbbi  
could you please test if  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3155)  
also works for you?

In particular check your "rear -D recover" log file  
for possible issues when dracut is run  
and during reboot of the recreated system  
for issues that could be related to the initrd.
