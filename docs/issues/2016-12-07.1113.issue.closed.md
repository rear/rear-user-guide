Hi everyone,  
I tried subscribing to the rear-devel mailing list today, but I can't
receive any emails from <rear-devel-bounces@lists.relax-and-recover.org>
due to a broken SPF record (the SPF basically tells me that
148.251.123.139 is NOT allowed to send mail for
lists.relax-and-recover.org. So it gets blocked by my employers
mailgateway)

% dig txt lists.relax-and-recover.org  
\[...\]  
;; ANSWER SECTION:  
lists.relax-and-recover.org. 80163 IN TXT "v=spf1 mx -all"

..but "lists.relax-and-recover.org" does not have a MX record specified.
This could be fixed by adding an 'a' to the SPF record, or an MX record
for lists.relax-and-recover.org

@dagwieers Hey Dag - does the above ring a bell with you?

Perhaps @danboid has the same problem, cf.

This should now be fixed !

The best option for me was to update the TXT field to include all the MX
records of the service provider: `"v=spf1 include:_spf.3ti.be -all"`

Let me know if you have any issues (but wait 24h to report them, just in
case ;-))
