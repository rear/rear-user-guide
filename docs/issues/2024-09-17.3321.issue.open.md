See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319\#issuecomment-2355118862](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319#issuecomment-2355118862)  
(excerpts):

    usr/share/rear/restore/GALAXY/default/400_restore_with_galaxy.sh:
           . ./GxCmd
    ...
    ... it seems GxCmd (and GxCmdLine) belong to
    the BACKUP=GALAXY software.
    In this case it is probably OK to source GxCmd
    because the BACKUP=GALAXY software can be trusted.
    Nevertheless it should be verified ...
    ... that '. ./GxCmd' can be trusted

Right now I replaced '.' by 'source' via
