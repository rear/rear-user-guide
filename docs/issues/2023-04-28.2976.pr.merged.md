-   enable/disable SC2168 (local is only valid in functions) because
    scripts under lib/ are always sourced from functions, so "local" is
    valid inside them.
-   set shell=bash because ReaR uses bash but the scripts don't have
    shebangs.

As a part of my master's thesis, I made a "research" about the
Differential shellcheck usage.

I solved 2 problems in this PR:

-   unnecessary output of shellcheck "Tips depend on target shell and
    yours is unknown. Add a shebang or a 'shell' directive."  
    Since the ReaR is written in bash and that is specified in the
    following line:  
    [https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear\#L1](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L1)

    Example of such notice:  
    [https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/100/files](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/100/files)

-   Scripts outside the lib directory are handled from functions, so
    it's a valid usage of local variables in them. However, shellcheck
    "incorrectly" marks local variable usage in these scripts.  
    Example:  
    [https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/100/files](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/100/files)

These issues I described in my master's thesis, chapter 6.2  
[https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/107238/F3-DP-2023-Voznia-Anton-dip\_thesis-2.pdf?sequence=-1&isAllowed=y\#toc%3A22](https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/107238/F3-DP-2023-Voznia-Anton-dip_thesis-2.pdf?sequence=-1&isAllowed=y#toc%3A22)

2 test examples with the fix:

-   The example with a newly added file without shebang and local
    variable usage without described above warning.

    [https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/349/files](https://github.com/antonvoznia/rear/pull/349/files)

-   Another example with local variable usage in functions, and there is
    expected behaviour of the shellcheck/Differential shellcheck:

@antonvoznia thanks - I have one comment - you show two example PRs,
both are generated with `severity: style`. But that's not the shellcheck
severity we are using - we are using `severity: error` :
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/966379ef1f83071f381ef4fbf8c03a6aeaa782a0\#diff-eace62a8ebcdafd0f6975200d68cbf851300952aae47db07e71f383038a368b3R29](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/966379ef1f83071f381ef4fbf8c03a6aeaa782a0#diff-eace62a8ebcdafd0f6975200d68cbf851300952aae47db07e71f383038a368b3R29)
. Can you please update the example PR links to PRs generated with the
same severity level?
