@lzaoral Would be nice to test `OUTPUT=PXE` as well.

PSA: I still plan to test this PR with `OUTPUT=PXE`. Hopefully, I'll get
to it next week.

@gdha I managed to test `OUTPUT=PXE` sooner than expected. I've tested
it only on an aarch64 OVMF Fedora 42 VM and I was able to successfully
boot to the rescue environment from network with the following
configuration (and necessary changes on another aarch64 Fedora 42 VM
serving as a PXE/TFTP server, e.g. `grub2-mknetdir`, configs for `dhcpd`
and NFS, and proper file permissions in `/var/lib/tftpboot`):

    OUTPUT=PXE
    OUTPUT_PREFIX_PXE=rear/$HOSTNAME

    PXE_CONFIG_GRUB_STYLE=y

    PXE_TFTP_IP=<redacted>
    PXE_CONFIG_URL="nfs://$PXE_TFTP_IP/var/lib/tftpboot/boot/grub2/arm64-efi"
    PXE_TFTP_UPLOAD_URL="nfs://$PXE_TFTP_IP/var/lib/tftpboot"

    PXE_CREATE_LINKS=MAC
    PXE_REMOVE_OLD_LINKS=y
