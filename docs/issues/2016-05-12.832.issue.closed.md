Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template
=======================================

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 6.7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    GRUB\_RESCUE=1
-   Brief description of the issue

**Issue** - I was trying to clone a system via Rear. I used some other
system's rescue image. When I reach to rescue shell it asks me to
restore all the data to /mnt/local. How do I do that ?  
I want to use TSM for restore. I cannot do unless there is a TSM Client
installed on it.  
How can I do this? Any Idea?  
I cant install anything now, as it is in rescue mode.

Is there any other way to do it ?  
Is there a Procedure to make Rear work with TSM ?

Thank You  
Akshay Saraf

On the source system you should also add `BACKUP=TSM` to the
`local.conf` file and make sure you have a full backup made by TSM. Use
the newly created rear rescue image to boot on the target system and you
are ready to go.

And see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
in particular see therein the "BACKUP=TSM stuff".

FYI  
why you got that

<pre>
Please start the restore process on your backup host.
Make sure that you restore the data into /mnt/local
instead of '/' because the hard disks of the recovered
system are mounted there.
</pre>

text see also usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf that contains

<pre>
# default backup and output targets
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE
...
# BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE stuff
##
# This mode stops the restore after formatting and mounting the filesystems and expects
# the backup data to appear by miracle (e.g. you doing something).
...
# The text to display in order to prompt the user to restore the data
REQUESTRESTORE_TEXT="Please start the restore process on your backup host.
Make sure that you restore the data into $TARGET_FS_ROOT (by default '/mnt/local')
instead of '/' because the hard disks of the recovered system are mounted there.
"
</pre>

Thank s lot for your prompt response.  
How will I restore from TSM when the System is in Rescue Mode ?  
Can TSM Push Backup ?  
Won't it need TSM Client installed that time ?

Thank You

When booted from the rescue image just type 'rear -v recover' and the  
restore will be invoked via TSM - pure magic, no?

Sorry, you have to install the TSM Client on the rescue system.  
Here are my /etc/rear/local.conf part for TSM-Restore for an Redhat 6.x
System:

    BACKUP=TSM
    PROGS_TSM=(dsmc)
    TSM_RESULT_FILE_PATH=/opt/tivoli/tsm/rear
    TSM_RESULT_SAVE=n

Now create a new rescue image and an working TSM Cllint wil be there.

Thanks a Lot Joeri-MS. Your configuration worked Perfectly. Could you
please tell me what does TSM\_RESULT\_FILE\_PATH Mean ?

Also when I run "rear -v mkbackup" after this configuration. It creates
a rear ISO file in /var/lib/rear/output directory and also in
/opt/tivoli/tsm/rear directory. What is the difference between these 2
files ?

@Joeri-MS `conf/default.conf:PROGS_TSM=(dsmc)` so there is no need to
add it to the `local.conf` file.  
@akshaysarraf2016

    onf/default.conf:# where to copy the resulting files to and save them with TSM
    conf/default.conf:TSM_RESULT_FILE_PATH=/opt/tivoli/tsm/rear

And, you are right currently you will find the exact ISO images on your
system (see issue \#734 which is not implemented yet).

No further comments since more than 4 month  
indicate that the issue is sufficiently answered.  
I am closing it now.  
If needed it can be reopened.
