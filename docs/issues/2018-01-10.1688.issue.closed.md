This kind of issue and how to work around it  
is described in the release notes of the 2.3 release.

@MogiePete ,  
Could you try with the following variable added in your `local.conf`
file

    COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm /opt/tivoli/tsm/client /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* /lib*/libgsk* )

@jsmeix I do not believe NON\_FATAL\_BINARIES\_WITH\_MISSING\_LIBRARY
being added would resolve the issue due to the fact that the libraries
are needed by dsmc to run.

@schabrolles When added to the local.conf file the mkrescue completed.
Thank you.

@MogiePete

I see!

The NON\_FATAL\_BINARIES\_WITH\_MISSING\_LIBRARY  
description in default.conf is insufficient, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1693](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1693)

@schabrolles  
according to the above it seems an enhancement is needed  
for the COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM default value to be enhanced  
from the current

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm /opt/tivoli/tsm/client /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* )
</pre>

to

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm /opt/tivoli/tsm/client /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* /lib*/libgsk* )
</pre>

@jsmeix, I'm currently working on it.  
The libgsk are located in `/usr/local/ibm/gsk8` for (sles and redhat)  
but there is some symlink in /lib64 for RedHat distro.  
This mean libgsk are actually copied into the rescue image.

I would prefer to update the `TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with
`/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib64`

Adding something to TSM\_LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
only makes the ldd test in build/default/980\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
find more libraries via LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
while in contrast  
adding something to COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM  
only gets more stuff into the recovery system.

If adding something to TSM\_LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH helps  
it shows that the needed libraries are already in the recovery system  
as described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1688\#issuecomment-357248210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1688#issuecomment-357248210)

But then
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1688\#issuecomment-357081281](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1688#issuecomment-357081281)  
seems to contradict because there @MogiePete seems to report  
that those libraries were actually missing in his recovery system?

@MogiePete  
does it also work for you when you leave COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM as is by
default i.e.

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm /opt/tivoli/tsm/client /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* )
</pre>

but only add ` :/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib64` to TSM\_LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH as
in

@MogiePete ,

Could you please test again by modifying your /etc/local.conf.

-   remove `COPY_AS_IS_TSM`
-   and instead, add
    `TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib64`

I made the change you requested and the error has returned:

@MogiePete,

Could you test again with the current version of ReaR. I just merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1694](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1694)
which should solve your issue. It worked for me, but I would like to
verify it on your environment.

@schabrolles,

As previously mentioned, adding the path did not work. The path listed
in the merge is incorrect according to my system. It should be
/usr/local/ibm/gsk8\_64/lib64.

Adding COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM to my /etc/local.conf resolved the issues I was
having with 2.3 on a RHEL 7 server running TSM 8.1.

@MogiePete,

I see... thanks for the clarification. It is strange, because gsk libs
are located in `/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib64` on my ppc64le system.  
I made a change proposal
([https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1744](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1744))
to detect the real gsk PATH to add into `TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for system
like intel which could have it in 64 or 32 bits.

I'm waiting for other ReaR member to review it before merging.

@MogiePete,

change is now merged into master. Could you test and confirm the issue
can be closed.

Thanks.

No news is Good news... then, I close this one.
