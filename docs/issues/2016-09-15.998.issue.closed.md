Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git  
OS\_VENDOR=OracleServer  
OS\_VERSION=6  
AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH=  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE="`cat /proc/cmdline | sed -e 's/\(.*\)\(root=UUID=[a-z0-9-]*\)\(.*\)/\1\3/'`"  
OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///backup/OS  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=""  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_SUFFIX=""  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( '/u01/app/oraadm/diag/*' '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*'
'/u01/app/oraadm/admin' '/u01/data/*'
'/u01/app/oraadm/product/11.2.0/\*/rdbms/audit' )

I need to recover system over NFS. ISO boots fine, but "rear recover"
gives error. Logs indicate there is no NFS support built in. What
options do I have now. Can I copy NFS support binaries from elsewhere or
something like that? I cannot add hardware to server.

Can I use some other net prtocol for restore like FTP or SCP?

Hi,

> Logs indicate there is no NFS support built in

Can you post these logs (or relevant parts at least)?

Cant copy logs form there since it is on console. Error happens on step
06\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh and command mount -v -t nfs -o rw,noatime
<nfs path> <local path> complains about wrong options. Error is acutally
few lines long, and in the end there is hint that some filesystem types
may require /sbin/mount.<fstype> helpers. When checking, I see no mount
helpers under /sbin indeed.

hmm, now I realized ...  
`BACKUP_URL=file:///backup/OS`  
can be the problem.  
Just a guess, but didn't you manually mounted NFS share to /backup/OS
?  
If so, try to scp rear tarball from NFS server to /backup/OS on your
clent and start `rear recover`

This is just guess, so no guarantees.

Yes, I made backup on local filesystem assuming I can recover them later
over NFS. This used to work before, when I tested recovery palns, but
not today when I actually need it. This is bad, I believe it should be
fixed.  
But I got idea, since I have access to storage array, I create+mount new
filesstem there, scp my tarball (all 33GB of it) and then try to
restore.

This part of ReaR code is really not my domain, so maybe I'm wrong ...  
In *05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh* I've found some code that looks
to decide what binaries to copy depending on url\_scheme (file:// in
your case), so this might be reason why you are missing nfs binaries.

In any case, if you use NFS server for backups you should change your
config to:  
`BACKUP_URL=nfs://<nfs_server>/<path>`

Good luck with your restore!

Thanks, I got my problem solved and our main database server is fully
functional again. I can even sleep few hours tonight, really didnt hope
so. Please consider making more restore methods available by default.
This is because when things go wrong ,they often go multiple things at
once, and you never know in advance what parts of infrastructure will be
available.

@gozora  
many thanks for your help!

@toomaskiisk  
you may have a look at the usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ files  
that are included in current rear versions (perhaps not yet  
in your 1.17.2 - I didn't check that) the current ones are at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)  
FYI:  
I always do backup and restore via NFS and I always use

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup
</pre>

which always worked and works for me.

Regarding "rear recover gives error" see the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover (rear)" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

According to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/998\#issuecomment-247461450](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/998#issuecomment-247461450)
"problem solved" I close this issue.
