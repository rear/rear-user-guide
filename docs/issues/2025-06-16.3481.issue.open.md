### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

To avoid that issues (and pull requests) will be marked as **stale** we
will only check issues (and PRs) with the labels "waiting for info"
and/or "ready-to-close?"

### Describe the solution you'd like

adapt the stale.yml workflow
