    it):

    script is only running once a month.

I think the issue is resolved. I was not aware that when installing
rear, it automatically creates a cron for rear mkrescue that runs
everyday at 1:30 AM and it looks like this is a default setting. I will
comment out this cron for now and if there is no more recurring issue
related to this in a week I will close this case. Thanks.

@iringor  
it seems your issue is similar like this one  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787)  
where also a cron job broke things.

The /etc/cron.d/rear/ related things  
were removed for ReaR 2.5 see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2139](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2139)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1892](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1892)

See the comments therein why that cron thing is broken  
and why I and others are against such cron things.

It seems your issue here is just another case  
that shows why that cron thing is broken.

I guess your cron job is a leftover from ReaR 2.4

Hi Johannes,

Yes, it looks similar. But my issue is now fixed. I could not access
[https://relax-and-recover.org/](https://relax-and-recover.org/) before
when I started researching about ReaR. The site was blocked by our IT
admin for some reason. I didn't find this in the man pages, but it is
mentioned in
[https://relax-and-recover.org/usage/](https://relax-and-recover.org/usage/)
that a cron job can be created (or automatically created?) to sync with
the rescue image. It is actually a good tool, this "rear checklayout,"
to alert me if there is a need to create a new image. Thank you.
