Otherwise the initrd file will not boot the kernel, instead returning a
Kernel Panic and

`lsinitcpio -a` was helpful in spotting this issue:

@ProBackup-nl  
all you need is to add a comment in the source  
that explains *why* that '-l' option is there, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
and then I will 'just merge' it.

Many thanks for your valuable contributions to ReaR!  
They help a lot to improve ReaR.
