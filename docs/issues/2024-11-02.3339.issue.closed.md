If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you can't
upgrade:
[https://software.opensuse.org/package/rear](https://software.opensuse.org/package/rear)
official version is at 2.7, no other community packages provide a newer
version so I would have to build my own.

Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):  
My NVMe drive recently began to mount read only (btrfs) and show errors
with btfrs check. After replacing the drive and using the rear rescue
ISO to attempt to recover, I ran into
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3338](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3338).
After working through that, I realized that some directories are
missing, despite not being called out as excluded by REAR in the
local.conf, or otherwise. For example, my `/opt` directory was for sure
not backed up at all, and neither was `/usr/local/texlive`.

Workaround, if any: none

Update again... apologies for cluttering up the issues, I didn't search
for the right things until I began to understand more about the problem.
My issue is likely this:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928),
clearly I should have specified the subvolumes to be explicitly included
in the backup. This can be seen in the backup log, where it did not
descend into either /var, /usr/local, or likely any of the other default
suse btrfs subvolumes:

I am closing
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3338](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3338)
as it looks redundant to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927).

I'll leave this issue open, just to get confirmation:

1.  Are the fixes in
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928)
    and
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927)
    expected to be incorporated in REAR 2.8?
2.  In the meanwhile, is using this template
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf\#L48](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf#L48)
    designed to prevent both of those issues by explicitly including
    snapper/chattr, and by explicitly including the subvolumes? Or, is
    there still expected to be an issue (especially for the
    snapper/chattr thing) in REAR 2.7 even when using this template?

Thanks for providing such a flexible and powerful backup solution, and
sorry again for posting on topics that may have been already settled!

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2927)  
is fixed in current GitHub master code  
by the two fixes

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928)  
should be fixed in current GitHub master code by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175)  
together with several other related fixes  
but currently - off the top of my head -  
I don't know whether or not

    /.snapshots must be excluded from the backup restore

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-2151951631](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-2151951631)  
i.e. whether or not one must manually specify  
in /etc/rear/local.conf something like

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( /.snapshots )

to avoid what I described in the `BUT` part in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175\#issuecomment-2111776529](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3175#issuecomment-2111776529)  
and also in

@cbmiller2610  
I would much appreciate it if you could  
test our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
as described in the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and provide feedback how far things "just work"  
with openSUSE Tumbleweed on your particular system  
in your particular environment.  
See also the section  
"Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

To avoid too high expectations note that  
in general openSUSE Tumbleweed cannot be  
a supported Linux distribution for ReaR upstream,  
see the section  
"Supported and Unsupported Operating Systems"  
in our release notes, currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L3862](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L3862)  
which reads (excerpt)

    In theory ReaR 2.7 should work on openSUSE Tumbleweed
    but in practice arbitrary failures could happen at any time
    because the Tumbleweed distribution is a pure
    rolling release version of openSUSE containing
    the latest stable versions of all software
    (cf. https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)
    so arbitrary changes of any software are possible at any time
    that could arbitrarily break how ReaR works.

cf. the section  
"No disaster recovery without testing and continuous validation"  
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
which reads (excerpt)

    You must continuously validate that the recovery still works
    on the replacement hardware in particular
    after each change of the basic system. 

So a rolling release operating system contradicts  
a prerequirement of disaster recovery which is  
to have a stable basic system.
