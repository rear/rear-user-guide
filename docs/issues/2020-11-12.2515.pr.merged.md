-   How was this pull request tested?

Of course things still work for me on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system  
but I do not use any special LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH so my test is rather
meaningless.  
I have to wait for @dcz01 feedback on

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh restore the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH  
after reporting binaries with 'not found' shared object dependencies  
so that results are the same for the first 'ldd' run that finds
binaries  
with 'not found' shared objects dependencies and the second 'ldd' run  
that reports those 'not found' shared objects dependencies, see
