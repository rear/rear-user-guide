@thomas-merz  
I cannot reply to your request in a helpful way because  
I am not at all an expert in bootloader area  
and even less an expert in UEFI area.  
I am also not at all an expert in making bootable ISO images  
and even less an expert in making UEFI bootable ISO images.

So I can neither comment whether or not it is possible  
to be implemented so that it works reasonably well  
nor do I have an idea how much effort it could be  
to implement it in a reasonable way.

Could you explain your reason why configuring ReaR  
(i.e. with `ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso`)  
is not feasible for your particular use case?

Hello @jsmeix , I just wanted that someone Rear-related from SUSE is
aware of this and got no reaction since opening this issue…  
I also found an older (closed, not fixed) issue opened by you with the
exact same issue/idea:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/805](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/805)
😄

Regarding your question:

We see that Rear is already aware of "this is system has been booted
with EFI" and it should know that `mkisofs` (without extra parameters?)
can't make an ISO for UEFI boot.

But why should the user (or admin of many systems) be responsible to
tell Rear what it already knows? Please think of your customers that
have many systems - some EFI and some not - and need to configure this!
So please let sysadmins "relax" by letting Rear do what needs to be done
😃

Maybe @schlomo oder @gdha can explain because I found both very
interested in this discussion:
[https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/issues/2015-09-18.657.pr.merged.html](https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/issues/2015-09-18.657.pr.merged.html)

@thomas-merz  
to avoid misunderstandings:

It is not that I don't understand why you request  
that ReaR should do things automatically.  
I do fully understand that desire and I have the same.  
Almost each day I wished computers won't behave so "utterly stupid"  
when "obvious stuff" does not work and needs awkward interaction  
(most annoyance with Windows and Android, far less with Linux).

All I say here is that currently I cannot implement it  
because I do not have the needed overall understanding  
how all the related code in ReaR works or is meant to work  
and I am not alone, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/657\#issuecomment-141482926](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/657#issuecomment-141482926)

    code around UEFI_BOOTLOADER I find it very complex (meaning that
    by reading it I don't understand exactly what goes on there)

see also my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2980\#issuecomment-1536130852](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2980#issuecomment-1536130852)

Simply put:  
Currently we at ReaR upstream do not have an active contributor  
who is an expert in the booting area.

Something (hopefully) more constructive:

Regarding  
"many systems - some EFI and some not - and need to configure this":

Do I understand it right that your actual issue is  
that you like to use one same /etc/rear/local.conf file  
for all your systems so that you don't need to configure  
each system manually and separately?

If my assumtion is right, here a general note  
that could perhaps help in your specific case:

ReaR config files are read via 'source'.  
Because 'source' executes the content as bash script  
you can run commands within your configuration files,  
in particular commands to set different configuration values  
depending on certain conditions as you need like

    CONDITION_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special_value" || VARIABLE="usual_value"

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/etc/rear/local.conf)

If you can distinguish your systems that boot with UEFI  
from those that boot with BIOS via some CONDITION\_COMMAND  
you could set the right ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN automatically.

"Challenge accepted" - let's see if I find some time to have a look and
try a PR…

We use a config management (sorry, not SUSE Manager, but Puppet) so we
just have to set an entry in a YAML file for the hosts with EFI to
inform Puppet that this host needs another line in site.conf. That's
really not impossible to do. But… I thought that if Rear already knows
about EFI it could or it should already use the right tool -
automatically.

> CONDITION\_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special\_value" ||
> VARIABLE="usual\_value"

I understand, but to make it more complicated:  
`rear mkrescue` is executed remotely by our backup system via a backup
agent everytime a system is backupped… We could put this into a script
and let the script be executed… and so on… this feels very "hacky" and
not very "relaxing" 😉

Please give me some time to have a look into it and if a PR might be
possible to make and if you can adopt/adapt it…

@thomas-merz  
I do very much appreciate it that you yourself  
will have a look and try to contribute a PR!

Your PR does not need to be some kind of "general solution".  
Just what works for you in your particular environment  
so we have a starting point wherefrom further development  
can be done as needed.

The basically only mandatory condition for a PR is  
that things behave reasonably backward compatible, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#maintain-backward-compatibility](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#maintain-backward-compatibility)

Of course I will help you as good as I can.

Many thanks in advance for your contribution!

@thomas-merz  
before you invest time right now to find out  
how to let ReaR use 'ebiso' automatically  
please wait a bit  
because I am currently testing something:

Based on my testing of UEFI booting  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031)  
on a KVM/QEMU VM with OVMF "TianoCore" UEFI firmware  
with SLES15-SP4  
it seems UEFI booting had worked (at least for me)  
with the nowadays default /usr/bin/xorrisofs

    # xorrisofs is now used as the preferred method for generating the iso image
    # with mkisofs and genisoimage as second and third option
    ISO_MKISOFS_BIN="$( type -p xorrisofs || type -p mkisofs || type -p genisoimage )"

see default.conf online for ReaR 2.7 at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L893](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L893)

So perhaps 'ebiso' has meanwhile become obsoleted by 'xorrisofs'?

@thomas-merz  
did you try out - and if not could you try out - whether or not  
UEFI booting works in your case when you use xorrisofs?

On my SLES15-SP4 system I have the RPM package  
xorriso-1.4.6-1.29.x86\_64 installed  
that is normally available for SLE15:

    # rpm -qi xorriso
    ...
    Packager    : https://www.suse.com/
    Vendor      : SUSE LLC <https://www.suse.com/>
    ...
    Distribution: SUSE Linux Enterprise 15

    # zypper info xorriso
    ...
    Repository     : sle-module-basesystem
    Name           : xorriso
    Version        : 1.4.6-1.29
    Arch           : x86_64
    Vendor         : SUSE LLC <https://www.suse.com/>

If SUSE ships xorriso and it works, it would be the best option.
Otherwise it possibly could be enough to add ebiso to the line
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7c5c9bc83db5202fb515cbaa803efcd18d9fcd1e/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1023](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7c5c9bc83db5202fb515cbaa803efcd18d9fcd1e/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1023)
ahead of mkisofs and genisoimage? Although "ebiso silently corrupts
files greater or equal 2GiB" (cf \#2525) does not sound very encouraging
for preferring ebiso, but perhaps mkisofs is no better in this respect.

@pcahyna  
as far as I know 'ebiso' is only for EFI boot  
but not for legacy BIOS boot.

What I found at its upstream location  
[https://gitlab.com/gozora/ebiso](https://gitlab.com/gozora/ebiso)  
all documentation tells only about \[U\]EFI and  
its sources contain neither 'bios' nor 'legacy' (with ignore case).

This is my primary problem:  
When 'ebiso' cannot be used for BIOS boot  
a reliably working method is needed  
to distinguish \[U\]EFI boot from BIOS boot.

But there is the general problem that  
it is impossible to determine in a reliable way  
how a running system was actually booted, cf. the  
section "Disaster recovery does not just work" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I will test with `xorriso` on friday and give feedback. This might be a
much easier solution - for maintainers (just an update in docu) and for
users/admins/customers…!

Yesterday and today I tested UEFI booting with OUTPUT=ISO  
on the same KVM/QEMU VM with OVMF "TianoCore" UEFI firmware  
with SLES15-SP4 that I had used with OUTPUT=USB  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3031)

I did not use the ReaR 2.7 release  
but a bit older 'git clone' of our current GitHub master code.

        Merge pull request #3025 from rear/jsmeix-create_grub2_cfg

Yesterday I tested without Secure Boot  
which worked for me.

Today I tested with Secure Boot  
which also worked for me.

For Secure Boot I specify in etc/rear/local.conf

    SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/sles/shim.efi"

cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1635876186](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1635876186)

My whole etc/rear/local.conf

    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )
    PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="5"

After reeboot of the recreated system  
I had the minor issue hat I described at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025\#issuecomment-1639798077](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3025#issuecomment-1639798077)

Reeboot of the recreated system works with Secure Boot enabled  
(at least on my KVM/QEMU VM with OVMF "TianoCore" UEFI firmware).  
After GRUB loaded kernel and initrd  
the message

    EFI stub: UEFI Secure Boot is enabled.

is visible for a short time (about one second or so).

@jsmeix `SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/sles/shim.efi"` - was it
not possible that ReaR guessed this automatically?

@gdha  
please just implement what you ask for  
(SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is nowhere set to a non-empty value)

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER='

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# 1. UEFI boot without secure boot (SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="")
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# For example: SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/shim.efi"
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:# so when for example SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/shim.efi" is specified
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER=""

@rear/contributors  
could you - please - do you and me a favour  
and contribute when you like to improve ReaR  
instead of asking me that I should do for you  
what you think is needed to make you feel better?

To avoid misunderstandings:  
When someone pays to get ReaR improved  
then the one can of course determine  
what others should do for the money  
provided both parties agree on a contract.

With `xorriso` installed I don't need to set
`ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso` anymore. So with the help/tipp/hint of
@jsmeix I solved my "problem" 👍🏼

I also tested booting the ISO that `xorriso` created with success. So I
will install it on all SLES15 servers and let Rear use it instead of
`mkisofs`.

@thomas-merz  
thank you very much for your testing and your feedback!  
It helps so much to have feedback how things behave  
for users "in real world out there" - and in particular  
positive feedback when things work (reasonably) well.

I will adapt the ReaR upstream documentation soon.  
I will also have a look at the SUSE documentation.

So shall we close this issue or do you need it as a reminder for
updating docu(s)?

I like to keep it open until I adapted  
the ReaR upstream documentation.
