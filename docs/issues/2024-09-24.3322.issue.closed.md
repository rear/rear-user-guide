@macMikey Did you format the USB before running `rear mkbackup`?  
I found an error in your log file:

i have tried partitioning+formatting it several different ways, used
rear to format it as per the quickstart, etc.  
i'm also not a worthy sysadmin, so suggestions (like - repartitioning a
certain way then formatting a certain way) are welcome.  
the goal is to make a bootable system recovery disk that i can build
daily or weekly, and save myself if the main drive on the machine dies.

@macMikey I noticed in your log-file that you renamed script
`/usr/share/rear/prep/USB/default/350_check_usb_disk.sh` to
`/usr/share/rear/prep/USB/default/350_check_usb_disk.sh.bak`. Was there
a reason for?

In script
`/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/850_make_USB_bootable.sh` you see
a comment like:

    # We assume REAL_USB_DEVICE and RAW_USB_DEVICE are both set by prep/USB/Linux-i386/350_check_usb_disk.sh
    [ "$RAW_USB_DEVICE" -a "$REAL_USB_DEVICE" ] || BugError "RAW_USB_DEVICE and REAL_USB_DEVICE are not both set"

1.  thanks for jumping in.
2.  i did not rename anything...at least not intentionally. AFAIK all i
    changed was the configuration file.  
    how did you even find that? is there a script that can be run that
    would identify issues like that?
3.  looking at that directory, it appears that that file is owned by
    root (all the others are owned by me - i installed rear), and was
    created a few minutes after the other files in the directory. so,
    either i managed to rename it (???), or something else happened...  
    so, just now, i copied the bak file to sh, and tried again:

<!-- -->

    sudo cp /usr/share/rear/prep/USB/default/350_check_usb_disk.sh.bak /usr/share/rear/prep/USB/default/350_check_usb_disk.sh
    sudo rear -vD mkrecover

the output looked promising. it looks like it might have achieved.  
i'll reply with all of it, including the log file, on monday...

i'm not going to waste space with the log. i have tried this multiple
times.  
thanks for the help. i think that fixed it.
