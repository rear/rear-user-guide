Currently rear contains many files  
with explicit GPL-2.0+ or GPL-2.1+ licensing notes  
of the form

<pre>
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version
</pre>

or

<pre>
either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version
</pre>

so that some (older) rear files are still "GPL-2.0+"  
but some (newer) rear files are "GPL-3.0"  
according to the current COPYING file in rear  
that was changed from GPL version 2 (up to rear 1.17.2)  
to GPL version 3 (since rear 1.18)
