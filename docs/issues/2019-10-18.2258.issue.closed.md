-   Currently there is a problem with creating a tar archive due to
    unknown reasons, or at least I couldn't find out the reason by
    myself. Would really appreciate any piece of advice on how to get
    Rear working again.

    This means that the archiving process ended prematurely, or did
    not even start. As a result it is unlikely you can recover this
    system properly. Relax-and-Recover is therefore aborting execution.

Seems like, after many hours, I have managed to work around the problem.

Despite the fact that I had my **S3 buckets** excluded from the backup,
they have been root cause of this issue, Everything has been resolved
after umounting them completely. It was quite a big surprise to me. I
have tried to understand the reason. Although it is not my area of
expertise, I strongly believe this might be related to the **dd**
command.

I would appreciate it if someone with bigger knowledge could explain the
reason and tell me whether this is a bug in the **REAR** or somewhere
else.

@jacekadamus88  
I never used anything like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)  
where its storage objects are organized into so called 'buckets'  
(I read
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon\_S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3)
for the first time)  
so I know nothing at all about its implications in relation to `tar`.

According to your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258\#issuecomment-544307011](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258#issuecomment-544307011)

    I had my S3 buckets excluded from the backup,
    they have been root cause of this issue,
    Everything has been resolved after umounting them completely.

I guess the following happened in your case:

By default ReaR has some automatism what disk components  
(like partitions, filesystems, mountpounts) get included or excluded  
and some (other but related) automatism what directories get  
included or excluded in the backup which do most of the time  
what is usually expected but no automatism works perfect.

From my experience with other issues the backup include/exclude
functionality  
versus the disk components include/exclude functionality in ReaR gets
"hairy"  
when it comes to unusual cases.

By default ReaR includes basically "what is mounted"  
while "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" is running  
except some automatically excluded things,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229)

Regarding the backup I implemented some time ago  
BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
see its documentation in the default.conf file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L999](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L999)  
that should help to specify explicitly what gets included in the backup.

Note that things like BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE and BACKUP\_ONLY\_EXCLUDE  
and many other BACKUP\_\* variables only

    apply to all cases of internal Relax-and-Recover backup

see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L893](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L893)

Run `rear -D mkbackup` (-D is debugscript mode)  
and inspect the log file what exactly happens while  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh)  
is running.  
That should (hopefully) show why a particular directory  
is automatically included in the backup,  
cf. the section "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Furthermore use `KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"` cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L128](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L128)  
so that you can after `rear mkbackup` inspect the contents of the files

    $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/tmp/backup-include.txt
    $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/tmp/backup-exclude.txt

to see what directories are actually included and excluded in the
backup.

If that is the case, then we can confirm that this is not (yet)

but in your case both `cat $FAILING_BACKUP_PROG_RC_FILE`

I would like to understand why in your case there is no such output.  
I guess your case is a special case where there is no such output  
but then we should be prepared for that case with reasonable  
fallback values to avoid such emptiness in the output.

I haven't tested this yet, but these two configuration parameters could
probably be considered the second workaround in this particular case.

I have recovered the system from the backup into the virtual machine and
run `rear -D mkbackup` as advised.  
Thankfully issue is reproducible after mounting s3fs.

    df -P -T /mnt/*
    Filesystem     Type       1024-blocks  Used    Available Capacity Mounted on

@gdha  
I believe, more or less to the mentioned article.  
These are exact commands i use to mount s3 buckets

    s3fs -o umask=0007,uid=0,gid=1008 -o allow_other aws-backups /mnt/s3backups
    s3fs -o umask=0007,uid=0,gid=1008 -o allow_other aws-archive /mnt/s3archive

I am afraid this is the case here, although the issue might be related
to one of the internally used commands (**tar**, **dd**)?

@jacekadamus88  
thank you for your prompt and detailed reply.

Regarding

    the issue might be related to one of the
    internally used commands (tar, dd)?

ReaR calls `tar` with the `--one-file-system` option, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh\#L136](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh#L136)  
for the whole `tar` command.

So you could try out how `tar` behaves in your particular case  
while you have things mounted via FUSE at some sub-directory of
`/mnt/`  
when you try out things like

    tar -czvf /dev/null --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system --anchored --exclude='/mnt/*' --exclude='/tmp/*' /  2>&1 | tee /tmp/tar.out

For me (on openSUSE Leap 15.0) that seems to work.  
For my test I use a sshfs mounted via FUSE (excerpts):

    # pwd
    /root

    # mkdir ~/fusessh

    # sshfs root@localhost:/tmp/ ~/fusessh
    Password: ...

    # mount | grep fuse
    ...
    root@localhost:/tmp/ on /root/fusessh type fuse.sshfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0)
    ...

    # tar -czvf /dev/null --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system --anchored /root/ 2>&1 | grep fuse
    /root/fusessh/
    tar: /root/fusessh/: file is on a different filesystem; not dumped

so for me `tar --one-file-system` excludes my sshfs mounted via FUSE.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for providing that tar command.  
`tar -czvf /dev/null --no-wildcards-match-slash --one-file-system --anchored --exclude='/mnt/*' --exclude='/tmp/*' /  2>&1 | tee /tmp/tar.out`  
Seems like it executed successfully.

I have run `rear -v mkbackuponly` and still no success.

Since tar behaves properly, I would say the issue might be somewhere
within "exit code" logic. In order, to track it down probably some

I also need your `backup.log` file which contains  
the debug output for the backup program subshell  
that is run by backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

Usually the `backup.log` file is copied to your NETFS output location  
but you use `OUTPUT_URL=null`.  
The `backup.log` file ist is also available where `rear -D mkbackup` is
run  
there in `/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXX/tmp/backup.log`  
provided you have `KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"` set,  
see the KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR description in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L128](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L128)

For example one of my `backup.log` files contains (excerpts)

Additionally to better see how the `Exit code logic`  
actually behaves in your case please insert in your  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
the line

    for e in "${pipes_rc[@]}" ; do echo "pipes_rc array element is '$e' " ; done

at

      for e in "${pipes_rc[@]}" ; do echo "pipes_rc array element is '$e' " ; done
      while [ $index -ge 0 ] ; do

and then provide your `backup.log` file  
for a \`rear -D mkbackup' run that fails for you.

Furthermore you should inspect your `backup.log` file  
for suspicious (error) messages that my indicate  
why things fail in your particular case.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for your next great reply

I have followed all suggested hints including `KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"` and
exit logic debug

    for e in "${pipes_rc[@]}" ; do echo "pipes_rc array element is '$e' " ; done

Looks like those things helped me to find out the real error being
thrown on that VM.  
It was simle

    No space left on device

I have recovered some space to accommodate the "build" directory and iso
image.  
And it went through.

    ++ exit 1

Although this doesn't answer what was the root cause of the issue on the
Real server, however, space issues can be excluded from the list of
*unexpected* issues.

Currently, I am not able to kick off the backup on real server, however,
I will make use of the suggested hints to track it down there whenever
possible.

I claimed that the root cause of the issue is somewhere within Rear,
however, this is not true. Seems like ReaR does handle s3fs well (at
least it ignores it properly when configured to do so).

I believe we can close that issue.

I would like to thank @jsmeix for the pieces of advice, that helped me
to get to the bottom of the problem. Hopefully, anyone else struggling
with a similar problem will benefit from this conversation.

@jacekadamus88  
thank you for your explanatory feedback.

As time permits I will try to reproduce it on my VMs  
because I would like to understand why such a hard error  
like "No space left on device" was somehow hidden  
so that 500\_make\_backup.sh failed inexplicably.

If I can reproduce it I wish I could get the root cause error message  
so that 500\_make\_backup.sh can show that error message to the user.

And this issue shows another problem in 500\_make\_backup.sh:

Parts of the `set -e` debug output are not in the usual log file  
but hidden in the separated `backup.log` file which is bad  
because we needed so much time and effort to find out  
where the root cause error actually is.  
The separated `backup.log` file contradicts

    All what could be useful for later debugging
    in case of issues must appear in ReaR's log file.

in the section "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

My immediate untested offhanded idea is to somehow get  
the `set -e` debug output of the backup subshell process  
also in the normal log file (in addition to the `backup.log` file).

Furthermore this issue may show a redirection problem  
in 500\_make\_backup.sh:

    (
    case "$(basename ${BACKUP_PROG})" in
        ...
    esac 2> "${TMP_DIR}/${BACKUP_PROG_ARCHIVE}.log"
    ...
    ) &
    BackupPID=$!

Only stderr is redirected into the `backup.log` file  
but not also stdout as it should be normally done nowadays  
according to "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so stdout messages from the backup subshell would  
appear in the normal ReaR log file needlessly split apart  
matching stderr messages from the backup subshell.

Finally this issue shows one more problem in ReaR:

The `backup.log` file does not appear as the normal ReaR log file  
in var/log/rear locally on the system where 'rear mkbackup' was run  
at least not for me with

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://your.NFS.server.IP/path/to/your/rear/backup

where the `backup.log` file only appears on my remote NFS share  
but not locally in var/log/rear.

@jacekadamus88  
if you find futher issues in ReaR because of what still fails for you  
I would prefer if you open new separated GitHub issues  
each one for each separated issue in ReaR so that  
we can handle separated issues separatedly.

Yes, I know,  
but it seems in this case the `tar` exit code is `1`  
see "The output from the backup.log" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258\#issuecomment-546091056](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2258#issuecomment-546091056)  
which should output (excerpt)

    This means that files have been modified during the archiving

but that does not match the initial comment here

    This means that the archiving process ended prematurely

which happens when exit code &gt; 1 according to the code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh\#L262](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh#L262)

I can reproduce it:

I use a virtual machine with a separated filesystem for /tmp  
that has 1GiB size which is too small to store the backup  
there via `BACKUP_URL=file:///tmp`.

I use in etc/rear/local.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS

    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS=3
    KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( no )
    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )

I get no var/log/rear/backup.log file.  
I have only the one in /tmp/rear.XXXX/tmp  
I.e. without KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes" I would have  
no backup.log file at all.

The reason for the emptiness of exit code and  
backup program error message in the output  
is the emptiness of the files  
/tmp/rear.lwYlarbzswNQcsq/tmp/failing\_backup\_prog  
and  
/tmp/rear.lwYlarbzswNQcsq/tmp/failing\_backup\_prog\_rc

because those files cannot be written

    ++ echo 1
    ... echo: write error: No space left on device

This shows there is one more bug in 500\_make\_backup.sh  
that is related to the code

            # Variable used to record the short name of piped commands in case of
            # error, e.g. ( "tar" "cat" "dd" ) in case of unencrypted and unsplit backup.
            backup_prog_shortnames=(
                "$(basename $(echo "$BACKUP_PROG" | awk '{ print $1 }'))"
                "$(basename $(echo "$BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_OPTIONS" | awk '{ print $1 }'))"
                "$(basename $(echo "$SPLIT_COMMAND" | awk '{ print $1 }'))"
            )

that leads to

    backup_prog_shortnames[0]="tar"
    backup_prog_shortnames[1]="openssl"
    backup_prog_shortnames[2]="dd"

But `openssl` is not used in the backup pipe in my case  
because BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_ENABLED is not true  
which leads to a wrong `echo openssl` instead of `echo dd`  
for the failed program name in the backup pipe  
which would result a wrong $prog value for the code

                else
                    rc=$(cat $FAILING_BACKUP_PROG_RC_FILE)
                    Error "$prog failed with return code $rc and below output:
