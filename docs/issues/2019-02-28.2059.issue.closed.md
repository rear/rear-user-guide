I checked the same process with the `BACKUP=TSM` and there was no
problem.  
I've tested the case that an client of us could use an newer hardware
with an bigger hard drive or RAID system.

As far as I see on first glance in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2915792/rear-FBD01PSS.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2915792/rear-FBD01PSS.log)  
it is neither the `wipefs --force` nor any other command in

    cleanup_command='wipefs --all --force /dev/sda3 || wipefs --all /dev/sda3 || dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda3 bs=512 count=1 || true'

that makes it fail because of the `|| true` at the end.

Where diskrestore.sh actually fails is at

    +++ mkfs -t ext4 -b 4096 -i 16346 -F /dev/sda3
    mke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)

    ++ ((  1 == 0  ))
    ++ true
    +++ UserInput -I LAYOUT_CODE_RUN -p 'The disk layout recreation script failed' -D 'Rerun disk recreation script (/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh)' ...

That needs to be investigated why that fails.  
It seems something with your /dev/sda3 is not right...

@jsmeix Yes, there is something with the /dev/sda3.  
The recreation script must expand the volume/partition a little bit,
because the new disk is bigger than before like i mentioned above.

It does increase the last partition /dev/sda3  
as it should according to what there is in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2915792/rear-FBD01PSS.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2915792/rear-FBD01PSS.log)

    Changed last partition /dev/sda3 size from 156308078592 to 209995169792 bytes

which results in diskrestore.sh this parted call

    +++ parted -s /dev/sda mkpart ''\''primary'\''' 4753195008B 214748364799B

where `214748364799 - ( 4753195008 - 1 ) = 209995169792` is as it
should  
(4753195008 is the first byte of that partition and 214748364799 is the
last one  
so both belong "inside" the partition).

This are all parted calls while diskrestore.sh is run

    ...
    +++ partprobe -s /dev/sda
    /dev/sda: msdos partitions 1 2 3

and all run without an error so that afterwards there should be
/dev/sda  
with the partition device nodes /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3  
but somehow something is wrong with /dev/sda3 because then

    +++ Log 'Creating filesystem of type ext4 with mount point / on /dev/sda3.'
    ...
    +++ wipefs --all /dev/sda3
    wipefs: error: /dev/sda3: probing initialization failed
    +++ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda3 bs=512 count=1

    ...
    +++ mkfs -t ext4 -b 4096 -i 16346 -U fd2aaed0-d3c1-4bf4-99cb-e12f3da6a5c4 -F /dev/sda3

    mke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
    mkfs.ext4: No such device or address while trying to determine filesystem size

so it seems in contrast to what partprobe had reported before

    +++ partprobe -s /dev/sda
    /dev/sda: msdos partitions 1 2 3

there is no partition device node /dev/sda3 on your particular system.

From my current point of view this issue looks like just one more
instance  
of the various annoyances with asynchroneously created device nodes  
where one cannot know when a device node will actually appear  
and - even worse - when an existing device node stays there stable.

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)  
and follow the links therein.

Some blind shot in the dark what might help:

In general when device nodes that are expected to appear are late  
it helps to sit and wait until the system (hardware kernel udev
whatever...)  
has settled its various activity so that at the

With probability one when

    with the 'rear -D recover' executed a second time it worked

the root cause are those kind of timing issues that I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2059\#issuecomment-468597405](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2059#issuecomment-468597405)

I.e. try to make the diskrestore.sh script wait a bit before it
creates  
the filesystems so that the needed device nodes will be there.

@dcz01  
I think you misunderstood me - I meant that you change things in your
ReaR  
as you need it for your use case - at least as a workaround - because  
currently I don't know how to correctly wait for the real thing, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/791)

I think in your particular case where `wipefs --force ` does not work  
you may change in your  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
the value of the `cleanup_command` to something like

    cleanup_command="sleep 5 && wipefs --all $device || dd if=/dev/zero of=$device bs=512 count=1 || true"

so that it does a dumb wait of 5 seconds to let (hopefully) /dev/sda3
appear  
before it tries to clean it up and afterwards makes a filesystem on it.

@jsmeix Ah well ok, now i understand you. But for an future release it
would be great to insert this change for all ReaR users by default or?

@dcz01  
this totally depends on how enthusiastic your feedback is  
if it really works for you this way... ;-)

If it works with `sleep 5` please test if it also reliably works with
`sleep 1`  
because I would much prefer to not sleep too much because  
on systems with many filesystems it would sleep hardcoded  
that amount of time for each one of the filesystems, cf.

@jsmeix When i edit your solution in that file
`/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130_include_filesystem_code.sh`
in the rescue system, i also get the same error with `sleep 5` or
`sleep 1`.  
Or am i editing the wrong file in rescue mode?

@dcz01  
provided it really sleeps it is disappointing that this does not help.  
I was sure it would help to wait and then /dev/sda3 would finally
appear.

Did you try to verify that sleeping won't help at all in your case  
by let it sleep very long, e.g. `sleep 60` or even `sleep 300`?

If waiting would not help at all here, this case could become  
just another frustrating example how unpredictable and hopeless  
things have become since device nodes appear and disappear  
asynchronously and dynamically so that in practice it behaves randomly.

Check your ReaR log file in debug mode (i.e. `rear -D recover`)  
to verify that it actually sleeps.

In the running recovery system use
`find / | grep include_filesystem_code`  
to find where that script actually is in your particular recovery
system.

Normally it is in `/usr/share/rear/...` but when you run e.g. our
current ReaR  
GitHub master code from within a separated directory as described at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2019\#issuecomment-469219216](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2019#issuecomment-469219216)  
then the scripts are in the recovery system at a different place,  
e.g. on my test systems where I run the ReaR GitHub master code  
this way (and I always use `KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"` cf. default.conf)  
I have the scripts (on the original system where I run
`rear -D mkrescue`):

    # find /tmp/rear.UK5Jx27aSLvwZ62/rootfs/ | grep include_filesystem_code
    /tmp/rear.UK5Jx27aSLvwZ62/rootfs/root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130_include_filesystem_code.sh

i.e. I would get the scripts in the running recovery system under

    /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/...

and in this case /usr/share/rear would be a symlink  
that points to /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear  
so that in the running recovery system the ReaR scripts  
can be always found under /usr/share/rear/...

I verified on my test system that in  
.../layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh

    cleanup_command="sleep 15 && wipefs ...

actually lets it sleep 15 seconds.

@dcz01  
had no time today so only a short notice how you may proceed  
(which means how you could do some debugging legwork):

After you logged in into the recovery system  
do manually what the diskrestore.sh script would do  
to see how things behave in your case step by step.

Use a recent "rear -D recover" log file to see what  
the diskrestore.sh script would do or even better  
copy the diskrestore.sh script out of the recovery system,  
perferably also attach it here as reference, so that you can  
inspect directly what the diskrestore.sh script would do.

Before the first 'parted' command and after each  
subsequent command that you do run commands like

    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print

    # ls -l /dev/sda*

    # find /dev/disk/by-* -ls | grep '/sda'

    # lsblk -i -p -o NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

to see at each step what there actually happens regarding your `sda`  
and how that changes for each parted, wipefs, and mkfs call  
that you do on your particular system.

@dcz01  
according to your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2941002/diskrestore.zip](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/2941002/diskrestore.zip)  
what I mean that you should run manually in a new booted recovery
system  
(without having done any "rear recover" attempt before)  
is something like

    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
    # ls -l /dev/sda*

    # parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos
    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
    # ls -l /dev/sda*

    # parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 1048576B 525336575B
    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print

    # parted -s /dev/sda set 1 boot on
    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print

    # parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 525336576B 4753195007B
    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
    # ls -l /dev/sda*

    # parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 4753195008B 214748364799B
    # parted -s /dev/sda unit MiB print
    # ls -l /dev/sda*

    # tune2fs  -m 3 -c -1 -i 0d -o user_xattr,acl /dev/sda3
    # lsblk -i -p -o NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

    # mkdir -p /mnt/local/
    # mount -o rw /dev/sda3 /mnt/local/
    # lsblk -i -p -o NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

and see how far you can get with that...

If the disk is not new, i.e. if there is already some old stuff on it,
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/799)  
how to use `wipefs` in the recovery system directly after login as
root  
to first and foremost clean up the used dik before anything else is
done  
with that disk (i.e. before one runs `parted` and things like that).

@jsmeix  
I also got some information that a program wasn't found...

@dcz01  
so we have a "heisenbug" here,  
cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)  
because it seems all "just work" (there is not any error message)  
when you do the actual setup commands manually.

Currently I have no idea how to find out why things fail when  
those setup commands are called by the diskrestore.sh script.

Don't worry that you don't have `lsblk` in your recovery system.  
It is not needed to set up something.  
It would only show the results in a nice way.  
You can add it to your recovery system via

    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" lsblk )

Since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b4fd97fd47d8c15ca1383dd911ec018780dce77b](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/b4fd97fd47d8c15ca1383dd911ec018780dce77b)  
(which had happened after the ReaR 2.4 release in June 2018))  
`lsblk` is included in the recovery system by default.

@rmetrich  
could you have a look here - perhaps you have an idea what goes wrong
here.

It is RHEL 6.10 where basically things fail when the partition and  
filesystem setup commands are called by the diskrestore.sh script  
but things work when the same commands are called manually  
in the recovery system.

Perhaps - only a blind guess - the additional `my_udevtrigger` and  
`my_udevsettle` calls (cf. usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh)  
in diskrestore.sh do more harm than good in this particular case?
