hi,

it seems that on debian jessie some systemd realted files have been
moved from /usr/lib/systemd to /lib/systemd, as such the files are not
included (or some rear related startup files refer to /usr/lib/systemd)

you will note this as it fails to bringup the udevd service and the
network during bootup of the  
recovery cdrom.

As a whacky workaround i have copied the files from /lib/systemd to
/usr/lib/systemd on my testsystem  
to confirm that it correctly boots up if the files are included, and it
does.

Bootup with those missing systemd files will look like:

made a symbolic link from `buidl/SUSE_LINUX/61_link_systemd_lib.sh` to
`build/Debian/61_link_systemd_lib.sh` which should fix it mormally.

On my test systemd failed to start udev Kernel Device Manager - still
needs investigation. As a result the ethernet interface is not
recognized....

See my pull request. I think the SUSE Workaround will not work on debian
as it only symlinks the systemd/system directory but on debian the
scripts are referenced one directory above.
