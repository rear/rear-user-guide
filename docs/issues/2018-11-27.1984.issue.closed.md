Hi team,  
I have used a single ISO recovery image as per guide of REDHAT. I have
used following settings for creating both rescue and backup data on
single iso image. My ISO image file is created successfully of size 6.5
GB. When I try to recover data from this ISO image on another physical
server, I get the following error. Please guide what I am missing.

Environment:  
RHEL 7.4  
Physical Blade Serer Gen 8

Source Host:  
\[root@localhost rear\]\# cat /etc/rear/local.conf

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///srv/backup/  
BACKUP\_URL=iso:///rear  
BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*'
'/home/attiq.rehman/rhel-server-7.3-x86\_64-dvd.iso' )  
BKUP\_MAX\_SIZE=3500MB

Target Host:  
rear -d -v recover

cat /var/log/rear/rear-localhost.log  
Error:  
"the workflow restore is not supported in the rear rescue/recovery
system"

@attiqmscs004  
there is no `restore` workflow in ReaR so that I cannot imagine  
from your error message alone what goes on in your particular case.  
Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
that reads (excerpt):

<pre>
Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files)
</pre>

see also "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Is that "another physical server" same hardware as the original
system?  
If it is different, how exactly is it different?

Apology for typo mistake.  
It is recover instead of restore.

rear -v recover

@attiqmscs004 please show us the log file with the error message
(preferably in debug mode)

@attiqmscs004 Did you boot from the ISO image on the 2th system?  
If no reply received within 2 weeks we will close this issue - ok?
