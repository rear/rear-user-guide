Moved the guess\_bootloader script  
from prep/default/500\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
to layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1266](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1266)  
and some other minor cleanup and adaptions  
that are somehow related to that issue.

"rear mkbackup" + "rear recover" test on SLES12 still works.
