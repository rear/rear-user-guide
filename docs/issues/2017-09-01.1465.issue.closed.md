Guess something went wrong in our numbering scheme when we build are new
packages?  
@schlomo Could you have have a look at?

Oh no, this is indeed not good. @jsmeix any idea? My OBS days are long
over unfortunately.

Good thing that we have an official Debian package that is built
independently.

In download section of stable rear I find unstable diff/dsc which we do
not find for older releases. I think this brings us into problems with
the 2.2 build

I think this is not an issue of the Open Build Service  
but an issue of how the package is built for Debian/Ubuntu  
(i.e. an issue in the Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.2 sources  
therein probably in the debian related files).  
Unfortunately I know nothing at all about how to build  
packages for Debian/Ubuntu (I only know about RPM).  
By blind inspecting the Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.2  
source files I found in rear.dsc:

<pre>
Version: 2.1-0git201706261424
</pre>

where the value matches.

I noticed that the Snapshot series for Debian and Ubuntu are also
broken:

I found out that OBS requires the existence of a **description** file
(`rear.dsc`) which was left out during working on issue \#1362. In OBS
there was one there - albeit an old one pointing to 2.1-0git201706261424
which explained that this particular version was build.

OK the Debian/Ubuntu build went fine on OBS now with a rear.dsc being
there and containing the correct versions nr

Fixed on OBS manually the rear.dsc file on the stable branch of
**rear-2.2** and now the rear-2.2 versions for Debian and Ubuntu are
build correctly on OBS.  
I think we are good the close this issue
