When using the alternative config directory option (-c) the resultant
restore images are not usable. The alternative config directory is not
included in the rescue image and the default config directory does not
include a valid config.

From a mail from Nassar:  
Looks like the problem occurs when i use the -c option, i have a 2nd
site.conf in /etc/rear/systems

so when i run: rear -vd -c /etc/rear/systems mkbackup

I see the following in the log file:

    /usr/share/rear/build/default/99_update_os_conf.sh: line 3: /tmp/rear.Nsc16WdcVitzDws/rootfs//etc/rear/systems/os.conf: No such file or directory
    /usr/share/rear/build/default/99_update_os_conf.sh: line 6: /tmp/rear.Nsc16WdcVitzDws/rootfs//etc/rear/systems/os.conf: No such file or directory

probably because the systems directory does not exist on the recovery
media, i will do some more testing but at this point i am thinking that
this is a bug with the alternative config directory option

@nassarmu in recovery mode you just need to type `rear -v recover`
(without the `-c DIR` option as the content of the alternative directory
was copied to `/etc/rear` in the recovery image).
