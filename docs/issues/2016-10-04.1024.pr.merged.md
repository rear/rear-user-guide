Non-ASCII characters (e.g. UTF-8 characters) in scripts  
are not wanted, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1018\#issuecomment-251385721](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1018#issuecomment-251385721)

Non-ASCII characters (e.g. UTF-8 characters) in scripts  
might even cause failures on systems that do not  
support non-POSIX/non-C locales (like UTF-8),  
e.g. in the recovery system during "rear recover".

Currently non-ASCII characters were only used in  
comments in the scripts but even that makes it at least  
hard to read the comments in a non-ASCII locale  
in particular because it is impossible to know  
what encoding is meant by a sequence of bytes  
that is a non-ASCII character, cf.
