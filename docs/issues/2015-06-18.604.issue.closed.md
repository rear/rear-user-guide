Noticed during OBS builds the following errors/warnings for Debian 7 (or
8):

    [   70s] N:    Build-Conflicts, or Build-Conflicts-Indep field in a binary section.
    [   70s] N:    These specify source package relationships, and should be in the source
    [   70s] N:    section of the control file.
    [   70s] N:    
    [   70s] N:    Refer to Debian Policy Manual section 5.2 (Source package control files
    [   70s] N:    -- debian/control) for details.

    [   70s] N:    using ${shlibs:Depends} in its debian/control stanza.

    [   70s] N: 
    [   70s] N:    The source package uses debhelper, but it does not include
    [   70s] N:    ${misc:Depends} in the given binary package's debian/control entry. Any
    [   70s] N:    debhelper command may add dependencies to ${misc:Depends} that are
    [   70s] N:    required for the work that it does, so recommended best practice is to
    [   70s] N:    always add ${misc:Depends} to the dependencies of each binary package if
    [   70s] N:    debhelper is in use.
    [   70s] N:    
    [   70s] N:    Refer to the debhelper(7) manual page for details.

    [   70s] N: 
    [   70s] N:    The package uses debhelper but does not ship a compat file. This is
    [   70s] N:    deprecated and eventaully cause the package to FTBFS.
    [   70s] N:    
    [   70s] N:    Please refer to the dehelper documentation on how to create the compat
    [   70s] N:    file and the differences between each compat level.
    [   70s] N:    
    [   70s] N:    Refer to
    [   70s] N:    http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/debhelper/news/20120115T191738Z.html and

    [   71s] N: 
    [   71s] N:    When you NMU a package, that fact should be mentioned on the first line
    [   71s] N:    in the changelog entry. Use the words "NMU" or "Non-maintainer upload"
    [   71s] N:    (case insensitive).
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:    Maybe you didn't intend this upload to be a NMU, in that case, please
    [   71s] N:    doublecheck that the most recent entry in the changelog is byte-for-byte
    [   71s] N:    identical to the maintainer or one of the uploaders. If this is a local
    [   71s] N:    package (not intended for Debian), you can suppress this warning by
    [   71s] N:    putting "local" in the version number or "local package" on the first
    [   71s] N:    line of the changelog entry.
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:    Refer to Debian Developer's Reference section 5.11.3 (Using the DELAYED/

    [   71s] N: 
    [   71s] N:    A source NMU should have a Debian revision of "-x.x" (or "+nmuX" for a
    [   71s] N:    native package). This is to prevent stealing version numbers from the
    [   71s] N:    maintainer.
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:    Maybe you didn't intend this upload to be a NMU, in that case, please
    [   71s] N:    doublecheck that the most recent entry in the changelog is byte-for-byte

    [   71s] N: 
    [   71s] N:    As of debhelper version 4, the DH_COMPAT environment variable is only to
    [   71s] N:    be used for temporarily overriding debian/compat. Any line in
    [   71s] N:    debian/rules that sets it globally should be deleted and a separate
    [   71s] N:    debian/compat file created if needed.
    [   71s] N:

    [   71s] N: 
    [   71s] N:    The debian/rules file for this package does not provide one of the
    [   71s] N:    recommended targets. All of build-arch and build-indep should be
    [   71s] N:    provided, even if they don't do anything for this package. If this
    [   71s] N:    package does not currently split building of architecture dependent and
    [   71s] N:    independent packages, the following rules may be added to fall back to
    [   71s] N:    the build target:
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:      build-arch: build
    [   71s] N:      build-indep: build
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:    Note that the following form is recommended however:
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:      build: build-arch build-indep
    [   71s] N:      build-arch: build-stamp
    [   71s] N:      build-indep: build-stamp
    [   71s] N:      build-stamp:
    [   71s] N:    build here
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:    These targets will be required by policy in the future, so should be
    [   71s] N:    added to prevent future breakage.
    [   71s] N:    
    [   71s] N:    Refer to Debian Policy Manual section 4.9 (Main building script:

    [   71s] N:    Please update your package to latest Policy and set this control field
    [   71s] N:    appropriately.
    [   71s] N:
