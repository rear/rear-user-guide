-   Brief description of the issue

    -   When i boot using the ISO, NW Device name is changed from
        p12XXXX to ethX  
        so during the recover, i set the IP by myself.

    After complete to recover, i reboot.  
    But after reboot, NW Device name is still ethX.

    Please tell me how to fix it.  
    Thank you and Best regards.

-   Work-around, if any

@kodiss The usage of biosdevname can be enforced on every hardware with
"biosdevname=1". If the BIOS has no support, no network interface names
are renamed. See
[https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86\_64/SUSE-SLES/11-SP3/\#fate-311333](https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/11-SP3/#fate-311333)  
Or, see also issue \#951  
You could try to define `KERNEL_CMDLINE="biosdevname=1"` in the
`/etc/rear/local.conf` file and see what happens (the `biosdevname`
executable is already copied to the ramdisk if available). So, be sure
it is on your system of course.

Thank you for you support, I also know about biosdevname.  
But i don't know the option for rear.

Thank you so much!

@kodiss I would appreciate feedback if what I proposed actually worked
or not?

unfortunately, I don't have enough time for test because this system
will be opend for our customer.  
I'm sorry but i don't forget your help.  
Thank you.
