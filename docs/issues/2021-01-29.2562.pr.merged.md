-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not at all tested by me (I don't use EFI).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Add 2 more 32MiB blocks to be on the safe side against inexplicaple
failures like  
"cp: error writing '/tmp/rear.XXX/tmp/efi\_virt/./EFI/BOOT/elilo.conf':
No space left on device"  
where the above calculated $efi\_img\_sz is a bit too small in practice.

Always nice to see how one could make code even simpler:

I wish you all a relaxed and recovering weekend!

I would like to wait until next week so that @abbbi has a chance to test
it,  
cf.

Interestingly `(( var += 2 ))` does not result an error if $var is no
number

    # foo=123 ; (( foo += 2 )) && echo "'$foo'" || echo fail
    echo '125'

    # foo=bar ; (( foo += 2 )) && echo "'$foo'" || echo fail
    echo '2'

at least for me with GNU bash version 4.4.23 (on openSUSE Leap 15.2).

@abbbi  
thank you for testing it!
