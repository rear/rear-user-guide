#### Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue (quick
response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):

    (cloned today)

        Relax-and-Recover 1.19 / Git

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):

        No LSB modules are available.
        Distributor ID: Ubuntu
        Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
        Release:        16.04
        Codename:       xenial

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

    (directly from the example)

        ### write the rescue initramfs to USB and update the USB bootloader
        OUTPUT=USB
        ### create a backup using the internal NETFS method, using 'tar'
        BACKUP=NETFS
        ### write both rescue image and backup to the device labeled REAR-000
        BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

-   Brief description of the issue

    On boot, the screen is showing garbage (sometimes just a few lines),
    though they tend to be "responsive" to arrow keys. When I press
    enter, it boots to the local drive. Once booting has started, the
    local-drive linux console works fine, all boot messages work fine.
    This is a server, no GDM or X installed.

    I have seen this before with linux when the console video driver was
    not correct. I don't know how to set it here. I have been able to
    successfully boot to other linux distro boot-USBs.

-   Work-around, if any

    None found yet. I have only done `mkrescue`, nothing else;
    referencing the examples in "Booting from USB storage device"
    (`04-scenarios.adoc` line 240), I don't know how many arrows I need
    to get to a certain menu. I've tried twice and ended up booting
    local or entering grub. I'd much prefer to not have to navigate the
    menus blindly.

Thanks for all the work.

I am afraid I cannot help with setting the right console video driver.  
Perhaps the attached image of a ReaR recovery system boot screen  
could help you a bit to navigate blindly for now as a workaround:  
In particular:  
The preselected entry boots from the first local disk  
(i.e. that usually boots your installed system).  
The topmost entry boots the ReaR recovery system.  
When you hit many times the up arrow key it does not wrap around  
at the topmost entry - i.e. to boot the ReaR recovery system use  
many times the up arrow key and then the enter key.

The image of a ReaR recovery system boot screen  
is for traditional BIOS boot, for (U)EFI it is different.

That's helpful, thanks for the updated image. The no-wrap is helpful,
too. Thanks!

(It is traditional BIOS, not (U)EFI, so I don't think that's the issue.
The server is a Dell PowerEdge T630, for reference.)

ReaR uses syslinux/isolinux for creating  
its bootable recovery ISO image, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764)

When you set in /etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
</pre>

then "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" will not remove its  
build directory of the form /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
(cf. "TMPDIR" in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
so that you can after "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" inspect  
in detail what your ReaR recovery system contains.

For example on my test system I get two identical

<pre>
/tmp/rear.MRb3SRJ7wUq9pKs/tmp/isofs/isolinux/isolinux.cfg
/tmp/rear.MRb3SRJ7wUq9pKs/tmp/isolinux/isolinux.cfg
</pre>

which contain things like

<pre>
MENU label Recover f79
...
append initrd=initrd.cgz root=/dev/ram0 vga=normal rw selinux=0 console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0
</pre>

The 'vga=normal' string appears in the ReaR sources in those files  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
usr/share/rear/output/PXE/default/810\_create\_pxelinux\_cfg.sh  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh

There is no other 'vga=' string in the ReaR sources  
which means 'vga=normal' is set hardcoded  
and that has always worked (as far as I know).

The make\_syslinux\_config function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh is called in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh and  
usr/share/rear/output/OBDR/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh

When I run "rear -s mkbackup" on my test system  
I get in particular

<pre>
# rear -s mkbackup
...
Source output/ISO/Linux-i386/300_create_isolinux.sh
</pre>

which indicates that it is the make\_syslinux\_config function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
that sets the 'vga=normal' kernel command line parameter  
when booting the ReaR recovery system.

You could play around with the kernel command line  
settings of the make\_syslinux\_config function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
to try out if something makes it work for you.

Alternatively  
and even better from my point of view, cf:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/951\#issuecomment-239836711](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/951#issuecomment-239836711)

Because 'vga=normal' should work on any system  
(I never had an issue with an unintelligible  
ReaR recovery system boot screen)  
I assume there is something special on your particular  
hardware why it does not work with 'vga=normal'.

Therefore I would first of all recommend to try to find out  
if you could make your particular hardware behave "normal"  
so that it works with with traditional 'vga=normal'.

Only if that is not possible I would try to adapt ReaR  
especially for your particular hardware.

Correction:

With "OUTPUT=USB" it is  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh  
that is used.

On my test system I had "OUTPUT=ISO" and then  
the make\_syslinux\_config function in  
usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh is called in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh

@r2evans  
in your case - if you need to adapt ReaR - you must change  
usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh

I would start with updating syslinux and extlinux. The problem is most
of the times an outdated version of the video driver within one of those
packages

Many thanks for all of the suggestions. Because I'm dealing with a
"commercial Dell server", I'm not surprised that "normal" is not quite
right. When I speak with others with similar servers about similar
issues, they all report using the high-end commercial configurations,
including vSphere and others provided directly from Dell. Not a bad
thing, mind you, but many non-standard BIOS extensions/configurations
seem to mess with doing things "my way" (i.e., not through Dell).

The pointers and walk-through are very-much appreciated, I'll report
back if I find something meaningful.

@r2evans  
you can forget all what I wrote above about the  
'vga=normal' kernel command line parameter.  
That setting has nothing to do with the ReaR  
recovery system boot screen.

Reason:

The ReaR recovery system boot screen is  
not shown by the kernel of the ReaR recovery system.

Instead the ReaR recovery system boot screen is  
shown by the ReaR recovery system boot loader  
i.e. by syslinux/isolinux/extlinux.

While the ReaR recovery system boot screen is shown  
no kernel is loaded - loading the kernel happens after  
you selected a boot entry on the ReaR recovery system  
boot screen.

When the ReaR recovery system boot loader has loaded  
the kernel, then kernel command line parameters  
come into effect.

Only a blind guess:

Syslinux supports two user interface modules  
menu.c32 (text mode only) and vesamenu.c32 (graphical).

ReaR uses always menu.c32.

Perhaps in your particular case you need vesamenu.c32?

See  
[http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Menu](http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Menu)

<pre>
The simple menu system is based on a module located
at com32/menu/vesamenu.c32 (graphical)
or com32/menu/menu.c32 (text mode only).
...
To use the menu system, simply make sure [vesa]menu.c32
is in the appropriate location for the boot medium (the same
directory as the configuration file for SYSLINUX, EXTLINUX
and ISOLINUX, and the same directory as pxelinux.0 for
PXELINUX), and put the following options in the configuration
file :

DEFAULT menu.c32
PROMPT 0

Another alternative, using the UI directive:

UI menu.c32
</pre>

On my test system I have in my  
/tmp/rear.MRb3SRJ7wUq9pKs/tmp/isolinux/isolinux.cfg  
at the bottom

<pre>
default menu.c32
</pre>

and I have both syslinux user interface modules  
menu.c32 and vesamenu.c32  
/tmp/rear.MRb3SRJ7wUq9pKs/tmp/isolinux/menu.c32  
/tmp/rear.MRb3SRJ7wUq9pKs/tmp/isolinux/vesamenu.c32  
so that it seems one can also use

<pre>
default vesamenu.c32
</pre>

I changed in usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh

<pre>
    echo "default menu.c32"
</pre>

to

<pre>
    echo "default vesamenu.c32"
</pre>

and for me it worked.

I get now the ReaR recovery system boot screen  
in graphical mode (with same textual content).

@r2evans  
because you use "OUTPUT=USB" you may try out if it  
works for you to change in  
/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300\_create\_extlinux.sh

<pre>
    syslinux_write "default menu.c32"
</pre>

to

<pre>
    syslinux_write "default vesamenu.c32"
</pre>

I assume it somehow works because "no news is good news".

Generally a necessary assumption, though I haven't been able to test it
(been on travel). It sounds fair, though, so coding it is fine for now.
I'll come back when I'm able to confirm or not. Thanks, by the way, for
the suggestions.
