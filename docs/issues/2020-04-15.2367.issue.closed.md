Hello Support,

So with the same setting when I do a REAR backup to an NFS server it
backs up the system files not only the ISO image.

'/boot' '/' 'swap' '/dev'

Why is Networker backing up these files?

@IT-Guy-1973 First of all 1.17.2 is really old! Please upgrade ReaR to
2.4 or 2.5.  
And, yes ReaR will only save the ISO file after the mkbackup and it is
designed in this way (was a sponsored project). With EMC Networker (and
this is also true for all EXTERNAL backup programs) you are responsible
of making your own full backup of the Linux system.

@gdha When I ran "yum in rear" on my RedHat v6.10 system it installed
this version. I will look to upgrade it soon. But so far it has been
working great.  
When I backed up my VM to an NFS file system and restored it - REAR did
all the work. It created the disk to restore and created the MBR and
everything. Can I expect the same experience when I integrate it with
Networker? Networker currently takes backup of all my file systems on
that server on a daily basis. I am going to try the restore soon but I
just wanted to ask you first.

Some background:  
Our larger goal is to implement rear on our 23000 VM's and physical
servers we support. They all run either RedHat (v6 and v7) and SUSE (v11
and v12). So the support you are providing me now by answering all my
questions is really appreciated. Thank you, again.

Hello Support,

I was able to restore using NSR to another new system (VM) with the same
hard disk sizes. However, when restoring to the new system REAR
identified that the IP was different but it said "Disks are identical"
and started the restore without prompting me. I had two disks on this
system one 80GB and the other 40GB. Both belong to different volume
groups. But REAR restored all data to one disk and (80GB) and kept the
other disk free. The system after restore went to maintenance mode and I
had to manually comment out the file system that belongs to the second
VG to bring the system up.

@IT-Guy-1973  
see in default.conf the section about  
`MIGRATION_MODE recovery during "rear recover"`  
how ReaR determines if "Disks are identical"  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L351](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L351)  
and also the subsequent section about  
`Resizing partitions in MIGRATION_MODE during "rear recover"`

You don't have that in your old ReaR 1.17.2 version.  
But you really must have that newer and much more fail-safe behaviour.  
In particular when you migrate systems.

See the ReaR release notes for some more info  
about that newer and much more fail-safe behaviour,  
in particular follow the links to some of the scaring issues  
that had led to the newer and much more fail-safe behaviour  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

ReaR version 2.3 has an improved MIGRATION\_MODE autodetection  
when the disk layout looks ambiguous.

ReaR version 2.4 has major rework and changed default behaviour  
how ReaR behaves in migration mode when partitions can or must  
be resized to fit on replacement disks with different size.

ReaR version 2.5 has lots of other improvements that are in particular  
useful in migration mode i.e. when the replacement system has  
non-identical hardware (e.g. `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` and  
a new config variable `GRUB2_INSTALL_DEVICES` and so on...).

Newer ReaR will never start the restore without prompting you.  
There is always a confirmation dialog with 30 seconds timeout, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271\#issuecomment-346788244](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271#issuecomment-346788244)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh\#L136](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250_compare_disks.sh#L136)  
Only if you do nothing it will start the restore after the timeout.  
This is to be backward compatible with automated restore behaviour.

Note that resizing only happens for plain disk partitions  
but not for higher level storage objects like logical volumes.  
So in general when you have things like LVs it is recommended  
to recreate the system without resizing - or you need to manually  
and carefully adapt all the related values in disklayout.conf.

Furthermore see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Or just better:  
Complelety read through that whole long "SDB:Disaster Recovery"
article  
(you may leave out YaST and other SUSE specific things ;-)

Hello @jsmeix ,  
Thank you as always.

I updated the rear to v2.4.

The first thing I noticed with the new version is that it does not
prompt for the network card. The IP is already there of the source
system.

One reason to use REAR for us is to upgrade systems by building another
system. Therefore, we need to restore the system onto another system
while the source system is in production. We cannot afford to have an IP
conflict. Luckily the v2.4 of REAR stops at the prompt. I changed the
original IP that was there with REAR to a different IP so that no IP
conflict happens.

The other option that I am looking for is the list of disks or file
systems that I could select for the restore. We almost all of the time
need only the root disk to be restored. The root disk would be about 30
GB. We have databases on other disks that run to TB's and we should not
restore those with REAR. I do not see the option presented in REAR with
Networker. How can I select what disks o file systems to restore?
Because Networker anyway backs up everything and I cannot stop Networker
from backing all the mounted file systems. How can we select what to
restore when restoring through REAR v2.4?

Thank you,

Niranjan

Hi @IT-Guy-1973.

Within Legato Networker configuration there are IMHO possibilities to
exclude files/directories based on patterns and wildcards (IMHO named
backup directives) or determine the backup filesystems in the saveset.
So it is - as @gdha pointed to - always the responsibility of the
EXTERNAL backup tool what files will be recovered to the system.  
ReaR's part is to "prepare" the to be recovered system to its initial
state (i.e. setup IPs, partitions, filesystems, start the required
daemons etc) and thereafter starts i.e. the EXTERNAL recovery or waits
for the EXTERNAL recovery to do its part. What is included or not is up
to the EXTERNAL backup/recovery tool only.

Cheers,  
Holger.

Offhandedly I think the currently best way to do that is  
to manually adapt disklayout.conf as you need it  
before you run "rear recover"  
or  
enforce MIGRATION\_MODE and manually adapt disklayout.conf  
at the matching dialog that appears while running "rear recover"  
or  
use RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL (cf. below).

What is currently not well supported in ReaR is that the user can  
specify exactly what he wants to get included in disklayout.conf  
during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup", see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229)

In general regarding system migration with ReaR see

and also follow the links therein in particular read through  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943)  
which is a bit older so some things are a bit different now  
(e.g. RECOVERY\_UPDATE is now called RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL)  
but the general topics therein are still relevant, in particular see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943\#issuecomment-237544630](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/943#issuecomment-237544630)  
how certain directories are different in the ReaR recovery system  
when you run usr/sbin/rear from within a sub-directory

@hpannenb

Hello Holger,

Thank you.

Our systems would normally have a "rootvg" volume group and then data
volume groups that include files systems related to applications and/or
databases. All file systems are backed up by Networker. The goal is to
recover any file or file system if needed.

As a system admin I may have to recover only the rootvg. So I will have
a system where many disks are attached and the ISO image from REAR is
mounted. I boot off the ISO image and when I run "rear recover" I should
ONLY restore everything in rootvg and NOTHING in datavgs.

Can I use this parameter to do it with REAR?

ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=()

Networker will have all the data backed up as their job is to take care
of any data on that system.

Regards,  
Niranjan

@IT-Guy-1973  
FYI a general method how to get an idea for what a particular  
ReaR config variable is actually used:

    # find usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'ONLY_INCLUDE_VG'

    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:
    # syntax : e.g. ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" "vg01" )
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=()

    usr/share/rear/conf/examples/borg-example.conf:
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" )

    usr/share/rear/conf/examples/RHEL7-ISO-Oracle-example.conf:
    #ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" )

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:
    if [ ${#ONLY_INCLUDE_VG[@]} -gt 0 ] ; then

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/310_include_exclude.sh:
            if ! IsInArray "${name#/dev/}" "${ONLY_INCLUDE_VG[@]}" ; then

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/335_remove_excluded_multipath_vgs.sh:
    # If AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n is used in combination with ONLY_INCLUDE_VG or
        # to further investigate if EXCLUDE_VG or ONLY_INCLUDE_VG was respected for multipath devices:

So there is no code about ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG  
that is related to Legato Networker i.e. `BACKUP=NSR`  
i.e. no file with `/NSR/` in its path.

Accordingly it seems ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG is only used  
for what gets included in disklayout.conf  
but what is included in the Legato Networker backup  
seems to be totally unrelated to that - in particular because  
there is no code in ReaR that makes a Legato Networker backup  
(there is no usr/share/rear/backup/NSR/ directory).

Therefore I think if your Legato Networker backup contains  
for example all files of all VGs or LVs of a system  
but you use ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG to only get the  
"rootvg" volume group included in disklayout.conf then  
I would assume you get by "rear recover" a disk layout  
recreated that contains only the "rootvg" volume group and  
when then the full-system Legato Networker backup gets restored  
you get all the files restored into the "rootvg" volume group.  
But that is only what I imagine off the top of my head.  
I am not a Legato Networker user.  
I don't use third-party backup tools (no time for that)  
and in particular I cannot use proprietary backup tools.

Hello @jsmeix ,

Thank you for your reply above regarding the "ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG". I was
thinking of it in terms of restore. Like in - only include vgxx when
restoring. But as you pointed out this parameter is not related to NSR.

Also, I am still going through your earlier responses to my question.

It looks like the options I have is to edit the disk layout files during
restore. But let me carefully read all you posted here before I raise
another question.

Thank you,

Hello @jsmeix ,

When using Networker with REAR there is absolutely no way to control
what is restored on the VM. With REAR you can select what disks you want
etc ... But when the restore happens it is going to restore everything
Networker backed up.

Example: I have a volume group on disk "/dev/sdb" named nmonvg and a
file system in it name /nmon\_data. If I disable the "/dev/sdb" using
REAR the "/nmon\_data" will anyway get restored on a directory under /.

@jsmeix Let me know if my understanding of this is correct.

Yes, you are absolutely correct. I tried to change what needs to be
restored but that cannot be done. Even if I change the disk layout
hoping it will not restore certain volume groups the restore happens on
the rootvg as directories.

Hi, @IT-Guy-1973.

In my use case EMC Networker backups all data of a (single) server. The
setup backups the dedicated filesystems /, /var/log, etc. instead of
ALL. Furthermore it is possible to exclude all unwanted data i.e. the
database files of a MySQL in /data/mysqldata/ or all logfiles in
/var/log/ and so on.

When it comes to a disaster recovery ReaR prepares my (single) server
with all required filesystems and afterwards EMC Networker is triggered
to restore all the backuped files into them.

Using NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=YES it is possible to i.e. execute EMC
Networker's "recovery" tool manually to recover data of dedicated
filessystems or manually select all the data required.
NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=YES waits until someone recovered the data with EMC
Networker.

Regards,  
Holger.

Hello @hpannenb ,

I added NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE=YES to the site.conf file. Now, as you mention
correctly the restore stops at the "rear&gt;" prompt.

At this point do I need to inform the backup team to initiate a restore
from their end or can I run the "recover" command at my end to perform
the restore?

I have 3 file systems on this system.  
/, /boot and /nmon\_data

I need to avoid installing /nmon\_data. I only need / and /boot only.

On the restore system I see:

/mnt/local/  
/mnt/local/boot/

file systems.

I am not very familiar with NSR commands. Please let me know what I need
to do at this point.

Thank you,  
Regards,  
Niranjan

Hi, @IT-Guy-1973

You can handle it as You prefer. Either execute the recovery on Your own
or with the help of Your backup team.

Quiet some time ago I found the required EMC Networker commands at this
page [here](http://www.ipnom.com/Legato-NetWorker-Commands/). You can
look for "recover".

With this and the knowledge from the ReaR sources in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c5f61051d017b20149041f9376d549e3d311af4c/usr/share/rear/restore/NSR/default/400\_restore\_with\_nsr.sh\#L26](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/c5f61051d017b20149041f9376d549e3d311af4c/usr/share/rear/restore/NSR/default/400_restore_with_nsr.sh#L26)
you should be able to (batch) recover the required filesystems i.e.in
Your case with

    export VAR_DIR=/var/lib/rear/
    recover -s $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server) -c $(hostname) -d /mnt/local -a / /boot

I propose You check Your backup strategy if `/nmon_data` needs to be
backed up for each of the nodes or if it is of no use for a the generic
recovery. It might also be required the filesystem exists so check if
You really need to exclude it in the ReaR config or exclude it in the
external backup tool EMC Networker.

Sincerely,  
Holger.

Hello @hpannenb ,

Thank you for the information. I have not tried this yet. But hopefully,
I will try this tomorrow. Thank you for sharing the Networker
command-line help page as well. Networker commands are pretty hard to
assemble.

Hello @hpannenb ,

I ran the commands you had provided. I had to manually add the hostname
and the Networker server name. It worked. However, I did not see the
boot image been created at the end. It is at the "rear&gt;" prompt now
after the restore.

Do I need to run any manual commands at this point to get the boot image
created before I reboot the newly restored system? Please see the
attachment.

Hi, @IT-Guy-1973.

You should have seen a prompt beforehand

    Please let the restore process start on Your backup server i.e. $(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server).
    Make sure all required data is restored to /mnt/local .

    When the restore is finished type 'exit' to continue the recovery.
    Info: You can check the recovery process i.e. with the command 'df'.

I suppose at the prompt You entered the "recover" command. When Your
manual EMC recovery has been completed type "exit"(+ENTER) to continue
the restore process.

Regards,  
Holger.

@hpannenb Thank you for your valuable input. It all worked perfectly! I
did restore multiple times to get a feel of the process.

Thank you again,

@IT-Guy-1973  
can I conclude from your

that this issue which is primarily about NETWORKER backup usage  
is now sufficiently solved for you?
