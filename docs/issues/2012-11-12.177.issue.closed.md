[\#177 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/177) `closed`: uncomplete restore with TSM
============================================================================================

I've tried to restore my server with rear 1.14 (BACKUP=TSM).,
Filesystems / /var and /boot.  
First time / and /var was completely restored, but not /boot. Second
time /var and /boot was completely restored, but not / (only some
directories) See log.

I assume there is a problem in in `40_restore_with_tsm.sh`

What does `exit 12` mean in TSM?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2778369?v=4" width="50">[ghwk](https://github.com/ghwk) commented at [2012-11-16 09:24](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/177#issuecomment-10441085):

Good question !

Return codes from the command line interface:  
In general, the return code is related to the highest severity message
during the client operation.

    If the highest severity message is informational (ANSnnnnI), then the return code will be 0.
    If the highest severity message is a warning (ANSnnnnW), then the return code will be 8.
    If the highest severity message is an error (ANSnnnnE), then the return code will be 12. 

Code 12:  
The operation completed with at least one error message (except for
error messages for skipped files). For scheduled events, the status will
be Failed. Review the dsmerror.log file (and dsmsched.log file for
scheduled events) to determine what error messages were issued and to
assess their impact on the operation. As a general rule, this return
code means that the error was severe enough to prevent the successful
completion of the operation. For example, an error that prevents an
entire file system from being processed yields return code 12. When a
file is not found the operation yields return code 12.

I should have seen in the dsmerror.log.

Perhaps rear should not eat the dsmc error messages ?

I agree, for restoring we should give as much information as possible to
the user. If default output is sufficient, it could go to the terminal,
otherwise it should be logged. (Maybe in this case default progress
output could go to the log, and normal output to terminal).

Patches to make this better will be accepted.

Hello Dag,

I have looked at the code and found that I must have missed the
message.  
Probably because it was the first filespace and the following went  
through without error.  
What do you think of the proposal that rear breaks when dsmc failed.
In  
addition I have written a patch. The patch is not tested, because  
actually I dont have access to a TSM environment.

I would prefer that you first test your enhancement of the code before
we add it (to avoid broken code). And, it would be even better to make
it available as a pull request.  
Thanks for the troubleshooting.
