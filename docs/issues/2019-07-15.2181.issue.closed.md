-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    current master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

On original system only `/dev/vdb` was used,  
on replacement hardware only `/dev/vda` should be used  
so during "rear recover" in rear config files (e.g. disklayout.conf)  
`/dev/vdb` is mapped to (i.e. replaced with) `/dev/vda`  
but that causes in 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh

    +++ grep '^/dev/vda5 ' /var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt
    +++ mathlib_calculate ' * 1048576'
    +++ bc -ql
    (standard_in) 1: syntax error

because in /var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt  
`/dev/vdb` is not mapped to (i.e. replaced with) `/dev/vda`

    Filesystem     1048576-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
    /dev/vdb5              34295M 7403M    26762M      22% /

so

    grep '^/dev/vda5 ' /var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt

finds nothing and that results an empty first argument  
for the `mathlib_calculate ' * 1048576'` call  
which causes the `syntax error` for `bc`.

The `syntax error` for `bc` is not the actual problem.

The actual problem is that in 420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
that code part cannot do its inteded job because it works on  
inappropriate data in /var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt

It seems the same kind of issue (disk mapping is not applied)  
also happens for the contents of the variable  
BTRFS\_SUBVOLUME\_SLES\_SETUP

I have a mapping where /dev/vdb is mapped to /dev/vda  
but I have in the recovery system in /etc/rear/rescue.conf  
the old

    BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP=(   /dev/vdb5 )

so that the mapping should be also applied to /etc/rear/rescue.conf

in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2188](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2188)  
avoids the above described mathlib\_calculate/bc `syntax error`  
(but that does not actually solve this issue here).

merged  
this issue should be fixed.
