Now when rear errors out it shows the right logfile name, e.g.:

<pre>
Relax-and-Recover 1.19 / Git
Using log file: /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f79.16621.log
16621: ERROR: 
====================
BUG in /root/rear/usr/share/rear/init/default/030_update_recovery_system.sh:
'Test Error'
--------------------
Please report this issue at https://github.com/rear/rear/issues
and include the relevant parts from /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f79.16621.log
preferably with full debug information via 'rear -d -D mkbackuponly'
====================
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear/var/log/rear/rear-f79.16621.log for details
Terminated
</pre>

The fix is mainly in usr/sbin/rear and it is a bit ugly  
but from my point of view the whole logging code  
in ReaR is currently ugly which results such ugly fixes.

From my point of view the whole logging in ReaR  
should be simplified and cleaned up as I described in

After a few tests in particular with multiple backups  
all still works o.k. for me so that I will merge it.
