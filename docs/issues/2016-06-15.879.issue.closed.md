-   rear version: rear-1.16-1.el6.noarch
-   OS version: Oracle Linux Server release 6.6 (RHEL 6.6)
-   rear configuration:  
    OUTPUT=ISO  
    BACKUP=TSM
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Rear backup doesn't copy all required libraries into chroot
    directory which causes chroot command to fail and entire backup to
    fail.  
    After backup fails, the missing libraries stay in /tmp instead of
    going go to /tmp/rear.JCUYFv0LeP7clzT/rootfs

Libraries in /tmp are shown in following text file:  
[libraries-in-tmp.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/315925/libraries-in-tmp.txt)

From backup log:  
2016-06-15 10:20:04 Including build/default/98\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
chroot: failed to run command \`bash': No such file or directory  
2016-06-15 10:20:04 ERROR: BUG BUG BUG! ROOTFS\_DIR
'/tmp/rear.JCUYFv0LeP7clzT/rootfs' is broken, chroot bash test failed.

Chroot fails because bash is missing some libraries which are not copied
to chroot (ldd /bin/bash).

Full debug log (rear -D) is also attached:  
[rear-SERVERHOSTNAME.log.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/315917/rear-SERVERHOSTNAME.log.txt)

-   Work-around, if any: NONE

Thanks for help.

The problem is the following:

    ++ [[ -L /lib64/libgssglue.so.1 ]]
    +++ readlink -f /lib64/libgssglue.so.1
    ++ target=
    ++ copy_lib
    ++ local lib=
    ++ ensure_dir
    ++ local dir=

It should return something like:

    $ readlink -f /lib64/libgssglue.so.1
    /usr/lib64/libgssglue.so.1

Does `readlink` exist on your os?

You are right, /bin/readlink was zero size, although coreutils was
installed.  
I reinstalled coreutils and backup now runs successfully.

Thanks very much for blazing fast resolution!
