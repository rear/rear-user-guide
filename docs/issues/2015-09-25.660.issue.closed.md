we see now a rear.noarch and a rear.x86\_64 version on Fedora Build
Service. We should expire the noarch version within a few days..

Just to be sure, was that the story where the conflicting RPM
dependencies for different archs are the motivator for going away from
noarch?

@schlomo indeed that was the main reason of the change (proposed by J
Meixner)

Actually it was @k0da who found the issue and reported it to me via
personal mail.

Here what Dinar Valeev wrote in his mail to me:

<pre>
There is last remaining bit, packaging.
We package rear as noarch but do require arch specific
bootloader as rpm requirement. See Require: syslinux
As this is noarch package I propose to change it
to Suggests: syslinux, because we can't make arch
dependent Requirements for noarch packages.
Just checked with Fedora spec, they do it wrong:
BuildArch: noarch
%ifarch %ix86 x86_64
Require: syslinux
%endif
%ifarch ppc ppc64
Require: yaboot
%endif
</pre>

From that I created
