Anyway ...  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926\#issuecomment-234255678](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/926#issuecomment-234255678)  
it looks good to me and  
I like to have it tested by @tcerna  
so that I simply merge it now.

Hi, thank you for a fix. Currently I don't have a capacity to test it.
We will released it in next RHEL where it will be definitely tested. If
I catch it earlier, I will take you a result.
