Hi All,

I could seccessfully created ISO backup of VM in XEN and send to NFS
repos. but when I try to restore the VM.

I encountered some problem and failed to restore VM eventaully,

1.  When I tried to create a new VM (for restoration), If I select VM
    type as "CentOS / RHEL", I cannot startup the newly created ISO that
    for restoration
2.  When I tried to create a new VM and select "other" type, I could
    restore the VM but failed to boot the recovered VM

The ISO backup and recover works perfectly under VMware

it said that there is problem in disk xvdsk/dsk convertion. I could not
find any troubleshoot info from google or here. Is it only encountered
by me? Anyone can help?

When choosing "CentOS/RHEL" as the VM type you probably configured a
paravirtualized VM (PVM) which to the best of my knowledge cannot boot
an ISO.

Do you have a screenshot? The recovery log?

Hi,

yes, if you create a VM with the template for the operating systems in
use, they are allways Paravirtualized. I dont know wether if it is
possible to boot a ISO image which already includes  
a XEN PV kernel. We have asked the citrix guys about this but not yet
got any answer:

[http://discussions.citrix.com/topic/365604-how-to-boot-a-paravirtualized-kernel-off-an-cdrom-image/](http://discussions.citrix.com/topic/365604-how-to-boot-a-paravirtualized-kernel-off-an-cdrom-image/)

I think it *might* work if you convert the ISO Image to a Virtual Disk,
and then set the PV-Kernel  
and PV-Bootloader options accordingly. Other than that i think the only
solution is to boot the  
kernel from the network.

One existing workaround is to install a regular kernel within the
virtual machine besides the xen  
kernel and start rear mkrescue with the -r option, passing the kernel
verison which is not a xen  
PV kernel.

Then you can at least boot the iso image with the "other install media"
option which is a HVM  
virtual machine. After recovery the Virtual machine has to be converted
to PV again.

No further comments since more than one year  
indicate that this issue has become outdated  
so that I like to close it now.

If needed it could be reopened but preferably  
file a new issue based on a current rear version.

In general regarding XEN and paravirtualization  
you may have a look at the section about  
"Virtual machines" in
