Update documentation e.g. doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc

Because of what @schabrolles wrote 3 days ago in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2019\#issuecomment-466769572](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2019#issuecomment-466769572)

    I don't have a lot of time and will be really busy
    till the end of next week

I suggest to postpone the ReaR 2.5 release until @schabrolles  
has a bit more time for ReaR according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/milestones)

    For ReaR release 2.5 we do not have a release date
    in mind (beginning 2019). It depends on bug fixes
    or bleeding edge new features... 

I suggest to postpone the ReaR 2.5 release until `end of next week`  
plus one more week which would be until Friday 15. March 2019  
provided that one week is sufficient for @schabrolles

@schabrolles  
I would appreciate it if you could before ReaR 2.5 release have a look
at

I moved the scheduled release to end of March 2019 - plenty of time to
get the last issues in and do the stability tests...

@rear/contributors Shall we try to wrap up rear-2.5 so we can start
creating our validation matrix?

Right now this is the only open issue for ReaR 2.5  
(also no pull requests that we must have in ReaR 2.5) and with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/4bc1a19f6cb4f779d895434e1c32f19d8a09bab1](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/4bc1a19f6cb4f779d895434e1c32f19d8a09bab1)  
the release notes for ReaR 2.5 are up to date,  
only `Version 2.5 (work in progress)` would have  
to be changed to `Version 2.5` therein  
provided we @rear/contributors agree to release  
our current GitHub master code as ReaR 2.5.

@rear/contributors Fine - shall we first file up
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear--2.5](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Test-Matrix-rear--2.5)
a bit before we make the general release available. Can we agree on
this?

I agree with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2033\#issuecomment-486999654](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2033#issuecomment-486999654)

What I basically meant with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2033\#issuecomment-486983987](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2033#issuecomment-486983987)  
is that we first agree to freeze our current GitHub master code  
so that we can test a non-moving state and then - provided  
there are no severe issues - release it as ReaR 2.5.

@rear/contributors Can we pin-point for a release upcoming Friday? If
not new blockers appear I would go for that Friday. Please let us review
the documentation, man page and web site (download section) before the
release to avoid (stupid) mistakes in the documentation...

o.k. for me regardless that I will not find time to test our latest
master code  
for SLES and openSUSE...

By the way, what about

A side note regarding "review the documentation":  
I found
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2140](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2140)  
but that is an "RFC" for "Rear future".

which is also visible at

because there is no such file in the list of `Source Files` that is

@jsmeix I forced a rebuild - it started building again...

As ReaR-2.5 has been released in the meantime we may close this issue.
