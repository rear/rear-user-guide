Please direct me to the case \# if this case has already been answered
elsewhere before.  
If not this is what I have been trying to do:

Simple background of my case:

1.  root file system is on one disk
2.  /data2 is on another/separate disk/device  
    3.I have taken backup image of the OS excluding the content of
    /data2 using the local.conf config below.

I wanted to restore the OS on NEW DISK and import whatever the content
of the device where /data2 filesystem was on.

I am able to recover the OS but /data2 is empty and looks like the
device has been initialized and not imported back onto the OS.

Can you please let me know the correct/appropriate local.conf
configuration to achieve my objective?

Thanks,

Mauro

See also issue \#291 - /dev/mapper/data2 got wiped out because it was
not excluded.

@msgameng was your question answered? Or do you have still some doubts?
