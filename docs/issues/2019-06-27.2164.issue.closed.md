Hi,

First of all thanks a lot for rear, it's really a wonderful piece of
software !

This issue is not a bug report, more like a generic question.  
I'm wondering what would it take to create a custom made rescue image
?  
I use rear in a business context as an automated DR system, and I
restore the VMs on another environmnent. Right now I managed to modify
the base rescue image to adapt options like DHCP, BACKUP\_URL and
whatnot but for monitoring purposes I think I need a more "complete"
operating system acting as the rescue medium.

For example I would need curl to send error notifications to our API,
and some scripting intelligence before or after the recovery per se. I
can not use the `REQUIRED_PROGS` directive because I cannot assume that
the source VM has the required program(s), and I'm not sure how I would
include it manually in the rescue image afterwards.

So I thought the simpler option would be to create manually a rescue
image to have more control over the rescue process. I noticed most of
the files come from the
[skel](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/skel)
folder so I'm wondering if I "just" have to put those in my custom OS
(along with configuration of course) to make it magically a rear rescue
system.

Looking forward to answers from you guys.

In contrast to `REQUIRED_PROGS` programs that are specified in `PROGS`  
get included in the recovery system only when they are available  
on the original system where "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" is run.

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf (excerpts):

    # Program files (as found in PATH) to include in the rescue/recovery system:
    # These progs are optional, if they are missing, nothing happens
    PROGS=( )
    #
    # Required programs in the rescue/recovery system:
    # Same as above, but if they are missing, we abort.
    REQUIRED_PROGS=( ...

Use `COPY_AS_IS` to include arbitrary files (that are no programs)  
in the rescue/recovery system.

Furthermore all config files (in particular /etc/rear/local.conf)  
are sourced and executed as scripts so that you can do any  
bash scripting inside your config files, e.g. in /etc/rear/local.conf

    # Include curl in the recovery system only when available:
    type -P curl && REQUIRED_PROGS+=( curl )

which is basically the same as

    # Include curl in the recovery system only when available:
    PROGS+=( curl )

or whatever code you need in your particular case.

The precondition is that all files and programs you need in  
your rescue/recovery system must exist on the original system  
where "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" is run because otherwise  
there is no way how ReaR could get them.

When you like to create one same full featured rescue/recovery system  
that you can use to recreate various different but similar systems  
you need to create that full featured rescue/recovery system  
on a sufficiently complete original system.

To recreate different but similar systems with that one same  
full featured rescue/recovery system you need to use  
`RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL`, see its description in default.conf  
and for background information about the idea behind and  
its limitations and how it was finally implemented see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841)  
and follow the links therein.

Thanks for this thorough answer jsmeix,

I think I missed the "PROGS" option when looking through the
configuration files.

I'll look into it. Maybe I could put static builds of softwares manually
during the recovery programs (or dynamic with LDD like rear does).

I think I'll look more into how rear build the rescue system. The
problem I have is that I feel "trapped" into the rescue system, as I'm
supposed to automate as much as possible (the rescue and the monitoring)
and since the rescue machines run in an Openstack Cloud I thought it
would be easier to just use cloud-init to do the work for me.

Thanks again for all this information.

One limitation of RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL is that you  
cannot update /etc/rear/local.conf with RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL  
because /etc/rearlocal.conf contains the RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL value  
so that /etc/rear/local.conf must be read (i.e. sourced by the
usr/sbin/rear main script)  
before usr/share/rear/init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh can
be run.

If needed usr/share/rear/init/default/030\_update\_recovery\_system.sh
could be  
enhanced to source /etc/rear/local.conf again but that would require
the  
/etc/rear/local.conf content "behaves sufficiently idempotent" (cum
granu salis).

Regarding "OpenStack Cloud" you may have a look at the mails

I assume the question has been sufficiently answered.
