With NetWorker 8.1.1.5 (at least) when you run the command to list the
pool(s) that the client uses you get many lines returned (usually of the
same pool but can be others in there). This sets the variable POOLNAME
incorrectly.  
If more than one pool name is returned we don't actually know which one
to use so I have decided to use the first one returned.

Before: line 42: POOLNAME="$( mminfo -s $NSRSERVER -a -q
"client=$CLIENTNAME" -r "pool" )"  
After: line 42: POOLNAME="$( mminfo -s $NSRSERVER -a -q
"client=$CLIENTNAME" -r "pool" | head -1 )"
