-   How was this pull request tested?  
    using output=usb I created a bootable USB stick with working serial
    on a apu board based machine. (ex6linux)
-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    I can not find any statement in syslinux documentation if multiple
    `serial` lines are allowed. The docs just state the line must be the
    first one in the config file. On my apu board based machine I have
    two serial interfaces (and nothing else) but as soon as I have
    `serial` config lines for two different devices/ports it is not
    working for any of them.  
    Only when having one serial device in the config it is working.

So this PR does two things:

-   it writes only one serial line matching the configured device (when
    found) to the config
-   it also writes it for the syslinux config in case it is used without
    extlinux

I am not at all a serial console expert so I may confuse this or that.

From plain looking at the serial console related code in ReaR  
by inspecting the serial console related scripts

    # find usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -li 'serial console'
    usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_extlinux.sh
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/400_use_serial_console.sh
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/45-serial-console.sh
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/init/start-ttys.conf
    usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/200_include_serial_console.sh

there are two different places where serial console is set up in ReaR.

Setup of serial consoles in the running ReaR recovery system  
versus  
setup of serial consoles for the bootloader of the ReaR recovery system

Currently both are specified via the boolean config variable
USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE.

Your new SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE config variable only applies  
to setup of serial consoles for the bootloader of the ReaR recovery
system  
and there only in case of syslinux.  
So that new config variable should be properly named e.g.  
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE \_SYSLINUX  
to make its limited usage obvious and that limited usage  
should be described more explicitly in default.conf  
(currently 'syslinux' is mentioned but that looks more like an example
case).

In general I prefer a single config variable with ternary (and more)
semantics  
(cf. the initial comment in disklayout.conf)  
over several config variables for one same thing  
if possible to implement it with reasonable effort  
and if it makes things simpler to setup for the user  
(we have already very many config variables).

So in this case I would prefer to drop SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE  
and instead enhance the current USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE like

-   USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE is empty: same behaviour as now
-   USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE has a true or false value: same behaviour as
    now
-   USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE is a string of possible character device nodes:
    serial consoles are set up only for those device nodes that exist in
    USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE

So e.g. `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="true /dev/ttyS0 /dev/sda"`  
will set up a serial console only for /dev/ttyS0 if /dev/ttyS0 exists  
(/dev/sda is no character device node and 'true' is no device node)  
while `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="/dev/ttyS2 /dev/ttyS123"`  
will set up serial consoles for /dev/ttyS2 and /dev/ttyS123 if exists.

The fix is absolutely syslinux & extlinux config and not related to
other serial config. It may be syslinux version, hardware and bios
dependent but thats something I can't tell.

Those scripts do take care about different serial related config (kernel
parameter and getty config):

    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/400_use_serial_console.sh
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/45-serial-console.sh
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/init/start-ttys.conf
    usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/200_include_serial_console.sh

The script `usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh` however looks
interesting. The syslinux part looks mostly identical and has the same
issue. I guess this is the more modern bootloader function set that
should have been used by the usb scripts instead of doing basically the
same thing with duplicated code.  
My intention was more to fix my specific issue and not rewrite the whole
format/output usb scripts but I will have a look when I find the time
for it.

I agree that a string containing devices for `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE` would
make sense instead of a new variable but that would mean chaning a lot
of scripts with usecases I don't know and can't test. So changing the
`USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE` allowed values brings a way bigger risk of breaking
things which I did not want to take.  
The name `SERIAL_CONSOLE_DEVICE_SYSLINUX` is fine for me even when it
actually also changes extlinux config far as I understand.

strangely multiple serial config lines work on apu2 board versions. So I
will change the PR to keep the old behavior when the variable is not
set.

@gdha @pcahyna  
I would like to know your opinion about a new config variable  
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_SYSLINUX  
introduced by this pull request  
versus some generic cleanup and enhancement of the existing  
USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE  
config variable.

@DEvil0000  
if there is some general agreement to better implement it  
via some generic cleanup and enhancement of the existing  
USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE  
I would try to do that on my own via a separated pull request  
so you could have a look and try out if that also works for you.

@jsmeix In case you decide to change how USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE works it
may be best to merge the PR first and handle it then like the rest of
the code.

My idea of enhancing USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE as I suggested in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2650\#issuecomment-875498171](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2650#issuecomment-875498171)  
is that e.g. with

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="/dev/ttyS0"

both the serial console for the bootloader  
and the serial console for the ReaR recovery system  
will be only at "/dev/ttyS0" (and nowhere else).

My reasoning behind is that I assume when a user specifies e.g.

    USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE="/dev/ttyS0"

then he has a serial console only at /dev/ttyS0 and nowhere else.

Or in other words:  
I ssume it will not happen in practice that a user has  
e.g. two serial consoles at /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1  
but for the bootloader (e.g. in case of syslinux)  
only one serial consoles at /dev/ttyS0 can be used  
but for the ReaR recovery system he wants to use  
both serial consoles at /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1

If that assumption is wrong my proposal  
of enhancing USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE cannot work  
and a separated SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_SYSLINUX  
must be used.

@DEvil0000  
from my point of view I could merge your pull request just now  
if you removed the SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_SYSLINUX  
part in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf so it is not yet "officially"
documented  
or you enhance the comment there that it may change in near future  
in arbitrary ways.

added the not about a near future change of USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE and
SERIAL\_CONSOLE\_DEVICE\_SYSLINUX to the comment in the file as
requested. So this one should be okay for merge now.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.
