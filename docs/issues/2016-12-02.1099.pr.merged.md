Remounting all what is mounted below /mnt/local  
with sync option is no longer needed when systemd is used  
because when systemd is used reboot, halt, poweroff,  
and shutdown are replaced by scripts that do umount  
plus sync to safely shut down the recovery system,  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1097](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1097)

Furthermore remounting with sync option could become  
in practice a major annoyance because it makes writing  
anything below /mnt/local basically unusable slow,
