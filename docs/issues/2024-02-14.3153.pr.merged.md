Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement** / **Clean-up**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149\#issuecomment-1941620475](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3149#issuecomment-1941620475)

-   How was this pull request tested? I was able to successfully boot
    the generated kernel and initrd on s390x Fedora Rawhide machine with
    both `OUTPUT=IPL` and `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` options.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The initial PR with s390 support in ReaR introduced an s390-only
`OUTPUT=IPL` undocumented option. However, the `OUTPUT=IPL` option is
completely redundant because it does the exact same thing as the already
existing and documented OUTPUT=RAMDISK option.

This commit removes the whole `IPL` directory sub-tree and introduces a
fallback that replaces `OUTPUT=IPL` with `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` during the
`prep` phase with a deprecation warning to still be backwards compatible
with existing `local.conf` files.

Only as a side note regarding  
shouting at our users with "WARNING: ..."  
instead of normal user information with "Warning: ..."

Currently we have about 42 code places with "WARNING"  
and only 3 code places with "Warning" :-(  
Sigh!

When time permits I will have a look at those code places and  
try to improve things as far as possible with reasonable effort.
