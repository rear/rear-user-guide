-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    rear-1.17.2
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL-7.2 Server
-   Brief description of the issue:

If user has installed grub2, it is necessary to generate grub password
and specify it in directive GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD in
/etc/rear/local.conf.

    # cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://$NFS_SERVER_IP/mnt/rear/"
    GRUB_RESCUE=1
    GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="grub.pbkdf2.sha512...."

I found some information about this only in documentation  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/usage/\#rescue\_system](http://relax-and-recover.org/usage/#rescue_system)

Please add information about grub options GRUB\_RESCUE and
GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD also in manual page. There and in documentation
should be also documented information about default user name
(rearadmin) or how to set up own user name (probably with variable
GRUB\_SUPERUSER).

    # rpm -q grub2
    grub2-2.02-0.41.el7.x86_64

I'm a little bit confused from behavior on RHEL6 and RHEL7. No grub
password is required in RHEL6, is it because of nonexisting grub2? Grub2
is installed in RHEL7 and GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD is necessary.

I am against any duplicated stuff  
because that leads to a maintenace nightmare  
to always keep duplicated things in sync.

In particular I am against duplicated documentation.

If something is documeted at "this"  
then other documentation should not duplicate it  
but only point to "this".

I think traditionally UNIX man pages are short  
and not meant as the full documentation.

@tcerna  
for your various documentation issues  
could you submit GitHub pull requests  
so that we have real proposals how you  
think things should be fixed.

@tcerna The `GRUB_RESCUE` stuff were never my favourite additions to
rear and see these as easy test facilities. I prefer to avoid mentioning
this in the man-page as it would overload the user with too much details
which he probably will never use. It fits more in a developers guide
(still to be written and postponed due to lack of free time and lack of
sponsoring)

Regarding GRUB\_RESCUE  
see also
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913)  
in particular
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913\#issuecomment-232654462](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913#issuecomment-232654462)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913\#issuecomment-232662751](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/913#issuecomment-232662751)

FYI:  
My personal opinion abut the GRUB\_RESCUE functionality:

I would even recommend to drop that completely.

Reason:

GRUB\_RESCUE is (as far as I know) the only functionality  
where rear changes the currently running system and  
it changes it even in a critical way because it changes  
the bootloader of the currently running system.

I would never expect that any kind of "make me a backup"  
program run like "rear mkbackup" changes my currently  
running system in a substantial way.

I find this GRUB\_RESCUE functionality terrifying.

I agree with @jsmeix and also would prefer ReaR to not modify the local
system.

**Suggestion**:  
Let's rename `GRUB_RESCUE` to `DEVEL_GRUB_RESCUE` to make it transparent
that this is a development and testing feature and not meant for
production. If people use it in production then at least they know about
this.

I will do that:

Hopefully next week I will submit a GitHub pull request.

I close this issue here because as far as I understand it  
we agree that GRUB\_RESCUE (or its successor)  
is not meant for normal usage so that it should  
not be mentioned in the man page.

@jsmeix @gdha Sorry but I can't agree with your arguments. When I became
tester of rear, I was like an ordinary user and I didn't know how to
correctly set and use this tool. I configured rear and I wanted to start
rescue mode and there was no item in grub selection with "Rear recover".
So this parameter is necessary.

@schlomo You told that this parameter is only for development and
testing. How can ordinary user do recover without specifying this
parameters? I don't know.

And what about parameter GRUB\_RESCUE\_PASSWORD? There is no information
about it in man page and neither in documentation. But we were not able
to start recover without password. Can I file it as new bug?

When dealing bare-metal restore, you can't rely that grub (or any other
bootloader) will be available.  
For this situation you should use one of the methods specified in
[OUTPUT](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/03-configuration.adoc),
boot from appropriate media and start with restore.

@tcerna  
I don't know about Red Hat's documentation about rear  
and what Red Hat's intended users of rear are  
but for SUSE's documentation you may have a look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
and follow the links at the end in the "See also" section.
