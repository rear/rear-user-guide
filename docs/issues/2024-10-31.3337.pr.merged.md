@gdha  
I have a question how this is meant to work:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3295\#issuecomment-2495235753](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3295#issuecomment-2495235753)  
reads:

    Stale issue message
    ...
    github-actions (bot) added 'no-issue-activity' and removed 'no-issue-activity' labels

The added 'no-issue-activity' label results  
a notification e-mail from GitHub which reads

    Re: [rear/rear] How is skel/default/bin/dhcpcd.sh meant to work? (Issue #3295)

    Stale issue message

    -- 
    Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:
    https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3295#issuecomment-2495235753
    You are receiving this because you were assigned.

The subsequent removed 'no-issue-activity' results that  
this issue has no 'no-issue-activity' label as intended  
by this pull request because this issue is assigned.

But the notification e-mail from GitHub does not indicate  
that 'no-issue-activity' was already removed again.

In contrast for example  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3291\#issuecomment-2495235761](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3291#issuecomment-2495235761)  
got the 'no-issue-activity' label added again because  
this issue is not assigned and it results same looking  
notification e-mail from GitHub as above.

My question is:  
Is the notification e-mail from GitHub intended  
also for assigned issues?
