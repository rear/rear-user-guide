@suraj952 I am interested in the log file offered in entry 2 on the last
screen (/var/log/rear/rear-test *something* .log).
`/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf` is also present in the rescue
system. The script `/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh` would also be
interesting to have. Please fetch them from the rescue system (it should
be possible to ssh/sftp to it, if the network is configured) and attach
them here.

Thanks, from the log I see that the problem most likely is "A volume
group called rhel already exists." and is due to restoring to the disks
with your original system, so the original volume group is still there.
I can suggest wiping the old data first using `wipefs`, as mentioned in
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1919989\#c5](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919989#c5).
(that is, you boot the rescue system, and first you wipe data the old
disks and only then you start `rear recover`. Or, you can restore to
clean disks, if you have some spare disks with the same size as the
original disks, and keep the old disks as backup.)

I also suggest to edit `/etc/rear/local.conf` in the rescue system and
add the line `MIGRATION_MODE=n`. It can be seen from your screenshots
that due to the presence of two disks of the same size, ReaR has
switched to the so-called migration mode, which is usually used for
migrating to a different hardware, and the restoration of LVM is then
less faithful. As you are restoring to the same hardware, you don't need
migration mode.

We have wiped out the data in same way as given in Bugzilla link and did
“rear recover” But still no luck.

Please find the latest logs for the same and let me know if you have any
question related to this issue.

    2021-11-30 11:30:52.689499158 Please start the restore process on your backup host.

Have you restored your backup to the recreated filesystems? It seems
that you have not and your filesystems are empty. What backup software
are you using (what is the value of the `BACKUP` configuration
variable)?

We are using Rubrik backup software.

yes we have tried to restore backup by running “rear recover” and but
there was issue related to ownership of filesystem. I believe, that
error can be found in log files which we had shared earlier.

@suraj952 and @nmaheve, `rear recover` only prepares the system for data
recovery. You then have to go back to Rubrik and recover the actual
data. The Rubrik agent should now be running on the rescue system, and
you should be able to access it from Rubrik. Remember that when you
recover the actual data from Rubrik to redirect the recover to
`/mnt/local` instead of `/`.

See [Chapter
16](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc)
of the ReaR user guide for more details. You should be around step 11
now.

@suraj952 note that Rubrik CDM support was added to ReaR in version 2.6
by @DamaniN in PR \#2249, but according to the logs and screenshot, you
are using ReaR 2.4, so you must restore the data manually (not sure how,
I have never used Rubrik CDM).  
Concerning

> there was issue related to ownership of filesystem. I believe, that
> error can be found in log files

-if you mean these lines:

    2021-11-30 11:31:42.229193058 Recreating directories (with permissions) from /var/lib/rear/recovery/directories_permissions_owner_group
    'bin' -> 'usr/bin'

    mode of 'etc' retained as 0755 (rwxr-xr-x)

    2021-11-30 11:31:42.256494605 Failed to 'chown root:root etc' 

then this is not an "issue related to ownership of filesystem", but the
fact that the recreated system is empty, there has been no backup
restored to the reformatted disks. I see this in the log earlier:

    Please start the restore process on your backup host.

    Make sure that you restore the data into /mnt/local (by default '/mnt/local')
    instead of '/' because the hard disks of the recovered system are mounted there.

    2021-11-30 11:30:52.733135532 Please restore your backup in the provided shell and, when finished, type exit
    in the shell to continue recovery.

Have you started the restore process when prompted? I suppose this
prompt was shown on the screen as well.

(Anyway, this issue has digressed from the original disk reformatting
issue, which is a known problem when using disks with prior data, and I
believe it is solved already in the development version. For older
versions, wiping the disks manually is an easy workaround, as shown by
your latest log, which records that the disks were reformatted just
fine.)

@pcahyna and @DamaniN Currently server is crashed and as we have ran
Wipe on the system so i think backup services also get wiped from the
host and Rubrik CDM is also not able to communicate with the Host as RBS
status showing disconnected. Can you please share POA per our current
scenario.

Sure, everything gets wiped from the host, simply because ReaR reformats
all the disks, as the title of the issue ("disk reformatting issue")
shows. You need to have the software needed for backup restoration in
the rescue system. You haven't added the Rubrik CDM client there when
creating the rescue media (ISO or USB)? If not, I suppose it will be
posible to copy it to the rescue system from somewhere else and thus
resolve your problem, but I can't help you with this, I know nothing
about CDM. By the way, can you paste your `/etc/rear/local.conf` file
here?

@suraj952, If you have re-installed the Rubrik CDM agent on the rescue
system, you can register the rescue system with your Rubrik server.
Assuming that you backed up the server in the past, you will be able to
recover the data to it. The rescue system will be registered as a new
host, so you will need to perform a redirected recovery of the data. If
you need help with registration and restoring the data from Rubrik at
this point, please contact Rubrik support.

You may run into a conflict where Rubrik thinks that the rescue system
is the original system because it has the same IP address. Normally, the
CDM integration with ReaR takes care of this. Since the proper version
of ReaR wasn't used, this conflict will have to be taken care of
manually. Rubrik Support can help with that.

As listed in the link I provided above, be sure to recover the data in
`/` to `/mnt/local`. After the data recovery, be sure to exit the ReaR
shell prompt and answer the last question. This will allow ReaR to
finalize the rescue, and you will be able to reboot the rescue host
properly.

No @DaminiN we are not able to install rubrik services into server as
server got crashed when we tried to perform recovery from ISO backed up
file. We tried to install Rubrik backup agent in crashed server but it's
not working.

So if you guys can help over the virtual remote session that would be
great. Also see the below snapshot and let us know what next step we

@suraj952, please create a case with Rubrik support for further help
with re-installing the Rubrik agent on the rescue host.

@DamaniN per your suggestion, Case \#00286029 have been opened with
Rubrik support for the same.

I don't see anything unfortunately, I suggest to use the web interface.
Anyway, I hope that Rubrik support will be able to help you with CDM. I
have a suggestion for you and maybe the Rubrik support: instead of
trying to get the Rubrik client into the booted rescue system, wouldn't
it be better to restore the entire backup to a different server and then
copy the whole subdirectory to the `/mnt/local` directory at the rescue
system during the rescue process, when ReaR asks to restore files? This
could be done e.g. via rsync or via tar and ssh, something like
`tar cf - . | ssh root@crashed_system "cd /mnt/local; tar xpf -"` (of
course tar will need some more parameters to restore all the attributes
properly, but that's the general idea). @DamaniN what do you think?

@DamaniN thanks a lot for looking into the issue.

I think this is meanwhile fixed or done outside of ReaR.
