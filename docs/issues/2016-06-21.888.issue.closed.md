-   Brief description of the issue  
    Trying to create rescue USB key that is directly connected to the
    server and save backup files to a mounted NFS server (NAS) on the
    network. The Centos 7 install is using EFI. With a modification to
    increase partition from 100MB to 200MB (issue \#849 ), I am
    formatting the USB key with the command, which appears to work:  
    `sudo rear format -- --efi /dev/sde`

However, when I go to mkrescue, it gets to the end and then fails
with:  
`ERROR: No files to send (RESULT_FILES is empty)`

I check the log, and it ends with:

I got the same error in 1.17.2 yesterday before trying the latest git.

Any insight into what is causing the error?

Thanks in advance

It is caused by

<pre>
RESULT_MAILTO=(mike@myemail.com)
</pre>

and the code in
usr/share/rear/output/default/95\_email\_result\_files.sh  
(excerpt):

<pre>
# email all files specified in RESULT_FILES to RESULT_MAILTO
#
test -z "$RESULT_MAILTO" && return
[ ${#RESULT_FILES[@]} -gt 0 ]
StopIfError "No files to send (RESULT_FILES is empty)"
</pre>

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf about that.

I never used that myself so that I cannot tell right now  
how that is meant to work.

"git blame usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf"  
tells that @schlomo wrote this in default.conf  
so that probably it is best when @schlomo  
has a first look what goes on here - primarily  
how RESULT\_FILES is meant to work.

Thank you for your response. I can confirm that the mkrescue completed
successfully after I comment out all those RESULT\_\* variables. I was
under the impression this was going to mail success/fail as any good
backup script should do (how is this not a feature already? Or is it
just me who prefers to setup something initially and be alerted to
problems rather than have to babysit things?). Looking at an example
local.conf file, I don't know what the purpose of that feature is, and
looks like it has a custom purpose that isn't covered in usage case or
work flow pages on
[http://relax-and-recover.org/](http://relax-and-recover.org/).

Many thanks for getting me over this last hurdle.

@schlomo

I'd suggest changing this to a WARNING instead of ERROR and not bail out
if empty files are reported. I don't think it does proper cleanup when
it currently bails out on the ERROR.

@BCITMike I think that @schlomo will not agree with you - see

@gdha  
I fully agree with what @schlomo wrote in  
[https://linuxconcontainerconeurope2016.sched.org/event/7oIH](https://linuxconcontainerconeurope2016.sched.org/event/7oIH)  
and in  
[http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](http://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)  
where the latter links to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/564)

But on the other hand @BCITMike could be right  
that when there are no RESULT\_FILES  
it could be not a sufficient reason to error out.

The primary question here is not whether or not  
to show the word 'WARNING' in a message.

The primary question here is whether or not  
to error out in output/default/95\_email\_result\_files.sh  
when there are no RESULT\_FILES.

Because there are other places in the code where  
it errors out when there are no RESULT\_FILES  
(e.g. in output/TSM/default/95\_dsmc\_save\_result\_files.sh)  
the current behaviour is probably correct.

But as far as I see not all places that deal with RESULT\_FILES  
error out when there are no RESULT\_FILES  
(e.g. in output/default/95\_copy\_result\_files.sh)  
so that the current behaviour could be not correct.

To answer this question one needs to know  
how using RESULT\_FILES is meant to work.

@jsmeix We should make sure (and yes that is not yet the case
everywhere) that that *all* output workflows have at least *one* file in
RESULT\_FILES. If I find time I will have a look into it, but I have to
say I'm very occupied lately so it has to be done in *free* time
(perhaps we have to start with a co-funding project so that I can work
on these matters in a paid matter).

@gdha  
no need for you to to it yourself.  
I will implememt that all output workflows  
have at least one file in RESULT\_FILES  
and error out if not.

Except where it is documented  
that no RESULT\_FILES is o.k. as in  
output/default/95\_copy\_result\_files.sh

<pre>
        # if called as mkbackuponly then we just don't have any result files.
        if test "$RESULT_FILES" ; then
</pre>

but I probably change that to something like

<pre>
test "mkbackuponly" = "$WORKFLOW" && return
</pre>

to skip copying RESULT\_FILES in case of mkbackuponly  
and otherwise (i.e. when copying RESULT\_FILES is a valid task)  
then error out if there are no RESULT\_FILES.

Probabyl I cannot do that for rear version 1.19 but afterwards  
because I need to test it carefully to avoid regressions.  
Therefore I set the milestone to "Rear future".

@jsmeix Was this already done? I cannot recall anymore - memory leak?
