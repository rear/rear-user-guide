Type: Enhancement

Impact: High  
Other platforms supporting the Data Protector Disk Agent, but not the
Cell Console (GUI), will be supported with REAR and BACKUP=DP. This
includes ppc64.

Reference to related issue (URL):  
none

How was this pull request tested?  
Applied the changes to a SLES15 SP1 system running rear 2.6.1. Created a
new ISO, booted the system and ran through various test cases.

Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
Relevant checks unavailable on clients without the Data Protector Cell
Console (GUI) are skipped. Restore defaults to external Data Protector
GUI restore.

@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate it if there was a second review from someone else.  
If not and when there are no objections I would like to merge it
tomorrow afternoon.

I obviously can't test this but it looks to me like the code would
benefit from a refactoring to better utilize our arch-dependent sub
directory structure so that the ReaR framework will make sure to include
the right scripts for the platform that ReaR runs on.

Otherwise looks good.

As far as I see those code parts that should behave different  
depending on the value for the `ARCH` variable are within one script.  
But our arch-dependent sub directory structure only works for whole
scripts.  
So I think smaller code parts within one script cannot be easily moved
out  
into separated scripts in arch-dependent sub directories.

Currently the following arch-dependent `Linux-ARCH` sub directories are
in use

    /Linux-arm/
    /Linux-i386/
    /Linux-ia64/
    /Linux-ppc64/
    /Linux-ppc64le/
    /Linux-s390/

In usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf `x86_64|i686|i586` are mapped to
`i386` via

    # These variables are used to include arch/os/version specific stuff:
    # machine architecture, OS independent
    REAL_MACHINE="$( uname -m )"
    case "$REAL_MACHINE" in
        (x86_64|i686|i586)
            # all these behave exactly like i386. For 64bit we took care to handle the
            # special cases within the 32bit scripts to prevent code duplication
            MACHINE=i386
            ;;
        (arm*|aarch*)
            MACHINE=arm
            ;;
        (s390*)
            MACHINE=s390
            ;;
        (*)
            MACHINE=$REAL_MACHINE
    esac
    # Architecture, e.g. Linux-i386
    ARCH="$( uname -s )-$MACHINE" 2>>/dev/null

so `Linux-x86_64` never happens as arch-dependent sub directory  
or as value for the `ARCH` variable.  
So it seems those tests could be simplified to

    if [ $ARCH == "Linux-i386" ] || [ $ARCH == "Linux-ia64" ] ; then

I was actually looking into this before I did the changes and came to a
similar conclusion. In the end it would result in multiple scripts all
doing the same making it very complex to maintain.

Okay, that's handy. Will work on this, too.

@sebastian-koehler  
thank you for your continuous enhancements  
of the BACKUP=DP support in ReaR.
