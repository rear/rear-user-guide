I currently facing a BUG with mkinitrd re-creation when :

-   restoration is made to a different system (migration)
-   running with ppc64 with lilo or yaboot boot loader
-   boot device is multipathed.
-   and boot partition is defined with `/dev/disk/by-id` in `lilo.conf`
    or `yaboot.conf`

mkinitrd gets the boot device from `/etc/lilo.conf` or
` /etc/yaboot.conf` when they exists.  
This means those one need to be migrated BEFORE running mkinitrd.

`/etc/lilo.conf` and `/etc/yaboot.conf` are with migrated with
(`250_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh`) for non-diskbyid device
(/dev/vda, /dev/sda, /dev/mapper/vg-lv) which is before
`550_rebuild_initramfs.sh`.

But diskbyid devices which are multipathed are not migrated
(`260_rename_diskbyid.sh`).

    while read ID DEV_NAME; do
      ID_NEW=""
      if [[ $DEV_NAME =~ ^dm- ]]; then
        # probably a multipath device
        # we cannot migrate device mapper targets
        # we delete DEV_NAME to make sure it won't get used
        DEV_NAME=""
      else
    ...

The script `610_install_yaboot.sh` or `610_install_lilo.sh` contain a
verification and replace `part=` with the good Power PReP partition.
(but it runs after `550_rebuild_initramfs.sh`)  
(@jsmeix, this explain why mkinitrd part was running originally after
bootloader for ppc64. cf \#1323)

====  
Solutions:

1.  The best would be to update `260_rename_diskbyid.sh` in order to
    also migrate multipathed...  
    but it looks complex

2.  Another way would be to move the `part=` renaming of `lilo.conf` and
    `yaboot.conf` from bootloader installation script to run it before
    mkinitrd. This solution is quick & easy and reduce the potential
    side-effect because we can apply this change to only ppc64 arch.

This pull-request implements the solution 2), but I ask advice/feedback
from the team (@gdha @jsmeix @schlomo @gozora).

tested on ppc64 with SLES11 SP4

@gdha, sure. I will wait for next week. it will let time for other to
also provide feedback.

@schabrolles  
perhaps a stupid question:  
I do not understand why you need to

<pre>
export PREP_BOOT_PART
</pre>

in finalize/Linux-ppc64/540\_check\_yaboot\_path.sh

Nothing goes wrong with the export.  
I only like to understand why it is needed.

I think all ReaR scripts get sourced  
(via the Source function in lib/framework-functions.sh)  
so that all the scripts are run by one same bash process  
so that usually no export to child processes should be needed.

Or in other words my question is:  
What child process needs PREP\_BOOT\_PART?

@jsmeix, thanks for the clarification.

`$PREP_BOOT_PART` is only needed in `600_install_yaboot.sh`. So If I've
well understood, it is the same process and the variable should be
available without export. So I will remove it.
