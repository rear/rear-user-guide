=======================================

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    1.17.2 / Git

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RedHatEnterpriseServer 7

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=USB

    OUTPUT\_URL="rsync://192.168.122.153/home/rear"

    USB\_DEVICE=/dev/sda1  
    GRUB\_RESCUE=1  
    GRUB\_PASSWORD=rootroot  
    BACKUP\_URL=usr:///dev/sda1  
    BACKUP=HAHAHAHA

-   Brief description of the issue  
    rear mkbackuponly appears to work even though it doesn't create the
    backup (doesn't print any error and exits with exit code 0). In
    verbose mode It does prints a warning message, but it suggest it
    might still work:

> The BACKUP method "HAHAHAHA" is not known to rear. Use on your own
> risk

-   Work-around, if any

Technically it would be easy to let  
usr/share/rear/backup/default/00\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh  
error out if a BACKUP method is not known to rear  
by replacing

<pre>
    LogPrint "The BACKUP method ...
</pre>

with

<pre>
    Error "The BACKUP method ...
</pre>

@schlomo @gdha  
I wonder if it is a good idea to error out  
when a BACKUP method is not found  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

In general I think rear should error out if mandatory  
conditions to propceed are not fulfilled cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

In this particular case I think it is a good idea  
to error out when a BACKUP method is not found  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf regardless  
that this is strictly speaking not a mandatory  
condition to propceed because the BACKUP method  
could be implemented nevertheless.

On the other hand I think all implemented BACKUP methods  
should be mentioned in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

If someone implements a new BACKUP method  
he would immediately notice via that error out  
that he must also mention it in default.conf  
which ensures a minimum documentation about  
what BACKUP methods are implemented in rear.

@zelial

Background information:

In general you have zillions of possibilities  
to make improper settings in /etc/rear/local.conf.

In practice it is impossible to check all conditions  
to ensure that "rear mkbackup" only succeeds  
when actually everything is right.

In general you must carefully verify that your  
particular disaster recovery procedure that you set up  
in your environment actually works for your systems.

See the initial issue

FYI:  
"git blame
usr/share/rear/backup/default/00\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh"  
shows 00\_valid\_backup\_methods.sh was created by  
commit fc9722d5ee394b90cf969ee54068d715dfaa5991  
and "git log" shows that it was because of

@jsmeix OK lets bail out when BACKUP method is not known - however, this
means we should start with a developers guide, no?

Yes!  
I fully agree to have a Relax-and-Recover developers guide.

I initiated  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide)

If you have time, just add what you like to have there  
but of course: first things first i.e. enjoy your leisure time!
