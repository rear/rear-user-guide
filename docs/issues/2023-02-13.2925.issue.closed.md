#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version: 2.6

-   OS version: RHEL 8.5

-   ReaR configuration files:  
    OUTPUT=USB  
    OUTPUT\_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"  
    BACKUP=NETFS

    USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE="650"  
    EOF

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR):

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware: GRUB

-   Storage: SSD

-   Description of the issue: So I was able create a mkBACKUP on a
    external lockable SSD that I had available. I am able to boot to the
    drive by plugging the device and the SSD into a docking station to
    keep the lockable ssd powered so it won't auto lock during the
    reboot process, however once booted to the drive and it enters ReaR
    the drive umounts and instantly locks after loading into rear. Once
    ReaR loads and asks for the login, I do that and attempt a rear
    recover, but says it can't find /bin/rear to find the default.conf
    file. I unlock the drive, do a lsblk to make sure that it shows that
    it is mounted on the system, but I get the same result.

Is it impossible to use a lockable drive as the USB device or am I
missing something to make this work correctly?

Can you please use version 2.7? We can't support older version, sorry.

Also, how did you install ReaR? @jsmeix do we have RHEL 8 repos with
current packages somewhere?

Is there a specific reason for copying a kernel *source* to the rescue
system? What would you do with that during recovery?

IMHO the lockable USB storage device should not make a difference as
long as it is unlocked. The rescue systems runs completely out of a RAM
disk (created by the `initrd` so that at this moment nothing should be
mounted in any case.

Bottom line: This looks like an installation gone wrong or a very
unusual system layout. After upgrading to 2.7 please try again and also
provide us the log file from the `rear mkrescue` and the output of
`rear dump`

I can try the newer version. Didn't realize I was using an older
version.

yum install rear

I had to do the copy as is with that kernel because the mkbackup kept
erroring out with that specific line as the cause, when I went looking
for solutions that copy as is line was what I found and once I included
it, I could at the very least create the backup.

That makes sense, but why would it reach out for the default.conf file
during that phase?

This was a second go round, I uninstalled rear and all of the packages
with it. Reinstalled it and had the same error at the same point.

I will attempt with the newer version and try again.

`/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` is always read by `rear`, which btw
is copied in its entirety into the rescue system.

The fact that it is missing shows that there is some fundamental
problem.

Please try with a recent version and als show us the output and log of
`rear dump`, `rear -v mkrescue` or `rear -v mkbackup`, whatever you
used.

BTW, you can configure SSH for the rescue system to make your life
simpler.

The cause is

    COPY_AS_IS="/usr/src/kernals/4.18.0-348.el8.x86_64"

in etc/rear/local.conf (or etc/rear/site.conf)  
because this overwrites

    COPY_AS_IS=( $SHARE_DIR $VAR_DIR )

in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf that is sourced in usr/sbin/rear  
before etc/rear/local.conf and etc/rear/site.conf get sourced  
so nothing in usr/share/rear/ and var/lib/rear/ gets copied  
into the ReaR rescue/recovery system.

Use

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /usr/src/kernals/4.18.0-348.el8.x86_64 )

instead.

Note that COPY\_AS\_IS is an array,  
see the initial comments in our ReaR 2.6 upstream  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

See also the comments in our original  
ReaR 2.6 upstream etc/rear/local.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/etc/rear/local.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/etc/rear/local.conf)

By the way:  
Is it really '/usr/src/kernals/' and not '/usr/src/kernels/'?

In the openSUSE Build Service (OBS)  
there is no RHEL 8 repository avialable for building on  
[https://build.opensuse.org/projects/Archiving:Backup:Rear/distributions/new](https://build.opensuse.org/projects/Archiving:Backup:Rear/distributions/new)  
Login at OBS is needed to see that - without login at OBS one gets  
"Sorry, you are not authorized to update this project."

Nice catch @jsmeix!

Maybe some day we can do a simple check for such common mistakes by
validating that variables that should be an array are actually still an
array, or at least the ones where we always expect more than one value
in them, like this `COPY_AS_IS`.

Interestingly "rear mkrescue" does not error out with

    COPY_AS_IS="/some/directory"

I tested it right now on a test VM with

    COPY_AS_IS="/home/johannes"

I would have expected that something fails with that.  
But it looks to the user as if it had "just worked" ok:

I think I will enhance  
usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
to verify that 'rear' can be run inside the recovery system  
e.g. by calling

    rear dump 1>/dev/null

or something similar.

When I call this inside the ReaR recovery system  
with 'COPY\_AS\_IS="/some/directory"' I get

    # chroot /tmp/rear.BaBizTjSCHecwck/rootfs/

    bash-4.4# rear dump 1>/dev/null
    /sbin/rear: line 312: /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf: No such file or directory

    /sbin/rear: line 576: LogToSyslog: command not found

    bash-4.4# echo $?
    1

For now I prefer a simple test for what is actually needed  
inside the ReaR recovery system over a more abstract  
verification of config variable settings because currently  
I don't have a good idea how to implement that with reasonable  
effort (which does of course not mean a general verification  
of config variables cannot be implemented at a later time).

Should we keep this issue open till we actually add a sanity check?

I was thinking along the lines of parsing `default.conf` to find all
variables that should be an array:  
<img width="639" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101384/218696832-de042698-99ac-4b62-bd7e-902ecf5904be.png">

And then we can add a check like this to validate that all those
variables are actually still arrays:

    [[ "$(declare -p EXCLUDE_BACKUP)" =~ "declare -a" ]] && echo array

(and this code is not very robust, see
[https://stackoverflow.com/a/42877229](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42877229)
for the probably most "correct" implementation)

What do you think. Should I add that to ReaR?

I did  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2930](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2930)  
for the generic test to have things separated.

By the way:

    COPY_AS_IS=( /some/directory )

would be syntactically correct but still results  
the same useless recovery system.
