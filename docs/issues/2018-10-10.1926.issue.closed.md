-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

In issue \#655 @rg-fine has an issue with rear working with teamed
interfaces in RHEL and provided work around in PR \#662.

The resolution was to simplify the function that all ip-addresses and
routing-entries of a teaming-interface will be attached to its first
available teaming-member according to teamdctl.

While this works well in a team configured for broadcast, roundrobin,
and activebackup it does not work when configured for LACP. (I can't
confirm for loadbalance as I haven't tested it).

As stated in \#662 all ip-addresses and routing-entries are configured
on one interface but LACP is not operational. This results in the host
not being able to communicate with the TSM server and the backup
failing.

@MogiePete  
in ReaR version 2.4

<pre>
Network setup was completely reworked to support
bonding, bridges, vlans and teaming. There is a full
rewrite of the 310_network_devices.sh script generating
network interfaces for use during ReaR rescue/recovery
system networking setup via the 60-network-devices.sh
script. It also handles corner cases/odd setups that can
be found from time to time, typically when the administrator
uses bonding plus bridges plus vlans as well as teaming.
</pre>

see  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-4)

@rmetrich  
could you have a look here because it is about  
teamed network interfaces which could be related to your code in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh

@MogiePete  
in general when ReaR's automated setup of the networking stuff  
in the ReaR recovery system does not work as you need it  
in your particular case, you can as a workaround manually  
specify any networking setup comands as you need it via the  
`NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS` array, see  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

@jsmeix

I looked at the `NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS` but I don't think that
will resolve the issue. Bonding is done with a kernel module while
teaming is done in user space so I don't believe I can configure the
interfaces and they would work unless I configured them as a bond which
defeats the purpose of using teaming.

At this point, until a solution is found, I am having to revert all of
my physical hosts running EL7 to bonding.

Hello,

If I remember well, the teaming is always simplified.  
Could you hence submit the generated file
(`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh`)?

Also a debug log of the `rear -dD mkrescue` may help there.

@MogiePete  
Would it work with LACP if an interface is taken administratively
down?  
What happens on the OS if you set carrier to 0 on one of the physical
interface?  
The idea is to find a solution without integrating the whole teamdctl
stack.

@rmetrich

I have attached the 60-network-devices.sh renamed to .txt as requrested
along with the debug log.

In regards to your question about setting the carrier to 0 I do not know
how to do that with teaming and rear but it would be worth a try.

Also, we did work with our network team and tried with the second port
set to admin down but they were not seeing any LACP traffic.
Additionally, when they disabled the Port-Channel then traffic was
flowing but this is not the ideal path to take as doing a restore when
the OS is configured for bonding does not require any modification of
the network configuration.

Looking closer, I think we really need to simplify the Teaming
configuration because including Teaming is very complicated: it requires
d-bus and other stuff we probably don't want in the rescue.  
Could your network team describe the switch configuration of the
ports?  
With same switch configuration, is it possible to configure the OS in
bonding instead? If so, can you describe the required bonding
configuration?  
Asking because maybe we could just map teaming to bonding while in
rescue.

@rmetrich

Here is the configuration of the Port-Channel and one of the port
configurations.

interface Port-channel276  
switchport  
switchport access vlan 417  
switchport mode access  
no ip address  
!  
interface GigabitEthernet3/14  
switchport  
switchport access vlan 417  
switchport mode access  
no ip address  
channel-group 276 mode on  
!

The system works with bonding and teaming. I actually reconfigured the
network for bonding, created a new rescue disk, and did the restore
without any issues.

This is the bonding configuration on the OS:

BONDING\_OPTS="downdelay=0 miimon=1 mode=802.3ad updelay=0"

I think the idea of mapping teaming to bonding would work perfectly.
Same network configuration will work with both.

Hello @MogiePete ,  
I've started implementing the teaming code inside recovery. I believe
this is doable without including D-Bus.  
Please allow me some time as this is not my primary responsibility at
Red Hat.

My understanding is that with LACP, using network simplification will
not work, even for Bonding. Hence, I would also like to harden the bond
code so that in case of LACP, no network simplification happens and a
message gets printed to the user.

Once code is implemented, please help us testing, because I don't have
access to the required hardware.

@rmetrich  
as a networking noob I have a beginners question:

I had a quick look at  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link\_aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation)  
which also talks about redundancy in case one of the links fails.

If one of two links fails, there is only one left and then  
things should still work with the one left network interface.

Now I wonder why it is not possible to set up only one single  
network interface "as usual" and it still works to access  
the server where the backup is stored?

I.e. why is the whole link aggregation setup required in the recovery
system  
to be able to access the backup server via a single network interface?

Or in other words:  
Why is the whole link aggregation setup required in a network  
where "teaming with LACP" is used when a particular host  
has only one single NIC?

@jsmeix LACP works by sending frames to negociate link state between
switch and host. If we just plumb a single network interface, then no
frame will be sent, preventing any network traffic to occur.

Thank you for working on this. I am sure many will benefit.

Once the code is committed I will test and provide feedback.

Thanks again.

@MogiePete

PR is \#1934, please give it a try on real hardware.  
Please test the following scenarios with LACP enabled on the switch

-   **Bonding**
-   **Bonding** with **SIMPLIFY\_BONDING=y** in ReaR configuration
-   **Teaming**
-   **Teaming** with **SIMPLIFY\_TEAMING=y** in ReaR configuration

Due to LACP, SIMPLIFY\_XXX shouldn't do anything: Bonding and Teaming
shall persist in recovery.  
The `teamdctl` binary is automatically added to the ISO image for
convenience, when a Team exists and is not simplified.

@rmetrich

I was able to test this using bonding and teaming after building the rpm
from your pull request.

On one of the two nodes I had an issue with the system booting properly
after the TSM restore. The UUID of /dev/sda1 which holds /boot was not
updated in the fstab which resulted in the system failing to load the
operating system properly. A quick edit after booting into recovery on
the CentOS iso resolved the issue. The two systems were identical in
terms of hardware and OS configuration so I am not sure what the issue
was.

Other than that one issue I can report that the additions to the
networking code are working properly.

Thank you so much for the quick turn around on this issue.

@MogiePete  
can you open a new separated issue for

<pre>
The UUID of /dev/sda1 which holds /boot
was not updated in the fstab which resulted in the
system failing to load the operating system properly
</pre>

We need separated GitHub issue reports for separated issues  
because otherwise different things could mess up until havoc.

Normally UUIDs in the restored etc/fstab get automatically adjusted
via  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
that reads a FS\_UUID\_MAP file var/lib/rear/layout/fs\_uuid\_mapping  
which gets created during "rear recover" by the script  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh

You may also have a look at item (5)  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854\#issue-338886055](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854#issue-338886055)

and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1857](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1857)

To have a chance to understand what went wrong in your case  
I need a debug log of "rear -D recover" (the recovery log gets  
copied into the recreated system so that you should have it)  
plus - if possible - your old etc/fstab from the backup and the  
new adapted one that works.

@MogiePete "I was able to test this using bonding and teaming after
building the rpm from your pull request."  
Did you test teaming with multiple interfaces in the team? For us this
did not work because teaming seems to have a problem analogous to
\#1954, which was fixed for bonding, but not for teaming.

@MogiePete thanks for the confirmation. I don't see how this could have
worked though. In our testing, teamd is invoked as

which fails with this message:

@rmetrich any idea?

@rmetrich, yes, that's the point. That's why it fails. Since the MAC
address is duplicated, the sed command modified the script so that it
contains a duplicate interface name.

because I don't see in which case this problem could have been avoided.
