Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    OS\_VENDOR=RedHatEnterpriseServer  
    OS\_VERSION=7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

    $ cat /etc/rear/site.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///fsbackup/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///fsbackup/
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=
    TMPDIR="/fsbackup"
    export TMPDIR
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=3500

    $ cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}"
     '/dev' '/media' '/mnt' '/proc' '/sys' '/tmp' '/run' '/var/tmp' '/var/crash' '/fsbackup' '/linuxbackup' )
    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}"
     "fs:/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc" "fs:/sl_test" "fs:/seed_7" "fs:/fsbackup" )

-   Brief description of the issue  
    I would like to make ISO for backup/restore operations. When I use
    above settings, the error was returned, because of /var filesystem
    full. I found that the ISO file was generated under
    `/var/lib/rear/output`. That is expected behavior, even through I
    define `OUTPUT_URL=file:///fsbackup/`?

I tried

    OUTPUT_URL=null
    ISO_DIR=/expect_output/output/

and then rear would not put iso in `/var/lib/rear/output`, instead rear
put iso to `/expect_output/output/` directly.

Needinfo: @jsmeix @gdha Is above the right way to redirect iso file?

See also issue \#734 - however, still haven't found the time to
implement this feature.  
@feichashao Yes - the work-around you're using seems to do the job for
the moment.

@feichashao as your work-around is sufficient for the moment and issue
\#734 is still open for the same we can close this case.
