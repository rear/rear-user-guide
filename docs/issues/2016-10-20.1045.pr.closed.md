Hello all,  
This patch adds possibility for remote Borg repository encryption.  
I have however some mixed feelings about it.  
The thing on my mind is that we agreed in \#1037 that we will mirror
Borg defaults. (e.g. "none" compression will be used by default). Borg
however uses encrypted repositories by default, which adds some
additional complexity (manual repository initialization and entering
pass-phrase for every repository operation like purging, listing,
backing up). I've found couple of ways how to avoid all this (they are
described
[here](https://github.com/gozora/rear/blob/securing_borg/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-iso-with-borg)),
but like I said, mixed feelings...

In my opinion bare metal restore is quite complex task, where lot of
things can go wrong, and I really don't like adding more burden to quite
stressed admin as they already have on their shoulders when dealing with
restores (maybe because I'm one of them ;-) ). One such things could
possibly be encrypted backups.

For this reason I'd like to ask for you opinion, if we could set
**none** encryption as a default for ReaR and let users to enable
encryption only if they really need to and possibly know what they are
doing.  
.  
Thanks!

V.

I think we can set none encryption as a default for ReaR  
because also for 'tar' there is no encryption and I assume  
also for most other backup methods there is no encryption  
so that I assume ReaR users would expect no encryption  
by default.

Furthermore I think a basic idea behind ReaR is that the  
actual recovery is as simple as possible, cf.  
"A note on the meaning of 'Relax' in 'Relax-and-Recover'" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
(excerpts):

<pre>
... after an experienced admin had set it up ...
...
When now a real disaster happens, even a
relatively unexperienced person can do the
recovery on the replacement hardware
(boot the rear recovery system, log in  as root,
 run "rear recover", and finally reboot). 
</pre>

@gozora  
currently this branch has conflicts that must be resolved:  
Conflicting files: usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

If you resolve the conflict, I would "just merge" it.

Jey, my first conflict, let me see :-)

Ok, looks like I've payed attention during my Git classes :-), conflict
resolved.  
I'll update defaults for encryption later today.

Thanks for now!

@gozora  
strange, when I click in this issue in the GitHub  
web-fontend on "Files changed" I still see in  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/50\_make\_backup.sh  
and in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
your changes from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1044](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1044)  
that are already merged into rear master  
so that I wonder if it has now really no conflicts?

Well, this conflict was rather strange. The conflict looked something
like this:

    <<<<<<< HEAD
    =======
    +BORGBACKUP_COMPRESSION=""
     +# Borg encryption type
     +# Types: none, keyfile, repokey
     +# none: encryption is disabled (least trouble with setup, least security)
     +# keyfile: passphrase and having-the-key (stored on client in /$HOME/.config/borg/keys/)
     +# repokey: passphrase-only (stored on server BORGBACKUP_REPO/config)
     +# Default: repokey
     +BORGBACKUP_ENC_TYPE=""
    >>>>>>> <hash>

So to my understanding no conflict at all. I just removed
`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======` and `>>>>>>> <hash>`  
`git add .`  
`git commit`

and that is it ...

Maybe you've saw behavior like this already?

@jsmeix let's try to close this pull request and open new one,  
What do you say?

@jsmeix FYI, by just clicking "new pull request",
*usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/50\_make\_backup.sh* is not between
changed files any more.  
So new, pull request might solve this ...

@gozora  
feel free to do it as it is best for you.  
I think you can close this request yourself if you like  
(I assume the one who creates it can also close it  
but I cannot know how GitHub behaves for you).
