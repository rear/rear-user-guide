Now snapper's own subvolumes are excluded from being  
automatically recreated by listing them only as comments in  
disklayout.conf during "rear mkbackup" (via 23\_filesystem\_layout.sh)  
and furthermore if such subvolumes are active in disklayout.conf  
they are skipped during "rear recover" plus LogPrint info for the user  
(via 13\_include\_mount\_subvolumes\_code.sh).
