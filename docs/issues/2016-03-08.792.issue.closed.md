-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2 and recent git clone. Both
    were tested.
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): Rhel 6 and 7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): N/A

The main .gitignore file has the line "var". This appears to exclude the
var directory within the usr/share/rear/skel/default directory from
being committed in Git. When making rpm packages the
usr/share/rear/skel/default/var directory was being excluded which would
then exclude those directories from being created on the rescue ISO.

These directories missing was causing problems. Is there a justification
for having the "var" exclude in the .gitignore file?

The `var` directory was added by change
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/87ebabba5abe3f1cda4b691564fc5e1ee53985d1](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/87ebabba5abe3f1cda4b691564fc5e1ee53985d1)
by @schlomo  
Probably, when running rear from relative path then the `var` directory
is automatically created and @schlomo wanted to exclude this from the
rear archive tar.

Yes, this is correct.

Can you please let me know for which purpose you need a `var` directory
within `usr/share/rear/skel/default`?

In this Git repo usr/share/rear/skel/default/var contains the
directories empty,lib,lock,log,run,tmp then some sub-directories on top
of that. Because of the "var" exclude these directories are not
committed to git unless they are forced. Then because they never get
committed to git they then don't end up in rpm packages. Finally, those
folders never get created on the rescue ISO.

I'm only running into this because I have to download the zip folder and
then create a git repo locally. These folder are already in the git
repository here so if you do a proper git pull you wouldn't run into
this issue.

For example /var/run was not being created on the rescue ISO which then
resulted in the initramfs scripts failing (iirc).

I see. Maybe we change the
[gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) entry from `var` to
either `/var` or add another entry with
`!/usr/share/rear/skel/default/var` to exclude that from the exclusion.
However, since maybe others also want to add stuff to `var` I think that
going for `/var` would be better and more direct.

@thefrenchone Could you test this and tell us the difference?

Changing the gitignore to have `/var` instead of `var` did include the
`usr/share/rear/skel/default/var` directory in the rpm. This change
appears to have the desired result.

I don't really understand the justification for that line.

As @gdha wrote already: If you run ReaR from a checkout it will create a
var dir there.
