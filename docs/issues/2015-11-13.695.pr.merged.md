Multiple san-booting/uefi related fixes implemented.

-   correctly find disk and partition number for efibootmgr.
-   find now partition start also for multipath (dm-XX) disk
-   save `/dev/mapper/mpathX` dev names instead of `dm-XX` names to the
    disklayout file for btrfs and `/dev/disk/by-id/` disks description.
    Addresses the issue, when `/dev/dm-XX` is recoreded in disklayout,
    but `dm-XX` can by different disk with the same size in the recovery
    environment.

-   a small bugfix: skip comments and consider also tab-separated
    entries when scanning fstab for btrfs volumes.
