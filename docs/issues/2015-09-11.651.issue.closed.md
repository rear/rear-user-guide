Hi together,

not sure, if it's an issue or if it works as designed..

For me the ISO\_FILES() array is a little bit useless, because this
additional files will not be added to the initramfs and because of this
they are not automatically available on restore time. Especially if you
need a file like inclexcl for TSM (which otherwise will generate an
error while trying to restore) you can not use the
auto-restore-function...

I would prefer either that this files will be copied to initramfs before
you create the initrd image or an additional array with a new script
managing the described behaviour. For my environment I created a
workaround.  
Maybe this could help for an implementation:

    # cat /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
      ...
      # which files to include in initramfs
      ROOTFS_INCL=()
      ...

    # cat /etc/rear/site.conf
      ...
      # which files to include in initramfs
      ROOTFS_INCL=(/etc/tsm.inclexcl /etc/file1 /etc/dir/*)
      ...

    # cat /usr/share/rear/build/default/49_include_files.sh
      if test "${#ROOTFS_INCL[@]}" -gt 0 ; then

            for i in "${ROOTFS_INCL[@]}"
            do
                    DEST_DIR=$ROOTFS_DIR/$(dirname $i)
                    mkdir -p $DEST_DIR
                    cp -pLr $i $DEST_DIR/. >&2
            done

      fi

Thanks for your effort.

Cheers, Ralf

Why not simply use the `COPY_AS_IS` array for this purpose?

The answer is easy: because I did not realize that this array can be
used for this purpose (the tar in the comment section was confusing
me).  
Sorry for this and many thanks for the hint. Works perfectly with
COPY\_AS\_IS
