-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In lib/global-functions.sh in the function mount\_url()  
renamed the user config variable  
USER\_INPUT\_RELAXRECOVER\_SYMLINK\_TARGET  
as USER\_INPUT\_ISO\_SYMLINK\_TARGET  
because the old name contained a user config value:  
RELAXRECOVER was an old default value of ISO\_VOLID, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2457)

Accordingly also renamed the local variables  
relaxrecover\_block\_device  
relaxrecover\_symlink\_name  
relaxrecover\_symlink\_target  
as  
iso\_block\_device  
iso\_symlink\_name  
iso\_symlink\_target

@rear/contributors

are OK for you I would like to merge  
this pull request tomorrow afternoon.
