Hello,

I tried to install the latest rear and created my first image using
bacula as backupping-engine.

Now I started my created image and the procedure started fine.

But: If I come to the point where bconsole should be started - it is not
started :-(

I'm getting the error "No job control in this shell" and if I open
"bconsole", I always get "Connecting to director ... " and the shell is
there again.

Any ideas?

@e-it Did you ping the bacula director server before the restore? It
could be a network issue.

I know nothing at all about Bacula/bconsole but is seems  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/996](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/996)  
is related.
