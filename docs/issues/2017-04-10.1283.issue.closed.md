Rear doesn't create backup when big file systems are mounted. It tries
to copy files from network filesystems which are often very big and
slow. Backup creation of mounted NFS is not task which should clients
do. This should be backed up from server side.

Problem appears when variable NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES is set to
yes. It goes through whole system by command 'getcap -r /' including
NFS.

Current result:  
Rear does a copy of large mounted NFS and it can last indefinitely. I
waited for 8 hours and it was still working.

Expected result:  
It will not do a copy of mounted NFS.

Indeed.

    getcap -r / 2>/dev/null | grep -v $ISO_DIR > $VAR_DIR/recovery/capabilities || Log "Error while saving capabilities to file."

Is certainly not way to go, as root (/) can contain lots of files ...

@gdha, @jsmeix  
Maybe

    getcap -r $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) 2>/dev/null | grep -v $ISO_DIR > $VAR_DIR/recovery/capabilities || Log "Error while saving capabilities to file."

Would be better?

One good news: step `Creating root filesystem layout` and whole process
of `rear -v mkbackup` ended.  
But there is problem with capabilities again. It was not saved.

need some modifications - see above. Any comments?  
Also, this issue is related to \#1175 - if only `tar` could handle
correctly `--acls` and `--xattr` then this hack would not be necessary.

@tcerna @gozora The error
`/tmp/rear.mdzBvGEIXrxaihO/tmp/backup-include.txt: No such file or directory`
is normal as `./rescue/NETFS/default/610_save_capabilities.sh` is
executed before `./backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh`. To be
precise script
`./backup/NETFS/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh` creates the
*backup-include.txt* file.  
Try to use the command `rear -s mkbackup` to get an overview of **all**
scripts (and in the order these are executed)

I see that `610_save_capabilities.sh` are run before other scripts. File
`backup-include.txt` can't exist, so it is not possible to use it in
this script.

First and foremost:  
When the root cause is that 'tar' has a bug that is does no longer  
handle --acls and --xattr corectly then this hack is just a band aid  
and not meant to be a solution. But band aid hacks must be  
propoerly documented as described at "Dirty hacks welcome"  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
because  
otherwise we get bug reports about ReaR like this one  
that are actually no bugs in ReaR.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1175\#issuecomment-282334872](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1175#issuecomment-282334872)  
the bug is in 'tar' and must be fixed there.

Regarding the dirty NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES hack:  
I would only properly document it but leave it as is.  
ReaR is not responsible to fix broken backup tools.

If someone likes to enhance NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES  
to make it better usable I would recommend to make  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES an array of directories  
that is used for 'getcap -r directory' calls.  
By default NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES could be  
empty which means the hack is not done.

When 'tar' does not work as documented it is up to the user  
to either get a fixed 'tar' or to manually specify the right  
directories in his particular case to work around his broken 'tar'.

Currently I have other work to do - but later as time permits  
I may try to enhance NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES.

@tcerna  
what about a fix for 'tar' in Red Hat?

This would lead back to problem we have currently, considering that user
would not search manually for files/file systems containing capabilities
and fallback to "/" (root) which would again search all net shares even
if excluded from backup ...

See what I also wrote:

<pre>
When 'tar' does not work as documented
it is up to the user to either get a fixed 'tar'
or to manually ... work around his broken 'tar'.
</pre>

ReaR upstream is not there to fix bugs in other tools.

Any user can adapt and enhance our ReaR usptream scripts  
according to his particular needs when he must work around  
issues in his particular environment.

ReaR may even provide some kind of "template functionality"  
to work around issues that is disabled by default  
(like NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES).

But ReaR should not try to automatically work around issues  
because when ReaR does something automatically then users  
also "automatically" expect that ReaR does everything right.  
But that fails more often than not for workarounds.  
Any workaround has unwanted side effects.

Strictly speaking nothing at all should be done in ReaR  
when a bug is not in ReaR because regardless what  
sophisticated workarounds we try to implement in ReaR  
we will then get subsequent reports that demand  
"ReaR has a bug that needs to be fixed in ReaR".

FYI regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283\#issuecomment-293177186](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283#issuecomment-293177186)  
that 'rescue' stage is run before 'backup' stage:

It is a general problem in lib/mkbackup-workflow.sh  
that 'backup' stage is usually run last  
but sometimes not (i.e. for backup in the ISO image), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1281\#issuecomment-292534810](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1281#issuecomment-292534810)

I am already thinking about if another ordering might be better  
where 'backup' is not last so that one could do things  
even after 'backup', for example things like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283\#issuecomment-293160403](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1283#issuecomment-293160403)

At least there should be one same ordering in any case  
to avoid unexpected behaviour is some cases as in

I'm fully share your opinion @jsmeix.  
But we already have code for save/restore capabilities
*610\_save\_capabilities.sh* in ReaR present, and once it was merged it
should work.  
I personally think that scanning capabilities on "/" is simply not OK.  
I'll try to fix this somehow and we can discuss my approach of solving
this under PR, like always ;-).

@gozora  
because I fully agree with you that code that there is in ReaR  
should work sufficiently well I wrote that I will try to enhance  
the NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES implementation.  
But currently I have no good idea how to make that code  
"just work" out of the box - therefore I used my usual fallback  
to let the user manually specify what ReaR should do  
so that the user knows what he has set up and  
ReaR upstream is not "guilty by default".

@gozora @jsmeix with the sentence "*scanning capabilities on "/" is
simply not OK*" I full agree. I think we could fix this by moving the
rescue script to the backup workflow, no? We only need the capabilities
file during the restore phase anyway. So, why bother during the rescue
phase?  
@jsmeix there is a reason why the output workflow is before the backup
workflow and that is OBDR (however, is anyone still using that?) - I
guess HPE ;-)

@gdha  
I think we cannot move rescue/NETFS/default/610\_save\_capabilities.sh  
to the backup stage because the 'output' stage (and the 'build' stage)  
is usually before the 'backup' stage which means  
/var/lib/rear/recovery/capabilities will not get included in the  
output (i.e. it will be missing in the ReaR recovery system).

@gozora  
we cannot use your proposal

<pre>
getcap -r $(cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt) ...
</pre>

because on my SLES12 test system I get

<pre>
# cat /tmp/rear.Kg1fzf8DAe2o37x/tmp/backup-include.txt
/
</pre>

i.e. $( cat $TMP\_DIR/backup-include.txt ) evaluates to '/'.  
I have nothing specified in local.conf what exactly should  
be in the backup - i.e. I use the ReaR default.

@jsmeix this could work if we use `getcap` instead of `getcap -r`  
-r should use recursion and collect all files inside "/" (this obviously
means everything).  
But if we remove `-r` getcap will stay inside specified file system
boundaries so every other mount point should be skipped.

No, I have a single ext4 file system.

Even 'getcap /usr/\* 2&gt;/dev/null' does not work for me:

<pre>
# getcap /usr/* 2>/dev/null
[no output]
</pre>

in contrast to 'getcap -r /usr' which works

<pre>
# getcap -r /usr 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service+ep
/usr/bin/ping6 = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
</pre>

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1284](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1284)
merged  
NETFS\_RESTORE\_CAPABILITIES is more flexible to be used.  
See default.conf how it can be used.  
In particular on systems with zillions of files the user can  
now explicitly specify on what directories 'getcap -r'  
should be run to avoid that 'getcap -r /' runs too long.

@tcerna  
out of curiosity I am interested to learn why  
on your particular system with NFS mounts  
'getcap -r /' needs more than 8 hours.

On my test sytem without NFS mounts  
I have all regular files in one ext4 filesystem

<pre>
# find / -xdev | wc -l
125546

# time getcap -r / &>/dev/null
real    0m4.427s
user    0m0.126s
sys     0m2.246s
</pre>

Now I mounted for testing a whole /usr/ from  
another machine (107780 files) via NFS

<pre>
# mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/usr /tmp/mp

# time getcap -r / &>/dev/null
real    0m13.357s
user    0m0.285s
sys     0m8.564s

# find /tmp/mp -xdev | wc -l
107780
</pre>

For me 107780 additional files mounted via NFS  
make 'getcap -r /' somewhat slower but still  
it completes within seconds.

Now I mount the same NFS share two additional times

<pre>
# mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/usr /tmp/mp2

# mount -v -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,nolock 10.160.4.244:/usr /tmp/mp3

# time getcap -r / &>/dev/null
real    0m18.393s
user    0m0.440s
sys     0m10.964s
</pre>

I wonder what goes on on your system with NFS mounts  
that could make 'getcap -r /' running for hours?

From my above tests it seems the current default  
to run 'getcap -r /' is usually sufficiently fast.

For exceptional cases the user can now  
do appropriate exceptional setup in ReaR.
