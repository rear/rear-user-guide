I would like to see rear gain support for backing up and recovering ZFS
disks including root on ZFS disks eg Proxmox VE and Ubuntu are two
distros that let the user easily install to a ZFS root pool. I just
grepped the rear source tree for `zpool` and `zfs` and got no results so
I think its a safe assumption to make that it currently has no support
for ZFS.

I would recommend using syncoid (part of sanoid) for replicating ZFS
snapshots.

I don't know if enough people are interested in using rear with ZFS to
justify adding those links as a response to a new "Does rear support
ZFS?" question in [the
FAQ?](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/faq)
