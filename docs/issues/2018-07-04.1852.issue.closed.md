-   Brief description of the issue:  
    When using RAWDISK recovery environment to restore a server, the
    disk layout configuration (mapping) does not work correctly.  
    Because RAWDISK acts as a block device, it is recognized as (in my
    case) `sda`, so the root partition of the disk to be restored
    becomes `sdb`. When running `rear recover`, it should automagically
    find the appropriate disk based on its size. But here it does not
    work.  
    As an information, source disk and the destination disk are
    litteraly the same, I merely boot the virtual machine on the
    recovery environnement. So size is the same.

@GreenBlood  
as a quick first reply about what you get on your terminal:

All looks perfectly fine to me and works exactly as it should  
and as it also works for other output methods (like `OUTPUT=ISO`)  
because the output method must not make a difference how  
"rear recover" behaves regarding disk layout mapping.

It automatically detects that sda is not the expected one

<pre>
Comparing disks
Device sda has size 95420416 but 21474836480 is expected (needs manual configuration)
Switching to manual disk layout configuration
</pre>

and then it automatically finds that sdb has the expected size

<pre>
Using /dev/sdb (same size) for recreating /dev/sda
</pre>

so that it automatically creates the disk mapping proposal  
which it shows to you

<pre>
Current disk mapping table (source -> target):
    /dev/sda /dev/sdb
</pre>

and asks for your confirmation that this is really  
the right disk mapping in your particular case

<pre>
Confirm or edit the disk mapping
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
4) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
</pre>

where you could use item `3)` to verify what sda and sdb actually are  
at that particular state to make a decision based on the actual facts.

@GreenBlood  
can you describe in more detail what your expectation is and/or  
how that disk mapping ` /dev/sda` =&gt; `/dev/sdb` does not work for
you?

FYI:  
If you do not like the default `timeout 300 seconds`  
or if you like to avoid manual input, see the section about

@jsmeix Well let me briefly explain you my use case. I use rear to
automate the recovery processes of linux servers in a cloud
environnement. I used to generate a rescue ISO, boot it on a VM with all
the disks expected, and using the unattended mode and some fiddling,
restored the server automatically.

Now I recently changed my cloud environment and was not able anymore to
boot on ISO, hence my use of RAWDISK. The issue I'm having is that
because of the sda=&gt;sdb mapping thing, the automated workflow is
interrupted.

I have no issue with how rear builds the mapping, but I'd wish to know
if it's possible to, by default, accept all changes, because the source
sda and dest sdb are the same size, imho it would make sense to me to be
able to just say to rear "do your thing"

**EDIT :** As I read the UserInput section in default.conf, I think I
understand how I would do it. I'd have to set a default value for all
input that might come up using `USER_INPUT_user_input_ID` ?

@GreenBlood  
I think in practice the easiest way to "blindly accept"  
all `UserInput` dialogs with their defaults is to set

<pre>
USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=1
</pre>

in your etc/rear/local.conf  
(`USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=0` does not work)  
for the details how it is implemented see the UserInput function  
in usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

In your case you cannot use `MIGRATION_MODE='false'`  
because that would skip the automated disk migration  
and "blindly" recreate on what is stored in your disklayout.conf  
which means "blindly" recreate on /dev/sda which would  
destroy your ReaR recovery disk.

For example how things look for me with `USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT=1`  
on a SLES15 KVM/QEMU test system with two (virtual) disks  
with identical size (only one is used for the system):

Those changes had happened all the time but since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843)
is merged therein the commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/632bc2dee4d5b82cfe91416c81254f0bc9919a70](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/632bc2dee4d5b82cfe91416c81254f0bc9919a70)  
makes that obvious to the user via `LogPrint` that tell about what is
done, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1847](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1847)

That part is from scripts like  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/250\_migrate\_disk\_devices\_layout.sh  
and subsequent scripts like  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/250\_migrate\_lun\_wwid.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/260\_rename\_diskbyid.sh  
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
which modify files in the recreated system.

But in your particular case I assume  
sda is the ReaR recovery system only during "rear recover"  
but later during normal operation of the recreated system  
the ReaR recovery system disk is no longer there so that then  
sda becomes the usual system disk of the recreated system.

But the above scripts had modified certain files on the recreated
system.  
In particular the disk mapping `/dev/sda` =&gt; `/dev/sdb` was applied
to some files  
so that now those files contain `/dev/sdb` instead of `/dev/sda` which
is  
probably wrong during normal operation of the recreated system  
where actually `/dev/sda` is the first system disk (and not `/dev/sdb`).

@GreenBlood Some remarks:

1.  The difference between your old and new configuration is something
    like this:
    -   The optical boot drive (based on an ISO image) was controlled by
        the kernel's CD-ROM driver (possibly `sr`), so it may have
        appeared under `/dev/sr0`.
    -   The hard disk boot drive (based on a RAWDISK image) is contolled
        by the kernel's SCSI disk driver, so it appears under
        `/dev/sda`.
2.  The optical drive's device node `/dev/sr0` could never clash with
    that of the first regular hard disk `/dev/sda`. So your regular hard
    disks were assigned the same device nodes during recovery as during
    normal operation.
3.  Now, your new recovery boot device, being presented as the first
    hard disk by QEMU, becomes `/dev/sda`, moving your regular hard
    disks to `/dev/sdb` and beyond.

Block device names (and by the way, the virtual ISO optical drive is
also a block device) are assigned by the respective kernel driver in
initialization order. (For some information on bus-based naming, see
[Device
Names](https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SCSI-2.4-HOWTO/dnames.html#FTN.AEN172)
and [Persistent block device naming -
ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming).)

In my view the easiest option for you would be to present your recovery
boot device to the kernel either

-   a) as a disk device, which is initialized **after** the internal
    hard disks, but still can serve as a boot device, or
-   b) as a non-disk device (like before).

It looks like QEMU has very limited boot options but may boot anyway
from secondary devices if the first hard disk is not bootable, so some
ideas:

-   Could you make QEMU present your recovery (RAWDISK) drive as an
    attached USB device via `-device usb-storage` (see [qemu usb storage
    emulation](https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/usb-storage.txt))?
-   Could you make QEMU present your recovery (RAWDISK) drive as a
    secondary (or tertiary or later) hard disk via
    `-drive file=FILENAME,index=2,media=disk`?
-   What is the reason that you cannot make QEMU attach an ISO image as
    a bootable optical drive via its command line options
    `-cdrom FILENAME.iso -boot order=d`?

I think the initial question in this issue how to
`say to rear "do your thing"`  
is answered so that I can close this issue.

current ReaR does its thing in this particular case
