I work with numerous customers who have implemented Linux on Power and
they would like a solution like REAR. I have found that REAR can be
executed on Power; however, currently it appears to not be possible to
generate an ISO that is bootable on Power. Are there any plans to
support Linux on Power? I could potentially help with this effort be
providing information on the specific files that would need to be
written to the ISO file to make it bootable on Power.

Thanks for your consideration

Improving the Power support would be great! The main problem with Power
is  
that nobody has a development system for it :-(

I may be able to get you access to a Power system for a while -- if I
can  
would this be something that we could work on? I believe that having
the  
Power support in your tool would be beneficial to Power users and you
would  
see a definite uptick on customer usage.

Thanks for your consideration

@earleye2014 we would be glad to accept pull requests for POWER PC. As
@schlomo already mentioned we do not have such Hardware in our
possession, so I'm not sure how we can help you?  
Perhaps you could raise the question on the mailing list? There must be
Power users among the members. If you have questions we can try to
answer these, or otherwise, consider a consultancy request.

PPC support is already included in rear -1.17. We can close this general
request for now.
