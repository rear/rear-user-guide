@silent-mobius  
what "menu item in rear recover iso" are you talking about  
and what is your goal behind why you would like to  
"give a specific title/name to a menu item"?

i am generating the recovery for various system at my company, i'd like
to have a name of image that i am trying to recover at the boot screen
when booting from recovery.iso

The ReaR recovery system bootloader is usually syslinux  
which is set up by the syslinux related functions  
in usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
therein in particular the make\_syslinux\_config function.

Those functions set the hostname in the recovery system boot menue  
e.g. in the make\_syslinux\_config function via (excerpt)

<pre>
syslinux_menu "label ^Recover $HOSTNAME"
</pre>

The default vaule of the HOSTNAME variable is set in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf via

<pre>
HOSTNAME="$( hostname -s 2>/dev/null || uname -n | cut -d. -f1 )"
</pre>

If that is not the right way to set this value in your case  
you can set it as you need in your etc/rear/local.conf  
where you can call any commands you like to set HOSTNAME  
because also config files are sourced/executed as bash scripts.  
Be careful because etc/rear/local.conf is also executed during "rear
recover"  
but the usual way how the hostname in the running recovery system is
set  
is during recovery system startupo via /etc/scripts/boot that is  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot  
and /etc/HOSTNAME in the recovery system is created  
during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" by  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/100\_hostname.sh

Or is perhaps the hostname not sufficient in your particular case?  
I assume that your various systems have different hostnames  
so that you could distinguish them by their hostnames.

so what would be the guidelines to add option for version control?

I do not understand how the ReaR recovery system boot menue entries  
could provide different ReaR recovery system versions because  
one particular ISO image is one single ReaR recovery system  
(the one that matches the one original system at the time when  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" was run there - the recovery system  
is specific for the one particular original system where it was made)  
and when you boot that particular ISO image there is no way  
to choose another ReaR recovery system.

In general there is no support for version control in ReaR  
and ReaR is not meant to provide version control support  
or any other ways to manage multiple backups or ISO images  
for various systems.

Cf. the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

To manage multiple backups or ISO images for various systems  
additional software is usually needed.  
You may have a look at tools that are intended to manage backups.  
In particular to manage ReaR for various systems have a look at  
the Disaster Recovery Linux Manager (DRLM), see  
[http://drlm.org/](http://drlm.org/)  
that reads in particular (excerpt):

<pre>
DRLM is an easy-to-use software to manage your growing
ReaR infrastructure. It ... offers all the tools you need to
efficiently manage your GNU/Linux disaster recovery backups.
</pre>

Some very limited things could be done in ReaR, like an added
timestamp  
but as a consequence runtime dependant file names cause drawbacks  
for "rear recover", see  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-July/003575.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-July/003575.html)  
and  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-June/003569.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-June/003569.html)

Perhaps also  
[http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-July/003576.html](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/pipermail/rear-users/2018-July/003576.html)  
and the links therein might be helpful here.

But all those are not about the ReaR recovery system boot menue entries.

I think this issue is sufficiently answered.
