-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High** (cannot log in via SSH on rescue system)

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

On Ubuntu 18.04 with OpenSSH 7.6, /etc/ssh/sshd\_config contains  
commented-out lines for 'PermitRootLogin' and other options. This fix  
makes sure that settings changed for ReaR will be real, not comments.

@gdha or any other @rear/contributors  
could you also have a look if this change is ok.

If there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow.

@OliverO2  
what about when there is no /etc/ssh/sshd\_config in the recovery
system?  
As far as I see the sshd config file gets copied into the recovery
system  
via different kind of `copy_as_is_ssh_files=( ... )` settings in  
usr/share/rear/rescue/default/500\_ssh.sh  
but - on first glance - I see nothing that verifies there is actually
a  
/etc/ssh/sshd\_config file in the recovery system.

In gereral COPY\_AS\_IS ignores non existent files and I think  
that behaviour is often used in ReaR by adding lots of stuff  
to COPY\_AS\_IS like

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" something something_else )

to get 'something' and/or 'something\_else' into the recovery system  
depending on what there is on the original system, e.g. with

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" QQQ )

"rear mkrescue" just works fine - `QQQ` is silently ignored  
unless one inspects the log file where one gets

    + source /root/rear.github.master/etc/rear/local.conf
    ...
    ++ COPY_AS_IS=("${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" QQQ)
    .
    .
    .
    + source /root/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/100_copy_as_is.sh
    ...
    ++ test -f 'tar: QQQ: Cannot stat: No such file or directory'

`usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/run-sshd` would fail altogether
if there is no `sshd`. And if there is an `sshd` we can safely assume
that `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` exists, as it is a required configuration
file. sshd [exits with an error
message](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/f02afa350afac1b2f2d1413259a27a4ba1e2ca24/servconf.c#L2208)
if the file cannot be opened.

So basically, run-sshd would fail one way or the other if the original
system did not provide a complete openssh installation.
