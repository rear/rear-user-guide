-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When booting via PXE environment for rear i get flodding console
messages and rear is not useable even it is running.  
The flodding message is (repeating forever):

    MEKADEV nvmem
    /run/udev or or .... Aborting MAKEDEV 

Flodding with message (looping forever):

`[   89.713053] NVRM: The NVIDIA probe routine was not called for 1 device(s).`

NB: I am trying to recover to original source system.

Any help is highly appreciated!

have you tried blacklisting the module causing these warnings using the
grub boot commandline, as in

`modprobe.blacklist=MODULE_NAME`

like

`modprobe.blacklist=nouveau`

complete output of the boot messages would be helpful, too.  
Not sure what the exact parameter name ist, the linux kernel command
line list shows:


            module_blacklist=  [KNL] Do not load a comma-separated list of
                            modules.  Useful for debugging problem modules.

@abbbi : Thank you for the hint!  
By using this stanza in `site.conf`
`KERNEL_CMDLINE="modprobe.blacklist=nouveau"` the flodding message is
gone,  
and the nvidia related modules are loaded (verified by ssh into rescue
system) - BUT: the screen turns black and i was unable to wake it up at
the end - strange! I will do some more investigations ASAP.

@rmueck  
regarding "the screen turns black":

Does this mean that booting works so far for you,  
so you see the bootloader menu correctly on your screen  
and you also see some initial kernel boot messages  
but then "the screen turns black"?

This could be an issue with false kernel command line  
settings for the 'console'.

Regarding no further messages on the console see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843)  
therein  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843\#issuecomment-1196337765](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843#issuecomment-1196337765)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843\#issuecomment-1196588256](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2843#issuecomment-1196588256)  
what usually helps when you do not have a serial console.

When you do not have a serial console  
but there are 'console' kernel command line settings  
(check the kernel command line in your bootloader menu)  
it usually helps to remove all 'console' settings  
from the kernel command line to get the kernel default  
behaviour which usually works best.

@rmueck  
regarding kernel video mode setting issues:

Sometimes it helps to specify the kernel command  
line option `nomodeset` to avoid kernel video mode  
setting issues.

In particular when using the ReaR recovery system  
the simple kernel framebuffer driver with some  
traditional VGA resolution should be sufficient.

Cf. starting at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3194\#issuecomment-2047646496](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3194#issuecomment-2047646496)  
and some subsequent comments.

@jsmeix  
Thanks for all this great tips! Finally the working solution is a
combination of `nomodeset` and `vga=7` (have not tried other resolutions
yet - i am sure they will work as well)  
And the combination with the tip of @abbbi regarding the
`KERNEL_CMDLINE="modprobe.blacklist=nouveau"`

I must say the rear community is great - thanks! Going to close the
issue.

@rmueck  
thank you for your prompt reply and in particular  
for your information what exactly made it work for you  
because that may later also help others.

@abbbi  
special thanks to you for your help here  
even at non-working times on Sunday afternoon!
