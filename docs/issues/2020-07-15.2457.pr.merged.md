-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In default.conf change `ISO_VOLID="RELAXRECOVER"` to

    ISO_VOLID="REAR-ISO"

so the first ISO has the label REAR-ISO (8 characters) and subsequent
ISOs  
get the labels REAR-ISO\_01 REAR-ISO\_02 ... respectively  
that have 11 characters which is the maximum length for FAT volume
names  
so things work by default when the ISO image is used  
to (manually) create a FAT bootable USB stick.

Using ISO\_VOLID="REAR-ISO" (e.g. instead of ISO\_VOLID="REAR\_ISO")  
because the REAR-... syntax matches better the ISO file name  
syntax rear-HOSTNAME.iso and also it matches better the other  
label syntax USB\_DEVICE\_FILESYSTEM\_LABEL='REAR-000'

I did this pull request because I think  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565\#issuecomment-342449263](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1565#issuecomment-342449263)

    In practice we cannot change such default settings
    because probably zillions of ReaR users use the default
    for their existing ISOs and if we changed the default
    their existing ISOs (that are labelled "RELAXRECOVER")
    would no longer match what there is expected/used in ReaR
    so that regressions happen for "probably zillions of ReaR users".

could not be an issue in actual real world.

Reasoning (off the top of my head - I did not test anything):

Existing ISOs that were made with `ISO_VOLID="RELAXRECOVER"`  
have that setting "inside the ISO" (i.e. inside the ReaR recovery
system)  
so "rear recover" still works with those old ISOs (regardless how old
they are).

New ISOs that will be made with `ISO_VOLID="REAR-ISO"`  
will have that setting "inside the ISO" (i.e. inside the ReaR recovery
system)  
so "rear recover" will work with the new default for those new ISOs.

If my reasoning is right we can change that default setting.  
If my reasoning is wrong this pull request must be rejected.

@rear/contributors  
I look forward to your feedback.

If it is possible to restore an old ISO backup with a recent version of
ReaR, to change the default value might break the restorin process.

Actually, the solution to the problem might not require any change to be
made.  
Since the best practice would require the user to create his own
configuration file, in my opinion, a simple warning within the main
configuration file might be enough, to guide the user to solve/avoid the
issue.

@MarcoS80  
according to my current understanding it is not possible  
"to restore an old ISO backup with a recent version of ReaR"  
because - cf. my above reasoning - an old ISO contains the matching  
old ReaR recovery system and when additionally the backup is included in
the ISO  
an old ISO contains the old ReaR recovery system plus the old backup  
and a new ISO contains the new ReaR recovery system plus the new
backup.  
You cannot mix up a new backup into an old ISO or vice versa.  
Cf. the `ISO_MAX_SIZE` explanation in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L688](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L688)  
that describes what gets stored on one or more ISOs.

I leave it open over the weekend and  
if no objections appear until Monday  
I would "just merge" it on Monday afternoon.

We are currently in early ReaR 2.7 development phase  
so we can try possibly incompatible changes and wait for user feedback  
and I could fix things if regressions are reported because of this
change.

In addition to ISO\_VOLID="REAR-ISO" matches better  
the ISO file name rear-HOSTNAME.iso and the other label REAR-000  
`REAR_ISO` could be confused with a variable name  
while `REAR-ISO` cannot be a variable name because  
'-' is not an allowed character in bash variables  
but '-' is allowed in FAT short filenames and volume names,  
cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume\_(computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(computing))  
that reads (excerpt)

    In the FAT filesystem, the volume label was
    traditionally restricted to 11 characters
    (reflecting the 8.3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3
    restrictions, but not divided into name and extension fields)

and
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3)  
that reads (excerpts)

    Legal characters for DOS filenames include the following:
        Upper case letters A–Z
        Numbers 0–9
        Space
        ! # $ % & ' ( ) - @ ^ _ ` { } ~
