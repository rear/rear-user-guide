I think I vaguely remember that we recently had  
such kind of issue here at ReaR upstream

    ERROR: Unsupported partition table 'unknown' on ... (must be one of 'msdos' 'gpt' 'gpt_sync_mbr' 'dasd')

...  
googling for `ERROR: Unsupported partition table 'unknown' on`  
found it:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2995](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2995)  
which is also on Ubuntu 24.04.X LTS  
that one is on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS and was  
reproduced with Ubuntu-Server 20.04.2 LTS, cf.

@gdha  
I don't know.  
I did not find time to investigate the details of those issues.

@u4ea75

FYI some generic boilerplate info:

In general I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code  
because the GitHub master code is the only place where we fix things  
and if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

See the "QUICK START GUIDE" and "INSTALLATION" parts on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear](https://github.com/rear/rear)

Additionally / alternatively see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how you can try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
without conflicts with your already installed ReaR version.

In general we at ReaR upstream do not support older ReaR versions.  
We at ReaR upstream do not plain reject issues with older ReaR
versions  
(e.g. we may answer easy to solve questions also for older ReaR
versions)  
but we do not spend much time on issues with older ReaR versions
because  
we do not (and cannot) fix issues in released ReaR versions.  
Issues in released ReaR versions are not fixed by us (by ReaR
upstream).  
Issues in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR
upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with  
reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got ReaR.

In particular regarding Ubuntu / Debian:

I am neither a Ubuntu user nor a Debian user.  
Currently we at ReaR upstream do not have  
an active maintainer for Ubuntu / Debian.  
So ReaR support for Ubuntu / Debian  
can be only as good as voluntary contributors  
who use those Linux distributions contribute  
which is much appreciated!

In particular regarding Ubuntu:  
It seems Canonical is not sufficiently interested in ReaR  
in contrast to Red Hat and SUSE who pay developers  
(like me from SUSE and e.g. @pcahyna and @lzaoral from Red Hat)  
to contribute to upstream ReaR because Red Hat and SUSE  
support ReaR in their enterprise Linux distributions.
