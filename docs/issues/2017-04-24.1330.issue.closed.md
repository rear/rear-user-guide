The suggested command to generate BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE can be wrong:

-   findmnt can output non-ascii glyphs to draw the tree lines in
    default output, while the command relies on the dash character ('-')
    to be used in those lines
-   some subvolume mount points can include the dash character (e.g.
    '/boot/grub2/x86\_64-efi' on SLES12SP1)

The commands are at:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf\#L59](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf#L59)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf\#L61](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf#L61)

Suggested alternative which worked for me:  
`findmnt -n -r -t btrfs | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | grep -v '^/$' | egrep -v 'snapshots|crash' | sed -e "s/$/\/*'/" -e "s/^/'/" | tr '\n' ' '`

Fixed.

@deacomm
