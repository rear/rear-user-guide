##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Tested in PowerVM environment, with RHEL7.4, with a disk Migration.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    RedHat use to add **no** prefix between multipath device name a
    partition number (ex:
    `/dev/mapper/mpatha1"). In that case, multipath option `user\_friendly\_name`is activated (which is RedHat default). When`user\_friendly\_name`is disabled, RedHat adds a **"p"** prefix between multipath device name (WWID in that case) and partition number. (ex:`/dev/mapper/3600507680c82004cf8000000000000d8p1\`).

I propose the following:

-   During the 1st replacement change, replace **ALL** known partition
    naming variant by ***REARX***.  
    (/dev/mapper/mpatha1, /dev/mapper/mpathap1,
    /dev/mapper/maptha-part1, /dev/mapper/maptha\_part1) will by
    \_REAR1\_1

-   During the 2nd replacement, check if the current system is a Redhat
    with "user\_friendly\_name" deactivated, recreate the partition
    device by adding "p" between device name and partition number.

=&gt; This will solve the issue when a user is using a RedHat with
"user\_friendly\_name" deactivated.  
And avoid a problem during a migration when a user wants to switch
"user\_friendly\_name" during the restoration phase.

@schabrolles  
recently I noticed a mail on an internal SUSE mailing list  
that reads (excerpts):

<pre>
> is there a way to enable multipath
> and have "friendly names enabled"...
> For example /dev/mapper/mpath0
...
If you are happy with the default user_friendly_names
("mpatha", "mpathb", etc), you can add...
/etc/multipath.conf

defaults {
    user_friendly_names yes
}

</pre>

so that also on SUSE systems there can be  
multipath device nodes with `user_friendly_names`.

Accordingly I think in the `(SUSE)` case  
the whole current code is also only valid  
`if is_false "$user_friendly_names" `

@jsmeix,

You are right, I just need to know how Suse will name the partition
device when user\_friendly\_names is set to true.  
`/dev/mapper/mapatha1` or `/dev/mapper/mpathap1` ... or something else
... :)

I asked on that internal SUSE mailing list.

If you like to merge your current changes soon,  
I think you can just do it and do the SUSE related enhancements  
later via a separated pull request.

As far as I noticed it is rather complicated to install a SUSE system  
with `user_friendly_names yes` so that - at least for now - we could  
probably safely assume that this case does not happen in practice  
on SUSE systems.

Perhaps to be safe against weird errors later at unexpected places in
the code a

<pre>
    (SUSE)
        if is_true "$user_friendly_names" ; then
            Error "Multipath with user_friendly_names is not supported on SUSE systems"
        fi
        ...
</pre>

might be added right now?

My question and the reply  
on that internal SUSE mailing list  
(full excerpt as far as it matters here):

AFAICS, the basic user_friendly_names scheme
has been stable since ~2008. The names
are "mpath$X", where $X is built up like
a SCSI device ID:
mpatha,...,mpathz,mpathaa,...,mpathaz,mpathba,...,mpathzz,mpathaaa,...

That said, the device name prefix ("mpath") is configurable
in multipath.conf ("alias_prefix", certainly a rarely used option,
but it exists). Names are looked up in /etc/multipath/bindings
and re-used between reboots.

Without user_friendly names, the device name is determined
by the WWID, which is udev property ID_SERIAL
for SCSI devices and ID_WWN for most other devices.

You can use `multipathd show maps format "%w %n"`
to find out the relationship between WWID (%w)
and name (%n) of multipath devices.

The rest of your question seems to relate
to *partition* naming.

Yes, _part$n has been replaced by -part$n in SLE12.
But there are compatibility links. This is determined
by the udev rules file "66-kpartx.rules".

Sorry I don't know either. Does it really matter still?

... will be like SLE12 (-part$n). The _part$n
compatibility links aren't present any more.

It seems they aren't shipping 66-kpartx.rules.
They are using the kernel default naming scheme,
which is "p$N" for parent devices ending with a digit,
and just "$n" for parent devices ending in a non-digit.
That's horrible, in particular if you don't
use user_friendly_names.

The rules don't distinguish whether or not
user_friendly_names is in use.
The rule which does the job is:

RUN+="/sbin/kpartx -u -p -part /dev/$name"

kpartx constructs the name of the partition device
from the name of the parent device
using the value of the "-p" option:

/dev/mapper/foo => /dev/mapper/foo-part1

Btw,
for the device-mapper *UUID*,
the part$n is not appended but prepended:

mpath-3600a098000aad73f00000a3f5a275dc8
=> part1-mpath-3600a098000aad73f00000a3f5a275dc8
 
Unlike the name, this is hard-coded and not configurable.

@jsmeix thanks to you and your team in suse for that useful
information.  
That also confirms my experiments:  
**Suse**:

-   &lt;12 : always `<device>_part<part_num>` (same with/without
    `user_friendly_names`)
-   &gt;=12 : always `<device>-part<part_num>` (same with/without
    `user_friendly_names`)  
    Question still open for sles10 ...

**RedHat**:

-   &lt;7 : always `<device>p<part_num>` (same with/without
    `user_friendly_names`)
-   &gt;=7 : if `user_friendly_names` (default) `<device><part_num>`
    else `<device>p<part_num>`

**Debian**:

-   if `user_firendly_names` (default) `<device>-part<part_num>`
-   if NOT `user_firendly_names` `<device>p<part_num>`

So checking `user_firendly_names` make sense only for Fedora & Debian
based system.

@schabrolles  
don't worry about SLES10 because  
since ReaR 1.17 we had dropped officially support for SLES10,  
see the doc/rear-release-notes.txt diff in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/86009877e7ae15d768d9eb3b6d0e660118dfdf42](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/86009877e7ae15d768d9eb3b6d0e660118dfdf42)

What I do regarding SLES10 support in ReaR is that  
I do not knowingly break existing SLES10 support  
but I do not check if each change keeps SLES10 support  
i.e. my changes may unknowingly break existing SLES10 support.

@schabrolles  
could you edit your above

and make it clear what about the cases when `Suse = 12` and
`Fedora = 7`  
by using less-than-or-equal or greater-than-or-equal signs because  
your

is a good general summary - or even better:  
Could you add that summary as comment directly in the code  
so that others who may have to adapt and enhance that code  
at any later time get a better understanding about the various  
multipath device naming schemes.

@gdha  
could you do your review here?  
( or a comment that you blindly trust @schabrolles )
