@rear/contributors

A (rather artificial) example  
how ReaR would source user-controlled files by accident, cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260#issuecomment-2219790045>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260#issuecomment-2219801028>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3258#issuecomment-2180230626>

    In particular I do not know what could be possible
    for "git clone" things done by whatever user and
    stored under arbitrary directories and then
    "just run" that via 'sudo' or something like that.

    On the one hand I think it is not ReaR's task
    to protect 'root' against any foolish things.

    But because ReaR is meant to be run as 'root'
    I think we must implement some reasonable protection
    to avoid at least too obviously bad things
    which can be easily avoided.

When I wrote that I had in particular Ubuntu users in mind  
where I fear some may carelessly "sudo COMMAND" all the time.

Right now I did:

    johannes@localhost:~> git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
    Cloning into 'rear'...
    ...

    johannes@localhost:~> mv rear rear.github.master

    johannes@localhost:~> cd rear.github.master

    johannes@localhost:~> vi etc/rear/local.conf
    ...

    johannes@localhost:~/rear.github.master> su
    Password: ...

    localhost:/home/johannes/rear.github.master # usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

"rear mkrescue" just worked with user-controlled files  
because all ReaR scripts and etc/rear/local.conf  
belong to "johannes users".

You could have - if you were interested - tried that  
on your own to reproduce and experience it yourself.

Of course now you may tell me that this case  
is root's own responsibility and his own fault  
to do 'su' carelessly and run user-controlled stuff  
but (again and again) you miss my point.

My point is not that this example shows  
how root could fool itself.

My point is that this example proves that  
there is absolutely noting in ReaR that checks  
at runtime if what ReaR executes is trustworthy.

Again and again - but unfortunately it seems  
you do not yet pay sufficient attention to what law  
(at least German law as far as I understand what it means)  
mandates from each of us personally - my fundamental  
reson behind all that is what I described in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1498627825>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2967#issuecomment-1510856524>

It is left to the reader as an exercise to find more examples  
(perhaps even actual threats that can be exploited right now)  
where ReaR "just executes" files from non-trusted users.

For comparison with my SourceTrustworthy implementation from  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3258>

    johannes@localhost:~/rear.github.master> git checkout jsmeix-SourceTrustworthy
    ...
    Switched to a new branch 'jsmeix-SourceTrustworthy'

    johannes@localhost:~/rear.github.master> su
    Password: ...

    localhost:/home/johannes/rear.github.master # usr/sbin/rear mkrescue
    Refused 'SourceTrustworthy /home/johannes/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-i386.conf' because file owner 'johannes' is not in TRUSTED_FILE_OWNERS
    ERROR: 
    ====================
    BUG in usr/sbin/rear line 749:
    Failed to Source /home/johannes/rear.github.master/usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-i386.conf
    ...
    Terminated

Of course verly likely my current SourceTrustworthy  
implementation is not yet a final ultimate solution  
but (hopefully) it could be at least one step forward  
into the right direction compared to endless high-level  
theoretical questions that I can never answer properly  
so that all decays and dies out in nowhere land  
since a few month (I think decay started in April)

I'd like to clearly take the problem of "security of developer
environment" out of scope for this topic. I'd assume that developers
only run `sudo ./usr/sbin/rear mkrescue` on test systems.

I'd also like to take all means of deploying ReaR from source out of
scope, meaning the problem of users using `git clone` to get ReaR and
then running it. Or downloading an archive of ReaR from GitHub and
running `sudo ./usr/sbin/rear mkrescue`.

For me the scope is a production system where ReaR was installed via
package (including the packages we provide on our GitHub releases page).
And on this production system and a subsequently used recovery system we
can think about potential attack vectors that ReaR can be part of.

@schlomo !!!

Please follow our instructions that we tell our users:

No excuses!

Yes, this is a quick start and not a production deployment. I'm happy to
add there that for production deployments people should use packages.
Quick start is for a first user to quickly see something happening,
nothing more.

Possibly we have some kind of "all-clear" signal for ReaR:

I think meanwhile I found sufficient evidence  
which shows that "all other software" behaves  
basically same as ReaR currently does.  
Details will follow later because currently  
things are under investigation via a SUSE internal  
bug report that I filed.

So (at least for now) I downgrade this issue  
on from "blocker" to "enhancement"  
but still with "critical / security / legal" scope.

@schlomo  
I would change that "quick start" guide  
to do all as 'root' and explicitly describe that  
the local "git clone" must be under root's control  
to avoid to cross a privilege boundary  
from 'root' who runs usr/sbin/rear to a non-root user  
by sourcing ReaR's bash scripts when those scripts  
were downloaded under control of a non-root user.

Regarding  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259#issuecomment-2220492231>

It does not really matter if a security issue exists  
"for a first user to quickly see something happening"  
or in a "production deployment".  
Both "first user" environments and production environments  
should be reasonably secure.

Those 'sudo ...' commands in our quick start guides  
indicate it is in particular meant for Ubuntu users  
what they could do on their (home) systems.  
I think we should provide in particular those users  
(who are presumably often rather unexperienced)  
some reasonably secure quick start guide.

All found cases where ReaR sources files  
were checked via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260>  
and its subsequent issues  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285>  
and  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319>  
so this issue itself is no longer "critical/security/legal"  
according to what I wrote in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260#issuecomment-2355205283>  
and I also move the milestone of this issue to 'ReaR v3.1'

I would like to unblock the issue by proposing a viable path forward.

The issue does not have a high priority for me  
(cf. "downgrade this issue on from "blocker" to "enhancement" "  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3259#issuecomment-2227955337> )  
but it would still be good to have an idea how to progress.

My starting point is the observation
`that "all other software" behaves basically same as ReaR currently does`.  
(Another starting point is abandoning the "same-author policy"  
idea from  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260#issuecomment-2220864142>,  
as there is has been no follow-up to explain it.)

So, other software executes potentially untrusted code all the time.

The shell executes commands that it finds in essentially arbitrary
directories.

The Python interpreter loads modules again from essentially arbitrary
directories.

The dynamic linker (ELF binary interpreter) loads shared libraries from
essentially arbitrary directories and so on.

How are security issues prevented in these systems?

It is not by using any "same-author policy"  
(no software I know about is doing that),  
it is by controlling the set of directories  
that the code can be loaded from.

The shell uses `$PATH`,  
the Python interpreter `sys.path`,  
the dynamic linker uses its defaults and the directories configured in
`/etc/ld.so.conf` and so on.

If any of these sets contain a world-writable directory,  
the security impact is disastrous and it is a job  
of the distribution and of the system administrator  
to ensure that this is not the case.  
(`.` got removed from the shell `$PATH`  
to prevent one of such issues.)

Moreover, if higher security is required,  
there are usually mechanisms to restrict the set of directories  
and prevent altering it.

For the shell, it is the restricted mode  
(see "The Restricted Shell" in the Bash manual, especially:

> the following are disallowed or not performed:  
> • Setting or unsetting the values of the ‘SHELL’, **‘PATH’**,  
> ‘HISTFILE’, ‘ENV’, or ‘BASH\_ENV’ variables.  
> • Specifying command names containing slashes.  
> • Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument  
> to the ‘.’ builtin command.

).

For the dynamic linker it is the "Secure-execution mode",  
see the **Secure-execution mode** section  
of the `ld-linux.so(8)` manual page.

Basically, this is the observation at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3260#issuecomment-2219801028>

> Currently the only "line of defense" is the file name.  
> E.g. /etc/os-release is hopefully safe to be read.

and my point is that this has been actually pretty sufficient  
in other software, so why not do the same in ReaR.

So, my proposal is:

Let `SourceTrustworthy` (or whatever the safe `source` wrapper  
function would be named) check the name of the file to be sourced  
and have a list of allowed directories to source from.

Furthermore, I believe that there should be  
multiple `source` wrappers for different use cases.

In particular, one for the shell-style config files (#3203)  
that should contain no executable code,  
and another for internal ReaR scripts that are called  
as part of the ReaR's shell scripting framework.

These are two very different use cases and it makes sense  
to keep them separated (for the former we may use  
a restricted shell, this makes no sense for the latter).

For the former the set of allowed directories should be  
system directories like `/etc`, `/lib` and `/usr`,  
while for the latter it should contain `$SHARE_DIR`.

There may also be a third command to source ReaR's config files,  
as this falls into neither category, with yet another set of  
trusted directories (`$CONFIG_DIR`).

Perhaps there could be even a generic `source` wrapper  
for sourcing scripts that are not part of ReaR,  
but do not fall under the "shell-style config files" category.

Such details can be added or adjusted according to the needs.

@didacog can you please specify what is the "sourcing remote files"

the same umbrella.

With <https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424> merged  
this issue should be "fixed/solved/done"  
at least to some reasonable initial extent.

With <https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3424> merged  
there will be regressions when third-party scripts  
use '.' for sourcing because currently sourcing via '.'  
is always forbidden in ReaR.

I would like to wait a bit and see if sourcing via '.'  
is sometimes actually needed in practice.  
If sourcing via '.' is sometimes needed,  
I will further enhance things to make sourcing via '.'  
again possible for the user by explicitly specifying  
in another config array which specific file paths  
he allows to be sourced via '.' by ReaR.

I could not wait because this regression is a bug in ReaR  
because 'source' is not POSIX compliant because  
'.' is the POSIX standard command  
so ReaR must not forbid using '.' in any case  
but allow it when really needed  
so I implemented trusted sourcing via '.' in  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3434>
