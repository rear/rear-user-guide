-   Type: **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Unknown**  
    It is unknown how many user will file issues  
    because 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' is indispensable for them  
    (i.e. they have no alternative to it).

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3148](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3148)

-   How was this pull request tested?

Works well for me.  
I don't have a gpt\_sync\_mbr test VM so for the test I changed  
in layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh

    if test "gpt_sync_mbr" = "$parted_mklabel" ; then

to

    if test "gpt" = "$parted_mklabel" ; then

to trigger it artificially with normal 'gpt'.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
ErrorIfDeprecated when 'gpt\_sync\_mbr' is used.

I used layout/save/default/950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
and not layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh  
because in 950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh  
there is only one place with 'gpt\_sync\_mbr'  
while in 200\_partition\_layout.sh it appears more than once  
and 950\_verify\_disklayout\_file.sh runs after disklayout.conf  
was created so we check the actual final result there.

is needed for my multi-line reason message here

    ErrorIfDeprecated gpt_sync_mbr "The 'gpt_sync_mbr' partitioning is no longer supported by SUSE since 2016
                                    see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3148"

that avoids a too long line for the whole reason  
which could be needlessly hard to read, perhaps even with  
the issue URL "out of sight" beyond the right screen border.

@rear/contributors  
unless there are objections I would like
