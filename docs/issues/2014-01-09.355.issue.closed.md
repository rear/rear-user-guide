I have Suse 11 running on a VM. I have installed rear-1.15-5. I have
made necessary changes to /etc/rear/local.conf

    cat local.conf
    # Create ReaR rescue media as ISO image
    OUTPUT=ISO

I noticed the following
`rmdir: failed to remove /tmp/rear.u2dPrxc7SDXdCnY/outputfs: Device or resource busy`  
Does your `root` user have the necessary privileges on
`10.45.209.30:/var/opt/ignite/recovery/archives/globiz101` ?  
Small advise, I would not mix HP-UX ignite archives with Linux rear
archives.

we have installed rear with similar configuration on other suse Host.
They perfectly work there. We see this NFS mount error on few of them. I
have given complete permission to NFS mount from Unix host.

What i see from the logs is, the NFS was mounted at first. Rear is
trying to remount it and then getting failed

perhaps run `rear -dD mkrecsue` to see more messages (incl. all code
output). If the output is too big make a gist entry and paste the link.
There must be an umount command failing somehow.

The rear logs is too big to paste here or in GIST. Please help me with a
FTP location or your Email, wherein i can send the logs.

Thank you

In your debug logging found the following lines explaining why the mount
operation was executed twice:

    2014-01-10 08:37:07.319612769 Including output/NETFS/default/10_mount_NETFS_path.sh
    2014-01-10 08:37:07.366684479 Including output/default/10_mount_output_path.sh

However, the current rear version should *not* have a NETFS
sub-directory under output/ anymore:

    [gdha@fedora20 ~]$ find /usr/share/rear -name 10_mount_output_path.sh
    /usr/share/rear/output/default/10_mount_output_path.sh
    [gdha@fedora20 ~]$ sudo rear -s mkbackup | grep mount
    Source layout/save/default/34_generate_mountpoint_device.sh
    Source output/default/10_mount_output_path.sh
    Source output/ISO/Linux-i386/20_mount_efibootimg.sh
    Source output/ISO/Linux-i386/70_umount_efibootimg.sh
    Source output/default/98_umount_output_dir.sh
    [gdha@fedora20 ~]$ cd /usr/share/rear/output/
    [gdha@fedora20 output]$ ls
    default  DP  ISO  NSR  OBDR  PXE  RAMDISK  RSYNC  TSM  USB

Did you ever upgraded `rear`? If yes, then the NETFS sub-dir is probably
a left-over from an older release.  
To fix it, `rpm -e rear` and re-install it I would say.

Thanks a lot. Removing rear worked here after deleting the directory
/usr/share/rear.

I installed a fresh version, rear backup is successfull.

Hi, I am trying to configure BACKUP\_URL=file:///localDirectorypath/../
for some firewalled servers. After running /usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup
sucessfully with this configuration, I copied the rear folder that got
generated with ISO and backup to a jumphost with nfs share. Now, at time
of recovery, when I have booted the server is ISO image, how should I
point the backup\_url to new location of backup and ISO, assuming
server's localDirectory path is already destroyed.

GM I am new to gethub and i am having a similar issue.  
The issue I am facing is that I am trying to mount an NFS share from an
AIX system to use this as my backup storage location.

ReaR works fine if I go to a Red Hat Linux system.

The issue appears to be with NFS 4 vs NFS 3 for AIX.

Is there a command line option or a file I need to change to tell ReaR
to use NFS3 not 4.

I did find this posting in Red Hat site  
mount.nfs: Remote I/O error  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/61602](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/61602)

When I try the mount bu hand it mounts fine.  
mount -o vers=3 server\_ip\_addr:dir local\_mount\_point

The errors in the ReaR log show it to be trying to use NFS4

Any help on how to make this work with NFS3 would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your time.

Sorry I just realized this is an old posting.  
I am still learning ho to use this site. My apologies for opening an old
case.
