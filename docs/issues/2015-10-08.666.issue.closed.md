@gdha, @schlomo

When a Linux distribution adapts a rear version to match special needs
of that specific distribution, what does rear upstream recommend as RPM
package version extension that the Linux distribution should use for its
adapted rear packages?

Assume the Linux distribution's package is based on rear 1.17.2 (i.e. it
is rear 1.17.2 with some patches from the Linux distribution).

Then the Linux distribution's RPM package versions could be something
like

<pre>
rear-1.17.2.1  rear-1.17.2.2  rear-1.17.2.3  ...
rear-1.17.2.a  rear-1.17.2.b  rear-1.17.2.c  ...
</pre>

or something else?

Reasoning and background information:

Currently I am working on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/556)
("Implement support for recovery when what is mounted at '/' is a btrfs
snapshot subvolume"). Right now I have some kind of "proof of concept"
patched into rear 1.17.2 to make it work specifically for the default
btrfs structure in SLE12-SP1. Because my current implementation is
basically a SLE12-SP1 specific hack, I do not yet want to submit that to
rear upstream. First I will provide my hack only to SLE12-SP1 users both
to SLE12-SP1 customers via a SUSE package and also publicly to SLE12-SP1
users via an openSUSE package from OBS (project "Archiving" package
"rear"). Afterwards as a second step (ideally after sufficient SLE12-SP1
users feedback) I will try to implement it in a generic way that is
inteded to work on all Linux distributions. The latter one will be of
course submitted to rear upstream (via GitHub pull request).

Interestingly the issue number of this numbering issue is "the number of
the beast" - hopefully this is not a bad omen...

For now I use

<pre>
rear-1.17.2.a  rear-1.17.2.b  rear-1.17.2.c  ...
</pre>

because a letter extension makes the difference more obvious than just
one more number.

Furthermore I assume that rear upstream will not use letters but instead
e.g. rear-1.17.2.1 for a sub-release of rear 1.17.2.

In such a case I could use rear-1.17.2.1.a for a SUSE-specific patched
package that is based on rear-1.17.2.1.

Finally the current extension 'a' would even correctly indicate that my
current patch is in "alpha" state and a subsequent extension 'b' matches
perfectly "beta" - only for 'c' I do not yet know a good meaning.

@jsmeix We have no intention to go further then *major.minor.subnr*
schedule. So, indeed a *letter* would make a distinction between
upstream and vendor sub-release.

@gdha many thanks for your prompt reply!

I had meant that a letter makes a distinction between upstream and
vendor sub-release even if rear upstream decided at some time to go
further then major.minor.subnr.

Right now I made my current SLE12-SP1 specific implementation public
available in the openSUSE Build Service development project "Archiving"
package "rear".

If you like to have a look what I changed and what needs to be set in
/etc/rear/local.conf for recovery of SLES12-SP1 with default btrfs
structure, see SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch and SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf at
