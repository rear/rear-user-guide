    anymore

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

If an error is not found in log, return 0. Not finding an error is good,
so don't return 1 from the
output/ISO/Linux-i386/850\_check\_for\_errors.sh script.

Avoids the message  
`Source function: 'source /usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/850_check_for_errors.sh' returns 1`  
in the log.

@pcahyna  
feel free to disable the script for now  
with an unconditioned `return` at its beginning  
plus a comment that points to this issue here  
so we could later when we actually fix it  
still understand the reasoning.

@jsmeix @pcahyna I would not remove the script yet as it proofs its
functionality in real production environments. Some RedHat customers
crawl the rear logs for this error and without a proper (replacing)
check in place yet we leave them in the cold for the time being.
