When trying to create a USB-Stick it fails because of the command
vol\_id in:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/20\_check\_usb\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/20_check_usb_layout.sh)  
(line 39)

blkid -o udev should work. Here is my /etc/rear/local.conf config:

    # sample local configuration

    ### write the rescue initramfs to USB and update the USB bootloader
    OUTPUT=USB

    ### create a backup using the internal NETFS method, using 'tar'
    BACKUP=NETFS

    ### write both rescue image and backup to the device labeled REAR-000
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1/REAR-000

As usual with bug-reports, we expect an exact version of Ubuntu and
Relax-and-Recover together with all possible relevant information.

yep I can confirm that the patch works. The mistake I made when trying
blkid was typing "yes" instead of "Yes". That is why "Abort USB format

@thumm Thanks for looking into this. However what we probably need to do
is ressurect `rear_vol_id` from the grave. We put it to rest back when
there was no longer a need to use `vol_id` (thanks to the new layout
code). So I was a bit surprised that there was still a need for `vol_id`
(and the related kludges it brings in).

You can find the removal of `rear_vol_id` here:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8bcb4ba05d0efd04c947a0dc193f2ef77f74b171](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/8bcb4ba05d0efd04c947a0dc193f2ef77f74b171)

If you search the issues/commits for `vol_id` and `rear_vol_id`, you can
get a feeling of what the context of these changes was. If there is a
way to get rid of `vol_id` altogether (maybe using the layout-code) that
would be even better...

@dagwieers Do you really want to (re-) use <code>rear\_vol\_id</code>?
The format-workflow is the last one using vol\_id (that's what
<code>grep -nri "vol\_id" .</code> says) and would only need a very
small part of <code>rear\_vol\_id</code>: given a device -&gt; does this
device already has a ext\* or btr filesystem.

In the layout functions <code>mount</code> is used to determine the
filesystem of a device. I would prefer a solution which uses the same
approach, e. g. something like this

I wouldn't just mount, because that changes the filesystem, rather use
readonly-mounting is better.

That said, I am not convinced. It seems quite costly to do this, and
there is a risk that a mount (attempt) gives problems we would otherwise
not see. I wonder how exactly udev/vol\_id do this. I expect they scan
the filesystem header, rather than mounting. That's why I prefer that
approach. The only reason why `rear_vol_id` is such a kludge is because
it has a lot of backward compatibility built in.

I love to hear what others think.

Ok, the preferred solution is to use `file` on, the block device. This
is lightweight. So something like this should do:

    file_output=$(file -sbL "$device")
    case "$file_output" in
        (*ext2 filesystem*)
            filesystem=ext2
            ;;
        (*ext3 filesystem*)
            filesystem=ext3
            ;;
        (*ext4 filesystem*)
            filesystem=ext4
            ;;
        ### FIXME: Also test for btrfs
        (*)
            Error "Unsupported filesystem found on device $device ($file_output)"
            ;;

Is this acceptable ? Can you modify the patch in this way ?

Hm, a miracle has happened between <code>mount</code> and
<code>file</code> :-)

Yes, I can modify the patch, but I would like to unterstand the
difference between using <code>file</code> and <code>mount</code>. Why
is <code>file</code> more lightweight?

With `file` you simply read a few blocks (in my tests it is the first
262k) of the disk, with `mount` you do much more:

-   register the mount to the kernel
-   verify filesystem metadata
-   open the filesystem
-   update filesystem metadata

and you require to `umount` it, which undoes the above again. Besides
`mount` and `umount` can fail in considerably more ways than `file` can,
although it probably knows more about filesystems itself. One advantage
for file is that you don't need the kernel modules in order to make it
work. One disadvantage may be that the magic files may not support new
