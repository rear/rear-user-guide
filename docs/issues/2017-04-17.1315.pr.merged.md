Creating a set of rules based on OS type (RedHat, Suse) to set the
suffix used between multipath disk name and partition number:

-   RHEL &lt; 7 =&gt; p
-   RHEL &gt;= 7 =&gt; ""
-   SUSE &lt; 12 =&gt; \_part
-   SUSE &gt; 12 =&gt; -part

Can easily be updated with other Linux distro

@schabrolles See also \#1302 - is this covered as well?

@gdha \#1302 is currently not covered by this pull request.  
I only cover the specificities of device in `/dev/mapper`

I had a look to \#1302, I think it should be ok as eMMC or NVMe are not
multipathed.

@schabrolles As no-one objects we approve this pull request. Thank you
for your nice contribution that I wanted to do 4 years ago, but the
sponsor dropped off and so did I.
