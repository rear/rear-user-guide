##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

A restore of a SLES12SP3 system was done with this version of the TSM
restore script with the parallel mode set to true.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

<!-- -->

-   Add a new parameter to differentiatie between normal (OLD) serial
    behaviour and parallel mode. Default is serial behaviour
-   make the TSM restore of a filesystem a function and call it either
    serial of in parallel

Extra actions done before the restore worked on sles12sp3:

-   copy /usr/lib64/libsnapper.so\* to rescue image after boot from it
-   copy /usr/lib64/libboost.so\* to rescue image after boot from it
-   copy /usr/lib64/libbtrfs.so\* to rescue image after boot from it
-   copy /usr/lib64/libstdc++\* to rescue image after boot from it
-   set LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH before `rear recover` to:

<!-- -->

    /usr/lib/usr/lib64:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/cit/bin

A few things as remark and/or comments:

-   these libraries were automatically copied to the rescue image,
    right?
-   could you verify script
    `/usr/share/rear/prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh` as it defines
    `TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$gsk_dir`
-   perhaps you could write this variable to the
    `$ROOTFS_DIR//etc/rear/rescue.conf` file in above mentioned prep
    script:

<!-- -->

    echo "TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$gsk_dir\"" >> $ROOTFS_DIR//etc/rear/rescue.conf

-   give it a try and if it works add it to the PR as we are not able to
    test the PR due to lack of HW

@schabrolles  
could you please review this one because neither I nor @gdha  
have TSM so that we cannot actually review it.

@cookie33  
I do not have TSM but out of curiosity  
I wonder how the messages look on the terminal  
while several `dsmc restore` processes are running in parallel.  
Does that look somewhat confusing or perhaps even messed up?

I think each `dsmc restore` process needs its own  
separated `backup_restore_log_file` because otherwise  
the error handling does no longer work correctly.

@jsmeix, Iâ€™m currently in vacation till the end of the month. I will try
to do my best in october, but will be busy with client on-site requests.

@schabrolles  
take your time (this is an enhancement for "ReaR future")  
and thank you in advance!

I am also not in the office currently and for some more weeks  
so that I cannot do much for ReaR.  
In particular I cannot try out or test anything for ReaR.  
I expect to be back in the office at about beginning of October.  
I also expect that I have to do first and foremost other stuff with
higher priority.

@cookie33 @schabrolles  
I am wondering about another possible generic issue with parallel
restores.

In the section "Running Multiple Backups and Restores in Parallel" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)  
I wrote in particular (excerpt a bit modified here)

    system recovery with multiple backups requires that
    first and foremost the basic system is recovered
    where all files must be restored that are needed
    to ... [get] ... the basic system into a normal usable state

One reason is that in particular the tree of directories  
of the basic system must have been restored as a precondition  
that subsequent backup restore operations can succeed.

The concern is that subsequent backup restore operations may fail  
or restore incorrectly when basic system directories are not yet there.

For example assume the files in `/opt/mystuff/` are in a separated
backup.  
When the files of the basic system (in this example the `/opt/`
directory)  
are restored in parallel with the separated backup of `/opt/mystuff/`  
it may happen that the files in `/opt/mystuff/` are restored before  
the `/opt/` directory was restored.

The concern is that it is not clear what the final result is in that
case.

Perhaps it fails to restore the files in `/opt/mystuff/` when `/opt/` is
not yet there?

Perhaps it does not fail to restore the files in `/opt/mystuff/` when
`/opt/` is not yet there  
but it creates the missing `/opt/` directory with fallback
owner/group/permissions/ACLs/...  
that may differ from what `/op/` had on the original system?

So the concern with multiple backup restores in parallel is  
how to ensure that the final overall backup restore result  
always matches exactly what there was on the original system.

@cookie33 the feedback?
