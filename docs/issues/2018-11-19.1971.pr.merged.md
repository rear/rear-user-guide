##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): N/A

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    By running `rear mkrescue` on Arch Linux.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

On current Arch (rolling release), SSL certificates are symlinked from
/etc/ssl/certs to /etc/ca-certificates/extracted/cadir.  
This is causing ReaR to complaint about broken symlinks when running
`rear mkrescue/mkbackup`:

    Broken symlink './etc/ssl/certs/QuoVadis_Root_CA_1_G3.pem' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target
    Broken symlink './etc/ssl/certs/1e09d511.0' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target
    Broken symlink './etc/ssl/certs/Staat_der_Nederlanden_Root_CA_-_G2.pem' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target
    ...

Could SSL certificates be in any way private data (i.e. secrets)?

By default the ReaR recovery system must not contain any  
private data or secrets from the original system.

If something in the /etc/ca-certificates/ directory could be  
private data or secrets, an unconditioned

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" '/etc/ca-certificates/*' )
</pre>

is not possible, cf.

By design, CA certificates should go there which are public in nature.

If there are not further objections, I'll merge this PR later today.

@schlomo, @jsmeix thanks for your enlighting on nullglob topic!

I think since this was merged I get (excerpts):

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
...
Testing that the recovery system in /tmp/rear.9hOdTOx8wpnxtEb/rootfs contains a usable system
Failed to copy symlink target '/var/lib/ca-certificates/pem'
Creating recovery/rescue system initramfs/initrd initrd.cgz with gzip default compression
</pre>

investigating...

The above `Failed to copy symlink target` happens in  
build/default/985\_fix\_broken\_links.sh

At least the ordering of the scripts at this area is wrong:

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -s mkrescue
...
Source build/default/970_add_rear_release.sh
Source build/default/980_verify_rootfs.sh
Source build/default/985_fix_broken_links.sh
Source build/default/990_update_os_conf.sh
Source build/default/995_md5sums_rootfs.sh
</pre>

It should be (do the verification at the end):

<pre>
usr/share/rear/build/default/970_add_rear_release.sh
usr/share/rear/build/default/975_update_os_conf.sh
usr/share/rear/build/default/985_fix_broken_links.sh
usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh
usr/share/rear/build/default/995_md5sums_rootfs.sh
</pre>

Since the change of this pull request /etc/ssl/certs  
has become a broken symlink in the recovery system

<pre>
# chroot /tmp/rear.eQshuna9VErWIid/rootfs find . -xdev -path ./proc -prune -o -path ./sys -prune -o -path ./dev -prune -o -xtype l -print
./etc/localtime
./etc/ssl/certs
./etc/mtab
./etc/termcap

# file /tmp/rear.eQshuna9VErWIid/rootfs/etc/ssl/certs
/tmp/rear.eQshuna9VErWIid/rootfs/etc/ssl/certs: symbolic link to /var/lib/ca-certificates/pem

# ls /tmp/rear.eQshuna9VErWIid/rootfs/var/lib/ca-certificates/pem
ls: cannot access '/tmp/rear.eQshuna9VErWIid/rootfs/var/lib/ca-certificates/pem': No such file or directory
</pre>

When I revert the change of this pull request etc/ssl/certs  
is not reported as broken symlink in the recovery system:

<pre>
# chroot /tmp/rear.9w3htbY8andZlEO/rootfs find . -xdev -path ./proc -prune -o -path ./sys -prune -o -path ./dev -prune -o -xtype l -print
./etc/localtime
./etc/mtab
./etc/termcap

# file /tmp/rear.9w3htbY8andZlEO/rootfs/etc/ssl/certs
/tmp/rear.9w3htbY8andZlEO/rootfs/etc/ssl/certs: directory
</pre>

where that /tmp/rear.9w3htbY8andZlEO/rootfs/etc/ssl/certs directory  
contains all the files from /var/lib/ca-certificates/pem on the original
system.

Accordingly since this was merged there is the regression  
that the recovery system does no longer contain the files  
from /var/lib/ca-certificates/pem on the original system.

With

<pre>
COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" '/etc/ssl/certs/*' '/etc/pki/*' '/usr/lib/ssl/*' '/usr/share/ca-certificates/*' '/etc/ca-certificates/*' )
</pre>

it works for me again.

I will now just blindly hack that into
usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
to get this regression out of sight for now...

I leave it to others who (hopefully) better than I understand the
subtle  
differences to explain the reason behind that regression and could  
perhaps even provide a proper fix later...

There are too many things in ReaR that work in too subtle ways...

The reason why `/etc/ssl/certs/*` works  
but `/etc/ssl/certs` fails is described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2405\#issuecomment-633573036](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2405#issuecomment-633573036)

Our ugly code places re-appear again and again until someone  
hopefully may finally get sufficiently angry to actually fix them ;-)
