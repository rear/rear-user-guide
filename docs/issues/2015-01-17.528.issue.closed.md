Able to take an OS backup with rear/TSM . When trying to recover there
are two issues we have discovered .

1.  If we do an Automatic restore , it restores OS + NON-OS related OS .

2.  If we select Manual Restore , we are able to restore OS image and OS
    based file systems only , but it it does not create
    directories/mountpoints for other NON-OS based filesystems.

To be able to give some support on this issue I need script debug log
sessions (option -D) with *manual recover*. E.g. `rear -v -D recover`

To debug the *auto recover* you probably need to edit the file
`./usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup` and add `-D`
after the line `rear recover -v` (on the production system and remake
the ISO image to have this active).

I have a somewhat simple fix for both of these issues that I will commit
and submit a pull request for.

As you can see, I created a pull request with my modification. There
might be a better way to determine included and excluded filesystems
from the rescue image but that is what seemed most logical to me. I
tested it on RHEL6 and TSM version 6. I don't think there would be any
OS specific catches but that is what I had available to test.
