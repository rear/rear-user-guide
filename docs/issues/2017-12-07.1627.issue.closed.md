#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2 and 2.2-5

-   OS version (lsb\_release -a):  
    LSB Version:
    :base-4.0-amd64:base-4.0-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch  
    Distributor ID: CloudLinuxServer  
    Description: CloudLinux Server release 6.9 (Igor Volk)

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    [local.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1539327/local.conf.txt)

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? Legacy SeaBIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    We have made rear backup on live hardware server with "rear -v
    mkbackup".  
    After that, we restored it on other server in KVM environment.  
    After restoration, the new server did not boot.  
    It seems, that device UUIDs changed after booting, but not changed
    in configuration files.

[disklayout.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1539332/disklayout.conf.txt)

-   Work-around, if any: Replace UUIDs for all local disks in files
    /mnt/local/etc/fstab and /mnt/local/boot/grub/grub.conf to mount
    points in format /dev/vda3, /dev/vda1 etc.

@VitalySolntsev  
I wonder why you think the UUIDs should change?

What normally has a UUID is only filesystems.

Normally there is no such thing as a "drive UUID"  
except exceptional cases.

The filesystem UUID is set via mkfs commands  
usually via the -U option.

During "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" the filesystem UUIDs  
are saved in var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

During "rear recover" the filesystems (and swap) get  
recreated with their saved UUIDs e.g. via command like

<pre>
mkfs -t ... -U $old_uuid /dev/sda2
mkswap -U $old_uuid /dev/sda1
</pre>

Accordingly when filesystems are referenced by UUID in  
config files no adaptions should be needed in those files.

From your screenshot in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1627\#issue-280177064](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1627#issue-280177064)  
it is not clear to me why the kernel panic  
is caused by wrong UUIDs.

In general regarding  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover"  
you may have a look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I.e. run "rear -d -D recover" and inspect the log file  
what exactly happens regarding UUIDs in your case  
and/or if something else looks suspicious that could  
also let the kernel fail to run init.

Is this not related to

At least for now I set the "not ReaR" label to this issue  
until there is evidence that the root cause is in ReaR.

It seems like in disklayout.conf  
[disklayout.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568968/disklayout.conf.txt)  
UUIDs the same as in source system  
[fstab-from\_source.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568969/fstab-from_source.txt)  
UUIDs setted correctly by tune2fs on target system  
![blkid-target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5821444/34120786-7de52980-e42f-11e7-804e-2b8af63e4c65.png)

However, in l/etc/fstab and grub.com other UUIDs  
[fstab.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568978/fstab.txt)  
[grub.conf.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568979/grub.conf.txt)

Of course, with other UUIDs the system will not boot (it doesn\`t matter
with 3.1 or 2.6 kernel)  
Why are other UUIDs used?  
Which part in detailed log should I look for?

@VitalySolntsev  
off the top of my head I cannot explain  
why in your case the recreated fstab  
(i.e. /mnt/local/etc/fstab in the recovery system after "rear
recover")  
seems to be different compared to /etc/fstab on the original system.

For me on SLES12 both are identical:  
Original system:

<pre>
f48:~/rear.master # md5sum /etc/fstab
58d7d80046c13ad8159adbdf502fcfcb  /etc/fstab
</pre>

On replacement hardware in the recovery system after "rear recover":

<pre>
RESCUE f48:~ # md5sum /mnt/local/etc/fstab
58d7d80046c13ad8159adbdf502fcfcb  /mnt/local/etc/fstab
</pre>

I see in your fstab files comments like

<pre>
# HEADER: This file was autogenerated at ...
# HEADER: by puppet ...
...
# Created by anaconda on ...
</pre>

with different dates in those comments  
in your fstab on your original system  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568969/fstab-from\_source.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568969/fstab-from_source.txt)  
compared to your other fstab  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568978/fstab.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1568978/fstab.txt)

I think this indicates that your other fstab is not the one  
from your original system (because ReaR scripts won't  
change the dates in those comments) but your other fstab  
might be perhaps an outdated one in your backup?

You get all what there is in your backup restored  
during "rear recover", cf. the comment about  
BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY in default.conf  
but it won't help to move away the restored fstab  
because then you don't have any fstab (it is not recreated  
from scratch by ReaR - the fstab is only adapted if needed).

I use neither puppet nor anaconda so that I cannot help  
with such tools.  
My blind guess is that perhaps those tools might somehow  
interfere here?

The scripts in ReaR may modify files like fstab  
and grub.conf at the end of "rear recover" are the  
scripts of the 'finalize' stage, i.e. the scripts in  
usr/share/rear/finalize

You may check in your "rear -D recover" log file  
what the 'finalize' scripts do in your particular case.

Run "rear -s recover" to see what scripts are run  
in your particular case.

I close this issue because as far as I can imagine  
the root cause is (with probability one) not in ReaR.  
Of course the issue can be reopened when there is  
some evidence that the root cause is acually in ReaR.
