@rmetrich  
thank you so much for your fix!

Ony as a side note a question FYI:

As far as I see we have now the same code

        cat >> "$LAYOUT_CODE" <<EOF
    # Make sure device nodes are visible (eg. in RHEL4)
    my_udevtrigger
    my_udevsettle

    # Clean up transient partitions and resize shrinked ones
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones

in three scripts:

    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh
    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/120_include_raid_code.sh
    layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/210_load_multipath.sh

in each one directly after the `create_partitions` call.

I am wondering if that code could be moved  
into the `create_partitions` function at its end, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281\#issuecomment-558081653](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2281#issuecomment-558081653)  
(excerpt)

    @rmetrich
    when my assumption is right
    that delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones
    must be called after any create_partitions call
    then it is perhaps best to add the
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones call
    into the create_partitions function to ensure that
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones
    is always called at the end of each create_partitions call?

Or what is the reason why code like

        cat >> "$LAYOUT_CODE" <<EOF
    # Make sure device nodes are visible (eg. in RHEL4)
    my_udevtrigger
    my_udevsettle

    # Clean up transient partitions and resize shrinked ones
    delete_dummy_partitions_and_resize_real_ones

    #
    # End of code handling disk or software RAID or multipath device '$disk'
    #
    EOF

cannot be added at the end of the `create_partitions` function  
in layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
?

Perhaps the reason is obvious but I still do not see it.

The idea behind create\_partitions is to create partitions, but we want
to let the admin create additional ones if he needs to. Hence the code
being split.  
Now, regarding having twice the same code, this could indeed be
consolidated, but probably harder to read and detect errors, since
create\_disk function would now have different parameters passed to it
depending on if we are multipath, a disk, or a softraid ...

@pcahyna we may need this.
