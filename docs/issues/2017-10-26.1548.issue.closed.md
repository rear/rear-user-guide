This is a follow-up of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1547](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1547)

Current ReaR master code:

Summary:  
Calling "rear mkbackuponly" with

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
OUTPUT_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL="iso:///mybackup"
</pre>

"succeeds" (i.e. exits with exit code 0) like

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackuponly

</pre>

but no ISO is made or stored in var/lib/rear/output/  
or saved at the OUTPUT\_URL.

Because of the reasoning in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545)  
and in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1547](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1547)  
only "rear mkbackup" makes sense when  
the backup is configured to be in the ISO so that the  
mkbackuponly workflow must be forbidden for things like

<pre>
BACKUP_URL="iso:///mybackup"
</pre>

With

this issue should be fixed.
