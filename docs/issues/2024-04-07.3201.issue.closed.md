-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

rear runs to completion. Expected backup files are created. But error
messages are reported as follows:

-   Workaround, if any:

rear seems to work, but I am concerned whether the error messages from
umount are something to worry about

Does `/var/tmp/rear.h64Kn9vXbQZsRIa/outputfs` remain mounted after ReaR
exits? If so, is there any process using it?
(`fuser -m /var/tmp/rear.h64Kn9vXbQZsRIa/outputfs` should display it.)

@hspindel Perhaps it was a small network hiccup resulting in a stale NFS
situation? It is not harmful, just annoying as you need to manual
unmount the temporary ReaR mount point.

Okay, thank you. Good to know it's not harmful.
