Hi,

I took a rear backup of a physical server running RHEL5.4. I have to
recover it on a different physical server with different hostname and
IP. Could you please let me know how to do it.

Thanks and Regards,

Did you try to recover the replacement server? It should "just work" :-)

After the recovery, before rebooting, you will have to go to /mnt/local
and adjust the hostname and IP address in the configuration files.

Hi Schlomo,

Thanks for your comments. I will update the hostname and IP in the
configuration files as mentioned before rebooting.

Regards,
