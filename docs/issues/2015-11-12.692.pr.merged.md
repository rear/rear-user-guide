After a successful recovery, during boot, warnings like

    WARNING: Bad format on line 10 of /etc/fstab

are printed. The reason is,
`usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/16_rename_diskbyid.sh` adds extra
space on every fstab line, including also the empty ones. The `fsck`
called at boot time reports the above warning for every such line.

The patch attempts to address this (in a rather expensive way).  
In the addition, a bug regarding exclusion of device-mapper devices from
renaming is addressed.
