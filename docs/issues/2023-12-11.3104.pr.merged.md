-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1571)  
    and

    i.e. false BUG Error in  
    output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh  
    because of unsupported OUTPUT\_URL for OUTPUT=USB

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Not tested.  
    Those code changes should not cause any issue.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In output/USB/Linux-i386/850\_make\_USB\_bootable.sh replaced the

    BugError "Filesystem where the booting related files are on $RAW_USB_DEVICE could not be found"

with more explanatory LogPrintError plus Error what the actual reason
is,  
similar as in the related  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3102](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3102)  
because in most cases it is not a bug in ReaR  
but an error (e.g. a user configuration error for OUTPUT=USB).

For documentation here a copy of  
a comment from @pcahyna directly at the code changes  
which got lost because I changed that code lines via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5d86ec547e03fc8fa7d635b46f642682662004da](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5d86ec547e03fc8fa7d635b46f642682662004da)

    Error "Unsupported filesystem $usb_filesystem for the booting related files on $RAW_USB_DEVICE"

    This part is a bit misleading.
    The purpose of the code is to determine the
    filesystem on `$RAW_USB_DEVICE`.
    But the code does not use `RAW_USB_DEVICE` at all
    except in messages and comments.
    It uses `$BUILD_DIR/outputfs` instead.
    So, it may well happen that `$RAW_USB_DEVICE` is ext3-formatted,
    but there is a XFS filesystem mounted at `$BUILD_DIR/outputfs`
    (because of some `OUTPUT_URL` confusion that makes `RAW_USB_DEVICE`
     out of sync with `OUTPUT_URL`).
    In that case, the user, when seeing the error message,
    will check the filesystem on `$RAW_USB_DEVICE`
    and will see that it is ext3, and will wonder
    what is ReaR complaining about.

Here also copies of my replies for completeness:

    My idea was to show both $BUILD_DIR/outputfs and $RAW_USB_DEVICE
    because $BUILD_DIR/outputfs is a meaningless directory like

    /var/tmp/rear.Bhlh9JjUxW91R0i/outputfs

    so $RAW_USB_DEVICE provides some context to the user
    that this two messages are about his USB device.

    I will show both $BUILD_DIR/outputfs and $RAW_USB_DEVICE

    I will not fix here the possible OUTPUT_URL confusion
    that makes RAW_USB_DEVICE out of sync with OUTPUT_URL
    because that belongs to a separated overhaul task
    of our whole OUTPUT=USB code.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5d86ec547e03fc8fa7d635b46f642682662004da](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/5d86ec547e03fc8fa7d635b46f642682662004da)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/87ff78560da4852eabffffa6c0d6be49e0de3e7f](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/87ff78560da4852eabffffa6c0d6be49e0de3e7f)  
the user may now get error messages like

    Could not find a filesystem in /proc/mounts for /var/tmp/rear.Bhlh9JjUxW91R0i/outputfs
    ERROR: An ext2/3/4 or vfat filesystem must be mounted for the booting related files on /dev/sdb

or

    Only ext2/3/4 and vfat are supported for the booting related files on /dev/sdb
    ERROR: Unsupported filesystem xfs is mounted at /var/tmp/rear.Bhlh9JjUxW91R0i/outputfs

Of course this is still not perfect  
but at least the user can now see that he should check  
/var/tmp/rear.Bhlh9JjUxW91R0i/outputfs and /dev/sdb  
so he may hopefully see what does not match in his case.

@pcahyna  
provided things are OK for you with my latest commits  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon

I am looking at the CI error with centos-stream-8-x86\_64 . It is of
course not related to the change, but still is something that would be
good to debug. As console log in the Testing Farm infrastructure is now
enabled, we can look at the console output:
[https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/a24b1484-7fc1-4e2a-8077-e72f9eea6cca/work-backup-and-restorefmaugnmx/console-68975dbe-0cbe-49ae-aa05-47d8fec8b66f.log](https://artifacts.dev.testing-farm.io/a24b1484-7fc1-4e2a-8077-e72f9eea6cca/work-backup-and-restorefmaugnmx/console-68975dbe-0cbe-49ae-aa05-47d8fec8b66f.log)
. It show this error:

    Running workflow recover within the ReaR rescue/recovery system
    Running PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT 'mkdir /tmp/mnt; mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /tmp/mnt/; modprobe brd rd_nr=1 rd_size=2097152; dd if=/tmp/mnt//var/lib/rear/output/rear-ip-172-31-16-70.iso of=/dev/ram0; umount /tmp/mnt/;'
    /etc/scripts/system-setup: line 255:   545 Killed                  rear $rear_options recover

    'rear recover' failed with exit code 137
    1) View Relax-and-Recover log file(s)
    2) Login at the rescue system

It does not tell us what happened, but it at least shows where. I
suspect that the fact that we don't see what happened is due to the
kernel not printing its log messages, which is due to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/b1e9f5e1cbc735ed90526ff7fa54b922fcfa60e7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot\#L4](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/b1e9f5e1cbc735ed90526ff7fa54b922fcfa60e7/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/boot#L4)  
that was added 92d3a15be54137ae0f00f550c5e9e58d68142617 with the commit
message `Added dmesg -n1 to rescue system` without explaining why.  
Having kernel log messages on the console would be helpful for debugging
filesystem-related errors like \#2777 (see \#3058 for explanation : when
mount fails, the mount commands display only the unhelpful message
`wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on ..., missing codepage or helper program, or other error`,
and the real cause of the error like
`XFS (...): logbuf size must be greater than or equal to log stripe size`
is printed by the kernel to the message log).

Anyway, since the error happens when loading the ISO into a ramdisk (the
whole ISO gets loaded into a ramdisk in this test procedure), I suspect
that we are out of memory at this point. The failed test shows

    Memory: 2052384K/3503836K available

and a successful test ( CentOS-Stream-9 ) shows

    Memory: 2931284K/3942236K available

so indeed, successful test seems to have run on a machine with more
memory than the failed test.

@pcahyna  
thank you for your review!  
As always it notably improved things.

FYI:  
Intentionally I have '$BUILD\_DIR/outputfs'  
last in those messages because that is a  
meaningless and longish technical term like  
'/var/tmp/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/outputfs'  
so having such stuff at the end helps to make  
those messages easier to read and comprehend.
