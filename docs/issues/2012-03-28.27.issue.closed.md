Original report
---------------

On a Centos 6.2 system with no LVM or raid, the EPEL-installed
rear-1.12.0-1.el6.noarch, rear mkbackup with NETFS generates an empty
tar backup, a commented out (but othewise correct)
/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf, and an empty
/var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device file.

Could you upload the file under /var/lib/layout/ files?  
What did the backup.tar.gz actually contain?

We are waiting for feedback from the original reporter in order to get
this ball rolling again...

@gdha: Is there a possibility to get in contact with the reporter using
private email ?
