##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

ReaR works in configurations not using syslinux, so `Depends` is too
strong. Additionally, not using syslinux is not unusual per se, so
`Recommends` would still be too strong. Per Debian Policy [7.2. Binary
Dependencies](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#binary-dependencies-depends-recommends-suggests-enhances-pre-depends),
`Suggests` would be the right level here.

@gdha  
because I know absolutely nothing about Debian packaging  
I dare to assign it to you (I just hope you may know a bit about it).

@jsmeix The changed proposal makes sense. It's fine to merge it.

Thanks to all of you again, too!

BTW: I promised to check everything on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, which includes
the changes in networking (DNS). So bear with me, there's more to come.
I did not expect to open Pandora's Box aka. Btrfs setup, though. ;-)
