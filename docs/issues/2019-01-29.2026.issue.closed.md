     # rear contains only bash scripts plus documentation so that on first glance it could be "BuildArch: noarch"
     # but actually it is not "noarch" because it only works on those architectures that are explicitly supported.

**Question for SuSe**: could you verify if the same rules apply to SLES
these days?

Removing the `BuildRoot` tag would violate  
the "openSUSE:Specfile guidelines" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile\_guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines)  
that read (excerpts):

    BuildRoot: should always be used, even if newer versions
    of RPM override it anyway. The preferred path is
    %{_tmppath}/%{name}-%{version}-build.

cf.

I think we need to maintain several separated RPM spec files  
as needed for different Linux distributions, for example  
rename packaging/rpm/ into packaging/fedora/ and add  
a packaging/suse/ so that we can have different RPM spec files  
for Fedora and SUSE based Linux distributions,

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1908](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1908)
that is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2819c071681a19fc3382aa84bfaf1654508a64aa](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2819c071681a19fc3382aa84bfaf1654508a64aa)  
both the disabled BuildRoot and the disabled defattr  
need to be reenabled to make it build again on SLES11 RHEL 5 CentOS 5
