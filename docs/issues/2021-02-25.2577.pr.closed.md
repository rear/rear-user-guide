With """, in the expected arg for rsync:  
`--rsync-path="""rsync_ --fake-super"""`, the arg will remove all """,
thus the --fake-super will not be executed on the remote server.  
And the ownerships will not be saved and restored.

A workaround is to add  
`BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" -M--fake-super )`

in /etc/rear/local.conf

Thanks

By the way  
in prep/RSYNC/default/150\_check\_rsync\_protocol\_version.sh

    if [ ${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]/--fake-super/} != ${BACKUP_RSUNC_OPTIONS[@]} ]; then

that was added via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3548430302cef3a8445de970eb763da33d9f6e8e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3548430302cef3a8445de970eb763da33d9f6e8e)  
that condition would be always true because `${BACKUP_RSUNC_OPTIONS[@]}`
is empty  
because BACKUP\_RSYNC\_OPTIONS is not BACKUP\_RSUNC\_OPTIONS (typo!)
:-(  
but actually that condition is always false because its syntax is simply
plain wrong:

    # unset BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS

    # BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS=( foo bar )

    # if [ ${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]/--fake-super/} != ${BACKUP_RSUNC_OPTIONS[@]} ]; then echo Y ; fi
    bash: [: bar: binary operator expected

    # BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( '--rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"' )

    # if [ ${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]/--fake-super/} != ${BACKUP_RSUNC_OPTIONS[@]} ]; then echo Y ; fi
    bash: [: too many arguments

What a shitty piece of shitty code shit - cf.  
[https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)  
("Yes, this is f\*\* satire ...")

I think

    if [ "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[*]/--fake-super/}" != "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[*]}" ];

could work.  
But I will have to have a closer look at that code.  
But only as time permits - no promises - in particular not for such
awful code :-(

@gdha  
I am totally confused about the rsync implementation in ReaR.  
I never used ReaR with rsync.

I noticed we have two scripts  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh  
which seem to do the same  
and I fail to understand how rsync is meant to work in ReaR.

Could you perhaps help me to understand how rsync is meant to work in
ReaR?

@jsmeix

-   if `BACKUP=NETFS` and `BACKUP_PROG=rsync` then you will use
    `usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh` to make a
    backup archive with the rsync (over ssh only) executable
-   if `BACKUP=RSYNC` (then `BACKUP_PROG=rsync` is always defined) and
    then you will use
    `usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500_make_rsync_backup.sh` (in
    this case you can use rsync over ssh or use the remote rsync daemon
    approach - see man page of rsync for the details)
-   I use most of the times the RSYNC backup method (as you can browse
    easily though your directories/files on the remote server)

@bwelterl  
I guess the root cause in your particular case is something rather
specific  
in your particular environment (perhaps something with bash in
RHEL8.2?)  
so I would recommend to report this issue to Red Hat so that they  
could have a look what the actual root cause is.

I don't like to experiment with this or that changes  
of the RSYNC code in ReaR that I never touched before  
unless we better understand what the actual root cause is  
so that we could fix things properly.

Hello Johannes,

Thanks for the test. In fact, with
`--rsync-path="""rsync --fake-super"""`  
there is not error, but you don't have the expected result that is  
to have ownerships and permissions added in xattr of remote files.  
You are using root as rsync user, please try with another user.

With `--rsync-path="""rsync --fake-super"""` the command become

    '--rsync-path=rsync --fake-super'

it should be

    --rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"

to have the expected result.

Thank you !

Benoit

@pcahyna @rmetrich  
could you please have a look here (as time permits)?

It seems something behaves special (and fails) for @bwelterl with
RHEL8.2  
which I cannot reproduce - neither with SLES15 directly with ReaR  
nor with openSUSE Leap 15.2 on the command line.

At least for today I give up lost in quotation hell.

My failed cases:

(1)

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --rsync-path="""rsync --fake-super""" )

results the rsync command option (with single quotes as shown here):

    rsync ... '--rsync-path=rsync --fake-super' ...

which doesn't result ownerships and permissions added in xattr of remote
files

(2)

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( '--rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"' )

results the rsync command option (with single quotes and double quotes
as shown here):

    rsync ... '--rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"' ...

which results an error like:

    bash: rsync --fake-super: command not found
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(235) [sender=3.1.3]

(3)

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --rsync-path=\"rsync --fake-super\" )

results the rsync command option (with single quotes and double quotes
as shown here):

    rsync ... '--rsync-path="rsync' '--fake-super"' ...

which results an error like:

    rsync: --fake-super": unknown option
    rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1593) [client=3.1.3]

(4)

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --rsync-path='rsync --fake-super' )

results the rsync command option (with single quotes as shown here):

    rsync ... '--rsync-path=rsync --fake-super' ...

i.e. same as case (1) above

(5)

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --rsync-path=\'rsync --fake-super\' )

results the rsync command option (with single quotes as shown here):

    rsync ... '--rsync-path='\''rsync' '--fake-super'\''' ...

which results an error as in case (3) above like:

    rsync: --fake-super': unknown option
    rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1593) [client=3.1.3]

Tomorrow I will try (basically a blind desperate attempt) something like

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( $( echo '--rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"' ) )

in the hope that then bash might somehow do its quoting automatically
right...

Thanks @jsmeix

But no luck: with

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( $( echo '--rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"' ) )

Same error:

    ++ rsync --sparse --archive --hard-links --numeric-ids --stats '--rsync-path="rsync' '--fake-super"' --relative --one-file-system --delete --exclude-from=/tmp/rear.Yb9Ly9BUsdSOKsw/tmp/backup-exclude.txt --delete-excluded / /boot/efi /boot user1@192.168.122.220:/home/user1/rear//localhost/backup
    rsync: --fake-super": unknown option
    rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1578) [client=3.1.3]

I think the easiest way to enable this feature is to use:

    -M, --remote-option=OPTION  send OPTION to the remote side only

as it's included in recent rsync version

Thanks

@bwelterl  
thank you for testing it.

Perhaps I have to give up and use the alternative option setting  
via something like

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --rsync-path=rsync -M--fake-super )

But I like to understand and solve the generic issue that it seems  
somehow it is not possible to specify an option of the form

    --long-option="some words as value"

via a variable or via an array (element) to a command.

Next Monday I will experiment with the various ways  
how an array can get evaluated in bash i.e. things like

    COMMAND ${ARRAY_OF_OPTIONS[*]}

    COMMAND ${ARRAY_OF_OPTIONS[@]}

    COMMAND "${ARRAY_OF_OPTIONS[@]}"

Perhaps the root cause is not how the array is created  
but how the array is evaluated at the COMMAND call  
which is in this case here

    $BACKUP_PROG "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}"

in usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh\#L27](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500_make_rsync_backup.sh#L27)

It seems I can get things working with

    eval $BACKUP_PROG "${BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS[@]}" ...

in usr/share/rear/backup/RSYNC/default/500\_make\_rsync\_backup.sh  
but currently I cannot foresee if that additional `eval` might have
unwanted side-effects.

In general I don't like `eval` because it makes things behave more
complicated,  
cf.
[https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/048](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/048)  
and RFC 1925 items 6 and 6a (excerpts)

    (6) It is easier to move a problem around ... than it is to solve it.
    (6a) It is always possible to add another level of indirection.

So I would prefer plain and simple

    BACKUP_RSYNC_OPTIONS+=( --rsync-path=rsync -M--fake-super )

provided `-M` is supported by sufficiently recent rsync i.e. by those
rsync versions  
that are included in the Linux distributions that are supported by
current ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L2513](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L2513)

    ReaR-2.6 is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

      o Fedora 29, 30, 31, and 32
      o RHEL 6, 7, and 8
      o CentOS 6, 7, and 8
      o Scientific Linux 6 and 7

Regarding what rsync versions that are included in the Linux
distributions  
hat are supported by current ReaR support `-M` / `--remote-option`:

[https://serverfault.com/questions/119846/rsync-and-fake-super-how-to-preserve-attributes](https://serverfault.com/questions/119846/rsync-and-fake-super-how-to-preserve-attributes)  
reads (excerpts)

    Note that at least as of rsync 3.1.2 (but probably already earlier versions)
    there is a --remote-option parameter which might generally be preferable.
    There is also the shortcut "-M" for it. So instead of
    --rsync-path="rsync --fake-super"
    one could also have written
    -M--fake-super

    I can confirm that --remote-option aka -M is also in rsync 3.1.1

    --remote-option/-M is not available in rsync 3.0.9 on CentOS 7

But CentOS 6 and 7 are supported by current ReaR.

--remote-option/-M is not available in rsync-3.0.4 on SLES11  
and SLES11 is no longer supported since ReaR 2.6  
but SLES11 was supported up to ReaR 2.5 cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md)

--remote-option/-M is available in rsync 3.1.3 on SLES12 and SLES15

@gdha @bwelterl  
I fully agree that proceeding with `-M--fake-super` and  
dropping official support for old distributions in upcoming ReaR 2.7  
is much better compared to not proceed and keep things as broken as is.

In particular users of old distributions should already have set up  
their disaster recovery procedures as they need it with current ReaR  
so users of old distributions should not need to upgrade to ReaR 2.7,  
cf. "Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" in

Even if users of old distributions need to upgrade to ReaR 2.7  
only those users who use BACKUP=RSYNC could be affected  
and then they could manually adapt the ReaR scripts as needed  
to make things work for their specific cases,

@jsmeix @bwelterl sorry for the delay. Looking at the issue now.

The issue can't be reproduced on 2.6, as I explained in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2577\#discussion\_r631997526](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2577#discussion_r631997526)
. Please close.  
(Not that the rsync code is entirely correct: it does not restore
extended attributes: so before restore you have

    $ getfattr -d -m- /usr/bin/ping
    getfattr: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
    # file: usr/bin/ping
    security.capability=0sAAAAAgAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
    security.selinux="system_u:object_r:ping_exec_t:s0"

while after restore just

    getfattr -d -m- /usr/bin/ping
    getfattr: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
    # file: usr/bin/ping
    security.selinux="system_u:object_r:ping_exec_t:s0"

so the system will be a bit broken in different ways. But that's a
separate issue. The problem reported here would be also easier to detect
if rsync errors during restore were reported, but that's a separate
issue as well, \#2612 .)

Since the problem discussed here was how to recognize properly quoted
arguments from improperly quoted arguments, here is a trick I have been
using. In `ps` you will not see the difference between
`rsync --rsync-path=rsync --fake-super` and
`rsync "--rsync-path=rsync --fake-super"` (the quotes are not part of
the arguments themselves and they should not be, the shell removes
them), but you can determine it using procfs, where the individual ARGV
entries are separated by zeros. So:  
rear 2.6 (fixed) has this

    # tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/19605/cmdline
    rsync
    --sparse
    --archive
    --hard-links
    --numeric-ids
    --stats
    --rsync-path=rsync --fake-super
    --relative
    --one-file-system
    --delete
    --exclude-from=/tmp/rear.fCuNUO7ZP85C4Tg/tmp/backup-exclude.txt
    --delete-excluded
    /
    ...

while 2.4 (buggy) has this:

    # tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/17970/cmdline
    rsync
    --sparse
    --archive
    --hard-links
    --numeric-ids
    --stats
    --rsync-path=rsync
    --fake-super
    --relative
    --one-file-system
    --delete
    --exclude-from=/tmp/rear.b2Dz5Dj4S9qNHf7/tmp/backup-exclude.txt
    --delete-excluded
    /
    ...

It works for me. How did you check? Does your target filesystem support
user extended attributes?

The only thing unclear is why was @jsmeix able to reproduce the problem
with (presumably) the current development version (was it really the
current version, or something older that is shipped with SLES15?), which
should have the problem fixed (and I was not able to reproduce it
anymore).

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for your deep analysis  
and your comprehensive explanations  
that help so much to understand things!

My "doesn't result ownerships and permissions added in xattr of remote
files"  
is only from what @bwelterl told about
`'--rsync-path=rsync --fake-super'`  
(as fas as I understood it - perhaps I misunderstood it).  
I did not verify if that was actually true or false.

Unfortunately it is too long ago so I don't remember what I exactly did
to "reproduce" it.  
Usually I use GitHub master code because that is the only place where we
fix things.  
I think I vaguely remember that with "I can reproduce" I had only meant
how the  
'rsync' command is shown by `set -x` in the 'rear -D mkrescue' debug log
file.  
So I guess my "I can reproduce" was false alarm because I failed to  
recognize properly quoted arguments from improperly quoted arguments  
that you described so well in your

That's a misunderstanding. I believe that
`ARRAY=( "${ARRAY[@]}" appended elements )` should be fail-safe. But the
code that you have replaced with `+=` lacked the quotes, that was the
problem.  
`+=` is fail-safe in the sense of "trottelfest" (fool-safe) because it
can be hard to remember to use quotes consistently, while with `+=` the
intention is obvious and one doesn't have to worry about such nasty
details.

For the record, if you look at the backup created using --fake-super on
the backup server, it looks quite weird and you will quickly recognize
it. Even symlinks become normal files and the information that they are
intended to be symlinks is recorded in the extended attribute.

On
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
I reverted that `ARRAY+=( appended elements )` is the *only* way  
so now it is again only the recommended way.
