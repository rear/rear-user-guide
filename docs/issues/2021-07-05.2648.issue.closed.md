-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / 2020-06-17

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):  
    Ubuntu 20.04.2, kernel 5.4.0-77-generic

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):  
    apu

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):  
    coreboot

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    I did start to dig a bit deeper in output usb mode and found more
    then one bug with this method. To reduce effort of tracking I think
    a summary ticket does make sense. So this ticket is meant to provide
    this summary.

The only output=usb settings working fine for me are:

-   UEFI + GPT (if uefi is supported by the system)

General improvements possible for output=usb:

-   add grub bootloader option
-   reuse output=rawdisk code (when grub is not used this may make
    sense)
-   reuse output=iso code (grub can boot from iso)
-   to me it is not clear what should be done by format and what by
    mkrescue but I would consider moving the bootloader writing to
    format command
-   hybrid gpt/mbr could be used if wanted
-   hybrid efi/legacy could be used if wanted

bugs with the current version:

-   in case of EFI it always creates a gpt partition - msdos is just not
    handled (300\_format\_usb\_disk.sh:34)
-   gpt partitions are not created correctly when **NO** EFI is used.  
    \*\* the bootloader must be within a gpt partition with type *ef02
    BIOS boot partition* (this partition must have *bios\_grub* flag
    set)  
    \*\* it would make perfect sense to create a separate boot partition
    containing the system image (like it is done for efi)
-   the flag "legacy\_boot" must be configurable since some systems may
    want it and some don't like it (from my understanding it is normally
    not used but if it is used then for the /boot partition)
-   the extlinux/syslinux boot config is not correct for my APU board
    with coreboot. Not sure what is wrong there but since output=rawdisk
    creates a working one it must be something there. (no matter if
    msdos or gpt is used) \#2644

We had already  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764)  
`Switch to grub2 (grub-mkrescue) for creating the recovery ISO image`  
but noone contributed the needed code to ReaR  
so it got closed because of `no-issue-activity`.

@pcahyna  
if time permits could you have a look here  
and provide some general comment?  
Thank you in advance!

at least some of the issues mentioned here should be (hopefully) fixed.

I can neither test coreboot nor serial console  
because I do not have matching hardware  
but I will test how far OUTPUT=USB works for me  
on my older x86\_64 laptop with traditional BIOS.

It still works for me with my setup as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2659\#issuecomment-886692737](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2659#issuecomment-886692737)  
and now even booting the existing system from the built-in local
harddisk  
works via the GRUB2 menu entry `Boot next disk`  
because now the created boot/grub2/grub.cfg contains

    menuentry "Boot next disk" {
        insmod chain
        set root=(hd1)
        chainloader +1
    }

I think the function create\_grub2\_cfg() is still somewhat messy  
because my created boot/grub2/grub.cfg contains

    search --no-floppy --file /boot/efiboot.img --set
    search --no-floppy --set=root --label MY-BOOT

I think it does not make sense to have several GRUB2 `search` commands  
at the same place (I guess only the last one matters in this case)  
in contrast to having several GRUB2 `search` commands  
each one in its own separated `menuentry` as in  
the "Multi-boot manual config" section of the "GNU GRUB Manual"  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html\#Multi\_002dboot-manual-config](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#Multi_002dboot-manual-config)

I think I have to clean up our various methods how to set up  
the GRUB environment variable `root` via different variables  
`grub2_set_root` and `GRUB2_SET_USB_ROOT` for the same thing  
plus a hardcoded `search --no-floppy --file /boot/efiboot.img --set`

To give an update on the current state from my point of view:  
All bugs and shot commings should be fixed now. Maybe there is still one
left around the serial configuration.

There are still some improvements possible without any priority to me:

-   reuse output=iso code and optionally store a iso in the boot
    partition instead of the initrd (grub can boot from iso)
-   hybrid gpt/mbr could be used (see gdisk)
-   hybrid efi/legacy could be used

I will re-test master as soon as possible what may be next week.  
Thank you very much for your help with those changes

>     * grub can boot from iso

I am interested how to do it - the only procedure I found is to let Grub
use the kernel and initrd contained in the ISO ( like
[http://www.panticz.de/MultiBootUSB](http://www.panticz.de/MultiBootUSB)
) but not to chainload the bootloader found on the ISO.

@pcahyna  
thank you that you joined here because I need your GRUB2 knowledge:

Could you tell whether or not my assumption in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648\#issuecomment-887383494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648#issuecomment-887383494)  
is true - i.e. whether or not it makes sense to have more than one  
`search` command in the general section (i.e. outside of a
`menuentry`)  
in grub.cfg?

Could you also have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662)  
there in particulat at my `FIXME:` comment  
in usr/share/rear/lib/bootloader-functions.sh  
about whether or not `--set=esp` makes sense?

My goal behind adding GRUB2 support for OUTPUT=USB is  
that ReaR uses only GRUB2 as recovery system bootloader  
so that we can drop using syslinux

@jsmeix sorry that I haven't replied earlier. I suppose your question is
whether the second `search` will overwrite the result of the first
`search` so the first one becomes useless? I don't know the answer
off-hand, I will try to find out.

@pcahyna no need to be sorry - we all have various day job things to do.

Yes, that is my question.  
When my assumption is true I would like to consolidate our current  
various methods how to set up the GRUB environment variable `root`  
into one single method and use only that method everywhere  
so that we get one single `search` command in our grub.cfg  
that is the right one for the intended purpose of that particular
grub.cfg

In particular the current hardcoded

    search --no-floppy --file /boot/efiboot.img --set

causes pain in my eyes and even more in my brain  
because that cannot be right for BIOS and  
it is also not right for OUTPUT=USB because  
as far as I see boot/efiboot.img is created by  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/700\_create\_efibootimg.sh  
but that is only run for OUTPUT=ISO and it actually creates it  
as isofs/boot/efiboot.img only if USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER is true.

@pcahyna for grub boot from iso you basically configure a loop device as
source for the kernel and initrd (including path within the ISO).  
Maybe you can also chainload to it but I am not sure about that.

see:  
[https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB\_2/Skripte/](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB_2/Skripte/)  
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot)  
[https://www.linux-community.de/blog/iso-images-mit-grub-2-booten/](https://www.linux-community.de/blog/iso-images-mit-grub-2-booten/)

edit:  
the idea behind this is that the booting source would always be the same
iso. No matter if you boot via ipmi or usb stick recover media.

@DEvil0000 thanks, that's what I thought. I would then say that doing it
this way is needlessly complicated (a change of naming convention for
the kernel and initrd would break the process) and does not have big
advantage compared to putting the kernel+initrd in the filesystem
directly. (You would not be reusing the bootloader and its configuration
files from the ISO, so there would not be much to reuse.)

I have a generic question regarding "grub can boot from iso":

Does "grub can boot from iso" mean something different  
than using GRUB2 as bootloader on an ISO as described  
in the section "Making a GRUB bootable CD-ROM" in  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html)  
?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26300485?u=9105d243bc9f7ade463a3e52e8dd13fa67837158&v=4" width="50">[pcahyna](https://github.com/pcahyna) commented at [2021-07-28 16:36](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648#issuecomment-888454280):

@jsmeix no, we mean chainloading a bootable ISO image (image as a file).
The "Making a GRUB bootable CD-ROM" deals with creating an ISO image
that will be then used to burn a CD-ROM and one will boot from the
CD-ROM. We are instead interested in having only an ISO image file
accessible to GRUB loaded from the harddisk (or USB disk) and booting
off that image file, if possible as if BIOS had booted a CD-ROM created
from this image.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3344302?v=4" width="50">[DEvil0000](https://github.com/DEvil0000) commented at [2021-07-28 17:14](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648#issuecomment-888479647):

@jsmeix I think it gets more clear with an example grub menu entry:

    menuentry "Ubuntu 20.04 ISO" {
       set isofile="/boot/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso"
       rmmod tpm
       loopback loop (hd0,5)$isofile
       linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject
       initrd (loop)/casper/initrd
    }

I think it may also be possible to chainload from the iso instead and
reuse the bootloader from there with something like:  
(not tested and did not find documentation about this)

    menuentry "Ubuntu 20.04 ISO" {
       set isofile="/boot/ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso"
       rmmod tpm
       loopback loop (hd0,5)$isofile
       chainloader (loop)
    # or chainloader (loop)$efipath
    }

So everything recovery system related would be one single iso file which
is the same for ipmi inserted or on a usb drive.  
I could also imagine to write a grub mod for wget of an iso so one would
not need to mess with PXE boot - which is just not possible in our
customer networks.  
Maybe this explains my usecase better.

edit: there is a tftp module since PXE needs it - this is maybe also a
option for getting a iso without a full PXE boot (no dhcp, no dns or
such).  
`linux (tftp,a.b.c.d)/tftpboot/bzImage` or similar may work

I don't think it is possible. I searched and found docs to do it only
for grub4dos (a separate GRUB fork) and Syslinux (
[https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Boot\_an\_Iso\_image](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Boot_an_Iso_image)
and
[https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=MEMDISK\#ISO\_images](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=MEMDISK#ISO_images)
) - but the goal was to get rid of Syslinux, not to add another
dependency on it. (@lzaoral, this may be of interest for you for testing
purposes though).

Regarding more than one 'search' command in grub.cfg  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648\#issuecomment-887383494](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2648#issuecomment-887383494)  
I asked our SUSE GRUB maintainer and he replied (excerpts)

    > Currently our generated grub.cfg contains (excerpt)

    > search --no-floppy --file /boot/efiboot.img --set

    Yes.

    > The second 'search' may not set 'root' because nothing with

    Yes.

    > I assume the second 'search' overwrites 'root' if it was set

    Yes.

    No it won't be re-set if the second search fails, so the value is
    retained. That basically will do the work if you want the last found
    wins.

This needs to be done before ReaR 2.7 release.  
I think it is already mostly done.  
I think only some config variable names need to be clarified.

I postponed
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2666)  
to ReaR 2.8

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2815](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2815)  
I describe in default.conf the currently  
implemented user config variable names  
USB\_BOOT\_PART\_SIZE and USB\_DEVICE\_BOOT\_LABEL

I think the current user config variable names  
USB\_BOOT\_PART\_SIZE and USB\_DEVICE\_BOOT\_LABEL  
are OK - at least I don't know really better names.

This issue is no longer a blocker for ReaR 2.8  
but
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2815](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2815)
is.

I postpone this issue to ReaR 2.8.
