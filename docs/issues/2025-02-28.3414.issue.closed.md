In usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
avoid when 'find' results only a dangling symlink to a needed library  
that then "rear mkrescue" proceeds "bona fide" cf.  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#try-hard-to-care-about-possible-errors>

Excerpts from  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3308#issuecomment-2328139914>

    when I have

    rm $ROOTFS_DIR/usr/lib64/libparted.so.2.0.1

    at the beginning of
    usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh
    ...
    localhost:~/rear.github.master # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...
    Testing each binary with 'ldd' for 'not found' libraries within the ReaR recovery system
    bin/parted requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found' (fatal by default)
    bin/parted requires libparted.so.2 which exists as usr/lib64/libparted.so.2
    bin/partprobe requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found' (fatal by default)
    bin/partprobe requires libparted.so.2 which exists as usr/lib64/libparted.so.2
    ...
    Therein in particular this (and same for bin/partprobe)

    bin/parted requires libraries where 'ldd' shows 'not found' (fatal by default)
    bin/parted requires libparted.so.2 which exists as usr/lib64/libparted.so.2

    shows that it is not sufficient when something
    that is reported as 'not found' by 'ldd'
    actually exists within the recovery system
    to assume that then the associated program(s)
    will actually work within the recovery system.

    In this case only the symlink
    /usr/lib64/libparted.so.2 exists
    but its link target (i.e. the actual library)
    does not exist so parted (and partprobe)
    cannot run within the recovery system.

Offhanded proposal how to fix it:  
In usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh at

    if actually_found_library="$( find "$ROOTFS_DIR" -xdev -printf '/%P\n' | grep "$not_found_library\$" )" ; then
        # Show files from inside the recovery system to the user as relative path without leading slashes
        # (extglob is set in usr/sbin/rear):
        actually_found_library_relpath="${actually_found_library##+(/)}"
        LogPrint "$binary_relpath requires $not_found_library_relpath which exists as $actually_found_library_relpath"

check that when actually\_found\_library is a symlink  
also its symlink target exists in the recovery system.

This helps to be more on the safe side that things work  
with what is found in the ReaR recovery system.

But this is no proof that things will actually work  
with what was found in the ReaR recovery system  
becaus in the ReaR recovery system there might be  
a wrong library (with the right name) or a symlink  
to a wrong library or whatever...
