I'm using rear-2.4-1 on RHEL7.4:  
After a system restore my server won't boot anymore.

The reason for this is the following:  
On RHEL7-Systems - also CentOS - the file "/etc/mtab" is a symlink to
"/proc/self/mount". At a restore this file will not be created, empty
created or with an unusable content created. So my server will hang up
while booting:  
`[FAILED] Failed to mount /. See 'systemctl status -.mount' for details.`

After booting the rescue image again, create the symlink for /etc/mtab
and boot the OS again, my server will boot successfully.

See  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

How things get restored depends on what you have in your backup,  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Perhaps BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES  
or POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT may help in your particular  
case, see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

@jonathankeuser Did you check your rear log file for something like:  
`'/tmp/rear.g7ZIwz3UWiFCXP1/rootfs/etc/mtab' -> '/proc/self/mounts'`?  
I never had issues with RHEL 7 (or CenOS 7) so far with this.

@jsmeix I created a workaroud using POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT. The variable
BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES is empty. So it has no effect on this
behavior.

@gdha In the rear log file i found something like

> '/tmp/rear.g7ZIwz3UWiFCXP1/rootfs/etc/mtab' -&gt; '/proc/self/mounts'

This link is also included in backup.tar.gz, but at a recover it is not
created. Also in the rear recovery log located at /var/lib/rear/restore/
is no entry to find.

@jonathankeuser  
FYI what I have in my 'backup.tar.gz' and on my original system:

<pre>
# tar -tvf backup.tar.gz | grep etc/mtab
lrwxrwxrwx root/root  0 2018-09-13 09:42 etc/mtab -> ../proc/self/mounts

# file /etc/mtab
/etc/mtab: symbolic link to ../proc/self/mounts
</pre>

@gdha  
I do not understand how /etc/mtab in the recovery system is related  
to etc/mtab in the restored system (which is /mnt/local/etc/mtab in the
recovery system)  
at least I do not see a relationship in the code.

@jsmeix We should not worry about ROOTFS/etc/mtab as it supposed to be a
symbolic link to `/proc/self/mounts` on RHEL 7.

On RHEL 5 anf 6: `/etc/mtab` is the file that mount and umount maintains
for a list of currently mounted filesystems. While, `/proc/mounts` is
the kernel's view of the mount.  
`/proc/mounts` is currently a link to `/proc/self/mounts` which lists
mount points of the processes's mount namespace. The VFS is responsible
to add to this file VFS options found in binary flags interface of each
filesystem, but, any specific filesystem option should be added by the
filesystem code using the superblock method show\_options()

On RHEL7, various command and libraries have been updated to use
libmount to read mount information and `/etc/mtab` is now a symbolic
link to `/proc/self/mounts`

@jsmeix Sorry, I expressed myself a little bit incomprehensible:

I did not mean the /etc/mtab of the recovery system, but the mtab of the
system being restored which is located at /mnt/local/etc/mtab.

> FYI what I have in my 'backup.tar.gz' and on my original system:

That's about what I find in my original system, as described above.

@gdha  
I know about /etc/mtab which was traditionally a file  
versus a symbolic link on nowadays systems.  
My question was because your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1946\#issuecomment-434649350](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1946#issuecomment-434649350)  
is about etc/mtab in the recovery system  
while @jonathankeuser issue here (if I understand it correctly)  
is about the restored etc/mtab in the recreated system.

@jonathankeuser  
I did a "rear recover" (but I run SLES12) and for me etc/mtab gets
correctly  
restored and is still correct on the rebooted recreated system
(excerpts):

@jsmeix The restoration of `/etc/mtab` is not the issue here, seems that
the symbolic link itself is not restored. However, I always thought that
everything under `/proc` file system is under control of the linux
kernel itself. Seems to be proven wrong?

@gdha  
I am afraid - in this issue I do somehow not understand you.

I would think restoration of /etc/mtab means that the symbolic link
itself is restored?

Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1946\#issuecomment-434674774](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1946#issuecomment-434674774)  
`This link is also included in backup.tar.gz, but at a recover it is not created.`

I.e. somehow for @jonathankeuser the link is in his 'tar' backup  
but it does not get restored (in contrast to what happens on my system).

Because we had in the past already some weird issues with 'tar' on
RHEL  
I guess this one could be perhaps another one of those kind of issues?

I've performed a test on CentOS 7.5 with BACKUP=NETFS and `tar`. The tar
archive contained the following after grepping on:

    # tar ztf backup.tar.gz  | grep -E '(mtab|mounts)'
    etc/mtab
    usr/share/man/man8/mountstats.8.gz
    usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tuned/plugins/plugin_mounts.py
    usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tuned/plugins/plugin_mounts.pyo
    usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tuned/plugins/plugin_mounts.pyc
    usr/sbin/mountstats
    usr/lib64/python2.7/symtable.pyc
    usr/lib64/python2.7/symtable.pyo
    usr/lib64/python2.7/symtable.py
    var/lib/nfs/rmtab

After doing a **recovery** test I still have:

    [root@client ~]# ls -l /etc/mtab /proc/self/mounts
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 17 Sep 30 21:58 /etc/mtab -> /proc/self/mounts
    -r--r--r--. 1 root root  0 Nov  5 16:22 /proc/self/mounts

So far, nothing has changed for me (before and after the modification
done at `build/default/985_fix_broken_links.sh`)

Because we can neither reproduce nor imagine what goes actually wrong  
and because we had in the past already some weird issues with 'tar' on
RHEL  
I assume this one is another one of those kind of issues.
