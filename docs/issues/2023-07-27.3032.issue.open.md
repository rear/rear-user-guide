I found another location for the libraries and added that to my
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and I was able to create the ISO file. I will now see
if it will boot.

Still doesn't boot as the kernel isn't getting created and placed in the
ISO. Any ideas?

Can you please attach a log file?

I uninstalled v2.6 and installed v2.7 and added an extra library path to
my /etc/rear/local.conf file and the iso doubled in size. I haven't had
a chance to boot the iso yet. I plan to run into the office tomorrow and
see if it will boot up on a spare machine.  
[rear-exxact01.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/12221707/rear-exxact01.log)  
The log file contains some libraries that are "not found", which is
true, as they do not exist on the server - so I don't understand why.  
Hopefully the iso will boot and get me to a ReaR main menu.

Thanks for replying,  
Bruce
