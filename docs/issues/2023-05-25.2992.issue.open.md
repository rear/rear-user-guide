Hi,

We are facing an issue after running Rear in some of our testing
environments.

We have a Jenkins pipeline that runs Rear in order to test that we are
able to do some backups of some guest VMs, after restoring the backup
images we noticed that the guests are unresponsive and this is because
the network interfaces are renamed from eth0 to ens3, eth1 to ens4 and
eth2 to ens5.

This is something that should be fixed as we should be using predictable
naming for all the network interfaces.

The initial state of the VMs is (net.ifnames=0)  
Before restoring the images:

    [root@undercloud-0 stack]# cat /proc/cmdline
    BOOT_IMAGE=(hd0,gpt3)/vmlinuz-5.14.0-283.el9.x86_64 root=UUID=62b51192-13b0-4838-a267-e410f86ee01e console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 no_timer_check net.ifnames=0 crashkernel=1G-4G:192M,4G-64G:256M,64G-:512M

After restoring the images:

    [root@undercloud-0 stack]# cat /proc/cmdline
    BOOT_IMAGE=(hd0,gpt3)/vmlinuz-5.14.0-283.el9.x86_64 root=UUID=62b51192-13b0-4838-a267-e410f86ee01e ro

Not having 'net.ifnames=0' anymore.

We played with the following configuration parameters in the local.conf
without any additional change.

-   Default values.
-   COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS=( 'net.ifnames')
-   GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX="net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"

If we reboot the guest VMs without running Rear there is no change in
the interface naming.

When creating the backups of the images we see these lines:

    2023-05-09 13:59:33.470942363 Adding net.ifnames=0 to KERNEL_CMDLINE
    2023-05-09 13:59:33.711087009 Modified kernel commandline to: 'selinux=0 net.ifnames=0 console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0

And when running the restore we have this:

We would like to understand what change is introducing Rear that is
triggering the renaming of the network interfaces, we are using
Relax-and-Recover 2.6 / 2020-06-17.

Is there a BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES, POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT or
PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT configuration parameter we could use to avoid
having `udevadm trigger` renaming all the network interfaces?

There is also another reference \#1818 where we might have a similar
situation, that is, Rear is not able to restore the previous network
configuration and the init scripts are regenerated.

Thanks,  
@fdiazbra and @ccamacho

@ccamacho  
as far as I know the "Modified kernel commandline" stuff only belongs  
to the kernel commandline of the ReaR recovery system,  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf where  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE and COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS are described  
only for the "rescue/recovery system" / "rescue image"  
(i.e. the ReaR recovery system).

Off the top of my head I think how the kernel commandline  
of the original system is saved and recovered happens as  
follows:  
In the "finalize" stage the bootloader gets installed  
via 'chroot' inside the recreated target system  
after the backup was restored so the bootloader gets installed  
with the restored bootloader config files from the backup.  
For example on my current openSUSE Leap 15.4 system I have  
in /etc/default/grub

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=... mitigations=..."

so this kernel commandline parameters are used when GRUB2  
is installed and this kernel commandline parameters appear  
in my /boot/grub2/grub.cfg like

    linux   /boot/vmlinuz... root=... resume=... mitigations=...

Accordingly I assume that in your case your bootloader config files  
on your original system may not contain the kernel commandline  
parameters which you are missing.

Regarding
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
see the comments in this script how it works.  
When those automated more or less hardcoded modifications  
of the restored files get in your way the direct workaround  
is to skip those automated modifications by skipping the whole  
finalize/GNU/Linux/320\_migrate\_network\_configuration\_files.sh  
by inserting an additional

    return 0

line at the beginning of this script - also as needed for  
other "finalize" scripts that modify restored files.  
You can add that 'return 0' line  
either  
when you are logged in as 'root' inside the ReaR recovery system  
before you run "rear recover"  
or  
you add that line on your original system and recreate the  
ReaR recovery system via "rear mkrescue" or "rear mkbackup".

it would be interesting to know what changes (if any) have been made by
the patching process. @ccamacho can you please diff these files after
recovery process and before the recovery process?  
Also, how are the interfaces called in the rescue system? And what is
the kernel command line in the rescue system? I suppose it has
`net.ifnames=0` because of your KERNEL\_CMDLINE and/or
COPY\_KERNEL\_PARAMETERS settings, and interfaces are called the same as
in the original install - `eth1`, `eth2`, `eth3`, but I would like to
confirm that.  
Also, are you restoring to exactly the same hardware as the backup was
made on, or to some replacement hardware? (Are the network interfaces
and their MAC addresses the same in the original and recovered system?)

The files: ifcfg-eth0, ifcfg-eth1, ifcfg-eth2, ifcfg-br-ctlplane, and
ifcfg-lo identical in the original and rescued system. The file
ifcfg-ens3 only exists in the rescued machine.  
The interface names are called "ethX" in the rescue system, as in the
original deployment.  
About the hardware, there is no replacement. We have both vms over the
same hypervisor.

after some discussion it looks that re-adding `net.ifnames=0` to the
recovered system makes this work again. So the only question is why is
the whole
`console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 no_timer_check net.ifnames=0 crashkernel=1G-4G:192M,4G-64G:256M,64G-:512M`
part missing from the restored kernel command line, and I smell some
misconfiguration here, aka GIGO (garbage in, garbage out).

Those additions shouldn't be necessary, default.conf contains this:

    # - Check net.ifnames and biosdevname kernel parameter as it may impact the network interface name during recovery/migration.
    COPY_KERNEL_PARAMETERS=( 'net.ifnames' 'biosdevname' )
