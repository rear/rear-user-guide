Is there a simple way to confirm a "rear -v mkbackup" ran to completion
without errors, when scripted to run automatically using cron? For
example, if the "rear -v mkbackup" command is placed within a shell
wrapper, is it sufficient to check the return value, (echo $?),
immediately after the script finishes? We'll be running nightly with
cron, and I would like to script such that I receive an email only if
there are problems, or, a syslog event is triggered in the event of a
problem. Thanks

Simply run `read mkbackup`. It will remain silent unless there is
something to say. The return code should indicate success or failure.

Run "read mkbackup"? Do you mean, "rear mkbackup", without the "-v"
verbose option? And when "rear mkbackup" completes, check the return
value, (echo $?), for success status? Assume return of zero is success
and non-zero means there were problems, correct? Thanks

@bbeaver

What exactly do you mean with  
"confirm a 'rear -v mkbackup' ran to completion without errors"?

E.g. to confirm that the backup of the files is complete without errors
one would have to restore it to another place and then inspect if the
restored stuff is complete without errors.

E.g. to confirm that the generated rear recovery system is complete
without errors one would have to boot and run it on another machine and
let it do its job there which means one would have to do a real "rear
recover" and after that verify that the recovered system is complete
without errors.

Or do you only mean that no program/script that was run by 'rear -v
mkbackup' resulted a non-zero exit code?

Since rear-1.16.x rear writes a return code message via syslogd to
`var/log/messages`, e.g.  
`Mar 10 10:22:20 <my_hostname> rear[20947]: DONE: rc=0`

@jsmeix: we are wanting to run rear backups each night via cron
unattended, which means I need to know by either an email or syslog
event if there were problems. I can either script for this by validating
a return code, or look for a syslog event.

@gdha:  
Perfect - that's what I was looking for. Will syslog also be written
with any problems? What local.conf variables need to be setup to support
the writing of syslog events?

Thanks

ATM the only thing that is logged to syslog are errors and a warning /  
success result codes.

I think that it would be not difficult to add support for logging  
everything to syslog instead of our own log file.

Leaving details in the ReaR log file is fine. The objective here is to
be notified if there are any issues with a regularly scheduled nightly
run of "rear -v mkbackup". Sysadmins will need to receive an email, or a
syslog event if there are problems, and once this is received they can
look at the ReaR log file details as to what failed. Thinking something
like this below:

rear mkbackup  
rc=$?  
if \[ -n "${rc}" \]  
then  
send an email indicating rear failed, or logger to syslog  
fi

if you grep the syslog with the keyword *rear* you would find all issues
if any or it went fine *DONE: rc=0*
