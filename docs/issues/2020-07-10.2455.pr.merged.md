##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2425

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

    The fix in \#2426 did not resolve the issue. The machine affected,
    an HPE ML10Gen9 server, still hung frequently, but not always, when
    trying to transfer control to the kernel after unlocking.

    After some more research, it turned out that the only reliable way
    to boot was using a power cycle after Opal disks were unlocked. It
    looks like the firmware did not initialize properly during a
    'simple' reboot and got screwed by the changed state of the boot
    disk after unlocking.

    A reboot including a power cycle could be achieved on this machine
    via the `reboot=efi` kernel parameter. However, TCG Opal 2 disks
    enter their locked state when power is turned off.

    To allow a reboot with unlocked disks nonetheless, this PR
    introduces a new unlocking mode "permanent", configurable via
    `OPAL_PBA_UNLOCK_MODE`. The "permanent" mode unlocks devices and
    deactivates locking until a reactivation command is issued.
    Reactivating locking is then the responsibility of the user and is
    best accomplished via a systemd service at boot time on the original
    system (or when leaving hibernate state if that is required).

    Comments in `default.conf` explain the options and weaknesses of
    this workaround and an example configuration. When creating a PBA
    with "permanent" unlocking, a warning message is issued so that the
    user is made aware of the situation.

    The original attempt to fix the issue (ee6eb63d) has been reverted
    as it failed to provide a working solution.

    Finally, some code safeguarding against disk access errors has been
    moved to the internal base function.

    \[Addition\] Enhance security by disabling emergency shell access
    via a keyboard interrupt and switching to a password hash for
    OPAL\_PBA\_DEBUG\_PASSWORD.

@OliverO2  
if it is OK for you I would merge it tomorrow afternoon.
