My environment

<pre>
Testing date: 2015-11-30
Operating system: Debian 8.2 (jessie)
Package: rear_1.17.2_all.deb
</pre>

I had successfully installed rear with all its dependencies but another
dependency showed up when backing up the system to a USB device.

<pre>
root@debian-8b:/etc/rear# rear -v mkrescue
Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git
Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-debian-8b.log
ERROR: Executable extlinux is missing! Please install syslinux-extlinux or alike
Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-debian-8b.log for details
Terminated
</pre>

No errors were observed once extlinux package was installed.

<pre>
apt-get install extlinux
</pre>

This issue seems to be related to Issue \#696.

Rear adds/checks dependencies on package level for the minimum
requirements. `isolinux` belongs to the minimum required packages.
However, `extlinux` is an optional package only required with USB.
Therefore, we do additional checks in the **prep** phase. That is what
you saw during your test run. We assume that the users first try it
manually before automating rear.

@jk04au are you satisfied with the answer? If you are fine then close

Reading your response, I get the impression that *extlinux* will remain
an optional package and will not be installed automatically when ReaR is
installed. However, some time in future, if the user is backing up to
the USB device, ReaR will detect *extlinux* is missing and installs it
automatically. Is that right?

Yes and no. ReaR will notice that the required program extlinux is
missing and it will abort asking you - the admin - to install it
yourself.

ReaR should not install software *for you*.

We already discussed several times to idea to provide `rear-usb`,
`rear-tape`, `rear-everything`... packages that would simply install
`rear` and also include the dependencies for the given use case (or all
dependencies to use all built-in features of ReaR).

See \#250 and \#133. \#696 is really bug because ISO is the default that
ships with ReaR.

I will now close the issue, if you have further questions please feel
free to reopen it or to open a new issue.
