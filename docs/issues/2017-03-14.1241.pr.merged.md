Clean up the SetOSVendorAndVersion function a bit.

In particular set SUSE\_LINUX as OS\_VENDOR  
on all SUSE systems but do not set OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR  
same as OS\_VENDOR because then scripts in  
a .../$OS\_VENDOR/... or .../$OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR/...  
sub-directory would get sourced twice by  
the (buggy?) SourceStage function.

I like to merge it soon because I think it is a good first step  
in the right direction and if somthing fails I will fix it.

Tested on SLES12 SP2 where it works for me.  
If accidentally something fails on other systems I will fix it.

Triggered by \#1311 I looked again at this and realized what (IMHO)
happened here: OS\_VENDOR and OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR should indeed never be
the same. Apparently on some SUSE distros this happened, setting both to
SUSE\_LINUX.

While the current fix in this PR works it actually goes against the
original concept of the `*_MASTER_*` variables. The original concept was
to have all vendor-generic code under the `*_MASTER_*` name and extend
this with derivate-specific code only where needed.

Maybe with Fedora/RHEL/CentOS this works better because they are more
consistent in the output of `lsb_release`?

The code of SetOSVendorAndVersion() somehow  
works "backwards" because it first sets OS\_VENDOR  
and from that value it derives a value that is set for  
OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR for several Linux distributions.

I implemented that behaviour now also for SUSE.  
Now OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR="SUSE" for SUSE distributions.  
I think before OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR was not set for SUSE.

As a second step all SUSE\_LINUX directories could now be  
renamed into SUSE but I don't like that because it works as is.

It never happened in real usage that OS\_VENDOR and  
OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR were same for SUSE.  
What happened was that I had set both same during my tests  
but then I noticed that scripts get run twice because of this.

When OS\_VENDOR and OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR should  
indeed never be the same, a test is missing in ReaR that  
errors out when both are the same.  
Way too often ReaR does not verify conditions  
but blindly proceeds "bona fide".

According to the code of SetOSVendorAndVersion()

<pre>
    case "$OS_VENDOR_VERSION" in
        (*Oracle*|*CentOS*|*FedoraCore*|*RedHat*|*Scientific*)
            OS_MASTER_VENDOR="Fedora"
</pre>

I don't think Fedora/RHEL/CentOS are consistent  
in the output of lsb\_release.  
Each one has its own name in the output of lsb\_release  
(which is expected) but SetOSVendorAndVersion()  
maps them to a consistent OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR.

+1 for adding a test to prevent running with OS\_VENDOR and
OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR set to the same.

Fedora-based distros so far (as I have seen) are much more consistent
with regard to their `lsb_release -i` output compared to SUSE, where
different SLES versions yield different results.

And yes, I would strongly suggest to actually use OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR for
SUSE and set OS\_VENDOR to something that differentiates between the
different SUSE flavors.
