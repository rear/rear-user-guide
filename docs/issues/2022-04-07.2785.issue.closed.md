-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

In certain circumstances (need to clarify exactly the workflow,  
certainly a rescue not run after a UUID changed and backuponly on the
source system),  
the UUID are not updated during the recover, because sed can't find old
UUID.  
The issue is that sed does not print an error or a different return
code  
if the file is not patched, thus we don't know if the sed script had an
effect.

        sed  "$sed_script" "$restored_file" || LogPrintError "Migrating filesystem UUIDs in $restored_file to current UUIDs failed";

=&gt; the error is printed only if the sed encounters an error, not if
the patch is not applied

A PR will be submitted to discuss how this can be improved.

Thanks !

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Manually check the UUID

I believe that changing the system between `mkrescue` and `mkbackuponly`
should not be supported, and this should be considered a user error.
@jsmeix do we have such a statement anywhere in the docs? There is a
`checklayout` command, does it report that the layout has changed before
you run `mkbackuponly`? If so, this indicates that `mkrescue` needs to
be rerun. If not, that would be a bug. (I wonder whether it would make
sense to add a `checklayout` at the start of the `mkbackuponly`
workflow, so that the likelihood of broken backups is reduced?)

It is a user error when "rear mkbackup" was not run  
after each change of the basic system in particular  
after a change of the disk layout that results a change in
disklayout.conf  
which is what "rear checklayout" is meant to detect.

As far as I know (but I don't know our whole documentation well)  
we do not document basics like when one should make a new backup  
or things like that.

If you don't run `mkbackup` after each change, you get an older state of
the system when you recover. This might be undesired, but might be
actually desired as well.  
But if you split `mkbackup` into `mkrescue` and `mkbackuponly` and you
change the system between them, the result is for sure inconsistent and
would be good if ReaR detected this situation automatically.

I need to investigate how FS\_UUID\_MAP is meant to work.

As far as I see on first glance it seem FS\_UUID\_MAP is written in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/131\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
only in case of `btrfs` and `vfat`  
but a filessystem UUID is also set in case of `ext*` and `xfs` and
`reiserfs`  
which does not look right.

@pcahyna  
for most external backup methods "rear mkbackup" does not make any
backup  
so for most external backup methods only "rear mkrescue" is useful  
which means for most external backup methods it is up to the user to
ensure  
that the files in his backup match sufficiently what there is in his
recovery system.

On the other hand finalize scripts like  
finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
are there to migrate e.g. UUIDs in outdated restored files  
to the current UUIDs of the recreated system.

Sure, I understand that, but at least in the internal backup case the
check could be automated.

I believe this is for the case that recovery process changes a UUID and
therefore the UUIDs in files are outdated and not for the case that the
backup is old, or is it a misunderstanding?

Thanks a lot for your comments !

I opened another issue (sorry...) to discuss a more general issue that
rescue ISO is dependant of data in the backup:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2787)  
And that crond job automatically creates a new ISO without checking if
the required data is in the backup.  
If we can avoid such dependency, the issue will not occur anymore.

Thanks !

Oops, I think I see the problem now... so it was first `mkbackuponly`
and then `mkrescue`?

I am afraid this won't be feasible in general...

I think I understand now how the issue happens:

At some time "rear mkrescue" was run that stored  
filesystem UUIDs of that time into disklayout.conf.

Then filesystem UUIDs were changed and a backup was made.

This means the filesystem UUIDs in disklayout.conf are outdated.

When then "rear recover" is run,  
the old UUIDs in FS\_UUID\_MAP are the ones from disklayout.conf and  
normally the filesystems get recreated with the UUPDs from
disklayout.conf  
(because nowadays mkfs.... tools support setting the filesystem UUID)  
but the recreated UUIDs cannot be found in the restored config files  
because the backup contained already config files with newer UUIDs.

When the filesystems get recreated with the UUPDs from disklayout.conf  
old and new UUIDs are the same in FS\_UUID\_MAP (which is the usual
case)  
so finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh won't change anything.

Accordingly - from my current point of view - I think the `sed` part
in  
finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh  
is not the right place to deal with this issue.

I will have to think more about it...

@jsmeix Yes, but I think it's the opposite. The rescue is built
everytime the layout changes (due to crond job), thus if you change the
uuid, you will automatically have a new rescue ISO, which will be
unusable ...  
Rear is checking some files to update the UUID during the recovery,
these files should be embedded in the rescue ISO.

Thanks !

In this case the problem was in `vfat` - the EFI System Partition.

All files that get included in the recovery system (what you call
"rescue ISO")  
are files from the system at the time when "rear mkrescue" is run  
so in this case those files would contain the new UUIDs (as in
disklayout.conf).

When during "rear recover" a backup with outdated UUIDs in files gets
restored  
one could compare the files that were included in the recovery system  
with the restored files to find out what changed between backup and
"mkrescue"  
(regardless what was earlier backup or "mkrescue").

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)
merged  
this issue should be solved.

When restored basic system files do not match the recreated system  
there should now be a message

    Error: Restored files do not match the recreated system in /mnt/local

during "rear recover" after the backup was restored.

What basic system files are checked can be specified via  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES and the new FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS  
see their descriptions in conf/default.conf
