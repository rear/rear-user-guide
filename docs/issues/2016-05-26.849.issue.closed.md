\# What version of grub are we using

The assumption is that grub-install is available, while in rhel7 the
command is called grub2-install. Also the same file tries to use
grub-mkimage while the command available is grub2-mkimage.

Also The package grub2-efi-modules need to be installed or the image
creation will fail with: "grub-mkimage: error: cannot open
‘/usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/moddep.lst’: No such file or directory."

-   Work-around, if any

Create a symlink grub-install -&gt; grub2-install and grub-mkimage -&gt;
grub2-mkimage in /usr/local/bin. Also "yum install grub2-efi-modules"

This one is probably for me :-) ...  
EFI USB support is quite new feature, so I was pretty sure that some of
the conditions don't need to match all OSes.  
I'll certainly take a look how things are on RHEL/Centos 7 (I'm missing
these two in my VM collection) and will report back with updates ...

@Rosco-github thanks for reporting this issue ...

I don't think I'm having a blocking problem creating the USB key in
Centos7, but I am having problems running mkrescue to the EFI formatting
USB key. I have a 4GB Kingston USB stick installed in the server to be
backed up.

Firstly, I think this is possibly an error:  
$ sudo usr/sbin/rear format --efi /dev/sde  
**rear: unrecognized option '--efi'**  
USB device /dev/sde must be formatted with ext2/3/4 or btrfs file
system  
Please type Yes to format /dev/sde in ext3 format:

I bail out of that, and add the --- (this doesn't seem expected/right?
Previous issues I read referred to just 'format --efi
&lt;usb\_device&gt;'), and it completes without error.

$ sudo usr/sbin/rear format -- --efi /dev/sde  
USB device /dev/sde must be formatted with ext2/3/4 or btrfs file
system  
Please type Yes to format /dev/sde in ext3 format: Yes

I've tried using REAR-000 and REAR-EFI (and EFI for output and 000 for
USB\_DEVICE) in the local.conf, but in all cases, I'm always running out
of space on the USB key. Which label should I be using in local.conf?
Test below is using REAR-000 after I saw the OP in this issues thread:

Is it expected to create a primary partition of 100MB and the rest is
unused? Or should the whole 4GB be available for the rescue disk?

Thanks in advance.

Please note, I am a beginner with this and this is my first time trying
to get REAR running. I would like to get this running so that the OS can
be restored (and not just files, like duplicity or something), so I'm
available to help debug/troubleshoot this.

Hi,  
I was wondering whether 100MB will be enough for EFI, however I was not
able to reproduce needs for bigger EFI partition.

Could you please try edit following code in
**/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/30\_format\_usb\_disk.sh** to more
appropriate size that could better fit your needs.

e.g.

    if [[ "$EFI" == "y" ]]; then
            LogPrint "The --efi toggle was used with format - make an EFI bootable USB disk"
            echo "Yes" | parted -s $RAW_USB_DEVICE -- mklabel gpt mkpart primary 0 200Mib mkpart primary 200Mib 100% >&2
    ...

then format your USB stick again and try to run `rear mkrescue/mkbackup`
again?

@gdha as you seems to be author of the code, do you think it would be
possible to prompt user user for size of EFI partition prior format
takes place?

In this Centos 7 install, /usr/lib/grub/x86\_64-efi/moddep.lst doesn't
exist.

Now I'm wondering if I really need EFI? I started out today with 1.17.2
and couldn't figure out the issue. I then cloned git to 1.18.1 and saw
the error about running out of space, and something that indicated I
NEEDED to format the USB for EFI. /boot has an efi dir...

dmesg | grep "EFI v"  
\[ 0.000000\] efi: EFI v2.31 by American Megatrends

Am I now running into the bug that this issue was created for and what
you created a possible fix for? If so, I'll take a look at your changes
and see if that fixes it.

I guess we've stopped here:

`${GRUB_MKIMAGE} -o ${EFI_DST}/BOOTX64.efi -p ${EFI_DIR} -O x86_64-efi linux part_gpt ext2 normal gfxterm gfxterm_background gfxterm_menu test all_video loadenv fat`

Just to confirm my doubt, could you run following comand:  
`grub2-mkimage -o /tmp/test.efi -O x86_64-efi linux part_gpt ext2 normal gfxterm gfxterm_background gfxterm_menu test all_video loadenv fat`

> Now I'm wondering if I really need EFI?

This is something you must decide ;-), If you want to save trouble
switch to legacy boot, if you want to experiment, got for EFI.

@BCITMike sorry to just put you command without further explanation (I'm
a bit deformed :-))  
grub2-mkimage will create EFI bootloader in /tmp/test.efi (which you can
delete afterwards). It will not mess with your current configuration.

@gozora

Didn't like that syntax:

$ sudo grub2-mkimage -o /tmp/test.efi -O x86\_64-efi linux part\_gpt
ext2 normal gfxterm gfxterm\_background gfxterm\_menu test all\_video
loadenv fat  
Prefix not specified (use the -p option).  
Usage: grub2-mkimage \[OPTION...\] \[OPTION\]... \[MODULES\]  
Try ‘grub2-mkimage --help’ or ‘grub2-mkimage --usage’ for more
information.

I even tried backspacing over the "-" in case it was copy/paste issue
with keyboard/language, but same.

Help says:

`-p, --prefix=DIR           set prefix directory`

:-) ok, confirmed.

After a bit of googling, missing file(s) should be part of package
called **grub2-efi-modules**
[(rpmfind\_link)](https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/centos/updates/7.2.1511/x86_64/Packages/grub2-efi-modules-2.02-0.34.el7.centos.x86_64.html).

Can you look for such package (or equivalent) on your distro?

Haha, found it right when you did. I sure as hell hope this doesn't bork
anything just by installing it.

    $ sudo grub2-mkimage -o /tmp/test.efi -O x86_64-efi linux part_gpt ext2 normal gfxterm gfxterm_background gfxterm_menu test all_video loadenv fat -p /EFI/BOOT
    $ ls /tmp/test.efi
    /tmp/test.efi

Sounds like this dependency needs to be added to the epel repo for rear,
right?

Yeah, but I was first, and that counts :-).

No, it is safe to install.

Not sure if dependency directly, because this is EFI specific, but it
could be certainly helpful to mentioned it in documentation.

I'll try to find some suitable spot for this.

@jsmeix @gdha any ideas where we could put this info?

I'm thinking that this is no longer an EFI issue, and a generic rear
issue I need to open a new issue for? Though, the mkrescue isn't
completely successfully, so not sure if EFI issue or not.

@BCITMike I'd agree here.  
You might have better attention from guys who have much deeper knowledge
of rear than I do, (I basically try to mess with EFI booting ... ) when
you open new issue with more fitting description ...

@BCITMike  
on a very first glance it seems your issue in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/849\#issuecomment-227381627](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/849#issuecomment-227381627)  
is separated from your initial issue here.

If yes, please submit separated GitHub issues  
for separated issues - otherwise different things  
get mixed up here until all ends in chaos.

@gozora regarding your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/849\#issuecomment-227380538](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/849#issuecomment-227380538)

I am not a sufficient (U)EFI expert to fully understand  
what went on here.

Could you post here a proposal text of what to mention  
in the rear documentation.

Then I think it is easy to find an appropriate place in the  
rear documentation whereto add that text.

@Rosco-github @gozora I think it would be good idea to foresee a new
variable in default.conf file to be able to overwrite the default size
of the FAT partition.

And, the **grub2-efi-modules** - is this specific needed for USB/UEFI? I
never needed this requirement before? If yes, then we should add a
little prep script for EFI and USB output?

FYI:

On my openSUSE Leap 42.1 system I have

<pre>
/usr/lib/grub2/i386-pc/moddep.lst
/usr/lib/grub2/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst
</pre>

installed by default.  
Note for me it is "grub2" not "grub".  
I do not have a "/usr/lib/grub/" directory.

Those files belong to the RPMs

<pre>
grub2-i386-pc-2.02~beta2-76.1.x86_64
grub2-x86_64-efi-2.02~beta2-76.1.x86_64
</pre>

respectively.

And no RPM package provides "grub2-efi-modules":

<pre>
# rpm -q --whatprovides grub2-efi-modules
no package provides grub2-efi-modules
</pre>

Just the usual mess with different packaging  
on different Linux distributions...

Fine with that, I'll can prepare pull request for it if you want.

This package (modules) are required by grub(2)-mkimage to create
bootloader.efi which is used to EFI boot from USB. So it is required
only if you want to do EFI boot from USB. As this don't seems to be
mainstream setup, I think we just could put note to **README.adoc**
*REQUIREMENTS* section.  
Something like:

-   mingetty or agetty

-   sfdisk or parted

-   grub2-efi-modules or similar package that provides Grub2 modules (/usr/lib/grub(2)/) if USB recovery on EFI is used

With

tomorrow.
