#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"):

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Hello REAR community,

We are in the process of restoring REAR backups to new VM's. The way we
do REAR backups now is by using an NFS server. Once we do the backup we
have to copy the "vmname.ISO" to the ESXI datastore and point the VM to
boot from the ISO. Is there a way we can avoid this part and maybe do a
network boot of the new VM from the REAR backup?

Why I ask this is copying the ISO from the NFS server to ESXi involves
our Compute team and that is not fun.

Regards,  
Niranjan

@IT-Guy-1973 PXE is supported with ReaR. For VMs within ESXi servers you
have to be careful that the VM is located in the same VLAN otherwise PXE
broadcast won't arrive at the proper DHCP/PXE daemon.  
An example you will find at

Hello gdha ,

So from the link, you sent me I see the following I need to include in
my site.conf file: I will check to adjust the settings with my settings
and see how it goes.

OUTPUT=PXE  
OUTPUT\_PREFIX\_PXE=$HOSTNAME

BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=nfs://192.168.33.15/export/nfs

PXE\_TFTP\_URL=nfs://10.0.2.2/root/.config/VirtualBox/TFTP  
PXE\_CONFIG\_URL=nfs://10.0.2.2/root/.config/VirtualBox/TFTP/pxelinux.cfg  
PXE\_RECOVER\_MODE="unattended"  
PXE\_CREATE\_LINKS="IP"

USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=y  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE="$KERNEL\_CMDLINE net.ifnames=0"

FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'no' )

SSH\_ROOT\_PASSWORD="vagrant"

Thank you.
