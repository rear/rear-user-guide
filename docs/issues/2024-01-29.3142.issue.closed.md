for context.

I'd like to be able to use automated source code formatting with ReaR,
and the go-to-tool for that seems to be
[shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd)
which is also supported in our `.editorconfig` file and in various IDEs
(I'm currently using Visual Studio Code with
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format)).

Our
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
has some rules that conflict with the abilities of this formatter,
specifically adding extra white space or padding around code fragments
or before `;`.

I wasn't able to find a shell script formatting solution that works in
the IDEs that allows such a coding style, and I believe that automated
consistent formatting is more important. Therefore I'd like to suggest
to adjust our coding style to also allow (or demand?) a more compact way
of writing Bash and to recommend using a shell script formatter to
format the code.

I'm happy to submit the PR with the change that reformats all lines,
although that would kill `git blame` and therefore I'd rather prefer
that we reformat files as we work on them.

Personally I'd prefer to not require a "clean" `git blame` as a
requirement over consistent and automated code formatting.

What do you think @rear/contributors?

Personally I don't worry about coding syntax style differences.

For example personally I don't care if

    if CONDITION ; then
        ...
        ...
    fi

or

    if CONDITION
    then ...
         ...
    fi

is used because both are reasonably easy  
to read and - most important - to understand.

Therefore  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
talks initially about "hints" - not "rules":

    Here is a collection of coding hints
    that should help to get a more consistent code base.

    Don't be afraid to contribute to Relax-and-Recover
    even if your contribution does not fully match all this coding hints. 
    ...
    Nevertheless try to understand the idea behind this coding hints
    so that you know how to break them properly
    (i.e. "learn the rules so you know how to break them properly").

    The overall idea behind this coding hints is:

    Make yourself understood

So as long as it is reasonably easy for me  
to understand some code I do not care about  
coding syntax style.

For example I prefer spaces as separators  
basically everywhere in my code for example as in

    if for x in this that ; do echo $x ; done ; then
        echo OK
    fi

because personally I find that easier to read  
than

    if for x in this that; do echo $x; done; then
        echo OK
    fi

But this is really not something which makes  
the code needlessly hard to read  
so I don't worry about such coding syntax style details.

In contrast for example I think that backticks  
make code needlessly hard to read - in particular  
when also single quotes are used things look confusing.

@schlomo  
do you perhaps propose  
to run an automated source code formatter  
over all existing ReaR code?

@jsmeix the problem we saw just now is actually only a problem of the
transition: If all the source code would have been formatted by a tool
then whenever somebody works on code the formatting tool ensures that
there are no needles formatting changes.

As we have not yet reformatted the ReaR code via tool we keep seeing
this problem.

Therefore indeed I propose to decide upon a tool and "convert" the
source code with a single PR to that automated formatting.

The main downside I can see to this is that we loose the easy
`git blame` history because then the author of that PR will be visible
in all changed lines.

The alternative is IMHO to give up on very consistent ReaR source code
formatting and accept PRs that mostly look good without too much
attention to the details.

My personal preference is to give up on  
consistent ReaR source code syntax style and  
accept PRs that properly implement actual functionality  
without much attention to coding style details  
provided the coding style looks acceptable ("cum grano salis")  
which means as long as the code is easy to understand  
i.e. as long as the code is maintainable which means  
that at any time later others still understand the code  
so they can properly fix and enhance the code as needed.

Cf. my above

@gdha @pcahyna  
please comment here what your personal opinion is  
regarding automated source code formatting and  
regarding a consistent ReaR source code syntax style.

@jsmeix I can also live with accepting different coding styles and
formattings, but then I'd expect it to be OK to change the formatting as
part of working on code and not be enslaved to the "original" formatting

@rear/contributors  
when a majority of us active ReaR upstream maintainers  
prefer a consistent ReaR source code syntax style  
it would be perfectly OK for me to enforce that by  
"converting" our whole source code with a single PR  
to an automated formatting  
because  
I do not care much what source code syntax style is used,  
cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3142\#issuecomment-1935804512](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3142#issuecomment-1935804512)

But if we "convert" our whole source code with a single PR  
to an automated formatting then those who want that must  
carefully review this PR to avoid that the conversion may  
mess up things where "exceptional" syntax stlye is needed.  
For example I am thinking about things  
like strings over several lines

        my_text="This text
    is several
    lines long"

where automated indentation would change the string value.

@schlomo  
yes of course, when you work on some code  
(in particular when you overhaul some code),  
you become owner of the the new code version  
(or at least the one who is to "blame" in git)  
and as owner (blamable/culprit) it is your code  
where only you decide what syntay style you like  
(provided others can understand your code).

I did this very often when I completely overhauled a script  
that I used my personally preferred coding style syntax  
everywhere in my (then it became 'my') overhauled script.

@rear/contributors  
when we agreed here how we like to deal  
with source code syntax style, I will overhaul  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
appropriately.

@jsmeix @schlomo I'm okay with the Coding-Style of ReaR.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2024-04-10 12:00](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3142#issuecomment-2047360888):

Perhaps a good argument against a  
consistent ReaR source code syntax style  
is that this would cause needless problems  
with new contributors who use their own coding style.

I would like to avoid unhelpful discussions about  
their own coding style (provided we understand their code)  
and focus on whether or not they did properly implement  
their intended added/enhanced/changed functionality.

I think that coding style discussions could become  
rather quickly very unhelpful because coding style  
is a very personal thing so trying to teach others about  
their coding style could be soon perceived as intrusive.

I even think that coexisting different coding styles in ReaR  
are a good sign of a healty/open/free culture in our project.  
In particular when on the other hand we are strict that  
we only accept contributions where we clearly understand  
what a contribution actually contributes, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3202)

Simply put:  
When we tell our contributors that their own coding style  
does not matter for us but it does matter for us that  
we clearly understand what they actually contribute,  
such a condition should be willingly accepted  
and even appreciated by our contributors.
