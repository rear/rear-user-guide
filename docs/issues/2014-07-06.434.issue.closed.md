Hi

I noticed that after a recovery from Debian testing the system was not
booting because it did not find it‘s root filesystem (changing UUID, new
btrfs filesystem). The problem can be easily fixed by booting with the
Debian installation CD in recover mode and either substitute the old
UUID with the new one or just run `update-grub2`. I tried both methods
on else untouched recovered systems successfully …

So I would suggest that rear chroot‘s into the recovered system and
tries to run `update-grub2`. What do you think?

Normally the UUID should be changed automatically. In which file did
you  
need to change the UUID?

A search for my current UUID brings up the file `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`.

Should be easy to fix. See file
[usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/15\_migrate\_disk\_devices\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/15_migrate_disk_devices_layout.sh).

If it is a btrfs related fs then it is another script handling this (or
not?). You could check the files:

    ./layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13_include_filesystem_code.sh
    ./layout/save/GNU/Linux/23_filesystem_layout.sh

Perhaps, you'll find a clue in there? You should know that btrfs is
still a moving target (development) and the commands might be different
on other flavors of Linux.

@ypid btrfs code has been enhanced in the meantime, so if you find the
time try out rear-1.17.1.

I am afraid that currently I don’t find the time. To be honest, I am not
using rear currently.

@ypid no problem then I just close the issue.
