I have tested ReaR only once with Redhat (recovery was a desaster, I
will write another message to this topic).  
Maybe I have overlooked it in the documentation:

(How) Is it possible to backup+restore ONLY the disk layout with
partitions, logical volumes and filesystems but without content?

Background of my question: I use linuxclone
([https://fex.belwue.de/linuxtools/linuxclone.html](https://fex.belwue.de/linuxtools/linuxclone.html))
to backup my files and need only a disk layout recovery., because
linuxclone cannot handle LVM.

@Framsfex  
I assume that in your

    backup+restore ONLY the disk layout
    with partitions, logical volumes and filesystems
    but without content

"without content" means without a backup of the files.

Use "rear mkrescue" to only create a bootable  
ReaR recovery system that contains info about the  
disk layout with partitions, logical volumes and filesystems  
but without making a backup of the files.

To only recreate the disk layout with partitions,  
logical volumes and filesystems  
but to not restore a backup of the files  
there is the **experimental** workflow 'layoutonly'  
so instead of "rear recover" (that also restores a backup)  
you can try out how far "rear layoutonly" does what you need.  
Because 'layoutonly' is **experimental** it may not (yet) do  
what you need for your particular intended use case.

Note that you are rather outside of what ReaR is usually  
meant to do - which is to recreate a (destroyed) system  
as it was before (as much as possible).

Yes. I should have written it more precise.

This is what I need! Great.

Thanks, I will test it!

Yes, I know, my use case is very special.
