@gozora  
could you also review it because the changes are about EFI?

@wdmsde  
many thanks for your valuable contributions to ReaR!

By the way, I have a question:  
Your
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1853](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1853)
and this one  
are about adding Slackware support in case of UEFI booting.  
Do you know if ReaR works for Slackware when BIOS is used?

@jsmeix  
Thank you for considering my patches for inclusion.

I have not tested with BIOS and had assumed that UEFI was a worst case.
I  
do have other machines to test with and will try a BIOS config. Based
on  
my experience so far I would guess it may only involve tweaks to grub
or  
mkisofs in the BIOS specific logic.

@wdmsde  
I look forward to a pull request from you  
with adaptions to support Slackware also on BIOS!
