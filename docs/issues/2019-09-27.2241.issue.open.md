@aasami  
there is currently no automatism in ReaR that would automatically add  
what is needed by `tar` for special BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
settings into the ReaR recovery system.

When you know what binaries and libraries and other files  
are needed by `tar` when using zstd compression  
you can add them into the ReaR recovery system  
via generic ReaR functionality using config variables like  
COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, and LIBS  
see the default.conf description  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

After "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" you can check things inside the  
ReaR recovery system by using KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes",  
see the KEEP\_BILD\_DIR description in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L128](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L128)  
via chroot $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/  
and then try to run `tar` with the options you like  
to test things inside the ReaR recovery system  
so that you can check more easily and directly  
if all what is needed to run `tar` as you want it  
is included in the ReaR recovery system.

Regarding how BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS  
is actually used for the `tar` command see the scripts  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh)  
and  
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh)

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9e07846b460976084e2bb2bdec01b901c42ec413](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/9e07846b460976084e2bb2bdec01b901c42ec413)  
I added explanatory comments to default.conf  
about backup restore that may fail for things like  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=("--zstd")  
due to missing zstd binaries in recovery system  
(probably also for --lzip --lzma --lzop).

Accordingly this issue is now at least documented  
and because I do not plan to implement an automatism in ReaR  
that would automatically include additional things  
that are needed by tar into the ReaR recovery system  
I close this issue hereby and set the 'needs sponsorship' label.

@jsmeix @pcahyna @schlomo Would it be an idea to switch with next ReaR
release the gzip with zstandard? It is a much better compression
algorithm and faster then gzip too?

@gdha  
I don't know - I have no experience in this area.

I wonder if switching to a newer compression method  
might annoy this or that users who are used to deal  
with the traditional compression method?

For example when they are used to do "some more stuff"  
with their 'backup.tar.gz' files (e.g. move them to some  
other locations and there do something with the backups)  
and then unexpectedly some of them (i.e. the newer ones)  
behave somehow different in this or that cases?

Of course you have to mention it in release notes, so one can be
prepared. ;-)

Since we do so few releases I would actually consider every release a
"major" release, and things are just bound to change.

If we would do monthly releases or such, then we could also afford to be
more conservative with regard to changes and hold some changes back for
a yearly "major" release.

Likely such time ranges look rather different  
from business/enterprise customer's point of view  
who would prefer they could run their systems stable  
for longer than a decade.

Because those SUSE customers pay my salary  
my personal preference is backward compatibility.

I even think that nobody likes  
any change that happens to one  
except of course those few features  
where one is explicitly interested in  
to get things moved forward.

Simply put: "Nothing must change except what I need!" ;-)

I think reducing the disk space requirement by 50% is a good motivation
to change the compression standard, even if it might be perceived as a
breaking change for some users.

However, I think that the change is much less "breaking" than it might
seem because we do assume that the backup archive and ReaR image used
for recovery are always a "matching set". So the actual breaking change
could be that after upgrading ReaR it won't automatically overwrite or
remove the old backup archive that has a different suffix.

Maybe @jsmeix you will feel better if we more often increase the major
version of ReaR to indicate the many significant changes that we make?

OK from me to move forward here  
(at least to find out if unexpected major issues appear).

@schlomo  
thank you for your explanation!

I agree with your reasoning that the backup archive and ReaR image  
used for recovery are always a "matching set", cf. my  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" section in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
what I wrote there about consistency.

For SUSE I keep separated ReaR versions separated  
to help our customers to better deal with possible  
backward incompatible changes, see my  
"Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) RPM packages for disaster recovery"  
and "SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover" sections in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Furthermore I documented it explicitly in the section  
"Version upgrades with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
what one has to consider before upgrading ReaR.

So I think SUSE is reasonably well prepared  
to help customers to deal with possible  
backward incompatible changes in ReaR.

I think the version numbering scheme does not mean much  
(i.e. whether or not it is a "major" version upgrade)  
because whether or not a particular change causes a "major" issue  
for a particular user is often rather unrelated.  
From my experience it happens often that rather small things  
cause a "major" issue for a particular customer because  
in his specific environment some tiny thing is crucial  
and he cannot "simply change" his environment with  
tons of (possibly hidden/unknown) interdependencies.

We could make it a rear optional setting on the command line, eg -gz or
-zstd?

As a compromise, would it be too bad to ask you to include other
compression binaries in recovery image, so one can simply use
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=("--\[zstd|lzip|lzma|lzop\]") and be
sure, that it will have no issues on restore? How much bigger would the
recovery image get if this gets added by default?

I think we would do good by adding the relevant compression helpers by
default as PROGS. This they will come into the rescue system if
available. If not, then selecting a missing compression helper will fail
during mkbackup

I'm against using command line options for things that should be part of
the configuration because that would reduce the consistency of repeat
ReaR interactions.
