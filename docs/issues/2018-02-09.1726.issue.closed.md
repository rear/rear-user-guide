Brought to my attention via gitter: (from @CFCombs)

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.17.2
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Using Multiple Backups for Relax-and-Recover - but I have found the
    issue. The -C option to specific a different configuration file does
    not exist in ver 1.17. I've installed ver 2.3 and the -C works.
    Curious why this change was never called out in the release notes
    anywhere.

In  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-3](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-3)  
I found

<pre>
Product Features
...
Multiple backup methods (read the documentation
https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)
.
.
.
Version 2.00 (January 2017)
...
Multiple backups are now possible (issues #1088, #1102, #1096) - see
the documentation page
https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc
(New)
</pre>

and same in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-2](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-2)  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-1](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-1)  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-00](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-00)  
but not in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-1-19](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-1-19)  
and older.

From my point of view Multiple Backups are sufficiently documented  
since they exist.
