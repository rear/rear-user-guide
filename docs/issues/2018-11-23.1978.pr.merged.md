<!-- -->

    Issue is caused by incorrect, according to PAPR specification,
    bootinfo entity parsing code in grub2.

    In PAPR spec "B.4.1.6.1 Bootinfo Entities" partition and path
    separator (,) is optional and if not present bootinfo may be
    treated as directory and filename components unless it begins
    with number:

      &device;:[&partition;][,]&directory;&filename;

    If (,) is missing and directory begins with a hexadecimal number
    GRUB2 treats this as partition number immediately followed by a
    directory/filename.

    Note that with (,) present in bootpath issue isn't in the case
    as GRUB2 returns empty string for GRUB_PARSE_PARTITIONS. This
    effectively meaning that GRUB2 code requires (,) as mandatory.

    This is a GRUB2 bug, but until it is fixed, we can make the
    message disappear by specifying a comma in bootinfo.txt.

@schabrolles  
I assigned this one completely to you  
because I cannot help with PPC booting issues.

@schabrolles  
if you have currently no time for an expert review,  
I would like to merge it "as is" tomorrow.

@schabrolles It's as simple as making an ISO and booting it :-)

Hi team, I'm currently testing it ... Sorry for the delay, as you say
I'm a bit overloaded and I've completely forgotten to test it.  
I come back to you later this day.
