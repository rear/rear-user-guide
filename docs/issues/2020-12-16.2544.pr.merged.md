##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   How was this pull request tested?

Tested by a customer using ReaR (2.4 version in RHEL 8) with NetBackup
8.2

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

It was found by our customer that when attempting to restore from
NetBackup, bprestore is unable to restore data from NetBackup server:

    EXIT STATUS 25: cannot connect on socket
    bprestore failed (return code = 25)

The fix is to copy the NetBackup PBX (vxpbx\_exchanged) service to the
rescue system and start it on boot before starting NetBackup.
Additionally, it was needed to add the /usr/openv/tmp directory.

The problem was reported for NetBackup 8.2, but the service is
apparently needed even in older versions of NetBackup
([https://www.veritas.com/support/en\_US/article.100031908](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100031908)).
There were fixes for previous NetBackup versions in ReaR reported by
@rmetrich, so I don't know why the problem was not seen at that time.

@pcahyna updates look good to me and these were tested as you mentioned,
so I'm good. Question: no plans to replace rear-2.4 with rear-2.7 on RH
when it would be released?  
@jsmeix any comments from your side before we perform the PR?
