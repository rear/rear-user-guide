-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    If I put a `file://` scheme specification in ISO\_DIR, an error
    occurs and the ISO is not output.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Change as follows  
    `ISO_DIR=file:///mnt/smb` -&gt; `ISO_DIR=/mnt/smb`

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

or paste verbatim text like command output or file content

Should it work? IMO `ISO_DIR` does not support anything else than paths
(it is not a URL but a path), so adding a schema would be superfluous
anyway.

I see, I understand.

However, I looked for an explanation of ISO\_DIR from the official
documentation and MAN page, but found very little explanation.

The only thing I could find, if I had to say, was the following quoted
part.  
It is true that the default value is a directory specification, so I
guess the schema cannot be used.

> Another point of interest is the ISO\_DIR variable to choose another

Upon further investigation, I found a detailed explanation in the
following file.  
For some reason, the explanations were scattered in various places,
which is far from the relaxing feeling I know,  
but anyway, I understood the ISO\_DIR specification. Thanks.

Basically all variables are documented using comments in default.conf.
It is not an ideal form of documentation of course, but it should be
fairly complete.
