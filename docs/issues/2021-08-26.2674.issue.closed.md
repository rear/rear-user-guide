    # This file etc/rear/local.conf is intended for the user's
    # manual configuration of Relax-and-Recover (ReaR).
    # For configuration through packages and other automated means
    # we recommend a separated file named site.conf next to this file
    # and leave local.conf as is (ReaR upstream will never ship a site.conf).
    # The default OUTPUT=ISO creates the ReaR rescue medium as ISO image.
    # You need to specify your particular backup and restore method for your data
    # as the default BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does not really do that (see "man rear").
    # Configuration variables are documented in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    # and the examples in /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ can be used as templates.
    # ReaR reads the configuration files via the bash builtin command 'source'
    # so bash syntax like VARIABLE="value" (no spaces at '=') is mandatory.
    # Because 'source' executes the content as bash scripts you can run commands
    # within your configuration files, in particular commands to set different
    # configuration values depending on certain conditions as you need like
    # CONDITION_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special_value" || VARIABLE="usual_value"
    # but that means CONDITION_COMMAND gets always executed when 'rear' is run
    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.
    # Sets output to an be an ISO file
    OUTPUT=ISO
    # # Specifies CDM as the backup and recovery application
    BACKUP=CDM

@nmaheve The Grub2 creation was successful, however, you have some
missing libraries:

    Testing each binary with 'ldd' and look for 'not found' libraries within the recovery system
    /usr/lib64/eog/plugins/libfullscreen.so requires additional libraries
            libeog.so => not found
    /usr/lib64/eog/plugins/libreload.so requires additional libraries
            libeog.so => not found
    /usr/lib64/eog/plugins/libstatusbar-date.so requires additional libraries
            libeog.so => not found
    /usr/lib64/samba/pdb/smbpasswd.so requires additional libraries

Try to change the following
[entry](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1818)
in the /etc/rear/.local.conf file:

    COPY_AS_IS_CDM=( /etc/rubrik /usr/bin/rubrik /var/log/rubrik /etc/pki /usr/lib64/*)

@nmaheve Please check where on your live system these missing libraries,
e.g. libeog.so, resides. E.g. try  
`find /  -name "libeog.so*"` to find the path. If that path is different
then `/usr/lib64` add it to the variable `COPY_AS_IS_CDM` (in assumption
you are still using `BACKUP=CDM`)

    COPY_AS_IS_CDM=( /etc/rubrik /usr/bin/rubrik /var/log/rubrik /etc/pki /usr/lib64/*

we have commented the backup=CDM

@nmaheve If you comment out `BACKUP=CDM` then the line `COPY_AS_IS_CDM`
will not be used. And, did you forget to end it with `)` ?  
Within ReaR everything is a bash script, so you can test it with
`bash -n /etc/rear/local.conf` (should not complain).

What is the content of ` ls /etc/ld.so.conf.d/` ? I think within ReaR
root fs the /etc/ld.so.conf file is missing a library path. For example,
for Legato we had to add something like
`/usr/share/rear/build/NSR/default/550_add_nsr_libs_to_ldsoconf.sh` to
add some missing library paths. Could be an equivalent issue.

Concerning the original issue.

> Can you confirm package grub2-efi-x64-modules is present on your
> system? See also issue \#2600

There are several reports of the same issue, like \#1193 and \#2524 . As
you can see from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193\#issuecomment-451450705](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193#issuecomment-451450705),
I proposed to add a warning that hints what package to install, but at
the end a more generic message was chosen:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193\#issuecomment-452617591](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193#issuecomment-452617591)
that does not mention the specific package:

> If we detect something is missing, we will not tell the user what
> software package  
> (e.g. a rpm or deb package or whatever else) he must install to get
> the missing piece  
> because we cannot continuously track and maintain for all those
> various kind  
> of different Linux distributions what particular software package
> provides  
> what program or file in what version of each Linux distribution.

@pcahyna  
to avoid misunderstandings:

My statement in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193\#issuecomment-452617591](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193#issuecomment-452617591)  
that we will not tell the user what software package is missing  
was meant for the generic code in ReaR, cf. what @gdha wrote in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193\#issuecomment-451450705](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1193#issuecomment-451450705)  
"if we decide to add this we should verify the OS version".

So we could have distribution specific code provided:

Distribution specific code is properly conditioned.  
See the `SetOSVendorAndVersion` function in lib/config-functions.sh  
what variables are set how to which vaules to distinguish between  
different distributions and distribution versions.  
See layout/prepare/Linux-s390/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh  
for an example of distribution specific code inside a script.

AND

There is someone who continuously tracks and maintains  
distribution specific code to keep it up to date in the future.

By the way as an additional side note  
in general regarding the word "WARNING" in messages see  
[https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)

and the subsequent comments therein.

@jsmeix thanks for the clarification, this separation of
distribution-specific code makes sense. I will resubmit the change in a
way that respects the separation.  
Concerning WARNING, I think it can be justified if it explains an error
that is expected to happen in the next step (so that in the output you
see the error immediately preceded by the warning that explains its
likely cause and action to take). Of course, the explanatory message
could be printed only when the actual error occurs, but then it will be
harder to maintain it separately in a distribution-specific code.

@nmaheve,

Please update your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the `local.conf` file to
include:

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/bind9-export:/usr/lib64/eog:/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/lib64/samba:/usr/lib64/firefox:/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/haw key:/usr/lib64/mutter-4"`

In general FYI regarding LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:

In general using LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is known to cause troubles, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907\#issuecomment-434215448](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1907#issuecomment-434215448)  
which links to  
[https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page\_id=1180](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=1180)  
"LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH – or: How to get yourself into trouble!"  
which further links to  
[http://xahlee.info/UnixResource\_dir/\_/ldpath.html](http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html)  
"Why LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is bad"

In particular using `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="..."`  
is usually really bad, see  
[https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page\_id=1180](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=1180)  
that reads (excerpt)

    Do NOT do:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib1:/path/to/lib2:/path/to/lib3
    $ ./myprog

    since this will pollute the shell environment for all consecutive commands!

    Never put LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your login profiles!
    In that way you will expose all the applications you start
    to this – probably problematic – path!

@nmaheve can you post an update on how you were able to create the ISO
on the original server?

I spent some time with the team this afternoon after they were able to
create an ISO from the RHEL 7.9 server. Attempting to recover presented
some additional challenges though.

Appended to the default /etc/rear/local.conf was:  
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/bind9-export:/usr/lib64/eog:/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/lib64/samba:/usr/lib64/firefox:/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/hawkey:/usr/lib64/mutter-4"`

After the recovery attempt the logs showed the following:

Hello Support ,

We were facing issue while creating the As per Redhat recommendation, we
uninstall the rear packages provided by Rubrik and install the required
packages from Redhat repository. Then , tried to create backup using CDM
backup option and run command rear -v mkresuce to create ISO on path
/var/lib/rear/output. It ran successfully without any errors and ISO
image has been created as backup on the server.

Please refer the attached case history

I am seeing data on the system,

The system is not booting apparently, let' have you do the following:

1.  Check to make sure boot files exist under:

ls -al /boot
============

1.  Check the grub.conf file for EFI

ls -al /boot/efi/EFI/redhat
===========================

cat /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.conf | grep vmlin
===============================================

1.  If these exist and there are boot file, let's have you re-install
    grub.

Hello Team,

the server got crashed and can't fetch any log from the server.

Please suggest an alternate solution as I have already sent the
screenshot of the issue.

So is the error in the screenshot from the restored system or from when
you boot from the ReaR ISO?

Also if the error is from the restored syste, you can try to rescue mode
to retrieve the log files and then enable networkign to pull those files
off.

(sosreport, vmcore, etc.) -  
[https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405661](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405661)

ENABLE NETWORK IN RESCUE MODE:

       You may need to activate networking in rescue mode in order to move the sosreport to a system than can uploade to red Hat, I have provided instructions below:

Please feel free to update the case with any comments, concerns, or
feedback on the above.

Hello Team,

It looks like it is not even booting up to the ReaR recovery menu.

Have you tried booting the ISO made that is non-CDM?

It should boot to a menu at least asking for restore options.

Maybe attach the rear logs made when you made the CDM backup and I can
check the log files when it created the ISO to see if there are any
warnings/errors, thanks.

Please let me know, thanks.

Hello Team,

Glad to hear it, now go ahead and try the backup using the CDM backup
option.

If that works then you should be able to continue forward.

Hello Team,

From everything I am seeing in the logs and the packages, I am thinking
there is a conflict with how ReaR was originally installed.

Since it was not installed from a Red Hat repo initially we may have a
file that was not updated when the Red Hat version was installed.

We may need to remove ReaR and then manually re-move all the remaining
components.

I am thinking the previous ReaR install has an extra script that is
running, specifically the script: \[
/usr/share/rear/init/default/010\_EFISTUB\_check.sh \]

Since when I check the rear package:

rpm -q rear
===========

rear-2.4-13.el7.x86\_64

rpm -q rear --filesbypkg | grep -i 010\_EFISTUB\_check.sh
=========================================================

\[ NO RESULTS \]

So the rear is seeing this script and trying to run it, BUT, the version
of rear is not expecting that file to exist.

So let's remove rear and then clear out all the rear files, then
re-install it:

1.  Remove Rear

yum remove rear
===============

1.  Clear out all extra rear files:

Make a backup of them first:

tar -czvf /tmp/rear\_backup.tgz /etc/rear /usr/sbin/rear /usr/share/rear /var/lib/rear
======================================================================================

Remove all rear files:

You can either manually clear out the following files/directories;  
/etc/rear  
/usr/sbin/rear  
/usr/share/rear  
/var/lib/rear

Or run the following commands:  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Be VERY VERY careful as using "rm -rf" with the wrong
options can remove files you didn't intend to

rm -rf /etc/rear
================

rm /usr/sbin/rear
=================

rm -rf /usr/share/rear
======================

rm -rf /var/lib/rear
====================

1.  Re-install the rear package:

$ yum install rear

1.  Try another "baseline backup" with newly installed rear.

Thanks.

Hello Team,

Let's have you run the following ( with the CDM still excluded and a
"baseline ReaR config )

rear -D -v mkbackup

The "-D" option should provide more debugging info in the log file,

Can you try a test backup using the example provided in this document:

Which has information on how to troubleshoot on ReaR and Rubrik

Let's Also get an rpm -Va to verify the integrity of all the package
files on the system. ( especially the ReaR files )

The following command will run an rpm -Va and output into /tmp.

Please upload/attach the generated file \[ /tmp/rpm\_va.out \] to the
case for further analysis.

RHEL 7/8

rpm -Va &&gt;/tmp/rpm\_va.out
=============================

Once you have generated the file please upload the file: \[
/tmp/rpm\_va.out \] to the case.

If you would like to analyze it yourself you can check it against this
Legend from the rpm man page.

LEGEND: ( source: rpm -Va )

       S file Size differs
       M Mode differs (includes permissions and file type)
       5 digest (formerly MD5 sum) differs
       D Device major/minor number mismatch
       L readLink(2) path mismatch
       U User ownership differs
       G Group ownership differs
       T mTime differs
       P caPabilities differ

If you want to check which packages associated with those files are
flagged you can run either of the following commands:

To get the full package name: ( command ran on same system the
rpm\_va.out was generated )

awk '$2 !="c" {print $NF}' /tmp/rpm\_va.out | xargs rpm -qf 2&gt;/dev/null | sort -u
====================================================================================

To get the package name: ( command ran on a different system than the on
rpm\_va.out was generated )

awk '$2 !="c" {print $NF}' rpm\_va.out | xargs rpm -qf --qf '%{n}.%{arch} \\n' 2&gt;/dev/null | sort -u
=======================================================================================================

If you think replacing/reinstalling the package will correct the issue,
you can run the following commands:

RHEL 5/6/7 System:

yum reinstall &lt;package\_name&gt;
===================================

If the issue is with package file permissions you can run the following
commands or follow the guide below:

Sets user/group ownership of files in the given package.

rpm --setugids &lt;package\_name&gt;
====================================

Sets permissions of files in the given package.

rpm --setperms &lt;package\_name&gt;
====================================

IMPORTANT: You must run "--setuguids" BEFORE running "--setperms"

How do I restore permissions of all the rpm packages on system to

Hello,

My name is Meredith Kielian,

I am a member of the Red Hat North American team and I will be assisting
on this case.

Let's check to make sure rear packages are installed:

$ cat
sh\_-c\_rpm\_--nodigest\_-qa\_--qf\_NAME\_-*VERSION*-*RELEASE*.*ARCH\_INSTALLTIME\_date\_awk*-F\_printf\_-59s\_s\_n\_1\_2\_sort\_-V
| grep -e rear -e genisoimage -e syslinux  
genisoimage-1.1.11-25.el7.x86\_64 Wed Aug 18 13:39:25 2021  
syslinux-4.05-15.el7.x86\_64 Thu Aug 19 10:28:56 2021

Okay so it looks like you are missing the "rear" package.

You will need to install it:

yum install rear genisoimage syslinux

@nmaheve, It looks like the issue you are having now, as shown by the
screenshots posted by @marcus9467, is with reformatting the disks on the
recovery system. This is a not something that CDM does, but is part of
the core ReaR code. Since this is not a CDM related issue, the people on
this issue thread may not be able to help. Please create a new issue on
this repo with the screenshots and description that @marcus9467 posted
so that others who deal with that part of the ReaR code can help.

@nmaheve can this issue be closed for you?

I think
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2747](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2747)  
also fixes the CDM related parts in this issue here.

I am facing a similar error, however I am running oracle linux 8.7. I do
have grub2 utils installed. I have updated my LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH as
stated in the thread above but still have the same error. How do you
want me to proceed with a new issue or ?
