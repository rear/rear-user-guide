-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The previous code was appending a "p" to the device name
unconditionally, which ended up having partition names such as 'wwidp0'
instead of 'wwid1', when the device name (e.g. 'wwid') ended with a
letter and not a digit.  
The new code applies the proper naming, which is 'wwid1' when device
doesn't end with a digit (e.g. 'wwid'), and 'wwid0000p1' when the device
(e.g. 'wwid0000') ends with a digit.

See also [When WWID does not end in digit, no `p` is added to the
partition name of a multipath device in
RHEL7](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2354631)

@rmetrich  
it seems you could simulate and test multipath things via QEMU.  
If yes, is there an explanatory description how to do that?  
I.e. how to setup a VM to simulate a multipath system  
on a usual workstation that has no multipath hardware.  
I do not setup KVM/QEMU VMs via command line  
but I use only the graphical UI of virt-manager.  
Is it also possible to setup a VM with virt-manager  
that simulates a multipath system?

Yes you can, it's easy, at least on RHEL :-)

When you create the VM, specify to use a RAW disk instead of QCOW2 and
make sure SCSI controller is used instead of VirtIO. Also make sure to
not use Cache mode, set a Serial number for the disk and select
Shareable.  
Finally add an additional disk, reuse the previously created disk and
set the cache mode to None and set Serial number to same value, and you
get your Multipath.

Example of XML:

        <disk type="file" device="disk">
          <driver name="qemu" type="raw" cache="none" discard="unmap"/>
          <source file="/var/lib/libvirt/images/multipath9-recovery.img"/>
          <target dev="sda" bus="scsi"/>
          <shareable/>
          <serial>0000</serial>
          <address type="drive" controller="0" bus="0" target="0" unit="0"/>
        </disk>
        <disk type="file" device="disk">
          <driver name="qemu" type="raw" cache="none" discard="unmap"/>
          <source file="/var/lib/libvirt/images/multipath9-recovery.img"/>
          <target dev="sdb" bus="scsi"/>
          <shareable/>
          <serial>0000</serial>
          <address type="drive" controller="0" bus="0" target="0" unit="1"/>
        </disk>

@rmetrich  
thank you so much for your description!

I will try it out as soon as possible  
i.e. when time permits - which may take some time  
because currently I am messed up with overhyped  
security excitement about cups-browsed when some  
fools run it accessible from untrusted networks  
like the public Internet, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS\_and\_SANE\_Firewall\_settings\#Automated\_print\_queue\_setup\_via\_cups-browsed](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_and_SANE_Firewall_settings#Automated_print_queue_setup_via_cups-browsed)

I think it is ok as a quick fix, but in longer term I would very much
prefer to get rid of fragile text manipulations like this (note how many
code branches there are and how many conditions they depend on). I
believe the format of the partition device name can be determined from
the layout, e.g. the layout contains

    part /dev/mapper/362cea7f0a24d79002c16131a09f376a1 2199022206976 1048576 primary none /dev/mapper/362cea7f0a24d79002c16131a09f376a1p1

so we know that the partition prefix is
`/dev/mapper/362cea7f0a24d79002c16131a09f376a1p` , if we know what
suffix to substract, and this can be done quite easily by adding the
partition number (`1`) to the layout as an additional field.

Regarding a future generic cleanup to get rid of fragile code:

@rmetrich @pcahyna  
could you please attach your disklayout.conf files  
(or excerpts of the relevant data in disklayout.conf)  
for each of the different cases that you mentioned here  
because I fail to imagine how your disklayout.conf  
exactly looks like for all those different cases.

I like to understand to what extent we already know  
in disklayout.conf for each child (partition) device  
what its parent (disk/mpath) device is.

Because if we knew them like

    parent (disk/mpath) device         child (partition) device
    0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000a          0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000a1
    0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000a          0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000a2
    0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000           0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000p1
    0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000           0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000p2
    mpatha                             mpatha1
    mpatha                             mpatha2
    disk0                              disk0p1
    disk0                              disk0p2
    362cea7f0a24d79002c16131a09f376a1  362cea7f0a24d79002c16131a09f376a1p1

we could generically determine what the used  
"partition separator string" is (which could be empty)  
by subtracting from the child (partition) device  
all trailing numbers (i.e. the partition number) and  
also subtracting the leading parent (disk/mpath) device.

When we know what "partition separator string" is used  
(the "partition separator string" could be empty)  
we can append it in any case to parent (disk/mpath) devices.

Ah!  
So it seems the problem appears when the ReaR recovery system  
with its disklayout.conf of the original system  
is booted on different replacement hardware and then  
it can happen that on different replacement hardware  
a different "partition separator string" is used  
than what was used on the original system  
which is in this case here

    multipath /dev/mapper/0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000c 21474836480 msdos /dev/sda,/dev/sdb
    part /dev/mapper/0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000c 1073741824 1048576 primary boot /dev/mapper/0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000c1
    part /dev/mapper/0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000c 20400046080 1074790400 primary lvm /dev/mapper/0QEMU_QEMU_HARDDISK_0000c2

so the "partition separator string" on the original system  
was empty in this case but on the replacement hardware  
a different "partition separator string" gets used  
like 'p' or '-part' or '\_part' or whatever.

Do I understand it correctly?

If I understand it correctly I wonder  
what the reason is why on different replacement hardware  
a different "partition separator string" may get used?

I.e. what conditions or settings or automatisms  
determine what "partition separator string" gets used?

I understand that a "partition separator string"  
needs to be inserted when the parent (disk/mpath) device  
ends with a number to separate the partition number but  
I do not yet understand how on different replacement hardware  
the parent (disk/mpath) device naming scheme can be different  
(i.e. with or without a number at its end)  
compared to the original system?

It's just that I was on a short holiday - but after that I found some
things that are unclear with the code.

@rmetrich and what happens if neither condition matches? I don't see any

A side note for the fun of it:

What a pleasure for me to see how unclear code can be  
for others who did not make a specific piece of code  
(even when they are experienced with a project's code)  
without comprehensive and explanatory comments ;-)

So the basic reasoning in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#code-must-be-easy-to-understand-answer-the-why](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#code-must-be-easy-to-understand-answer-the-why)

    Even if all is totally obvious for you, others ...
    may understand nothing at all about your code ...

is (at least to some extent) true.

> device name change

Ah ok, thanks. Line 1085 (former 1071) is quite confusing then.

It is not a question of comments in this case, the problem is that the
structure of the code - the other branches and especially line  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ba835cd47f6abb97ff08814e24f6eb8fa016c1eb/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh\#L1071](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ba835cd47f6abb97ff08814e24f6eb8fa016c1eb/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh#L1071)  
indicates that all cases need to be covered (there is always an `else`
or a default case) and the new code breaks this pattern.

It's debian code, I didn't change this code because i have no debian.

Sorry, I meant line 1071 (former 1085) - this is not for Debian, it is
the default case.

Yes, I see,  
it is not a question of comments in this case  
but in general a question of the basic ideas in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I think in this case it is (at least also) a question  
of basically meaningless variable names like

    part_name="$device_name"

where that line of code on its own tells  
(at least to me) nothing what it is meant to do.  
So one must reverse engineer major code parts  
to build up some idea what it may actually do.

But this is not something @rmetrich introduced  
so he should not be made responsible here  
to clean up and overhaul old code.
