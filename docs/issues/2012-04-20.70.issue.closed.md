When the disk recovering to is full for example, rear does not inform
the user about this "soft" tar-error. tar runs through the whole archive
with errors. Everything looks fine until you boot your system. Only when
there are necessary files missing for restoring the bootloader for
example, then you see errors that are related to these functions, not
that the disk is full.

AFAICT from the log file I cannot find any tar "soft" errors. Did you
find these in `tmp/dc-vserver-install-restore.log` ?

In order to see what we can do about them, I need that information.

No, there is no error in the logfile. And also not on the screen. I
remember now, the error was visible in the logfile where tar writes its
verbose out to. I'll have to get this. I will run the test again...

I cannot reproduce it... rear shows an error no.2 during archive
operation. I'm really sure I've seen this problem but i dont trust
myself anymore :-)
