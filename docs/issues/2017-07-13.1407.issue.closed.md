hi there,

as our internal Power8 System has now some spare LPAR i can use, so i
have the chance  
to do some testing with REAR on Power.

Im using the latest head git checkout.  
Installed is a SLES11 SP4 for Power.

REAR creates the ISO Image using mkisofs like the following:

    2017-07-13 05:36:24.792446132 Wrote ISO image: /root/rear/var/lib/rear/output/rear-sles11ppc64fix.iso (58M)
    [..]

but the resulting iso image is neither bootable in qemu-system-ppc64 OR
on the real lpar itself.  
Investigation shows that yaboot is missing in the iso image entirely:

    sles11ppc64fix:~/rear/usr/sbin # mount -o loop /root/rear/var/lib/rear/output/rear-sles11ppc64fix.iso /tmp/mnt/
    mount: block device /root/rear/var/lib/rear/output/rear-sles11ppc64fix.iso is write-protected, mounting read-only
    sles11ppc64fix:~/rear/usr/sbin # tree /tmp/mnt/
    /tmp/mnt/
    |-- etc
    |   `-- yaboot.conf
    |-- initrd.cgz
    |-- kernel
    `-- ppc
        |-- bootinfo.txt
        `-- chrp

As far as i understand the chrp boot process the power system in a first
step looks at a created  
file ppc/bootinfo.txt which is correctly created in the filesystem
layout of the REAR build directory:

     cat /tmp/rear.Pya6Ddji9I2bcRb/tmp/ppc/bootinfo.txt 
    <chrp-boot>
    <description>Relax-and-Recover</description>
    <os-name>Linux</os-name>
    <boot-script>boot &device;:\yaboot</boot-script>
    </chrp-boot>

however, the referenced bootloader yaboot is not placed anywhere on the
created iso image.  
As such the power system is not finding any valid bootloader and fails
with no operating sytem found.

I was able to make the iso file bootable by doing the following:

1.  copy kernel, yaboot and initrd.cgz to the build directorys ppc
    folder:

<!-- -->

    /tmp/rear.Pya6Ddji9I2bcRb/tmp/ppc/
    |-- bootinfo.txt
    |-- chrp
    |-- initrd.cgz
    |-- kernel
    `-- yaboot

1.  change bootinfo.txt to append \\ppc\\ to the path:

<!-- -->

    <chrp-boot>
    <description>Relax-and-Recover</description>
    <os-name>Linux</os-name>
    <boot-script>boot &device;:\ppc\yaboot</boot-script>
    </chrp-boot>

1.  create iso image by using:

/usr/bin/mkisofs -v -o /tmp/test.iso -U -chrp-boot -R -J -volid
RELAXRECOVER -v -graft-points etc=etc ppc=ppc
/tmp/rear.Pya6Ddji9I2bcRb/tmp/ppc/kernel ppc/initrd.cgz

then the resulting ISO image can be booted both on the real LPAR and in
qemu-system-ppc64

So basically what i did not yet discover is:

1.  why is yaboot missing in the created iso image (probably ppc=
    specified the folder to look in)
2.  why is it not happening on other systems? (other genisoimage
    verison?)

I guess mkisofs is simply ignoring the yaboot executable in the build
dirs tmp directory ..  
Yaboot is within the rear build directory but is not put on the iso
image for some reason:

    sles11ppc64fix:/tmp/rear.wBJNqEyYRNSbHYB # tree tmp/
    tmp/
    |-- boot
    |-- copy-as-is-exclude
    |-- copy-as-is-filelist
    |-- etc
    |   `-- yaboot.conf
    |-- initrd.cgz
    |-- kernel
    |-- mappings
    |   `-- routes
    |-- parted
    |-- partitions
    |-- partitions-data
    |-- partitions_unsorted
    |-- ppc
    |   |-- bootinfo.txt
    |   `-- chrp
    `-- yaboot

changing default.conf to:

     # which files to include in the ISO image
    -ISO_FILES=()
    +ISO_FILES=(yaboot)

makes the iso image bootable by default. But i think yaboot must be a
default setting  
in case of PPC.

I think the relevant part here is:

/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ppc64/300\_create\_yaboot.sh

it can be seen that on RHEL Systems yaboot is copied to:  
\\ppc\\chrp\\yaboot  
on SLES systems, it is copied to  
\\yaboot

the ISO\_FILES variable is set to:

ISO\_FILES=( "${ISO\_FILES\[@\]}" etc=etc ppc=ppc )

these options end up in the -graft-points options to mkisofs, which
defines what files should be  
added to the iso image.

this will work on RHEL systems, but not on SLES Systems.  
So in case Of SLES the ISO\_FILES variable must be changed accordingly
otherwise yaboot will be missing from the iso image.

Btw, im not sure why RHEL uses another path on the iso image for the
yaboot loader than SLES does. It should be no matter for both
distributions if yaboot is placed in \\yaboot or \\ppc\\chrp\\yaboot if
bootinfo.txt is created accordingly.

As a side note: i have now also a running SLES 4 SAP instance on this
Power System and it shows the same problem. As it works with version 2.1
i guess the issue was introduced by the following commit in the current
master version:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7124c122f855d83f0e7d373416ed95bc3d9e0cbb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7124c122f855d83f0e7d373416ed95bc3d9e0cbb)

@abbbi

You are right, `/yaboot` is not part of the ISO anymore (may be a side
effect of some big cleaning made for ppc64/ppc64le platform).  
I propose a patch (\#1414) which is now working for me (sles11sp4 on
PowerVM & KVM). Waiting for approval from ReaR team.

@schabrolles

thanks! Is there a particular reason why RHEL yaboot is placed on a
different folder than the suse yaboot?  
Shouldnt it work for both RHEL and SUSE style systems if bootinfo.txt +
place of yaboot are at the same directory?

@abbbi

I think it is to "replicate" the real system.  
SUSE stores yaboot at the root of the PReP partition while RedHat is
should store it inside /ppc in PReP.

You proposition should work as well, but because ReaR rescue media is
just build from the OS (getting kernel, rebuiding initramfs from the
current OS etc ...) I think that using the same philosophy for yaboot
(replicating the original OS behaviour) is may be better. People who
know Suse or Redhat will find the things where they are use to be...  
(it is just a personal view ... feel free to comment feedback)

Thanks to @schlomo, the patch is now merged... @abbbi, tell us if
everything works now fine on your side.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1414](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1414)

this issue should be fixed.

@schabrolles  
as always many thanks for all your work and contributions  
that make ReaR working better and better on POWER!
