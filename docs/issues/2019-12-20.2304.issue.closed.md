Do you plan to attend FOSDEM 2020?  
If yes, we could talk to each other in person there!

I am not going to FOSDEM unfortunately. Is anybody among you going to
DevConf in Brno?

@pcahyna  
I am not going to DevConf in Brno.  
On a quick first glance it seems there is nothing on  
[https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/](https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/)  
that matches disaster recovery or backup or even ReaR.

it seems your recent comment

@jsmeix  
Sorry about the rotten format of the emails I send -- some brilliant
idea of our IT Dept. :-/ I don't have any control over this,
unfortunately. The original message body is converted into an attachment
-- go figure.

In any case, here was my reply to your message:

> Yes, I'll do my best to attend (would be a shame not to, as I live
> close  
> by ;-) ), and I would indeed welcome the opportunity to meet you and

> Can you please tell me where and when I can expect to find you?
>
> Cheers. Bye.

@petroniusniger  
you can find us (in particular @gdha and me )  
in the "Backup and Recovery" devroom on Saturday 01. Feb. 2020  
which is `Room: UD2.119` according to the current  
[https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/backup\_and\_recovery/](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/backup_and_recovery/)  
where the `UD2.119` link points to  
[https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/room/ud2119/](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/room/ud2119/)  
where a `Building: U` link is that points to  
[https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/buildings/\#u](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/buildings/#u)

More general info about the location `ULB Campus du Solbosch`  
is on UBL pages like  
[https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-access](https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-access)  
and  
[https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-directions/solbosch](https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-directions/solbosch)  
and  
[https://www.ulb.be/en/solbosch/campus-map](https://www.ulb.be/en/solbosch/campus-map)  
but currently I fail to find a map of the rooms inside the `U` building.

I remember from former FOSDEM visits that finding the right room  
inside a building was sometimes a somewhat advanced task for me  
(I guess Belgians may have extradordinary habits of room counting  
or Germans have extradordinary expectations of room counting ;-)

Many thanks for this information, Johannes. I'll meet you there.  
I'm familiar with the Campus du Solbosch, having studied there too many
years ago. I can confirm its buildings can be labyrinthine.

After FOSDEM 2020 is before FOSDEM 2021  
so I look forward to seeing you at FOSDEM 2021!
