-   Brief description of the issue.  
    After recovering my system I've got the message in the attached file
    but even though I was able to reboot it, I saw that the warning msg
    is showed if /etc/yaboot.conf file is not present but that is not a
    valid criteria to assume that there is no bootloader.  
    ![no-bootloader-warning](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12053180/14460580/a0e4f9f4-0094-11e6-83f3-84b5d0b04e0d.png)
-   Work-around, if any

@jsmeix Could you take this issue with you as you already have a similar
case (issue \#817)

I cannot do much here myself because I have basically  
zero personal knowledge about the PPC architecture  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/817\#issuecomment-208204721](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/817#issuecomment-208204721))  
which means I cannot fix the yaboot related code myself  
but I will take this issue at least as a "caretaker".

Due to time pressure (for new release) and lack of interest of the
community we push this feature forward.

I had the same problem with a SLES11sp4 installed with LVM layout for
the system.  
If it is the case here (/boot included in / in a LVM volumegroup), I
propose a patch here: \#1061
