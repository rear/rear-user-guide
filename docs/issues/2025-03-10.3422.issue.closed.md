When I run restore my system with ReaR it fails to boot afterwards.

How can I resolve it so it won't act this way?

The platform is Debian 12 and architecture is 64bit.

The local.conf content is:

OUTPUT=USB  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( "os" )  
USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE="1000"  
KERNEL\_CMDLINE="noip unattended"  
USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT=15  
USB\_RETAIN\_BACKUP\_NR=1  
COPY\_AS\_IS+=( /root/scripts )

The destination disk is nvme

@AmosMes  
I am not at all a UEFI expert so in general  
I can neither actually help with debugging UEFI related issues  
nor can I fix UEFI related issues (except exceptions).

I added "waiting for info" because I do not understand  
what you are talking about.  
Problably I am somehow dumb or slow witted or whatever  
and all is totally obvious for you and others.  
In this case others who understand what goes on would  
remove the "waiting for info" tag and proceed here.  
But I do not have your particular environment  
so I am just looking at your textual description  
and from what I read I can not at all imagine  
what exactly happens in your specific case.

FYI:  
There is no such thing as "UEFI BIOS", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276\#issuecomment-558641223](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2276#issuecomment-558641223)

    to avoid confusion I recommend to use the word BIOS
    only if you mean the legacy firmware in PC architecture
    and also when you use the firmware in legacy BIOS mode
    but the word EFI or UEFI if you mean nowadays firmware
    that you use in its native way (i.e. as [U]EFI bootloader)
    and the word firmware as generic name for such kind of software.
    There is no such thing as BIOS that is UEFI capable
    (old BIOS does not support [U]EFI) but there is firmware
    that supports UEFI but can also run in legacy BIOS mode.
