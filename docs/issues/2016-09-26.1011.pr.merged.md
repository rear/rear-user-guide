The new script  
build/GNU/Linux/63\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh  
replaces in case of systemd in the rear recovery system  
/bin/reboot /bin/halt /bin/poweroff and /bin/shutdown  
by scripts that basically do  
"umount -a" and "systemctl --force \[reboot halt poweroff\]"  
to make reboot halt poweroff and shutdown work simpler  
and more fail-safe, see

I tested it on SLES12-SP2-RC2 and with  
63\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh  
I get in the recovery system those scripts:

<pre>
RESCUE g136:~ # cat /bin/reboot
#!/bin/bash
echo umounting all filesystems
umount -vfar &>/dev/null
echo reboot in 3 seconds...
sleep 3
systemctl --force reboot

RESCUE g136:~ # cat /bin/halt  
#!/bin/bash
echo umounting all filesystems
umount -vfar &>/dev/null
echo halt in 3 seconds...
sleep 3
systemctl --force halt

RESCUE g136:~ # cat /bin/poweroff 
#!/bin/bash
echo umounting all filesystems
umount -vfar &>/dev/null
echo poweroff in 3 seconds...
sleep 3
systemctl --force poweroff
</pre>

and

<pre>
RESCUE g136:~ # cat /bin/shutdown 
#!/bin/bash
command=poweroff
for arg in "$@" ; do
    case "$arg" in
        (-r|--reboot) command=reboot ;;
        (-H|--halt)   command=halt ;;
    esac
done
$command
</pre>

which seem to work well for me according to my very first tests.

Hmm - I think running umount verbose but then  
send all to /dev/null is not yet the ultimate solution...

Now I umount actually verbosely.

The more I use it, the more I like it.  
At least for me it seems to "just work".  
But I didn't test on a non-systemd machine.

@gdha  
please do not yet merge it - I like to add some enhancements  
to make 63\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh  
work more fail safe.

Furthermore I ask for feedback if you like my verbose umounting  
or if I should umount silently?

Personally I prefer verbosity (in contrast to the traditional Unix  
behaviour "no news is good news") because I like to see feedback  
from the computer that it is actually doing something and what that is  
(even if that feedback is low-level technical gibberish that I do not  
really understand like kernel boot messages and things like that).

Something is wrong with the test if systemd is not used

<pre>
test -d $ROOTFS_DIR/usr/lib/systemd/system || return 0
</pre>

that I copied from  
build/GNU/Linux/61\_verify\_and\_adjust\_udev\_systemd.sh  
but therin is no comment that explains what that test  
is about so that I probably misunderstood its meaning, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

I tested on a non-systemd machine (SLES11-SP4) in my case  
and I got a $ROOTFS\_DIR/usr/lib/systemd/system directory.

I.e. it seems in the rear recovery system there is a  
/usr/lib/systemd/system directory regardless  
whether or not systemd is used?

...investigating...

It seems the test if systemd is used in  
prep/GNU/Linux/28\_include\_systemd.sh  
is the right one:

<pre>
if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep -q systemd ; then
</pre>

Furthermore it seems  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/10\_copy\_as\_is.sh  
copies the content of skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system  
into the rear recovery system regardless  
whether or not systemd is actually used  
which raises the question what adds that to the COPY\_AS\_IS  
array regardless whether or not systemd is actually used...

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-09-27 12:33](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1011#issuecomment-249851303):

It is not 10\_copy\_as\_is.sh that copies the content  
of skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system  
into the rear recovery system, it is  
rescue/default/01\_merge\_skeletons.sh  
that copies the content of skel/default/  
into the rear recovery system.

This way the rear recovery system becomes 236K bigger  
than actually needed when no systemd is used

<pre>
$ du -hsc $( find usr/share/rear/skel/default/ | grep systemd )
16K     usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/systemd
12K     usr/share/rear/skel/default/run/systemd
196K    usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd
12K     usr/share/rear/skel/default/var/run/systemd
236K    total
</pre>

but that is a different issue.

I fixed the test if systemd is used.  
Now I use

<pre>
# Skip if systemd is not used.
# Because the scripts below need the systemctl executable and because
# via prep/GNU/Linux/28_include_systemd.sh and build/GNU/Linux/10_copy_as_is.sh
# systemctl gets only copied into the recovery system if systemd is used,
# we can test here (i.e. after build/GNU/Linux/10_copy_as_is.sh had already run)
# if /bin/systemctl exists in the recovery system:
test -x $ROOTFS_DIR/bin/systemctl || return 0
</pre>

Now it works for me on SLES12-SP2 with systemd  
and on SLES11-SP4 without systemd.

@gdha  
if you do not object I think I will merge it tomorrow.

@jsmeix looks perfect to! Thank you for the quick fix.

@schlomo  
regarding what happens if 'umount -a' fails:  
I added the explicit 'umount -a' plus 'sync' and 'sleep 3'  
before I call things like 'systemctl --force reboot'  
which is an advantage compared to what was  
done before according to how I understood it in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/953\#issuecomment-249540216](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/953#issuecomment-249540216)

I.e. before there was only plain 'systemctl --force reboot'  
without any explicit 'umount' and any delay to give the harddisk  
a chance to write its caches onto the actual disk.

But again:  
This is all according to my non-systemd-expert  
perception of how things seem to work in systemd.
