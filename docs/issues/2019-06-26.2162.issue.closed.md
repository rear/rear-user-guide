    I use BACKUP=NSR and setup NSRSERVER in site.conf file.  
    This is first backup and the /nsr/res/nsrladb is not exist, also I
    don't use servers file.

When I run rear mkbackup variable NSRSERVER is set to none by script
650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh:

I'm not sure that this should work in that way. There should be some if
statement to detect if NSRSERVER is set or not.

@viper1986  
regarding `BACKUP=NSR`:  
In general there is nothing at all what I could do in case of issues  
with third-party backup tools or any other third-party software  
because I do not have such software on my test systems  
so that I can neither test nor reproduce anything.

The last two adaptions and enhancements  
for `BACKUP=NSR` were done by  
@hpannenb via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2058](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2058)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1584](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1584)

@hpannenb  
could you have a look here?

@viper1986 Please check the script
`/usr/share/rear/rescue/NSR/default/460_save_nsr_server_name.sh` which
should have safed the NSRSERVER content to the file
`$VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server`  
Please run `rear vD mkrescue` for debugging output. It will allow you to
see what really happens in the above mentioned script.

@viper1986 and @gdha: Sorry for answering so late. As far as I can see
the code changes I made do not affect the NSRSERVER variable. In my
environment the NSRSERVER will be automatically detected with means of
the code of `460_save_nsr_server_name.sh`.

@hpannenb Code changes you made? Sorry, are you referring to an older
PR? (And now I'm so late with my answer)

Hello all,  
@hpannenb in 460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh there is a if:

    if [[ ! -z "$NSRSERVER" ]]; then
        : # do nothing
    elif [[ -f $NSR_ROOT_DIR/res/servers ]]; then
        NSRSERVER=$( cat $NSR_ROOT_DIR/res/servers | head -1 )
    elif [[ -d $NSR_ROOT_DIR/res/nsrladb/03 ]]; then
        NSRSERVER=$(grep servers $NSR_ROOT_DIR/res/nsrladb/*/* | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/[;,]//' )
    fi

-   $NSR\_ROOT\_DIR/res/servers - I do not use this file
-   $NSR\_ROOT\_DIR/res/nsrladb/03 - is not exist when there is no
    backup performed before
-   $NSRSERVER - is set to null by script
    650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh which is running before
    460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh

Script 650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh contains line:

    NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )

-   file $VAR\_DIR/recovery/nsr\_server is not exist in my case because
    this is first backup of this server.

I think that script 650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh contains should
looks a little bit different for example  
if file $VAR\_DIR/recovery/nsr\_server is not exist, use variable from
file site.conf or os.conf ... or something like that.

@gdha and @viper1986: What I mean is I did not write the main code for
the Legato Networker and just added few snippets (the NSR\_CLIENT\_MODE)
to the existing NSR workflow.

@viper1986:  
Proposed workaround(s):  
In `650_check_iso_recoverable.sh` comment in the line as follows  
`#NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )`  
or  
use the more sofisticated code snippet taken from `400_verify_nsr.sh`
instead:  
\[...\]

    if [[ ! -z "$NSRSERVER" ]]; then
        Log "NSRSERVER ($NSRSERVER) was defined in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf"
    elif [[ -f $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server ]]; then
        NSRSERVER=$( cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    else
        Error "Could not retrieve the EMC NetWorker Server name. Define NSRSERVER in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf file"
    fi

\[...\]

Please let us know if this working for You. I think a final code change
will be required in the script otherwise Your NSR approach will not work
for anyone.

P.S.:  
I checked the 1st workaround in my company's environment and it is
working as supposed:

1.  Set the `NSRSERVER=testing` in` local.conf`: In script
    `650_check_iso_recoverable.sh` the `nsrinfo -s testing -N ...`
    fails. =&gt; "testing" server does not exist: OK.
2.  Set NSRSERVER to the correct name in `local.conf`: Networker backup
    of ISO works as supposed to. =&gt; OK.
3.  Remove NSRSERVER in `local.conf`: NSRSERVER is gathered from
    `/nsr/resr/nsrladb/... `and Networker backup of ISO works as
    supposed to. =&gt; OK.
4.  Remove NSRSERVER in `local.conf` and re-create `/nsr/res/servers`
    (default in my company: Networker backup of ISO works as supposed
    to. =&gt; OK.

So IMHO removing the line
`NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )` from the script
`650_check_iso_recoverable.sh` in the existing code will not harm the
execution of the NSR workflow.

I do not use NSR but I hope  
with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2271](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2271)
merged  
this issue is fixed.

@hpannenb  
thank you for your fix!
