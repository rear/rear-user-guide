-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Both "rear mkbackup" and "!rear recover" worked well for me  
    with BACKUP=NETFS on SLES12-SP5

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The current working directory when usr/sbin/rear is launched  
is also the working directory of all the other scripts and config
files  
that get sourced via the Source() function in lib/framework-functions.sh

@rear/contributors  
I would appreciate a review.  
When there is none and/or if there are no objections  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon.

Things behave fail-safe if `WORKING_DIR="$( pwd )"` fails  
which results `WORKING_DIR=""` because then  
`cd "$WORKING_DIR"` becomes `cd ""` which succeeds  
without changing the current directory  
at least on my openSUSE Leap 15.1 system:

    # pwd
    /root/rear.github.master

    # WORKING_DIR="$( pwdqq )"
    pwdqq: command not found

    # echo "'$WORKING_DIR'"
    ''

    # cd "$WORKING_DIR" || echo fail

    # pwd
    /root/rear.github.master

I.e. `cd ""` succeeds without changing the current directory  
in contrast to `cd` which changes to the home directory (`/root` in this
case).
