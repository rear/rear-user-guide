-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    In backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh add "bs=1M" to  
    `SPLIT_COMMAND="dd of=$backuparchive bs=1M"`  
    to let 'dd' read and write up to 1MiB at a time to speed up things  
    for example from only 500KiB/s (with the 'dd' default of 512
    bytes)  
    via a 100MBit network connection to about its full capacity

Because adding bs=1M seems to be an improvement in any case, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2369\#issuecomment-621231553](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2369#issuecomment-621231553)  
I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections until then.
