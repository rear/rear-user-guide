System architecture (x86 compatible or POWER and/or what kind of virtual
machine): POWER

Are you using BIOS or UEFI or another way to boot? Use Power HMC SMS

Brief description of the issue:  
We want to have both versions 2.1 and 2.4 installed and used
concurrently.

Is there a way to keep the existing Rear version (2.1) installed on a
production server and install and use the new version of Rear (2.4) to
create the ISO backup so we can restore the 2.4 version in the Disaster
recovery servers?

Thank you.

@suseusr168  
see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1838\#issuecomment-399347056](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1838#issuecomment-399347056)  
how to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
separatedly from within its own separated directory  
in addition to whatever other ReaR that is instelled elsewhere.

When you `git clone` our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
you can `git checkout` any git commit you like so that you can also  
checkout an older released ReaR version (or any other  
particular git commit state you like) out of such a GitHub  
master code repository.

For example to `git clone` our current ReaR upstream GitHub master
code  
and then `git checkout` the git commit that matches the ReaR 2.2
release  
you can do:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.release.2.2

# cd rear.github.release.2.2

# git log --format="%H %cI %s %b" | grep '2\.2' | cut -b-120

You have to somewhat imaginatively search the `git log` output  
for an entry that seems to match a particular ReaR release  
and compare that with the ReaR release dates in the  
ReaR release notes at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/)  
that read e.g. for ReaR version 2.2  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-2](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-2)

<pre>
Version 2.2 (July 2017)
</pre>

so that this git commit entry matches best in this example

<pre>
fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e 2017-07-20T09:51:54-04:00 prepare for release v2.2
</pre>

We can `git checkout` this one (from within the rear.github.release.2.2
directory):

<pre>
# git checkout fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e
Note: checking out 'fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state.
...
HEAD is now at fd13be8f prepare for release v2.2

# git log --format="%H %cI %s %b" | head -n1
fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e 2017-07-20T09:51:54-04:00 prepare for release v2.2
</pre>

i.e. now (within the rear.github.release.2.2 directory)  
you are exactly at the state after this commit:

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -V
Relax-and-Recover 2.2 / Git
</pre>

When you do not like that you can go back to the  
latest ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
(all within the rear.github.release.2.2 directory)

<pre>
# git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was fd13be8f prepare for release v2.2
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

# usr/sbin/rear -V
Relax-and-Recover 2.4 / Git
</pre>

If you perfer to try out the ReaR 2.3 release:  
(all within that same rear.github.release.2.2 directory  
where now that directory name is wrong but it is only its name)

<pre>
# git log --format="%H %cI %s %b" | grep '2\.3' | cut -b-120
37bfa9c8591a69c83ea48bae73b6b0286ac36e8c 2017-12-20T16:22:57+01:00 ReaR 2.3 release 
e4dc19ed2e6640f23bb180579e0ff73e2fdc5f0f 2017-12-20T15:04:13+01:00 Update release nr 2.2 to 2.3
...

 # git checkout 37bfa9c8591a69c83ea48bae73b6b0286ac36e8c
Note: checking out '37bfa9c8591a69c83ea48bae73b6b0286ac36e8c'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state.
...
HEAD is now at 37bfa9c8 ReaR 2.3 release

# usr/sbin/rear -V
Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / Git
</pre>

Of course you can use several such directories in parallel.

@suseusr168  
I noticed right now that you have SLES11  
and - at least on my SLES11 system - I get

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
Cloning into 'rear'...
error: error:1407742E:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert protocol version while accessing https://github.com/rear/rear.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
fatal: HTTP request failed
</pre>

I am not at all a sufficient expert to know about the details behind why
it fails  
but I guess it is related to a change at GitHub that rejects protocols
which are  
no longer considered to be sufficiently secure nowadays like
SSLv3/TLS1  
or things like that.

I think a feasible workaround is to do the `git` stuff on a more modern
system  
(e.g. on SLES12 it works for me) and then copy the ReaR git directory
content  
onto the SLES11 system into its own separated directory.
