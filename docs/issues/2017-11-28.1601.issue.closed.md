-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): rear-2.00-3.el7\_4.x86\_64
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): RHEL 7.4
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): n/a
-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS
-   Brief description of the issue: **UEFI: Cannot boot rescue image
    created on "BIOS" system**

*Description of problem:*  
When creating a rescue image for ReaR on a legacy system (not UEFI), the
image doesn't contain the necessary bits to boot it on a pure UEFI
system.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

1.  Create a rescue image on a legacy system
2.  Try booting a pure UEFI system with the image

*Actual results:*  
Image is not bootable

In general I am always in favour of options so that  
"rear mkrescue" can (if wanted by the user) create  
a huge all in one ReaR recovery system that could  
be used "everywhere" to some reasonable extent  
i.e. on every (replacement) hardware that matches  
sufficiently the original hardware (e.g. not on a  
different hardware architecture).

For example currently things like  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
and  
FIRMWARE\_FILES=( 'yes' )  
are already meant to let "rear mkrescue" create  
a more generally usable recovery system.

But what about the partition layout?
I am afraid that to make a properly
functioning UEFI system one needs more
than to make a bootable ISO.
functioning UEFI system 
</pre>

Yes, that is a second (and separated) step  
that requires a bootable ISO as first step.

... use one same fixed rear recovery system
for various sufficiently similar systems
(i.e. systems where the same rear recovery
system works but the only differences are
in the rear configuration files).
...
Assume one has 100 servers ... of type A
and 200 servers ... of type B, then (I hope)
it is possible to have only one bootable ISO image
for all type A servers and one for all type B servers.

I think actually this enhancement request should be named:  
"BIOS to UEFI migration" and in this case see also

The suggested RAWDISK output method
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578\#issuecomment-346384421](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578#issuecomment-346384421)
with correction
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578\#issuecomment-346875484](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1578#issuecomment-346875484))
already supports BIOS/UEFI dual boot for the rescue image. It
auto-detects installed bootloaders (syslinux/BIOS, syslinux/UEFI, Grub
2/UEFI) and installs one for each boot method if available.

It's not an ISO, of course. And step 2 (migrating the original system
boot, adding an EFI System Partition) would still be required.

Wow!  
I thought ReaR 2.3 is an unusually great step forward  
but now it looks as if ReaR 2.4 could become  
an even more unusually great step forward...

It seems also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/764)  
could be related to simplify all the bootloader code  
so that it is in practice maintainable for the future.

Simplifying bootloader code in ReaR is certainly a good idea. However,
settling on Grub 2 (which I had considered) seems problematic:

-   Documentation is severely lacking (Grub 2 wants to do everything
    automagically but what you get exactly somewhat remains a mystery
    unless you dig deeply into the source code - see [GRUB 2 on a lower
    level](http://www.dolda2000.com/~fredrik/doc/grub2) or
    [Understanding the Various Grub
    Modules](https://www.linux.org/threads/understanding-the-various-grub-modules.11142/)).
-   `grub-mkrescue` seems to create a rescue image for the currently
    active boot method only, which may differ from the one to be used
    for migration.
-   Grub 2 boots slowly in certain configurations (I've seen 5-10 second
    delays compared to syslinux), which may not be an issue for a rescue
    system but is undesirable for a pre-boot environment to unlock disks
    (like the upcoming Opal PBA).

@rmetrich Hi Renaud - are you aware of this BZ report?

@gdha Sure, I reported the issue myself ;-)

In current ReaR the recovery system is specific for the one particular  
system where "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" was run.

In particular the recovery system is specific for the used way to boot  
on the particular system where "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" was run,  
cf. the section "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

My own plan for an unspecified future as time permits is  
to enhance ReaR so that it can alternatively produce a generally  
usable full featured recovery system that runs basically on any
hardware  
just like the usual Linux installation systems behave that you get  
as installation medium from the various Linux distributions,
