Hello,

I discovered for different distros the snapshot releases under
[http://relax-and-recover.org/download/](http://relax-and-recover.org/download/)
are not up-to-date (se example screenshot below). Is this by intention,
problem in the build process(es) or did I miss something in the
discussion(s)?

Regards,  
Holger.

@hpannenb  
as far as I know those snapshots are not done automatically  
(in particular no automated update after a git commit at ReaR upstream).

Perhaps @gdha could tell more about how that works?

In general regarding using current ReaR GitHub master code see the
section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

This is how I do it all the time but I run ReaR only on a few test
systems  
(mostly QEMU/KVM virtual machines on my homeoffice laptop).

@jsmeix Yes. On direct or indirect internet facing compute nodes
(servers, VMs, ...) I would do so as well. Unfortunately this is not the
case here. Obviously it is possible to download the GIT content and
transport it to the affected system, unpack `/usr/share/rear/...` etc.
But a baked/built package is much more efficient and its
installation/troubleshooting much more reproducible.

Would be appreciated very much if an automatic workflow creating the
packages can be implemented to test the current "bleeding edge" version
of ReaR without much manual tasks in a reproducible way.

@jsmeix @hpannenb We used to have a nightly job to build new rpm/deb
after git updates, but we re-used this box for other means. Due to lack
of sponsoring we stopped this activity on a nightly basis.

Not knowing much of the SuSE OBS the issue might be related to
`rear.spec` (as already managed in \#2289). According to
[https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/) the **GPL-3.0**
seems to be deprecated.

I was under the impression this was automagically created via
[OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot)
where download links under **Snapshot releases from Git** are
referencing to as well.

Edit: Ok. Seems to be quiet new OBS can be integrated with GitHub/GitLab
as mentioned in [Continuous Integration with OBS and
GitHub/GitLab](https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/)
This has "beta" state but is heading towards the proper direction.

I never used OBS source services.  
So here my very first attempt:  
I did not understand anything in  
[https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.source\_service.html](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.source_service.html)  
so I did it in script-kiddie mode based on the examples in  
[https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.best-practices.scm\_integration.html](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.best-practices.scm_integration.html)

I made now  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-github-master](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-github-master)  
but that builds only for some recent SUSE systems  
with Fedora\_33 as the only non-SUSE system.

So it seems it could get hard to make OBS source services working also  
for all the other systems.

So I tried a simpler and more manual approach based on manual  
`wget https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/refs/heads/master.zip`  
which resulted  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-snapshot](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-snapshot)  
that builds for all SUSE systems and most Red Hat based systems  
but fails for some Red Hat based systems and  
fails for all Debian based systems.

I cannot fix build on Debian based systems  
because I know nothing about the Debian build system.

@jsmeix @hpannenb It seems to work the OBS workflow after a PR, albeit,
with a new name (see picture):

Bottomline is now we have an automated manner to create ReaR snapshots
after each PR - thanks @hpannenb for the golden tip

@gdha  
I fear it may not work as you assume because  
I think that new rear-2.6.5-1.el8.x86\_64.rpm RPM may come from my above
testing  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-snapshot](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-snapshot)  
because this is what I get as binary RPM from that source package

    # osc getbinaries Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot rear-snapshot CentOS_8 x86_64
    ...
    rear-2.6.5-1.el8.x86_64.rpm

In particular note the special version `2.6.5` which is what I specified
in  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-snapshot/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-snapshot/rear.spec?expand=1)

    # Current snapshots are after ReaR 2.6 and before ReaR 2.7 i.e. between 2.6 and 2.7
    Version: 2.6.5

it did work.

    ...
    rear-2.6-146.git.4317.be8b6ed.master.el8.x86_64.rpm

I think the 'unpublished' in

    # osc results -v home:gdha:Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot:PR-2649 rear | grep CentOS_8
    CentOS_8             x86_64     succeeded(unpublished)

means that this binary RPM is not made available on OBS download
servers.

I removed my testing `Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot rear-snapshot`  
and added `Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot rear-manual-snapshot`  
which builds for all systems.  
The built binary RPMs have rather simple names like

    # osc getbinaries Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot rear-manual-snapshot openSUSE_Leap_15.2 x86_64
    ...
    rear-2.6.5-1.x86_64.rpm

where currently only the special version number '2.6.5' indicates  
it is a state between the current latest ReaR release 2.6  
and the upcoming next ReaR release 2.7.

@hpannenb  
if you like you may try out if RPMs from  
`Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot rear-manual-snapshot`  
i.e. binary RPMs with currently special version number '2.6.5'  
work for you.  
Be careful - I did not at all test those RPMs.

@gdha  
when your automated build works well we could remove that  
`Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot rear-manual-snapshot`  
or we could keep it (perhaps with some enhancements)  
so that we could - if we like - provide RPMs for a certain fixed
snapshot state  
instead of a too much moving target that rebuilds for each upstream
change?

Glad to see You managed the interworking between OBS and GitHub.
Honestly it was just "by accident" I found this SCM integration hint at
OBS. It is rather new.

I am currently checking the Centos\_7 RPM within one of my (K)VMs from
here  
[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/CentOS\_7/x86\_64/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/CentOS_7/x86_64/)  
I will let You know once I installed it.

Edit: Installation of the 2.6.5 RPM works perfectly fine.

@jsmeix I think that the PR github workflow towards OBS is user bounded,
so if you, merge a PR nothing will happen. To make your OBS account
linked to your GibHub account follow the procedure found at
[https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/](https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2021-07-12 08:43](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2645#issuecomment-878090407):

I had never before let computers act on their own on as if they were me.

[https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/](https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/)  
reads (excerpts):

    You have to give OBS permissions
    to report the build status to the pull/merge request to the SCM
    on your behalf.
    For this, you have to create a personal access token.
    ...
    You also have to give your SCM permissions
    to trigger a workflow inside OBS
    on your behalf.
    That’s why you need to create an OBS access token.
    ...
    Tokens are like the keys to (parts of) your house.
    You have to keep your token secret
    to prevent someone else
    from triggering operations
    in your name!

This is a contradiction in itself.  
Via the tokens  
I give the programmers of the SCM (GitHub in my case)  
and the programmers of the OBS  
permissions  
to do things in my name  
because what actually happens is not what I myself do  
but what programmers of those workflows/operations implement  
where I have no control in practice what actually happens  
(in practice I cannot verify their source code).

Of course when I log in at any foreign service and manually do things
there  
I depend on what the programmers implemented for what I do  
i.e. I let their programs run on their servers on my behalf, cf.  
[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html)

The difference - as far as I understand it - is that  
with access tokens I give them some kind of key/password  
while via login at any foreign service and manually do things there  
I do not give them some kind of key/password  
to let them do arbitrary things as if it was me  
(under the assumtion they do not store my clear text login password).

Perhaps it might be acceptable for me if I had a separated robot
account  
where I could specify limited permissions as I like and then  
do such access token things only via the restricted robot account.

Then it could be at least clear what happened via my robot account  
versus what I myself did via my normal user account.

@gdha  
when I made

I noticed that it triggered a rebuild of some rear package in OBS  
home:gdha:Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot...

At

But the commits in this pull request belong to a branch jsmeix-fix2622  
and not to master.

I think only commits to master should trigger builds in OBS  
but not commits to (development work in progress) branches.

On the other hand when pull requests create sepatated OBS projects
like  
home:gdha:Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot:PR-2658  
the additional builds are separated but I wonder where the built RPMs
appear?

does not provide the actual binary RPM.

In contrast when I am logged in at OBS and  
click on that binary RPM "Download" link  
I get the actual binary RPM.

Conclusion:  
When the "Publish Flag" is disabled it means the built binary RPM  
will not appear in a commonly known public accessible repository for
binary RPMs  
but the built binary RPM is still available via a direct "Download"
link  
for prople who can log in at OBS.

I don't know if there are certain restrictions for those who can log in
at OBS  
which binary RPMs they can access via such direct "Download" links.  
Because  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/users/home:gdha:Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot:PR-2658/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/users/home:gdha:Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot:PR-2658/rear)  
lists only  
[https://build.opensuse.org/users/gdha](https://build.opensuse.org/users/gdha)  
as the only user of the OBS project
"home:gdha:Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot:PR-2658"  
I assume everybody who can log in at OBS can get source RPM and binary
RPM  
via those direct "Download" links.

I.e. when the "Publish Flag" is disabled it does not mean  
the source RPM and the binary RPM are not accessible for others.

it seems that automatism has shomehow stopped after pull request 2675.  
I have no idea why because I do not understand how that works.  
I gave up because I could never make it work for me, cf.

As time permits I will update my

Was much easier than expected because I made comments in  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/view\_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-manual-snapshot/rear.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot/rear-manual-snapshot/rear.spec?expand=1)  
how to make its Source0

    # How to make Source0:
    # Download current ReaR upstream GitHub master.zip:
    # # wget https://github.com/rear/rear/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    # Unzip it (unzips into rear-master directory):
    # # unzip -q master.zip
    # Rename the rear-master unzip directory:
    # # mv rear-master rear-snapshot
    # Tar it (use the above 'Version' value):
    # # tar -czf rear-snapshot-2.6.5.tar.gz rear-snapshot
    # Remove master.zip and the rear-snapshot directory:
    # # rm -r master.zip rear-snapshot
    Source0: rear-snapshot-%{version}.tar.gz

so I did that and - voila! - here you are:

For other distributions see what there is under

The RPM package file must be named `rear-2.6.5...`  
in particular its version `2.6.5` indicates it is from the sources in

@jsmeix @hpannenb I am not familiar with this build service at all, but
maybe the openSUSE build targets in Packit \#2823 could provide at least
a partial replacement?

@jsmeix it seems like the snapshot builds again stopped to work, at
least the last RPM in
[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/15.4/x86\_64/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/15.4/x86_64/)
is from last year and the last DEB in
[https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/Debian\_11/amd64/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear:/Snapshot/Debian_11/amd64/)
is also from last year.

It would be nice if we can get the snapshot builds to work again.

I have no personal interest in automated builds and  
in particular not in automated snapshot builds.

My personal reasons:

I do not want to get one single user issue/bug report  
when something does not (yet) work properly in his case  
because it is under development but a blind automatism  
made a useless snapshot build where of course the user  
cannot know he got a (partially) inconsistent state  
(often users blindly install just the highest version).

Automated (snapshot) builds enforce us at ReaR upstream  
to never merge a pull request that requires further work  
by subsequent pull requests until all is properly done  
which means in particular we can never again merge a  
somewhat not yet complete pull request from a user  
who kindly contributed something that works for him  
but does not yet work sufficiently well in general.

I do not want to be enforced to enforce users who  
contributed something to enhance their contribution  
until it works sufficiently well in general.  
In particular not because in most cases I cannot verify  
what a user contributed because I don't have his environment  
or I am busy with other (higher priority) things  
when a user's pull request appears.

As far as I know automated builds require to let computers  
act on their own on as if they were me, see my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2645\#issuecomment-878090407](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2645#issuecomment-878090407)

Users who like to test our current ReaR GitHub master code  
don't need automated snapshot builds, see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2923\#issuecomment-1427820436](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2923#issuecomment-1427820436)  
(excerpt)

    ... everybody can use our current ReaR upstream
    GitHub master code via "git clone" and from there
    also get any needed state before via "git checkout"

As far as I can imagine only users who like to actually use  
our current ReaR GitHub master code ask for snapshot builds  
so that they can install a built software package as usual  
on their systems and use that normally on their systems  
but this is exactly not what they should do with some  
GitHub master code from a random (snapshot) point in time.

@schlomo @rear/contributors and ReaR users:  
if you personally want automated (snapshot) builds,  
feel free to implement it as you think it works best and  
then also continuously maintain what you implemented  
for some years in the future and/or find other ReaR  
upstream maintainers and/or ReaR users who also can  
implement and maintain it or at least help with it.

FWIW:  
I neither have special openSUSE Build Service knowledge  
nor special openSUSE Build Service rights or permissions.  
I am only a normal end-user of the openSUSE Build Service.
