@imagoillusion  
ReaR requires the program 'route' so you need to get that installed.

Its not fixed and you didnt help me at all...First i have iproute
installed and im getting the same error. Before new version of rear
everything worked just fine,now everything is broken. And why you close
my post? Only because you seen that i miss route...that is not help,you
just point obviously.

I am not an Arch Linux user so I cannot tell you what you need to do  
to get the program 'route' installed on your particular Linux
distribution.  
Likely on some Arch Linux help forum you could get that kind of help.
