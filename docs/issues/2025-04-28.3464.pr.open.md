##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    <https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3463>

-   How was this pull request tested?

The Backup Manager integration was tested manually by the Cove team.
Tests were performed on VMware virtual machines for the following
distributions:

-   Debian 12
-   Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04
-   CentOS 7, 8, 9
-   RHEL 7, 8, 9

The ISO rescue image created by ReaR for each distribution was used to
recover or migrate the source system.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

The backup process requires the Backup Manager to be installed in order
to include the necessary shared libraries in the rescue media. It is
supposed that `rear` will be launched by the Backup Manager as an
external program, providing the `COVE_TIMESTAMP` environment variable,
which is necessary to find the appropriate backup session for files and
folders.

The Backup Manager provides the required configuration parameters in the
`site.conf` file, which is installed by the Backup Manager installer.
The Backup Manager supports by default `OUTPUT=ISO`.

After ReaR successfully creates the ISO rescue image, it is backed up as
a regular file by the Backup Manager.

At recovery time, ReaR downloads and installs the Backup Manager on the
partitioned target disks and launches the Backup Manager, which restores
the backed up files and folders.

Hi @schlomo,

Thank you for your comments. Could you please check [this
comment](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3463#issuecomment-2841439427)?
It will likely clarify the integration between the Backup Manager and
ReaR.

However, if you still have questions, Iâ€™d be happy to set up a call to
discuss them.

I see, thank you. I didn't see that earlier comment and it explains some
things.

I'd like to suggest speaking in person for efficiency. After reading
through all of this I'm not sure that you'd actually benefit from that
kind of rest integration over using ReaR as an embedded tool without
modification.

I'm thinking of using PORTABLE output and EXTERNAL backup, together with
a generic other rescue system line Systemrescuecd or such.

I think it might be much simpler and closer to your use case than
teaching ReaR to do your bidding.

My reasoning:

-   adding a backup method that works only with ISO output goes
    massively against the ReaR philosophy
-   ReaR is made to be in control and instrument the backup software to
    recover the files, not the other way around. That is the reason why
    we need integrations. If ReaR is not in control you don't really
    need an integration, just embed it
-   ReaR collects required shared libraries, so no need to implement
    that again. Easier to use rear as intended.  
    ReaR is designed for crying personalized rescue images with a very
    high degree of reliability to successfully perform a recovery. We
    added the portable mode for all use cases that need a generic rescue
    image and recommend against using ReaR to create that (as we don't
    develop and test for this).
-   in professional (data center) environments typically all servers
    with persistent data (pets, not cattle) have lots of RAM and GB
    sized rescue images are unfortunately the norm with most backup
    software (not like the puny 70MB when I started nearly 20 years
    ago). With modern backup systems that is typically not a problem to
    add. Therefore it might be a bit of premature optimization adding
    complexity, or maybe you have a special environment in mind.
-   putting the backup software onto the target disc calls for potential
    conflicts with restoring files onto that
-   if the backup agent evolves quickly we recommend to create a new
    rescue image with every backup run, as a pre task to it. Much more
    reliable than dynamic installations from the Internet during
    recovery IMHO

Out of curiosity, did you try the traditional way of ReaR integration?
Why wouldn't that work? Including auto discovery for the installation
paths etc.?

Anyhow, happy to chat about that in a meeting and I'm sure we'll quickly
figure out what's best for our combined users.

Maybe I don't have the full picture yet and we are committed to make
ReaR the boat useful Linux disaster recovery tool for all.

Kind regards,  
Schlomo

@svlv  
FYI a side note regarding

    we recommend to create a new rescue image
    with every backup run

in <https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3464#issuecomment-2880963296>  
see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore"  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore>  
therein in particular the part about  
(excerpts)

    It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent.

    First and foremost the files in your backup must be consistent
    with the data that is stored in your ReaR recovery system
    ...
    (e.g. the contents of the restored etc/fstab must match
    the actually recreated disk layout).
    Therefore ... each change of the basic system
    ... needs ... to create a new ReaR recovery system
    together with a matching new backup of the files

Hello @jsmeix,

> we recommend to create a new rescue image  
> with every backup run

We actually do this. The recovery system matches the backup files and
folders (it is done via embedding `timestamp` to find the corresponding
backup session for files). But the recovery system does not include the
backup software, and it downloads it from the Internet, I guess it is
the main concern.

The motivation for this approach is that users have backup sessions that
are 1 month or even 1 year old, and they want to use this backups to
restore the system layout. If the rescue ISO image contains the Backup
Manager, it is very likely that the included version will be outdated
and may not work properly. It is not hypothetical example, it is our
real cases.

IMHO downloading the installer from the Internet is at least not bad
idea because

1.  You can update the backup software during the recovery process
2.  The rescue system does not depend on the backup software version

The backup software restore files and folders via Internet why the
installer couldn't be downloaded.

Any way, I understand you requirements for the integration. I will
update the PR to satisfy ReaR standards and requirements regarding the
integration. It will take some time but the logic will be much simpler.

Additionally, I am checking the possibility to use `PORTABLE` output
with the generic rescue ISO image, it looks nice.

@svlv could you share more context for the 1 month or 1 year old backups
that need to be recovered with a newer version of Backup Manager? Where
is it enough to have only seldom backups? Are these special systems that
kind of never change?

Just to understand what is going on: The online download of the backup
client is a workaround for a tight version coupling between backup
server and backup client that would be broken by "older" rescue images
containing an older version of the backup agent?

I'm asking because this scenario didn't come up with any of the previous
backup software integrations...

These are users decision. Users can configure how often they want to
create backups (once per day or even every 15 mins) and how long these
sessions have to be stored (one month, one year, etc.)

Yes, I meant that the included backup agent into the recovery system
might not be backward compatible with the backup server.

Additionally, we are solving issue with outdated certificates for the
backup agent that it is very likely appear. We would need to have a
special tool to somehow update the certificate safely. But I think we
won't have such a tool in the near future.

Additionally, the backup agent uses the database that is used to build
files and folders from data chunks. This database is not supposed to be
included in the rescue system. It might have several GBs of size if
users have a lot of sessions, but it is downloading from the network if
it is not available locally. That is why we decided to move the backup
agent to partitioned disks. In that case the DB is located on the disk,
not in RAM. Thanks to that the recovery process consumes much less
memory (4GB vs 8Gb). RAM consuming is important for us because users
have also quite small VMs (e.g., 2GB of RAM). Why not support them if we
found a way?

I hope, now it is a bit more clear

We are talking about your story here amongst the ReaR maintainers and
got some thoughts:

Is Cove a cloud-only backup tool? Especially in that case I'd like to
suggest a more streamlined approach, but that should also work well with
a local backup server:

-   boot the bare metal recovery system from a generic boot loader
    (somehow, ISO, floppy disk, PXE, whatever)
-   boot the actual rescue system via HTTP(S) over the network. This way
    the client doesn't need to have actual network boot support but you
    can still benefit from the flexibility of it.
-   the backup server / cloud service provisions an up-to-date rescue
    system (with latest certificates, backup agents etc.) on the fly to
    boot the recovery hardware from. You can use initramfs chaining for
    this purpose :-) This skips the update of the rescue image from
    inside and ensures that the resuce image is up to date when it
    boots.
-   This chainloading can be also used to inject credentials or other
    private data
-   Adding CA certificates and the backup manager software can be done
    also via a public URL
-   This way you can guarantee much better that the rescue system is
    truly up-to-date with all what you need
-   This approach will also work well with booting a generic rescue
    system and "adding" ReaR and the required configuration as
    additional initramfs images

About the local disk:

-   Yes, use the local disk for your database if you need to, even
    though it "breaks" the ReaR design philosophy.

However, the ReaR rescue system is till a "personal" rescue system for a
single server. If you don't want that then with the `OUTPUT=PORTABLE`
and `BACKUP=EXTERNAL` methods you should IMHO also be able to simply
integrate ReaR within Cove and use ReaR as a BMR tool.

If you want to continue with the personalised ReaR rescue system, then
I'd like to suggest that you also adopt the proven ReaR concepts like:

-   bundle the backup client and let ReaR handle the library
    dependencies
-   ensure that users create a new ReaR rescue system whenever something
    changes, e.g. the certificates or the backup client. That way the
    ReaR rescue system is guaranteed to 1) be compatible with your
    backup server and 2) be up-to-date and actually function
-   optimise the whole system to have less things that can go wrong
    during recovery, as ReaR does with all the other backup tools
