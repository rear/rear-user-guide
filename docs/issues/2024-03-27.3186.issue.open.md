Hi, this was reported as \#2681 . I know two solutions (besides reducing
the size of the initrd):

-   downgrading grub to a version between 2.02-121.el8 and
    grub2-1:2.02-141.el8 :
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681\#issuecomment-1697073572](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681#issuecomment-1697073572)
-   firmware update (helped on HP hardware, don't know if it will help
    on Dell hardware though)

Hi pcahyna , thanks for your reply  
we are in version grub2-2.02-142.el8\_7.1.x86\_64  
Unfortunatly , we can not downgrade to version 2.02-121.el8 . i ask to
upgrade the firmware of dell hardware in case ..  
but is there an other solution please to charge rear-iso file ?  
in fact we are using rubrik backup as third party backup tools  
thanks

What Dell hardware is it, exactly?

Hello  
i have tested on a cisco platform , and i have this version:
grub2-efi-x64-2.02-150.el8.x86\_64  
And i had no problem with rear iso file to load it .

Someone has any idea why it is not working on Dell Platform , ?

@sathyane007 this GRUB problem is apparently firmware (both manufacturer
and version) dependent, that's why. Have you tried updating it?
