    The cron job from rear has been removed since the update from rear 2.4 to 2.5.
    But how to automate the check for newer recovery media in an older system like RHEL6?

-   Workaround, if any:  
    `Create a own cron job to do this, but is also not working anymore.`

FYI:  
The cron job in /etc/cron.d/rear was removed intentionally via

@dcz01 you can also try to automate rear via ansible, puppet or chef.
This way you can install, configure whatever you like and in a uniform
way

@jsmeix @gdha  
So we need to create our own cron job if we use an operating system
without systemd?  
There will be no fix?

@dcz01  
what is the problem with creating a cron job as you need it  
for your particular use case in your particular environment?

Such things belong to the admin and are within the admin's own realm.

E.g. how should we know that just

    30 1 * * * root /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

is what the admin needs for his use case in his environment?

We (i.e. ReaR upstream) should not mess around with the admin's own
realm.  
Since ReaR 2.5 we do no longer mess around with the admin's own realm  
so what was wrong before is now fixed.

@jsmeix  
Ah ok, now i understand.  
Well then we fix it ourself and provide the old cron job for the rear
checklayout.

@dcz01  
yes, that's how cron jobs should be set up since ReaR 2.5.

@gdha  
in the Release Notes for Relax-and-Recover version 2.5 at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5)  
the "Product Features" section falsely still contains the item

    cron job to check changes in disk layout and trigger rear mkrescue if required

I removed that item in the Release Notes for Relax-and-Recover version
2.6 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/4a7a14cffb64dc9692d7b498ec2776e8923c29ef](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/commit/4a7a14cffb64dc9692d7b498ec2776e8923c29ef)

Would it work when I remove it also in the  
Release Notes for Relax-and-Recover version 2.5  
source at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md)  
or would that be useless now after ReaR 2.5 was already released?

Yes, as it has been removed we better remove that line as well in the
release notes of 2.5. Thanks for pointing this out!
