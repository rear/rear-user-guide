I have been testing rear and have mixed feelings. Anyway, I got this
error and thought I would submit it. I am running OEL6.3.

/boot is set to be at /dev/sda1. I went to the shell and checked that
/dev/sda1 had the boot flag using parted. I also mounted /dev/sda1 and
checked the fs. I was able to see the kernels, etc. I am rebooting off
the rescue cd. I will post the version and other info in a bit.

I am not sure if this is related. But I have been testing rear rescue
from the iso image and I always see this.

Disk configuration is identical, preceding with restore.  
No cide has been genereated to restore device fs:/ (fs).  
Please add code to /var/..../diskrestore.sh to manually install it or
choose abort.

Upon seeing this I usually continue fro the the fs errors. The first I
ran this it looked fine. I then wanted to see if it was truly working,
so I deleted /bin on the server and wanted to see if I could restore.
After that it when I had this issue. Now the server will not boot. It
might be the mbr. I an lokoing for the relax portion of the restore to
kick in. ;)

All these problems are related to this line:

    # lvmvol /dev/vg00 lvol3 512 4194304

Uncomment that line in your rescue image and things should work.

Now on to why it is commented... Can you post your
`/etc/rear/local.conf` and a log of `rear -D savelayout`?

One tip: enclose you data with \`\`\` so it will show up as code.

Looks like the restore did not restore /bin. I mounted /dev/vg00/lvol3
and checked the fs. bin was not restored. I manually restored it from
backup.tar.gz. I then re-ran rear recover, said continue for each

If `/dev/vg00/lvol3` was already excluded during `rear mkbackup` `/bin`
and `/lib` etc will indeed not be in the backup.

@jhoekx I see that now. Nice catch. here's the local.conf. It's rather
simple.

OUTPUT=ISO

I ran rear -D savelayout. I am not sure if the output should have been
to sdout or a file. Sorry. Only just started trying rear yesterday. Lots
to learn.

Config looks good.

You should try to run it with `-D`, not `-d`. Small letter just means
debug which gives extra information and leaves the working directory.
Capital D means super debug with every operation logged.

The output is in `/var/log/rear/rear-<hostname>.log`.

I haven't done any exclusions. /bin is in backup.tar.gz. That is how I
was able to manually restore it.

EDIT: My only exclusions are anything that is not in vg00.

I updated my comment to have -D, typo on my part. The directory
/var/log/rear doesn't exist on the system.

> I have been testing rear and have mixed feelings.

I am personally interested to learn why exactly the mixed feelings, I
can personally think of a few reasons myself, including the fact that it
doesn't work on your first try ;-) But we can learn from impressions
like yours when the feelings are still fresh.

In some cases certain output (e.g. the message ERROR: BUG BUG BUG!) may
not provide confidence to users. This is one of the things I would like
to see changed for the better.

> I wish there was better documentation.

For this also we need to understand where new users get stuck or trip
over. We do have quite some documentation with interesting bits, albeit
in a stale state. We recently restructured all documentation into a
single document and our aim is to rewrite the documentation to catch up
with recent developments. (see \#4 and \#113) You can find the
documentation at:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc/user-guide](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc/user-guide)

We welcome contributions and feedback to our current documentation
though.

@dagwieers Thanks for the doc link. I'll read it over. I was looking at
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/)
and did not see much to work with. The mixed feelings I got were from
what I thought was a lack of documentation (again, thanks for the link).
And from some of the output I get, i.e.

No code has been genereated to restore device fs:

As a first time user, I was having a lot of "huh?" moments. I have to
admit I am more familiar with mondorescue. But stopped using it for
reasons I'd rather not mention. I moved to release 1.13. Going to try
some more restores.

@cocampbe Thanks for the feedback. I agree with you that we could
improve that message. But rest assured, our intention is that users
would not see that message so we have to find "the why" first ;-)

> The mixed feelings I got were from what I thought was a lack of

Right, we are working on that in issue \#113, but holidays interfered
greatly with our schedule :-D

> I have to admit I am more familiar with mondorescue. But stopped using

I am also interessed in the reasons you stopped using MondoRescue
because we can learn from those experiences too, so feel free to share
those (in private if you like). We also have good relations with
MondoRescue and MondoRescue is more advanced in some areas compared to
Relax-and-Recover. The difference in design and approach (from my point
of view) is worthwhile to have both projects and I would hope to
collaborate more closely in the future on certain topics.

PS The Relax-and-Recover project has only recently been undergoing a lot
of progress, so some of the items are still in a state of flux. We are
now focussing on setting up automated testing infrastructure (\#38) to
ensure that regressions on certain platforms with specific use-cases are
a problem of the past. Once this is implemented I expect a surge in
development, and from that point we have more reliable releases and we
can start to document and promote this project more visibly and with
more confidence. We are close to that point, but not yet there.

If you are interested to understand where we are, the issue-tracker
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues))
and the release plan
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/milestones](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/milestones))
give a detailed view of what we would like to do. You may notice the
large set of features we collected for the future. Anyone is welcome to
discuss, implement and provide pull-requests already for any of these,
or request new features.

I checked your log file and it seems that the issue fixed in fd0be7dc is
causing this. Two logical volumes with the same name but in different
volume groups would be excluded instead of only one of them.

Can you test this with a recent trunk build or even release 1.13?

Implemented commit 1bda18844f053bb32f0adf370fb1747c82a9208f and commit
ed5847bd1a6af82b1c06d6999b2f9034911e40f3 to make it easier for users to
analyse and report issues, and hence get support.

@cocampbe We would like to hear back from you whether this issue was
effectively fixed by commit fd0be7dcd5d8796bfa1c73116332d815a0ab1a88. If
you would find the time to test the most recent snapshot release (or
release v1.13.0), please help us ! Thanks in advance !

@dagwieers I plan on doing this tomorrow. I installed 1.13.0-48.

All right. I formatted the drives and am in the restore. I am at 6
selection prompt . I got the message that "An error occured during
layout recreation. In the log there is warning mesage about the kernel
failing to re-read the partition table on /dev/sda. The paritions were
created fine. I veryfied it in the shell. When I press 5 to "continue
restore script" It brings me back to the prompt. It seems to be occuring
because the diskrestore.sh script has not changed.

I added partprobe /dev/sda to the script following the parted lines and
then continued. The restore is working now.

@cocampbe It would help to understand where exactly you added the
partprobe, can you send the log indicating the failure through
[http://gist.github.com/](http://gist.github.com/) ? Thanks in advance !

@jhoekx Advice on how to tackle this one ? Do you agree to add a
partprobe to every (set of) parted ?

So parted does not fail when it displays that warning about the kernel
unable to read the partition table?

Let's just add partprobe then.
