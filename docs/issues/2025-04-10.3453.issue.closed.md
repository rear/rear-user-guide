### Requesting support or just a question

Can I boot from a USB flash, then get the restore from tape?

### Platform

Linux x64

### Description

I think I was able to backup to tape with OBDR,  
but I can't figure out how/if I can boot my server from it.  
Taped Drive is IBM TS2290 and Server is Lenovo SR650V3.  
Can't find out anything from IBM or Lenovo's website.

Writing iso to CD and burning is a pain  
and the servers don't have an internal optical drive,  
so I thought I'd boot from USB flash,  
then let it restore from the Tape.

The USB drive boots into command line,  
I log in as root and run the rescue.  
I get

    ERROR: No 'backup.tar.gz' detected in /var/tmp/rear.blahblahblah/outputfs/rear/servername/*

ls verifies there is nothing under /var/tmp.

Seems like it's looking for the backup data on the local filesystem?

Here's local.conf contents:

    OUTPUT=USB
    TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
    BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
    BACKUP=NETFS

What am I missing?

I've used this before with a network SMB share  
and I was impressed, but this has got me so frustrated.  
Been working with rear for 3 days with various issues  
and have yet to make one successful backup/restore.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

@DebianGuru Could you share the output of `lsscsi` and `lsmod` so we can
see the modules involved around the tape drive.  
According the data sheet of IBM TS2290 we cannot figure out if the drive
is OBDR capable. Perhaps, IBM support can assist you on that point?
Perhaps you need a special software driver or configuration setup on the
drive itself?

Does your system uses UEFI to boot?  
If yes then you first need to format your USB drive as following:  
`rear -v -- --efi /dev/sdb` (assuming /dev/sdb is your USB drive - it
will reformat the **whole** USB disk!)  
If not, use:  
`rear -v format /dev/sdb`

Then edit the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file and define:

    OUTPUT=USB
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    # is the tape rewinded?
    TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/nst0
    BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
    BACKUP=NETFS

Hope this help?

@DebianGuru

first and foremost:  
Using ReaR with tape drives is not something I ever did.  
I never used a tape device with Linux  
so I cannot really help with tape device issues.

In general:  
We at ReaR upstream did not get user issues since years  
regarding using ReaR with tape drives and in particular  
no further user contributions in this area.  
The last one we got was via  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637>  
and even that finally faded away in July 2023  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2637#issuecomment-1620667477>

So all I can provide is some generic thoughts  
what might help in your specific case:

I think the first thing to have in mind is that  
in ReaR the "backup of the system files" part  
is a separated and somewhat "external" part  
of what ReaR's actual task is, see  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore>

For each backup method which is supported in ReaR there is  
a matching usr/share/rear/restore/METHOD directory.  
That there is no usr/share/rear/restore/TAPE directory  
tells me that there is no generic TAPE backup method  
which is supported in ReaR.  
There is only usr/share/rear/restore/OBDR but this directory  
is basically empty - in particular there is no ReaR script.  
This tells me that the OBDR backup method is rather special  
and not a generic backup method for tape devices.  
Because I never used a tape device with Linux  
I may not see things which are obvious  
for users who actually use a tape device.

The primary functionality of ReaR is to make a bootable  
ReaR recovery system which contains the ReaR installer  
(i.e. what is run via "rear recover") which can recreate  
the storage setup (called "disk layout" in ReaR)  
same as it was before on the original system.  
Afterwards as last step during "rear recover"  
the "backup of the system files" is restored  
into the recreated storage.

ReaR provides a very generic and rather crude backup method  
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
This is ReaR's default/fallback backup method  
when no BACKUP is specified by the user.  
The BACKUP method REQUESTRESTORE is not real backup method  
but simply halts the recovery and requests that somebody  
will restore the data into the recreated storage.

So when you have your "backup of the system files"  
on a tape drive and use BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
together with OUTPUT=USB  
then "rear mkbackup" is useless because  
BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does not make a backup of the files  
so only "rear mkrescue" is needed and that will make  
a ReaR recovery system which is bootable from USB.

When you boot that ReaR recovery system on replacement  
hardware and inside the running ReaR recovery system  
you call "rear recover" you will get your storage setup  
recreated same as it was before on the original system  
and the recreated (empty) storage will be mounted  
inside the running ReaR recovery system at /mnt/local

Then "rear recover" halts and requests you to restore  
your "backup of the system files" from your tape drive  
into /mnt/local

To do that everything what is needed for the backup restore  
(e.g. kernel modules for the tape drive, programs to use the  
tape drive, config files for the tape drive, whatever else)  
must be included in the ReaR recovery system.

ReaR provides generic ways to get things included  
in the ReaR recovery system.  
Those are (see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

    MODULES
    FIRMWARE_FILES
    REQUIRED_PROGS
    LIBS
    COPY_AS_IS

So with BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
plus appropriate settings as needed for  
MODULES FIRMWARE\_FILES REQUIRED\_PROGS LIBS COPY\_AS\_IS  
you can set up ReaR to be able to manually restore  
a backup from a tape drive during "rear recover".

Of course this requires manual try and error  
step by step legwork until it will work.

@DebianGuru

in addition and/or alternatively to BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
we also have BACKUP=EXTERNAL see its description in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

In contrast to BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
BACKUP=EXTERNAL has ReaR scripts to make a backup via "rear mkbackup"  
usr/share/rear/backup/EXTERNAL/default/500\_make\_backup\_with\_external.sh  
and to restore it during "rear recover"  
usr/share/rear/restore/EXTERNAL/default/500\_restore\_with\_external.sh  
so with BACKUP=EXTERNAL and appropriate settings for the  
user config variables

    EXTERNAL_...
    MODULES
    FIRMWARE_FILES
    REQUIRED_PROGS
    LIBS
    COPY_AS_IS

I think it should be possible to set up ReaR so that  
"rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" behave as usual  
with making and restoring a backup on tape drive.

It is ages ago when I tried last BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE  
and BACKUP=EXTERNAL so I have no personal experience  
how the current state of both is.

If special command are needed  
e.g. to somehow prepare the tape drive  
see  
PRE\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT and POST\_BACKUP\_SCRIPT  
(for "rear mkbackup")  
and  
PRE\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS / PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT and  
POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT / POST\_RECOVERY\_COMMANDS  
(for "rear recover")  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

@DebianGuru

FYI regarding your question in your initial description

    Seems like it's looking for the backup data on the local filesystem?

What is at /var/tmp/rear.blahblahblah/outputfs/...  
is normally not a local filesystem because  
with BACKUP=NETFS this is normally a mountpoint directory  
where "usually a network share" from a remote host  
is locally mounted, see the BACKUP=NETFS description in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

    NETFS is an internal backup method that saves the backup
    into a mounted directory.
    This is usually a network share, but can also be used
    to create a backup to a local disk (by providing your
    own BACKUP_MOUNTCMD and BACKUP_UMOUNTCMD commands
    that mount the local disk.

If you could mount your tape drive so that its contents  
appear as regular files within a mountpoint directory  
then it should be possible to somehow "misuse"  
BACKUP=NETFS with BACKUP\_MOUNTCMD and BACKUP\_UMOUNTCMD  
for storing and restoring a backup on a tape drive.

Again:  
I know nothing about tape drives so I have no idea  
whether or not mounting a tape drive makes any sense.

Mounting a tape drive would require that there is some  
kind of filesystem on the tape drive so that its contents  
could appear as regular files within a mountpoint directory.

I only try to explain some generic background information  
that might help you to better understand how ReaR behaves  
so you might be able to find a way how you could use ReaR  
to store and restore a backup on your tape drive.

Solved. I was missing "USB\_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000" as
suggested by @gdha . Many thanks to all who provided replies.
