-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Current master code

-   Brief description of the issue:

It seems currently it is not possible to exclude a partition between
other partitions  
because currently when one excludes a partition also all other
partitions  
on the same disk get automatically also excluded by that code in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/330\_remove\_exclusions.sh

        part)
            ### find the immediate parent
            name=$(grep "^$name " "$LAYOUT_DEPS" | cut -d " " -f 2)
            remove_component "$type" "$name"
            ;;
</pre>

cf.

As a side note see the mentioned bug therein because currently only  
all other partitions on the disk will be also automatically excluded  
but neither their affected filesystems nor swap entries  
which results an inconsistent disklayout.conf file, cf.  
"I want to always have all values perfectly right in disklayout.conf"
in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733\#issuecomment-366436113](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1733#issuecomment-366436113)

I guess all other partitions on the disk must be also automatically
excluded  
because somehow "rear recover" may fail when it should skip only the  
excluded partitions but still recreate the other partitions on a disk.

I guess a reason behind is how the create\_partitions() function works
in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh

I think this issue here is related to other general cleanup work  
that is(was) needed in the partitioning layout code in ReaR like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)  
and

Because there is zero user request for such a functionality  
I won't implement it.
