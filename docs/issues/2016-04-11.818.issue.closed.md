Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template
=======================================

After the recovery mountpoints for NFS mounts are missing. This will
make nfs shares not mounted after the recovery (if they are referenced
from fstab). Related to \#619.

Particularly, in prep/default/40\_save\_mountpoint\_details.sh, the
collection of nfs mountpoints is explicitly excluded.  
I assume there is reason for it, but cannot figure out which.

Work-around is trivial: mkdir manually.

Hi Pavol - good question: what was the reason? I cannot remember - is
there any?  
@rear/owners What are your thoughts?

Because in prep/default/40\_save\_mountpoint\_details.sh  
there are no comments that explain *why* certain  
things are excluded from the "mount" output,  
nobody (except the one who made that code ;-)  
can know about the reasoning behind.

Regardless of the reasoning behind I think the command

<pre>
... mount | grep -vE '(cgroup|fuse|nfs|/sys/|REAR-000)' ...
</pre>

is wrong because it excludes any "mount" output line  
that contains anywhere e.g. "nfs" (i.e. much more  
than to exclude only "mount" output lines where  
the mounted filesystem type is "nfs".

In general I wonder if a hardcoded list of what should  
be excluded is the right thing.

If something cannot be implemented in a hardcoded way,  
I think the right way is to make it configurable by the user.

In this case e.g. via a array variable in default.conf that is  
predefined with a list of what would be excluded by default.

FYI how one could exclude mounted filesystem types  
by using the newer "findmnt" command and output only  
the mountpoint directories, e.g.:

<pre>
findmnt -nrv -o TARGET -i -t 'nfs,cgroup'
</pre>

But "findmnt" is not available on older systems  
so that rear may use mount as fallback as I did in  
usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/23\_filesystem\_layout.sh

Hello!

Maybe with something like this should help:

mount -l -t "$(echo $(cat /proc/filesystems | grep -v nodev) | tr ' '
',')"

And also works for older systems

@didacog nice trick.

However, it wouldn't fix the NFS mounted file-systems. Perhaps, to catch
all mounted file-systems (including the NFS ones) a simple
`ls -ld $(mount | grep -vE '(cgroup|fuse|nfsd|/sys/|REAR-000)' | awk '{print $3}')`
could do the trick?  
Only change `nfs` to `nfsd` and it is fixed IMHO

@pavoldomin  
first and foremost I like to understand the actual issue here.

In your initial comment you wrote:

<pre>
After the recovery mountpoints for NFS mounts are missing.
...

</pre>

Only a blind guess what I think the issue could be:

Usually directories should be restored from the backup.  
In general what is not in the backup does not get restored.  
Now I wonder why directories that are used as  
mountpoints are not in the backup.  
I guess that is because rear excludes for example  
all what is mounted via NFS (because by default  
files on remote systems should not be in the backup).  
I assume when rear excludes sub-trees of the whole  
tree of filesystems it also excludes their base directories  
which is for NFS mounted stuff the mountpoint directory.

If my assumptions are true I wonder if it is really the  
best way to deal with missing directories in the backup  
by special scripts in rear for special cases when such  
directories are used as mountpoints.

What about missing directories in the backup that are  
not used as mountpoints?  
For example how to exclude all content in /var/tmp  
from the backup but keep the bare /var/tmp directory  
in the backup?

Perhaps it would be better to improve how rear excludes  
sub-trees of the whole tree of filesystems from the backup?

FYI:

I had the same issue for my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779)  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779\#issuecomment-186171981](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/779#issuecomment-186171981)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/784/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/784/files)

When moving away restored files that should not have been restored  
the base directory of that files is kept (e.g. useful to remove all
content in /var/tmp but keep the /var/tmp directory).

@gdha thanks! ;)

If the problem is the exclude of basedir, maybe you can try using
**'/some\_path/some\_mount\_point/\*'** in the exclude array definition,
at least you can try using it as temporary workarround. :-P

Sorry, again the problem where this thread was found in trash :)

What is really happening here is, that `/hana/shared` contains nfs
mountpoint referred from `/etc/fstab`, but as we exclude `/hana/shared`
from the backup, mountpoint `/hana/shared/SID` is not created (and as a
consequence application cannot start, because it environment links to
that nfs mountpoint).

I think the solution above outlined by @gdha:
`ls -ld $(mount | grep -vE '(cgroup|fuse|nfsd|/sys/|REAR-000)' | awk '{print $3}')`
should work. Got a suspicion that it was actually meant like this in the
first place :).
