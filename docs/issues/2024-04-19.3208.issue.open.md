-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):rear-2.7-1.git.5366

-   If your ReaR version is not the current version, explain why you
    can't upgrade:

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"): RHEL 7.9

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

-   BACKUP=CDM

-   OUTPUT=ISO

-   export
    LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/;/usr/lib64/bind9-export/:/usr/lib64/R/lib/"

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR): Vmware VM

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT"):

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    When I attempt a restore from an iso created using the rear -v
    mkrescue command, and select the option to restore from a replica
    Rubrik cluster, the agent will not register on the replica cluster
    when I attempt to register it using the IP address. I get an error
    indicating the agent is not running (refusal to connect on port
    12801). When I check on the partially restored system, the Rubrik
    agents are not running. Attempts to start the agents using
    "systemctl start rubrikagents" result in an error
    "rubrikagents.service not found"

-   Workaround, if any:  
    None I can find so far.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

-   The backup log files did not reflect any errors.  
    The system I was trying to recover (a Vmware VM) no longer exists
    and I have no option left to restore except to use the Rubrik
    replica copy of the backup.

You can drag-drop log files into this editor to create an attachment

by including it between a leading and a closing line of
