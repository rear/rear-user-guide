@mutable-dan  
thank you for your early pull request!

I added some comments about what I recognized  
from plain looking at the code.

@mutable-dan  
many thanks for all your work here - it is much appreciated.  
As time permits I will try to have a closer look next week.  
I am still struggling with getting used to use an IBM Z system  
e.g. x3270 terminal emulator, XEDIT, `#cp`, and things like that  
(I feel I drop one clanger after another)...

Here more of my changes that I did (as a IBM Z noob)  
in my (currently basically blind) attempt to move forward a bit:

Because `OUTPUT=ISO` does not make sense on IBM Z  
I created a new file
usr/share/rear/output/IPL/Linux-s390/800\_create\_ipl.sh

    # Create the 'initial program' to boot/load the ReaR recovery system
    # on IBM Z via IPL (initial program load)
    LogPrint "Creating initial program for IPL on IBM Z"
    RESULT_FILES+=( $KERNEL_FILE $TMP_DIR/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME )

which is currently basically an almost empty dummy  
that only results that kernel and ReaR's initrd get copied  
whereto the RESULT\_FILES are normally copied.

Now I can use a new tentative output method `OUTPUT=IPL`  
(we can rename or change all that as we like).

This way I get the currently used kernel of my running original system  
and ReaR's created initrd that contains the ReaR recovery system  
copied to my NFS server (I use `BACKUP=NETFS`).

But I needed also some generic improvements and fixes in  
usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
to make things work for me:

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 nobody nobody  9.6M May 21 16:48 backup.log

So now I got kernel, ReaR recovery system initrd and the backup  
out of the original system and safe on my NFS server.

My next step is now to learn how I could "boot" (i.e. `IPL`)  
a IBM Z system with that kernel and ReaR's initrd  
or to learn that I need to do things totally differently...

thx, will merge your changes. on rhel, there are errors in the
networking.... which I am looking at

i will make the changes regarding partition info (above) and push the
changes. Then continue with the networking problems. There is code for
copying kernel modules (for network (and dasd) drivers for s390) which I
am not following 100%. I made some very small changes to add directories
with modules.

@mutable-dan  
in general regarding "copying kernel modules" i.e. what kernel modules  
will be copied into the ReaR recovery system:

Since the curent ReaR 2.5 release by default all kernel modules  
will be copied into the ReaR recovery system, see in the  
"Release Notes for Relax-and-Recover version 2.5" at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5)  
the part about

    Version 2.5 (May 2019)

    Abstract

    New features, bigger enhancements, and possibly backward incompatible changes:

    ...

    Now there is in default.conf MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
    which means that now by default all kernel modules
    get included in the recovery system (issue #2041).
    Usually this is required when ...
    Additionaly it makes the recovery system better prepared
    when ... (issue #1870) ... (issue #1202) ...
    Furthermore this is helpful to be on the safe side ... (issue #1355) ...

and see the issues mentioned therein for background information.

Therefore since ReaR 2.5 you should not need to worry about  
possibly missing kernel modules in the recovery system.  
If on IBM Z architecture some kernel modules are missing  
in the recovery system it would be a bug in the current  
usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/400_copy_modules.sh)  
that would have to be fixed.

Here some more of my further steps to move forward a bit:

I use two same IBM Z test systems each on z/VM 5.4.

On the first one (my "original system") with hostname s390vsl179  
I did "rear mkbackup" as described in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)

On the second one (my "replacement hardware") with hostname s390vsl180  
I try to do the "rear recover".

I learned that to `ipl` my kernel and ReaR's initrd that I saved on my
NFS server  
on an empty IBM Z system is an advanced task that I postpone to learn
later.

What I did as an easier way how to "boot" my kernel and ReaR's initrd  
on an IBM Z system is to "boot" that via `kexec` from within a  
normally running IBM Z system that runs SLES12-SP4.

I.e. on my second IBM Z system with hostname s390vsl180  
I have SLES12-SP4 normally running and there I copied  
my kernel and ReaR's initrd from my NFS server  
so that I have both locally as those files

    /root/s390vsl179/initrd.cgz
    /root/s390vsl179/image-4.12.14-94.41-default

Then I did

    # sync

    # kexec -l /root/s390vsl179/image-4.12.14-94.41-default --initrd=/root/s390vsl179/initrd.cgz --command-line=root=/dev/ram0 rw vga=normal hvc_iucv=8 TERM=dumb

    # kexec -e

The `kexec -e` does an immediate hard boot of the new kernel  
and initrd which is why I did `sync` before to be on the safe side  
so that I could still reboot the system from the disk if `kexec -e`
fails  
but for me `kexec -e` just worked (that was really unexpected).

I got the `--command-line` paremeters for the `kexec -l` from  
a combination of what /proc/cmdline shows on my original  
system s390vsl179 wherefrom I took

    hvc_iucv=8 TERM=dumb

plus what /proc/cmdline shows from another booted  
ReaR recovery system on x86 hardware wherefrom I took

    root=/dev/ram0 rw vga=normal

but I did something wrong with the `kexec -l` call  
(probably I forgot proper quoting of the command-line paremeters)  
because in the via `kexec -e` booted ReaR recovery system I get

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # cat /proc/cmdline 
    root=/dev/ram0

After the `kexec -e` I used the x3270 terminal to log in  
at that new booted system to find out what its IP address is.  
For me it is fortunately still the same as before so that I could  
log in via `ssh` to the running ReaR recovery system on s390vsl179  
because I use in my etc/rear/local.conf

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)  
The DHCP server that I happen to use in my particular environment  
does fortunately "the right thing" for me (otherwise I would have had  
to do some manual networking setup from within the x3270 terminal).

In the ReaR recovery system I called "rear -D recover"

so ReaR works in general but as expected for this very first attempt

Those are the `parted` calls in diskrestore.sh

do that for IBM Z architecture...

The `du -hs /mnt/local/*` output in the recovery system is basically  
identical to the `du -hs /*` output on the original system so that  
so fat things look good.

Next step is to find out how to manually install the bootloader  
from within the recovery system...

the `mkfs` related commands are just copies from what I already have  
in my diskrestore.sh script in the running ReaR recovery system.

So all what needs to be adapted for now to make "rear recover"  
work in this particular IBM Z case is the `parted` commands  
in the diskrestore.sh script and how to install the bootloader.

@jsmeix this is the area in question, I have not checked it into my fork

the rescue, did not seem to copy all modules

i am currently outputting to a ramdisk,  
next, i will setup the netfs to nfs. we probably don't need IPL, we will
see.  
writing the initrd, kernel, etc to an nfs share should be sufficient  
once i get the init, kernel and params on nfs, i can test the boot

i am getting the initrd written but not the kernel, will investigate

@mutable-dan  
I did my generic improvements and fixes in  
usr/share/rear/output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
that I listed in my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)  
only in my personal ReaR scripts that I run on my IBM Z test systems.

I will do a GitHub pull request with that changes and merge it  
into our current GitHub ReaR master code...

Regarding your changes in  
rescue/GNU/Linux/230\_storage\_and\_network\_modules.sh

You won't actually need them because with current ReaR 2.5  
default.conf `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` setting  
you get by default all modules in the recovery system, cf. my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494677718](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494677718)

I checked that on my IBM Z test system where I had run "rear mkbackup"  
(I use `KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"`)

    # find /tmp/rear.NlvtWuz8Sx0tjOd/rootfs/lib/modules/ | grep s390 | wc -l
    69

    # find /lib/modules/ | grep s390 | wc -l
    69

i.e. same number of '390' kernel module files (and directories)  
in the recovery system (at `/tmp/rear.NlvtWuz8Sx0tjOd/rootfs/`)  
as in the original system and

    # find /lib/modules/ | wc -l
    1003

    # find /tmp/rear.NlvtWuz8Sx0tjOd/rootfs/lib/modules/ | wc -l
    1002

    # find /lib/modules/ | grep scsi_debug
    /lib/modules/4.12.14-94.41-default/kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.ko

    # find /tmp/rear.NlvtWuz8Sx0tjOd/rootfs/lib/modules/ | grep scsi_debug || echo not found
    not found

    # grep ^EXCLUDE_MODULES usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    EXCLUDE_MODULES=( scsi_debug )

same (except one) number of all kernel module files (and directories)  
in the recovery system (at `/tmp/rear.NlvtWuz8Sx0tjOd/rootfs/`)  
as in the original system - the exception is `scsi_debug` which  
is intentionally excluded, see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

Nevertheless your changes in  
rescue/GNU/Linux/230\_storage\_and\_network\_modules.sh  
are useful and needed if a user sets `MODULES=()` in  
his etc/rear/local.conf

@mutable-dan  
regarding item `3. Handling network interface 'enccw0.0.0610'` in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495010023](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495010023)  
I cannot help because I don't know much about networking details  
(I use DHCP and be happy that on SLES12 `eth0` is used).

I think @rmetrich can help with crazy network interface names  
because he implemented very most of our current  
usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
which is where the network device configuration for  
the ReaR recovery system happens.

A general workaround to deal with things like

    Failed to handle network interface 'enccw0.0.0610'.

is to specify NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
see its description in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
or - probably easier - do it as I do with

    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"

to use DHCP for recovery system networking setup  
and get remote access to it via SSH.  
Usually you do not need full networking setup in the recovery system.  
You need just enough to be able to access your backup.

Regarding item `4. kernel not detected` in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495010023](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495010023)  
see usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/400\_guess\_kernel.sh  
which is where the kernel is autodetected  
i.e. where the KERNEL\_FILE variable is set.  
You must use ReaR 2.5 because before ReaR 2.5  
KERNEL\_FILE was set by a mess of various scripts  
that I cleaned up for ReaR 2.5, see the  
"Release Notes for Relax-and-Recover version 2.5" at  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5)  
therein the part about

    Cleaned up how KERNEL_FILE is set: Now the
    KERNEL_FILE variable is set in the ‘prep’ stage only by
    the new prep/GNU/Linux/400_guess_kernel.sh
    that replaces the old
    ...
    (issues #1851 #1983 #1985)

for details see those issues  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1851)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1983](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1983)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985)

The KERNEL\_FILE value is the file of the currently running kernel  
and that kernel should be used in the ReaR recovery system  
i.e. the ReaR recovery system should be booted with that kernel.

In my usr/share/rear/output/IPL/Linux-s390/800\_create\_ipl.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494426331](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494426331)  
I use KERNEL\_FILE to copy the currently used kernel  
whereto the RESULT\_FILES are normally copied  
(which is in my case the NFS share on my NFS server)  
plus the ReaR recovery system files that are in ReaR's initrd  
and ReaR's initrd file is $TMP\_DIR/$REAR\_INITRD\_FILENAME

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494739752](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494739752)  
I copy that kernel and ReaR's initrd from my NFS server  
to my "replacement hardware" IBM Z system to boot the  
ReaR recovery system there via `kexec -l ...` and `kecex -e`.

@mutable-dan  
using `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` on IBM Z will not call  
usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh

@mutable-dan  
it seems things work for me with `OUTPUT=RAMDISK` on IBM Z  
with the following completely overhauled 900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh  
stored as usr/share/rear/output/RAMDISK/default/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh

    #

    #

    local kernel_file="$KERNEL_FILE"
    local initrd_file="$TMP_DIR/$REAR_INITRD_FILENAME"

    # The 'test' intentionally also fails when RAMDISK_SUFFIX is more than one word

    DebugPrint "Adding $kernel_file and $initrd_file to RESULT_FILES"

Right now I did another (partially manual) recovery  
on my "replacement hardware" with what I recently  
created on my NFS server with `OUTPUT=RAMDISK`  
(and the new output/RAMDISK/default/900\_copy\_ramdisk.sh)  
as shown in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-495200737](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-495200737)

Here my etc/rear/local.conf that I used

    OUTPUT=RAMDISK
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.67.243/nfs
    SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD="rear"
    USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
    KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
    FIRMWARE_FILES=( 'no' )
    PROGRESS_MODE="plain"
    PROGRESS_WAIT_SECONDS="5"

I booted kernel-s390vsl179 and initramfs-s390vsl179.img  
on my "replacement hardware" via `kexec` from within the  
running first recreated system from my above very first attempt  
to do a "rear recover" (excerpts of what I did now):

    s390vsl180:~ # scp root@...:/nfs/s390vsl179/*s390vsl179* .
    initramfs-s390vsl179.img
    kernel-s390vsl179

    s390vsl180:~ # kexec -l kernel-s390vsl179 --initrd=initramfs-s390vsl179.img --command-line='root=/dev/ram0 rw vga=normal hvc_iucv=8 TERM=dumb'

    s390vsl180:~ # sync

    s390vsl180:~ # kexec -e

Now s390vsl180 does a hard reboot and boots the  
ReaR recovery system where I log in via SSH  
and run "rear recover" in enforced MIGRATION\_MODE  
so that I get the dialogs that allow me to adapt the  
still wrong parted comands in diskrestore.sh

Don't get confused that the running recovery system shows  
as hostname `s390vsl179` which is the hostname of the original system  
but the recovery system is actually running on my "replacement
hardware".

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # export MIGRATION_MODE=true

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # rear -D recover
    ...
    Confirm or edit the disk recreation script
    1) Confirm disk recreation script and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Edit disk recreation script (/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh)
    3) View disk recreation script (/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh)
    4) View original disk space usage (/var/lib/rear/layout/config/df.txt)
    5) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    6) Abort 'rear recover'
    (default '1' timeout 300 seconds)
    2

Before the parted comands in diskrestore.sh are

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # grep ^parted /root/rear.pull2142/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh    
    parted -s /dev/dasda mklabel dasd >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart "'dasda1'" 98304B 314621951B >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart "'dasda2'" 314621952B 838926335B >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart "'dasda3'" 838926336B 7385198591B >&2

I changed them to

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # grep ^parted /root/rear.pull2142/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh
    parted -s /dev/dasda mklabel dasd >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart ext2 98304B 314621951B >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart linux-swap 314621952B 838926335B >&2
    parted -s /dev/dasda mkpart ext4 838926336B 7385333759B >&2

Note that in particular for the last partition the partition end byte  
value was not right: Before it was `7385198591B`  
which is not what parted reports for the disk size

    # parted -s /dev/dasda unit B print
    Model: IBM S390 DASD drive (dasd)
    Disk /dev/dasda: 7385333760B
    ...

so that this is another issue that needs to be investigated.

With the changed parted comands in diskrestore.sh  
the disk layout setup "just worked " for me  
and "rear recover" continues with

    WARNING:
    For this system
    SUSE_LINUX/12.4 on Linux-s390 (based on SUSE/12/s390)
    there is no code to install a boot loader on the recovered system
    or the code that we have failed to install the boot loader correctly.
    Please contribute appropriate code to the Relax-and-Recover project,
    see http://relax-and-recover.org/development/
    Take a look at the scripts in /usr/share/rear/finalize,
    for example see the scripts
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/630_install_grub.sh
    /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh

    ---------------------------------------------------
    |  IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL A BOOT LOADER MANUALLY,  |
    |  THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BOOT.     |
    ---------------------------------------------------

    You can use 'chroot /mnt/local bash --login'
    to change into the recovered system.
    You should at least mount /proc in the recovered system
    e.g. via 'mount -t proc none /mnt/local/proc'
    before you change into the recovered system
    and manually install a boot loader therein.

    Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.
    Exiting rear recover (PID 586) and its descendant processes ...
    Running exit tasks
    You should also rm -Rf /tmp/rear.pH3rsfVF7M6pgA4

This is expected because we do not yet have  
code to install a boot loader on IBM Z  
so that I need to do that manually as before:

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # mount --bind /proc /mnt/local/proc

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # mount --bind /sys /mnt/local/sys

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # mount --bind /dev /mnt/local/dev

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # chroot /mnt/local bash --login

    s390vsl179:/ # update-bootloader --reinit

    s390vsl179:/ # exit
    logout

    RESCUE s390vsl179:~ # reboot

Now the recreated system on my "replacement hardware" reboots  
and it works and I can log in via SSH

    # ssh root@10.161.155.180
    ...
    s390vsl180:~ #

Now it shows the right hostname that belongs to its IP 10.161.155.180  
because its hostname is set via DHCP (in contrast to the recovery
system  
that does not set its hostname via DHCP regardless that I also use
DHCP  
for the network setup of the recovery system).

@mutable-dan  
using kexec to boot a new kernel plus initrd in an already running
system  
is only my current workaround to boot the recovery system for my
tests,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-494739752](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-494739752)

But that is not a real solution because for real disaster recovery  
it must be possible to boot the recovery system on "bare metal"  
(where "bare metal" on IBM Z means an empty virtual machine).

The matching code for that is in the create\_partitions() function in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh

                device_size=$( get_disk_size  "$sysfs_name" )

                ### GPT disks need 33 LBA blocks at the end of the disk
                # For the SUSE specific gpt_sync_mbr partitioning scheme
                # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544
                if [[ "$label" == "gpt" || "$label" == "gpt_sync_mbr" || "$label" == "dasd" ]] ; then
                    device_size=$( mathlib_calculate "$device_size - 33*$block_size" )
                    # Only if resizing all partitions is explicity wanted
                    # resizing of arbitrary partitions may also happen via the code below
                    # in addition to layout/prepare/default/430_autoresize_all_partitions.sh
                    if is_true "$autoresize_partitions" ; then
                        Log "Size reductions of GPT partitions probably needed."
                    fi
                fi
    ...
            ### Test to make sure we're not past the end of the disk.
            if [[ "$device_size" ]] && (( end > $device_size )) ; then
                LogPrint "Partition $name on $device: size reduced to fit on disk."
                Log "End changed from $end to $device_size."
                end="$device_size"
            fi

So the cause is that in this case here `dasd` should not be treated  
same as GPT (that needs 33 LBA blocks at the end of the disk)  
which means in this case here my added `dasd` must be removed  
from this particular `if` clause so that it is again as it was before:

                ### GPT disks need 33 LBA blocks at the end of the disk
                # For the SUSE specific gpt_sync_mbr partitioning scheme
                # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/544
                if [[ "$label" == "gpt" || "$label" == "gpt_sync_mbr" ]] ; then

also with partition 'Flags' (but in my case there are no flags):

To get the bootloaders (GRUB2 and ZIPL) installed  
during "rear recover" on SLES I made a new script  
usr/share/rear/finalize/SUSE\_LINUX/s390/660\_install\_grub2\_and\_zipl.sh

i.e. byte-by-byte identical partitioning.  
The right `File system` entries happen via the `mkfs` commands  
so that the hardcoded fixed dummy `ext2` that are shown during

    Disk '/dev/dasda': creating partition number 2 with name ''ext2''
    Disk '/dev/dasda': creating partition number 3 with name ''ext2''

do not matter in the end.

hello,

I will merge your changes mentioned above into my fork. The one area I
will need to look at is the assumption of ext2. if it acts as just a
placeholder, should be ok. it it overrides the actual filesystem type,
could be a problem. rhel on z uses xfs

thank you

@mutable-dan  
right now I merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2150](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2150)  
so that now there should be generic support for dasd disks  
in the current ReaR GitHub master code.

Regarding why using a dummy file system type 'ext2' for  
dasd disk 'part' entries should work, e.g. as in my disklayout.conf

    part /dev/dasda 314523648 98304 ext2 none /dev/dasda1
    part /dev/dasda 524304384 314621952 ext2 none /dev/dasda2
    part /dev/dasda 6546407424 838926336 ext2 none /dev/dasda3

see the comment at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh\#L175](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh#L175)

Regarding (re)-installing the bootloader on s390 on Red Hat  
I think you need to make a Red Hat specific new script named like  
(directories named `.../Fedora/...` are also used for RHEL)

    usr/share/rear/finalize/Fedora/s390/660_install_zipl.sh

when Red Hat uses plain `zipl` as bootloader on IMB Z.

@mutable-dan  
a general note regarding things as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-498828073](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-498828073)

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142/files)  
I do not see where e.g. the program `cmsfscat` is called by a ReaR
script.

In general regarding things like PROGS, COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS  
and LIBS:

What is specified in those arrays is only what is needed to be run  
within the running ReaR recovery system, i.e. what is called  
during recovery system startup (e.g. by skel/default/etc/scripts)  
and during "rear recover".

Currently I fail to see how all those PROGS and REQUIRED\_PROGS  
that you specified are run from within the ReaR recovery system  
or at all by a ReaR script.

REQUIRED\_PROGS are additionally required to exist  
in the original system because e.g. "rear mkrescue"  
aborts in init/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
when an element of the REQUIRED\_PROGS is missing.

See the comment in init/default/950\_check\_missing\_programs.sh  
regarding how to add programs to REQUIRED\_PROGS as needed  
from other ReaR scripts, for example see the script  
layout/save/GNU/Linux/230\_filesystem\_layout.sh  
and cf.

Hi  
we put everything Z in right now while we figure out how to manually get
the network, storage devices and filesystems up. it's a slow process
building recoveries and booting on the zvm emulator.

some of the links provided add clarity to the usage of PROGS,
COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS and LIBS and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc)
helps a little too, but i have been unable to find a complete
description of these vars and how they should be used. any info would be
helpful.  
The difference between a recovery and original system was also confused
a bit, once we figure out what is needed, i'll pull out the rest

@mutable-dan  
while you are trying things out I suggest to set things  
like PROGS, COPY\_AS\_IS, REQUIRED\_PROGS, LIBS  
only in your etc/rear/local.conf

When you know what you need where and when,  
you could add it into scripts.

This way I think I could merge this pull request soon  
provided it does no longer contain things that are not needed  
for a very first (limited) usage of ReaR on IBM Z  
e.g. only having kernel and ReaR's initrd on an NFS server  
but no yet support how to boot/IPL them on a Z system.

The support how to boot/IPL them on a Z system  
can later be added via separated subsequent pull requests,  
cf. the part about "Submit early, submit often" in

next step is to find the place in recovery to read this and prep the

@mutable-dan  
with your changes in layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh via
your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142/commits/335f060bbb89e46baa9d484fa501bfa28e243378](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142/commits/335f060bbb89e46baa9d484fa501bfa28e243378)  
you introduce support for preparing a `dasd` disk  
with the commands `dasdfmt` plus `fdasd`  
instead of `parted` which is normally used to prepare a disk  
but you do not exclude that `parted` is also used  
when `dasdfmt` plus `fdasd` should be used.

As far as I know newer `parted` supports preparing a `dasd` disk  
and on current SLES we (i.e. SUSE) do no longer provide the  
commands `dasdfmt` and `fdasd` so that for IMB Z support  
on current SLES only `parted` is used to prepare a `dasd` disk  
and it seems `parted` is the only tool that is supported by SUSE  
to prepare a `dasd` disk.  
At least for my tests here plain `parted` had worked for me  
to prepare the `dasd` disk on my IBM Z test system.

Therefore my question:  
What is the reason why you need to additionally support  
preparing a `dasd` disk with `dasdfmt` plus `fdasd`?

When two kind of tools can be used to do the same thing in ReaR  
both methods must exclude each other (otherwise `parted` would  
be run in addition after `dasdfmt` and `fdasd` had been run)  
and both methods must be continuously maintained  
in ReaR for a possibly very long time in the future.

In other words:  
When there is no mandatory reason to use `dasdfmt` plus `fdasd`  
to prepare a `dasd` disk, I suggest to not add support for them to  
keep the code in ReaR simpler and better maintainable  
(the current code is already rather hard to maintain).

on rhel dasdfmt looks to be needed else it does not show up as a block
device w/o. it looks like i can use parted instead of fdasd on rhel. i
am testing....

@mutable-dan  
what `parted` does during `rear recover` is implemented in  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
therein rather indirectly via the `create_disk()` function  
that gets called during `rear recover` as needed by  
layout/prepare/default/540\_generate\_device\_code.sh  
therein again indirectly via the `create_device()` function  
that is implemented in lib/layout-functions.sh which calls

    create_$type "$device"

where `$type` is basically the keyword in disklayout.conf  
cf. "Disk layout file syntax" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

E.g. for the `disk` keyword in disklayout.conf

    create_disk "$device"

is called (i.e. the `create_disk()` function in
100\_include\_partition\_code.sh)  
and that function calls the `create_partitions()` function that is
also  
implemented in 100\_include\_partition\_code.sh so that finally  
the `create_partitions()` function emits `parted` command calls  
(and other stuff) into the `diskrestore.sh` script that is finally
called by  
usr/share/rear/layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh

Just simple - isn't it ;-)

Seriously:

The indirection via the `diskrestore.sh` script is crucial and
mandatory.

There must never even happen anything on the user's target system  
before the `diskrestore.sh` script is run.

All commands that prepare the user's target system disks must be
written  
into the `diskrestore.sh` script (via appropriate `create_$type`
functions  
or other appropriate functions or code in `rear recover` scripts) and  
not any command that changes any user's target system disk  
must ever be run directly via a `rear recover` script.

The reason behind is:

The `diskrestore.sh` script is the one and only piece of code  
that recreates the disk layout (i.e. partitions, filesystems, mount
points)  
of all the user's target system disks.

This way the user can see the actual commands  
that recreate his target system disks, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2081\#issuecomment-496175444](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2081#issuecomment-496175444)  
and  
the user can modify those commands as needed  
e.g. when something fails cf.

    ... if the worst comes to the worst - even temporary quick
    and dirty workarounds are relatively easily possible ...

in the section "Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
or in case of a migration where the target system disks  
are not fully compatible with the original system disks  
(e.g. migration from two smaller disks onto one big disk).

With this check-in rhel is able to properly partition dasd drives. There
are some items that need to be discussed, such as placement of the dasd
enable and dasd info placed in the disklayout.conf. All suggestions are,
of course, welcome.

**usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh**  
This is a temp fix:  
+ \#if \[\[ "$label" == "gpt" || "$label" == "gpt\_sync\_mbr" ||
"$label" == "dasd" \]\] ; then  
+ if \[\[ "$label" == "gpt" || "$label" == "gpt\_sync\_mbr" \]\] ;
then  
removed dasd while we figure out how to handle this  
If i put the dasd condition back in and add something for suse such as
"$OS\_VENDOR" == "SUSE\_LINUX", will that work?  
rhel dasd are basically dos partitions, the gpd re-calc caused rhel to
fail when partitioning

**usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh**  
dasd drive on rhel... needs to be enabled before partitioning, is this a
good place?

**usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200\_partition\_layout.sh**  
currently putting dasd info, specifically bus-id, info in
disklayout.conf  
echo "dasd\_channel $( lsdasd|grep dasd|awk '{ print $1 " " $2 " " $3 "
" $4}' )"  
putting it here simplifies 200\_partition\_layout.sh. would probably
need to write another loop over sys/block if we do not put it in
disklayout.conf unless you know a bash way to direct the stdout temp to
another file in the loop. does this potentially break anything?

@mutable-dan  
to have different code for different Linux distributions  
I recommend to use OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR  
because that is more general as OS\_VENDOR

Regarding how OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR is set see  
usr/share/rear/lib/config-functions.sh

Accordingly code like the following is fine:

    if test "SUSE_LINUX" = $OS_VENDOR ; then
        # Special case for SUSE
        ...
    else
        # Generic case for all other Linux distributions 
        ...
    fi

Probably even better because the `case` construct can be more easily  
enhanced and adapted if needed in the future for more Linux
distributions:

    case $OS_MASTER_VENDOR in
        (SUSE)
            # Specific code for SUSE
            ...
            ;;
        (Fedora)
            # Specific code for Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Oracle Linux
            ...
            ;;
        (Debian)
            # Specific code for Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint
            ...
            ;;
        (Arch)
            # Specific code for Arch Linux
            ...
            ;;
        (*)
            # Generic default case
            ...
            ;;
    esac

cf. `get_part_device_name_format()`
usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding
`dasd drive on rhel... needs to be enabled before partitioning`:

In your
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh  
I do not see how you write the commands to enable a dasd drive  
into the disrkrestore.sh file - I would expect code like

        cat >> "$LAYOUT_CODE" <<EOF
    # enable the dasd device on $bus (i.e. sets the device online)
    chccwdev -e $bus
    EOF

cf.
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh

I would add the dasd drive enable code to the `create_disk()` function
in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100\_include\_partition\_code.sh  
e.g. something like

    if [[ "$ARCH" == "Linux-s390" && "$OS_VENDOR" != "SUSE_LINUX" ]] ; then

       cat >> "$LAYOUT_CODE" <<EOF
    # enable the dasd device on $bus (i.e. sets the device online)
    chccwdev -e $bus
    EOF 

    fi

but I do not know about Red Hat on IBM Z so perhaps a separated script  
is better.

In any case you must never call commands that change a disk directly  
cf. my
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-503152699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-503152699)  
all those commands must hapen via the disrkrestore.sh script.

I do not know if `chccwdev -e $bus` actually changes an existing disk.

According to  
[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/linuxonibm/com.ibm.linux.z.lgdd/lgdd\_r\_chccwdev\_cmd.html](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/linuxonibm/com.ibm.linux.z.lgdd/lgdd_r_chccwdev_cmd.html)

    Use the chccwdev command to set attributes for CCW devices
    and to set CCW devices online or offline. 

the chccwdev command can set attributes which seems it  
can actually change an existing disk.

In general I would prefer to have all commands that are needed  
to set up the disks in the disrkrestore.sh script - i.e. also needed  
commands that do not actually change a disk.

Reason:

I would prefer to have the disrkrestore.sh script complete  
so that the user could use that script alone on bare metal  
to set up the disks, cf. my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142\#issuecomment-503152699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142#issuecomment-503152699)

    The diskrestore.sh script is the one and only piece of code
    that recreates the disk layout

I know in current ReaR this is not always true.  
There is some "initial preparation stuff" elsewhere  
(e.g. there could be some special `udev` scripts and  
there are initially needed commands like `mpathconf`  
and initially needed services like `multipathd`, cf.  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/210\_load\_multipath.sh).  
But I think the goal should be to try to have as much as possible  
in the disrkrestore.sh script (as far as possible with reasonable
effort).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding
`putting dasd info, specifically bus-id, info in disklayout.conf`

I think it is fine to put such info into disklayout.conf  
as long as the general disklayout.conf syntax

    # a comment
    unique_component_keyword first_value  second_value ...

is used, cf. the section "Disk layout file syntax" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
in particular

    None of the component keywords is a leading substring
    of another component keyword

so your new component keyword `dasd_channel` is o.k.  
because there is no component keyword `dasd`.

@jsmeix  
I am looking at your comments above....

Also looking at the networking.

on rhel the network devices are not enabled on boot:  
/sys/class/net/\*  
has no devices and thus can not find a MAC

the manual process would be to (without persisting device info)  
scan the devices

    znetconf -u
    Scanning for network devices...
    Device IDs                 Type    Card Type      CHPID Drv.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    0.0.0600,0.0.0601,0.0.0602 1731/01 OSA (QDIO)        00 qeth
    0.0.0610,0.0.0611,0.0.0612 1731/01 OSA (QDIO)        02 qeth
    0.0.7400,0.0.7401,0.0.7402 1731/05 HiperSockets      03 qeth

ignore the hipersockers  
then for each device

update:  
need to remove th ignore for each device scanned by znetconf -u
(excluding hipersockets)

    cio_ignore -r 0.0.0600,0.0.0601,0.0.0602
    cio_ignore -r 0.0.0610,0.0.0611,0.0.0612

then add the deivces:

    znetconf -a 0600
    Scanning for network devices...
    Successfully configured device 0.0.0600 (enccw0.0.0600)

    znetconf -a 0610
    Scanning for network devices...
    /bin/znetconf: line 560: echo: write error: No such device
    znetconf: Error: Failed to make 0.0.0610 online

in this case 0610 is not configured

and for those added run:

    znetconf -a 0600
    Scanning for network devices...
    Successfully configured device 0.0.0600 (enccw0.0.0600)

this needs to be done before
etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
How would you propose doing this for zlinux only??  
Perhaps:

-   write a 50-s390-add-network-device.sh to this dir if s390 and not
    suse --&gt; znetconf
-   in 55-migrate-network-devices.sh, check if znetconf exists and if
    /sys/class/net/ does not has a device --&gt; znetconf

@mutable-dan  
I think in the ReaR recovery system setup scripts

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/*.sh

you don't have all those Linux distribution specific variables  
like `OS_MASTER_VENDOR` set because the recovery system setup scripts  
do not call the SetOSVendorAndVersion function in
lib/config-functions.sh  
so that in the recovery system setup scripts you cannot write code like

    if test "Fedora" = $OS_MASTER_VENDOR ; then

as you could do in "normal" ReaR scripts where "normal ReaR scripts"  
mean those scripts that are run when e.g. "rear mkbackup"  
or "rear recover" are run, i.e. scripts that run "within" usr/sbin/rear.

I think a new separated generic recovery system setup script

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/50-prepare-network-devices.sh

would be best to enable network devices as needed.

I think adding such code to the 55-migrate-network-devices.sh script is
wrong  
because it is not about migrating network devices.

I think the script name should not be specific for the architecture  
(i.e. no 's390' in the script name) so that this script can be also
used  
if neded on other architectures in the future.

Inside the script the code can do what is neded to distingush between  
different architectures.

On SUSE we also have /sbin/znetconf (via our s390-tools RPM) installed  
so that you cannot distinguish between RHEL and SLES whether or not  
a command `znetconf` exists.

E.g. on my s390 test system I get

    # znetconf -u
    Scanning for network devices...
    Device IDs                 Type    Card Type      CHPID Drv. 
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    0.0.0700,0.0.0701,0.0.0702 1731/01 OSA (QDIO)        01 qeth

    # znetconf -a 0700
    Scanning for network devices...
    Successfully configured device 0.0.0700 (eth1)

    # znetconf -c
    Device IDs                 Type    Card Type      CHPID Drv. Name             State  
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    0.0.0800,0.0.0801,0.0.0802 1731/01 Virt.NIC QDIO     00 qeth eth0             online 
    0.0.0700,0.0.0701,0.0.0702 1731/01 Virt.NIC QDIO     01 qeth eth1             online

But I assume when a command `znetconf` exists  
(i.e. this is the test to find out we are on s390 architecture)  
you can run `znetconf -u` and `znetconf -a` in any case  
and nothing will go actually wrong so that  
on RHEL the code would enable network devices while  
on SLES the same code would actually do nothing.

To distinguish the architecture it seems you can use  
the `ARCH` variable in recovery system setup scripts  
because usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup  
sources /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf which sets `ARCH`.

for the 205\_s90\_enable disk, i tried writing to diskrestore.sh but had
some problems:  
currently i am not using zipl to mod the boot loader so it boots, runs
the scripts (which enable the networking device) i then run rear
recover  
`specifically rear -vDd recover`  
but the dasd devices are not enabled because diskrestore has not run and
i had changed layout/prepare/default/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh to
conditionally write to diskrestore.sh

when does diskrestore run?  
is it called by the recover or meant to run manually?  
if manually, should the dasd disks also be enabled in

@mutable-dan  
in general to get a better idea which scripts are run when  
use the simulation mode via the `-s` option like (excerpt)

    # rear -s recover
    ...
    Source layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/100_include_partition_code.sh
    ...
    Source layout/prepare/default/540_generate_device_code.sh
    ...
    Source layout/recreate/default/100_confirm_layout_code.sh
    Source layout/recreate/default/200_run_layout_code.sh

usually the `layout/prepare/.../...include...code.sh` scripts  
contain only functions that are run later,  
the layout/prepare/default/540\_generate\_device\_code.sh  
generates the `diskrestore.sh` script,  
the layout/recreate/default/100\_confirm\_layout\_code.sh  
is a user dialog that appears in MIGRATION\_MODE  
where the user can edit the `diskrestore.sh` script if neded,  
finally the `diskrestore.sh` script is run by  
the layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh script.

I would recommend to run "rear recover" in MIGRATION\_MODE via

    # export MIGRATION_MODE="true"

    # rear -D recover

This way you get several user dialogs that you can confirm step by
step.  
In each one you can also `Use Relax-and-Recover shell`  
and return back to that particular user dialog.  
In the Relax-and-Recover shell you can inspect or even adapt  
the system at that state during the "rear recover" process.

For example this way you could manually enable your dasd disks  
before the `diskrestore.sh` script is run to find out what exact  
command works for you to enable your dasd disks.  
Or you could add that command to your `diskrestore.sh` script.

##### Right now zipl is not called to setup the boot loader so rear is not called by the boot recovery

(I need to look into the proper sequences)

#### rear -vDd recover - or as you mentioned, rear -s recover

#### How disks are enabled

currently layout/prepare/default/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh  
reads from /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf

    where:
       /usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/200_partition_layout.sh:363
          calls lsdasd and writes
             dasd_channel 0.0.0100 active dasda 94:0 --> /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf
       i know that this is not part of the disklayout.conf spec
       one way to get around this (if we need to) is to have a separate device loop and write to another file

       We can't do lsdasd -a to get all device and then enable each of them
       because they are enabled as dasda, dasdb, dasdc, ... 
       and we don't know which channel belongs to which device 

As mentioned, I don't see where disrkrestore.sh is called and if i do
not enable the disk devices before 250\_compare\_disks.sh then recovery
fails

@mutable-dan

regarding the recovery system startup scripts in
etc/scripts/system-setup.d/

To debug issues with the recovery system startup scripts add `debug`  
to the kernel command line when booting the ReaR recovery system.  
This way the recovery system startup scripts will be called with
`set -x` set  
and each one after you confirmed its execution with \[Enter\] so that
you  
can see for each one its `set -x` output on the console.

Regarding where disrkrestore.sh is called:

It is called by layout/recreate/default/200\_run\_layout\_code.sh  
that runs disrkrestore.sh via `source $LAYOUT_CODE`  
which happens in a user dialog while loop (excerpt):

    # Run the disk layout recreation code (diskrestore.sh)
    # again and again until it succeeds or the user aborts:
    while true ; do
        # Run LAYOUT_CODE in a sub-shell because it sets 'set -e'
        # so that it exits the running shell in case of an error
        # but that exit must not exit this running bash here:
        ( source $LAYOUT_CODE )

@mutable-dan  
FYI what I personally basically always do to get an initial idea  
what belongs to a certain "thingy" in all those ReaR scripts  
is searching through all those ReaR scripts for it like

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'diskrestore'

or when I need primarily "suspicious" ReaR script file names

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -li 'diskrestore'

The main problem is to know how a certain "thingy" is called in ReaR  
e.g. `diskrestore.sh` or `LAYOUT_CODE` versus  
`disklayout.conf` or `LAYOUT_FILE` or `DISKLAYOUT_FILE`  
cf.

@jsmeix rhel 7 is in a working state:  
able to build the recovery kernel and initfs  
send it to zvm  
punch the kernel init and params and ipl the recovery machine  
run rear recovery, test that the dasd drives are partitioned with zipl
boot loader  
ipl the dasd bus-id to a recovered system

`/usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper`  
is needed

i saw this older issue:
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944)

I have just started to look at it but thought you might have some
insight?

For SLES 12 and 15 with its special default btrfs structure  
you need a special ReaR config, see the SLE\* example config files in  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples in particular for SLES 15 use  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf)  
as template.  
Terein see the comments how to add the right btrfs subvolumes to the
backup.

Alternatively to simplify testing use a simpler SLES system without
btrfs  
e.g. with only a single ext4 filesystem, cf. the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover" therein in particular item 3. at

@mutable-dan  
I am not in the office since some weeks and for some more weeks  
so that I cannot do much for ReaR.  
I cannot try out or test anything for ReaR - in particular not on IBM
Z.  
I expect to be back in the office at about beginning of October.  
But I also expect that I have to do first and foremost other stuff with
higher priority.

Regarding RHEL specific things  
@rmetrich and @pcahyna  
are our Red Hat experts.

Currently we do not have a dedicated IBM Z specialist.  
Perhaps @schabrolles from IBM might be able to help  
but he is actually an IBM POWER specialist who is  
`currently in vacation till the end of the month`  
and then `busy with client on-site requests`

adding support for kernel and initrd override for s390

#### override kernel and initrd name if arch is s390 and ZVM\_NAMING=Y is in local.conf

note: s390 kernel copy is only through nfs

s390 optional naming override of initrd and kernel to match the s390
filesytem naming conventions  
on s390 in ReaR, there is an option to name the initrd and kernel in the
form of VMID kernel, VMID initrd

file names on s390 are in the form of name type mode, we are concerned
with name and type  
if the vm name (cp q userid) is HOSTA then the files written will be
HOSTA kernel and HOSTA initrd

The reason for this option is that, on the flat filesytem of s390 with
many VM's there needs to be a way to organize the generated recoveries

vars needed:  
ZVM\_NAMING - set in local.conf, if Y then enable naming override  
ZVM\_KERNEL\_NAME - keeps track of kernel name in results array
(internal)  
ARCH - override only if ARCH is Linux-s390 (internal)

initrd name override is handled in 900\_create\_initramfs.sh  
kernel name override is handled in 400\_guess\_kernel.sh  
kernel name override is handled in 950\_copy\_result\_files.sh

@mutable-dan  
thank you for your continuous work on this issue!

Please tell me when things are in a at least basically usable state for
you  
because I would like to merge this pull request as soon as it is  
sufficiently complete to provide a single useful piece of functionality.

There is no need to wait until all is done for full featured IBM Z
support.

As soon as IBM Z support is usable at least in a very basic way  
things should be merged into our ReaR GitHub master code  
so that other IBM Z users could try it out and test it  
which helps a lot to improve IBM Z support in ReaR.

thank you.  
looking at some disk issues for LDL formatted disks. I would like to
wait until the end of this week before we discuss merging. CDL formatted
disks work fine, but not LDL  
SELinux kept us busy (recovery is a little different than non s390), I
will need to make some notes for the end users. Simple solution, but it
wasn't obvious

@mutable-dan  
thank you for testing it!  
I will wait with merging it until you gave me an OK  
that you finished your testing and things work for you.

There is another script where I think that it could be moved  
into an architecture specific directory:

From  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh  
to  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/Linux-s390/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/fb02447031edafb68685a93bc0ac9bdc911ab625/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/205\_s390\_enable\_disk.sh\#L7](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/fb02447031edafb68685a93bc0ac9bdc911ab625/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/205_s390_enable_disk.sh#L7)

That script has also several `FIXME:` comments from me  
because I do not understand the intent behind how  
the `echo` commands are meant to work in that script.

@jsmeix  
thank you, glad to help, we will continue to help support, bug fix and
test releases, glad to have the pull request completed. thank you for
your help also.

we should make a wiki section on s390 (which i would be happy to
contribute to) to give people tips and support trying out zlinux. so
that others do not repeat our mistakes and hurdles.

for example:  
on rhel with selinux, it was necessary on booting the recovery to put
selinux=0 on the kernel cmdline.... ie in the zvm param file.

and  
3270 can be a challenge for those used to vt220

@mutable-dan  
don't worry about 3270 terminal,  
even I managed to use it (for some very limited meaning of "use")

@mutable-dan @gdha  
I wonder if a wiki section on "IBM Z" is actually the right place  
because the wiki is outside of what is provided in ReaR itself.

I wonder if it is perhaps better to provide documentation about  
"ReaR on IBM Z (s390)" in the same way as other ReaR documentation

@wasifmoh  
instead of trying to make a RPM locally  
(I think you do not need to have ReaR as RPM package to test it)  
I would recommend  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code"  
as described in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

If you have issues with booting the ReaR recovery system  
on your replacement IBM Z virtual machine you may have a look at  
"Launching the ReaR recovery system via kexec" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
as a workaround.

See also the part about  
"Initial preliminary first basic support for IBM Z architecture" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L202](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L202)

Many thanks in advance for testing ReaR on IBM Z architecture!
