ReaR fails to find kernel modules, where aliases are present. For
example, the nVidia video driver modules on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS use aliases
like this: `nvidia_uvm` -&gt; `nvidia_384_uvm`, making
`rear -v mkrescue` produce error messages like this:

    Copying only currently loaded kernel modules (MODULES contains 'loaded_modules')
    ERROR: nvidia_uvm loaded but no module file?
    Aborting due to an error[...]

This PR fixes the module lookup code. It uses `modprobe` to check for
aliased modules. If the modprobe version installed does not support
alias resolution via `-R`, the new code will silently fall back to the
old behavior (i.e. no alias resolution).

@OliverO2  
many thanks for your contribution - and  
even more thanks for your perfect explanation  
what the issue is about and how you fixed it  
so that it is a pleasure for me to "just merge" it.

And on top of that now I even got an example  
why I had implemented tests like

<pre>
            # Can it really happen that a module exists (which is tested above) but 'modinfo -F filename' cannot show its filename?
            # To be on the safe side there is a test even for for such a possibly weird error here:
            module_files="$( modinfo_filename $module || Error "$module exists but no module file?" )"
</pre>

which nicely proves that tests even for possibly weird errors  
(that the developer could not imagine to actually happen)  
are "the right way" to implement things.

I explained now how it can happen that 'modinfo -F filename'  
cannot show a module filename (when the modprobe command  
does not support resolving module aliases via '-R').
