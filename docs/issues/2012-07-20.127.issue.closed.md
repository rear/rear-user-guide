I am pasting a bug report from rear-users into here for further
analysis. The original author is Cal Sawyer.

> I think i've uncovered a small scripting bug in
> *prep/USB/default/06\_set\_usb\_device.sh*, which causes archive
> writes to the outputfs/ path to fail

> *local.conf*, per documentation:
>
>     OUTPUT=USB
>     BACKUP=NETFS
>     BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
>
> In prep/NETFS/default/05\_check\_NETFS\_requirements.sh:
>
>     backuparchive is /disk1/tmp/rear.zlwSvhBIsE32725/outputfs/host.fqdn/backup.tar.gz
>
> USB\_PREFIX, as defined in *06\_set\_usb\_device.sh*:
>
>     USB_PREFIX="/rear//$(uname -n)/$(date +%Y%m%d.%H%M)"
>
> Results in *50\_make\_backup.sh*:
>
>     opath is /disk1/tmp/rear.zlwSvhBIsE32725/outputfs//rear//host.fqdn/20120716.1515
>
> Consequently, the tar archive step can't write to this non-existent
> path. Changing USB\_PREFIX in 06\_set\_usb\_device.sh to:
>
>     USB_PREFIX="$(uname -n)/$(date +%Y%m%d.%H%M)"
>
> makes opath consistent with backuparchive and the tar archive
> succeeds.

I can acknowledge both, the bug and the fix, on rear-1.13.0

I've done a complete backup/restore test with above settings with
`rear-1.13.0-git201207200104` with success. I did not modify any script.
Please use the latest snapshot versions to correct above mentioned
issue.
