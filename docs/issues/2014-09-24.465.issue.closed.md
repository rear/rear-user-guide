Hi,

when configuring rear with BACKUP=NETFS and NETFS\_URL=... pointing to a
folder not only containing backups of one single node, but other data
(like backups of other nodes) rear can delete all files on the NFS
location when cleaning up tmp directories. Here the scenario to
reproduce:

1.  rear version Relax-and-Recover 1.16.1 (on SLES 11.3)
2.  configure rear with BACKUP=NETFS and NETFS\_URL point to a directory
    which is not empty, so used for example by other machines to store
    also their backups
3.  login via ssh to the machine to be backed up
4.  start to create a backup with "rear -v mkbackup" and wait until rear
    shows progress about files system backup on terminal (something like
    "Archived 434 MiB \[avg 8722 KiB/sec\]")
5.  loose connection to your machine (either by fault or use "kill PID"
    where PID is the PID of your ssh session
6.  rear now recognizes that the session died  
    (Log entry in rear-<hostname>.log:  
    /usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh: line 1: 38654
    Hangup)
7.  rear now tries to unmount the NFS share, but this fails
    unfortunately as most likely still some data is transferred  
    (Log entry in rear-<hostname>.log:  
    ++++ umount -f -v /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs  
    .....................  
    umount2: Device or resource busy)
8.  rear ignores the umount problem and forces removal of "temp" data  
    (Log entry in rear-<hostname>.log:  
    2014-09-24 16:56:43 Removing build area /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw  
    ++++ rm -Rf /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/tmp  
    ++++ rm -Rf /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/rootfs  
    ++++ rm -Rf /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs)
9.  result is that all folders on NFS directory mounted by rear are gone
    (so also the ones not created by rear)

In my point of view this is a very nasty behaviour. Rear should not
cleanup outputfs folder when NFS unmount fails.

Workaround is to point NETFS\_URL= to a dedicated directory on NFS to
ensure that rear can only delete backups of that single node.

Edit: I have a rear-<hostname>.log with debugscript mode enabled.
Unfortunately I can not attach it, github only accepts images?

Edit 2: Besides this rear works like a charm on HP DL380G8 servers
running SLES 11.3. Thanks a lot for the great tool.

BR, Andreas

@andreas-tarp It is the `/tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs` which is
causing you the pains. You can add the log via gist.github.com and copy
the link in here.

Hi,

thanks for the gist.gitbug.com tip. Here the logfile:  
[https://gist.github.com/andreas-tarp/210bee9b4ef52dec4d60/download\#](https://gist.github.com/andreas-tarp/210bee9b4ef52dec4d60/download#)

I see in the log file:

    ++++ rm -Rf /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs
    rm: cannot remove `/tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs': Device or resource busy
    ++++ rmdir -v /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw
    rmdir: removing directory, `/tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw'
    rmdir: failed to remove `/tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw': Directory not empty

that the outputfs directory could not be removed. Therefore, I cannot
understand (yet) that files beneath the outputfs get deleted? Are you
saying that all the files got deleted execpt the directory itself?

on NFS server all files and folders below the folder configured in rear
local.conf parameter NETFS\_URL are deletet. I think the message

    rm: cannot remove `/tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs': Device or resource busy

is shown as rear can not delete the outputfs folder on machine running
"rear mkbackup" as NFS directory is still mounte (umount failed due to
device being busy).

Below some printouts from NFS server showing the behavior there before
and after rear crashed due to lost ssh connection:

1.  rear backup runnning. ls -lsh output on NFS server at backup
    destination folder configured in /etc/rear/local.conf. As you can
    see there are also a few "nodeX" subfolders not belonging to current
    backup prozess which is writing to subfolder "Node20"

1.  ssh session with rear running in foreground got killed, afterwards
    all files on mounted directory on NFS Server are deleted (ls does
    not show anything anymore):

<!-- -->

    -bash-3.00# pwd
    /flardir/Core/
    -bash-3.00# ls -lsh *

1.  on the machine which had "rear mkbackup" running NFS destionation is
    still mounted, but rear itself has already terminated. Thats the
    reason why outputfs can not be deleted:

<!-- -->

    Node20:/var/log/rear # mount
    ..............
    192.168.0.177:/flardir/Core/Node20/rear/ on /tmp/rear.ZsnBUJDGiKeYRNw/outputfs type nfs (rw,nfsvers=3,nolock,addr=192.168.0.177)

@andreas-tarp perhaps you could try the following : change in
`lib/framework-functions.sh`the function
cleanup\_build\_area\_and\_end\_program the line
`rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs` into `rmdir $v  $BUILD_DIR/outputfs`  
Keep me informed if this would fix your problem?

@gdha thanks a lot for looking into the issue. Now with the replaced
line the system behaves much better. Rear is not deleting folders on the
NFS location anymore. Of course it now fails to delete the local
/tmp/rear.xxxx folder as it is not empty. On top the NFS locations is
still beeing mounted after rear finished.  
But a manual unmount works fine after logging in again to the system
Maybe it would make sense to implement some waiting (maybe 10 or 20
seconds) and a umount retry afterwards. I assume, that the umount fails
until system has written cached data to NFS location, which might take
several seconds.
