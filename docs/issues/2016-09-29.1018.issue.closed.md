Relax-and-Recover (rear) release 1.19 preparation
=================================================

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.19
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): n/a
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): n/a
-   Place-holder for new release of Relax-and-Recover (rear) release
    1.19 - what may we not forget

I would suggest that we freeze our **master** code and only update some
pieces of the documentation (if required) so we can have a clean release
within a week or so. Suggestion are welcome.

We should only accept from now until the release **critical** and
**security** bugs for *rear-1.19*.

Good grief!  
It is assigned also to me but I don't know  
what you @gdha expect from me to do here.  
But of course I like to help you as good as I can.

@gdha  
which of the steps in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
should I do?

Personally since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/953](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/953)  
is fixed (i.e. since it "just works" for me on SLE12-SP2)  
a rear-1.19 release is fine for me.

@jsmeix You should just be aware of the fact that we are in a freeze
period. And, perhaps, check if our documentation requires here and there
a face lift?

I will check the documentation...

Currently this is the only open issue for the "Rear v1.19" milestone.

@gdha  
currently I find several files that contain UTF-8 Unicode characters:

<pre>
doc/rear-presentation.adoc: UTF-8 Unicode English text
doc/rear-release-notes.txt: UTF-8 Unicode English text
doc/user-guide/09-design-concepts.adoc: UTF-8 Unicode C++ program text
</pre>

and

<pre>
usr/share/rear/backup/DUPLICITY/default/50_make_duplicity_backup.sh: UTF-8 Unicode English text
usr/share/rear/lib/mkrescue-functions.sh: UTF-8 Unicode English text
</pre>

I think UTF-8 characters in scripts are not wanted  
(they may even cause arbitrary bad failures on systems that  
do not support the UTF-8 locale - e.g. during "rear recover")  
so that I will fix the UTF-8 characters in scripts.

But I wonder if the English documentation really needs  
UTF-8 characters - it makes it at least harder to  
display the documentation for any user on any system.  
When one does not have a UTF-8 locale set arbitrary  
nonsense could happen, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain\_Text\_versus\_Locale](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Plain_Text_versus_Locale)

Therefore I would prefer if the Relax-and-Recover documentation  
only uses ASCII characters that "just work" everywhere  
unless there is a really good reason for locale-specific stuff.

Therefore my question:  
@gdha  
do you agree that I simplify the Relax-and-Recover documentation  
so that only ASCII characters are used?

@jsmeix be my guest ;-) I agree with you

@gdha  
regarding how one could generate rear-release-notes.txt  
with only ASCII output, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1025\#issuecomment-251675516](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1025#issuecomment-251675516)

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/6](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/pull/6)
merged  
it looks o.k. for me for the 1.19 release but I did not check  
the whole Relax-and-Recover documentation - this would be  
a bigger task for the future.

FYI (for the future):

In general I think all Relax-and-Recover documentation sources  
should be stored at one single place,  
either in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc)  
or in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation)

If the Relax-and-Recover documentation files are needed  
at several places they can be copied whereto needed  
but I think the original source files (i.e. what is edited by us)  
should be stored at one single place.

Furthermore I think all documentation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation)  
should be also provided in the rear RPM packages  
which basically means all documentation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/tree/master/documentation)  
should be also in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/doc)

Or is there a good reason why we have two separated  
sources for Relax-and-Recover documentation?

@jsmeix I'll try to finish up 1.19 tomorrow. Any item I might have
forgotten?  
PS: IMHO the web site must not be the same as the user guide or vice
versa. The web site is already linking to the github pages of the user
guide where possible. However, I agree we should try to avoid double
information.

Currenty I am not aware of a forgotten item.

FYI  
a side note or proposal regarding  
"use git log --oneline to find all modifications since last
release..."  
on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)

For me the following git command results a nicer  
initial output for the release notes:

<pre>
git log --format="* %s : %b %n" --topo-order
</pre>

As rear-1.19 has been released we can close this issue as well.
