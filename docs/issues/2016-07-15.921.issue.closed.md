-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git

$ rear --help  
ERROR: Relax-and-Recover needs ROOT privileges!

Maybe it could work even without root privileges.

From a user's point of view  
it could be made working without root privileges  
but as it is currently implemented it would require  
some exceptional case handling for that.

Currently "rear --help" is implemented as a "help" workflow  
and all workflows (i.e. anything that is run by /usr/sbin/rear)  
have that test that root runs /usr/sbin/rear.

Because "man rear" works for any user, I don't think  
it is really worth the effort to implement exceptional case  
handling when "/usr/sbin/rear --help" outputs its usage  
information.

@scr4bble  
if you really think this feature is a must-have,  
reopen this issue together with a GitHub pull request  
so that we can see hwo you think it should be actually  
implemented.
