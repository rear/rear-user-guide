-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I don't know how I could test it.  
    I cannot reproduce the matching issue  
    because I don't have a system with /sys/block/nvme0c0n1  
    or something similar - i.e. where a /sys/block/device  
    does not have a matching /dev/device.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Let the is\_write\_protected function  
report candidate devices without device node  
as not write protected  
because not all /sys/block devices have a "dev" file  
e.g. /sys/block/nvme0c0n1 has no /dev/nvme0c0n1 device node, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3085](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3085)

Because the is\_write\_protected function is meant  
to identify write-protected disks and partitions  
only candidate devices with a device node  
are considered for write protection.

@pcahyna  
could you please have a look here (as time permits)  
because I don't know how to test it as I don't have a system  
with /sys/block/nvme0c0n1 or something similar  
i.e. where a /sys/block/device does not have a matching /dev/device

Oops - I did it again ;-)

Because I got confused by the former helper functions  
where all used `$device` but with changed meanings  
I needed to clean up things so that at least I can  
better understand what goes on to be able to fix  
issues that I can neither reproduce nor test  
with a higher probability that my fix actually works.

I did some tests on my test system  
and things worked so far at least for me  
so it is now (hopefully) not totally broken.

I will test more tomorrow.
