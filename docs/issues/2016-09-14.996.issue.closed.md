Relax-and-Recover (rear) Issue Template
=======================================

Please fill in the following items before submitting a new issue:

-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):  
    1.17.2
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):  
    RHEL6 & 7
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):  
    OUTPUT=PXE  
    BACKUP=BACULA  
    CLONE\_ALL\_USERS\_GROUPS=y  
    OUT\_URL=nfs://<our server>  
    OUTPUT\_PREFIX=`hostname`
-   Brief description of the issue  
    As you can see we use Rear in combination with bacula backup tool.
    We are facing the problem that rear needs the bacula console to work
    properly. But an installed bacula console on a client allows to
    restore files from any other host. This is a big security issue we
    are facing.  
    Question: is there a way in rear to disable the bconsole check so
    that we can uninstall the console on each client (recovery should be
    done only on the server).
-   Work-around, if any  
    I played around with the rear bacula preq. shell scripts but it
    ended up not working doing a restore.  
    Any suggestions?

What you probably want is a mechanism to push the backup to the client,
right? Instead of the client doing the pull?

Correct.  
Our first idea was to manipulate the rear scripts and remove the
bacula-console check. But it ended up that rear was not able to create
the filesystem layout (during restore process)
