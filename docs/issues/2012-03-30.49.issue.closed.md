Now that the new layout code seems to be working quite well, we can get
rid of the old dr and recreate stages.

As part of this cleanup we can get rid of the rear\_vol\_id wrapper.
**Please** verify that every use of vol\_id, udev\_volume\_id or blkid
is covered !

noticed that in other workflows there are still some symlinks to 'dr'
files. Noticed a message during a recovery exercise of Fedora 16 that
rear\_vol\_id was mentioned to be used. Should pay some closer attention
in the coming days...

The compatibility library creates the rear\_vol\_id wrapper based on the
tools available on the system. So what you most likely saw was the
compatibility library telling you on what tool the rear\_vol\_id wrapper
was based.

    Debug "Using 'vol_id' for rear_vol_id"
    Debug "Using 'udev_volume_id' for rear_vol_id"
    Debug "Using 'blkid' for rear_vol_id"

Apart from the dr code none of the layout-code (or other code) depends
on vol\_id, blkid or udev\_volume\_id, which is great because keeping
that compatibility alive was hard. We can in fact get rid of the
compatibility library (as it has no other purpose than this one).

BTW This wrapper is not new, but was called vol\_id before, and that was
confusing because in many cases it was not in fact using vol\_id :-)

BTW Yes, there are three workflows that still use the dr stage:
**mkdr**, **mkrescue** and **mkbackup**

Both **mkrescue** and **mkbackup** use the "dr" stage when `USE_LAYOUT`
is not set, I honestly don't know what the purpose is of the **mkdr**
workflow. I think we can get rid of this as well, if everyone agrees
that the layout code is an improvement in every use-case over the
dr/recreate code.

Note that I propose to clean this up after release v1.14, so we'll do
one more release before getting rid of it. Again, if everyone agrees :-)
(Personally I don't mind removing it today, less code == less that can
fail !)

In the meantime I have been looking into this and have already made the
necessary changes 3 times, however I also lost 3 times all my changes
because I cannot make feature-branches work. I lost the changes when
doing a checkout, I tried to merge it with origin, committed it to
origin/master, to no avail.

Jeroen ? :-)
