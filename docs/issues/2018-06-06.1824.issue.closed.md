Hello,

my recovery from an USB-stick failed, but MBR of the SSD has already
been erased.  
Is there anything I can do to restore the backup successfully ?

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): rear\_2.3-0\_amd64

    /etc/os-release"): Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

My recovery from an USB-stick failed, but MBR of the SSD has already
been erased.  
A few seconds after the start of rear recover it quits with the error
message "disk layout recreation script failed'  
During the boot procedure of rear I see the message -don't know how to
make device "nvmen"-. (I don't know if this is important)

@malvinas2  
your rear-ubuntu.log contains

<pre>
+++ parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart 'EFI System Partition' 1048576B 537919487B
parted: invalid token: System
Error: Expecting a file system type.
</pre>

so that this issue is a duplicate of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563)  
which was fixed after the ReaR 2.3 release.

The workaround in your case is to manually adapt the `diskrestore.sh`
script  
inside the ReaR recovery system while "rear recover" runs via the
UserInput  
`3) Edit disk recreation script (/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh)`
choice.

You need to replace in the `diskrestore.sh` script all

<pre>
... 'EFI System Partition' ...
</pre>

values with a value without blanks like

<pre>
... 'EFI_System_Partition' ...
</pre>

or alternatively use duplicated quoting as described here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563\#issuecomment-359774531](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1563#issuecomment-359774531)

To use a ReaR version where this issue should be already fixed:

I recommend to use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
because that is the only place where we fix bugs - i.e. bugs in
released  
ReaR versions are not fixed by us (i.e. by ReaR upstream).  
Bugs in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported)  
by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got your ReaR version.

To use our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
do the following:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

Thank you very much for your quick and detailed answer!

@malvinas2  
you are welcome!  
Thanks for your explicit positive feedback.  
It helps (at least me) a lot to have an explicit feedback  
that there is no possibly other still unknown issue in ReaR.
