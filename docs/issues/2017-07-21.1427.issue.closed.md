In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd13be8f1bb091e1d324d35d3be527b34346a38e)  
I noticed changes of the AUTHORS and COPYRIGHT parts  
in doc/rear.8.adoc.

Those changes are missing  
in doc/rear.8 and  
in usr/sbin/rear and  
in the AUTHORS file.

I can adapt those files but I would need to know  
what the actually right list of authors is.

In my opinion the list of authors contains

1.  those who can write to the rear git repo
2.  those who add themselves to the list via a PR together with a
    relevant or significant contribution

In any case we give write access to our regular contributors to make it
easier for them and to reward their contribution.

What do you think?

For this issue here I had hoped I could get  
a "ready-to-use" list of names,  
not an abstract definition ;-)

My current main issue here is that the AUTHORS file  
content differs compared to doc/rear.8.adoc.

Clearly @gozora "Vladimir Gozora" is missing as author.

But what about other major contributors even without GitHub  
write access like @schabrolles "Sebastien Chabrolles"?

In contrast what about long inactive major contributors?

Could it have some legal relevance who is listed as "author"?  
I think the only legal relevance regarding license issues is  
who contributed and not who is listed as what in which file.

I wonder if it o.k. to list only the current main contributors  
as "author" in the current source files to keep the  
information who is an "author" usefully up-to-date?

Is the AUTHORS file meant as up-to-date information  
for interested users who are current "main persons"?

Or is the AUTHORS file meant as reference of all  
persons who had ever contributed something?

According to  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Recording-Contributors.html](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Recording-Contributors.html)  
the latter is meant.

But I wonder if nowadays git history isn't much better  
to provide that information.

At least I will not continuously maintain an AUTHORS file  
that contains all that information.

Or we "just generate" it using "git log -p --follow" for each file  
to get tons of strictly correct but useless information ;-)

I see, sorry. And yes, I would be happy to see @schabrolles mentioned
there.

Maybe for starters we consolidate all the different locations to a
single one (e.g. the AUTHORS file) and reference that from the others?
That we we have only one file to maintain. We could then copy this file
as a doc file into the RPM/DEB packages to make it also available
offline.

I played around how we could generate an AUTHORS file  
that is to some reasonable extent in compliance with  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Recording-Contributors.html](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Recording-Contributors.html)

I think there are two main measures  
cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure\_%28mathematics%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_%28mathematics%29)  
how to measure the "legally significant contribution weight"  
of a person:

1.  

The simpler one is the number of git commits  
which is directly available from within a git checkout via

<pre>
git shortlog -e -s -n
</pre>

E.g. this results on my current git checkout:

<pre>
$ git shortlog -e -s -n | head -n20

   317  Dag Wieers &lt;dag@wieers.com>
   223  Jeroen Hoekx &lt;jeroen.hoekx@hamok.be>
   198  Schlomo Schapiro &lt;github@schlomo.schapiro.org>
    98  Sebastien Chabrolles &lt;s.chabrolles@fr.ibm.com>
    95  Dag WieÃ«rs &lt;dag@wieers.com>
    45  Vladimir Gozora &lt;c@gozora.sk>
    28  Didac Oliveira &lt;didac@brainupdaters.net>

</pre>

Note that same persons could be listed under  
different git author IDs.

This provides a reasonable short overview about  
who the main contributors are (or have been in the past)  
but it does not tell how much a person really contributed  
and it does not tell where a person contributed  
so that this alone is insufficient to be in compliance with  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Recording-Contributors.html](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Recording-Contributors.html)

Therefore an additional more precise measure is needed:

1.  

A more complicated measure is needed to be in compliance with  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Recording-Contributors.html](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Recording-Contributors.html)  
at least to some reasonable extent for automated generation  
of an AUTHORS file.

Hereby I propose as such a measure to count in each source file  
how many lines of code a person had contributed over the time.

I think that "had contributed over the time" is crucial  
because as far as I understand  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Recording-Contributors.html](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Recording-Contributors.html)  
the AUTHORS file is meant to contain all authors  
from the very beginning and not only some recent ones.

Therefore things like "git blame $source\_file" are insufficient.  
Instead the whole source file history needs to be considered  
i.e. "git log --follow $source\_file".

As far as I understand  
[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html\_node/Legally-Significant.html\#Legally-Significant](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Legally-Significant.html#Legally-Significant)  
from that follows that only added code lines count as  
"Legally Significant Changes" because when only real existing  
code lines count, then removed code lines can no longer count  
so that I conclude that only added code lines count.  
Accordingly my following script counts only added code lines  
and it ignores whitespace changes (because I assume whitespaces  
are no real existing code) but it can be easily changed to also count  
removed lines and/or whitespace changes (e.g. sometimes  
a whitespace change could fix even a severe bug).

Furthermore I skip files that are no regular files  
and symbolic links (to avoid things get counted twice).

My script that counts in each source file how many lines of code  
a person had contributed over the time:

<pre>
for src in $( git ls-files ) ; do
    test -f $src || continue
    test -L $src && continue
    echo
    echo $src
    git log --minimal -w -U0 --follow $src \
        | egrep -o '^Author: .*|^\+' \
        | egrep -v '^\+\+' \
        | while read key value ; do
              if test "Author:" = "$key" ; then
                  author="$value"
                  continue
              fi
              echo $author
          done | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
done
</pre>

Again same persons could be listed under different git author IDs.

@jsmeix just an idea ...

What about using github api for getting all contributor data?  
Rear contributor statistics can be obtained at
[https://api.github.com/repos/rear/rear/stats/contributors](https://api.github.com/repos/rear/rear/stats/contributors)
, but there might be a small problem with parsing JSON :-).

I think it is important that we can build ReaR offline:

1.  create a dist tar.gz from a git clone without Internet
2.  create OS packages from the dist tar.gz without git

That way we can be sure to support also older or strange systems (e.g.
SLES10 doesn't come with git) and we enable users who must work offline
to build from source. In certain strongly validated environments this is
necessary.

Not sure I understand your

@schlomo , aren't we talking here about creation of AUTHORS file?  
For me building package is different story ...

@jsmeix thank you very much for bringing this up. After today's
discussion I came to the conclusion that we should indeed change the way
how we deal with this. I am preparing a new PR right now which I will
put up for discussion. My direction is to remove most of the names from
the software and to give much more honor to all the many contributors
and all the maintainers who helped ReaR to become the leading DR
software.

Thank you @jsmeix also for making a concrete suggestion in \#1428 which
helped me to understand the critical aspects of the details at that
level. Code and specific suggestions really help to bring such a
discussion to a clear point where we can take a decision. I would kindly
ask you to take down this list of email addresses to protect our
contributors as much as we can.

I tried to understand what to do with the copyright notice and came upon
[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html\#AssignCopyright](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#AssignCopyright)
which makes me wonder if we should have asked all ReaR contributors to
assign their copyright to a singular entity. Since we didn't do that I
suppose that every contributor actually retains his copyright over his
code pieces.

I don't know yet if we should do something about that, maybe somebody
else has some more experience in this area.
