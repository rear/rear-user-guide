A few days ago I received a SUSE internal bug report with same symptoms.

I am not a PPC user and I am not a booting expert  
in particular I know nothing about booting specific things on PPC  
but from what I and a colleague at SUSE found out in that SUSE internal
bug report  
the issue seems to be as follows:

I guess /proc/cpuinfo shows in your case something like

    platform        : pSeries

but the code in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/620\_install\_grub2.sh  
that is (excerpt)

    if [[ $(awk '/platform/ {print $NF}' < /proc/cpuinfo) == PowerNV ]] ; then
        grub2_install_option="--no-nvram"
    fi

only tests for

    platform    : PowerNV

so grub2-install gets called without the --no-nvram option  
and because there is no /dev/nvram in the ReaR recovery system and  
then also not in the recreated system inside 'chroot /mnt/local'  
grub2-install that is run inside 'chroot /mnt/local' fails with

    nvram: ERROR: cannot open "/dev/nvram": No such file or directory
    nvram: ERROR: cannot open "/dev/misc/nvram": No such file or directory

As far as I was told /dev/nvram exists on the original system  
but currently I have no idea why it is missing in the ReaR recovery
system.  
On a KVM/QEMU x86\_64 virtual machine with legacy BIOS  
(running on my x86\_64 homeoffice laptop)  
I have /dev/nvram both in the ReaR recovery system and  
also inside 'chroot /mnt/local' because ReaR bind-mounts it.  
So the missing /dev/nvram in the ReaR recovery system on PPC  
seems to be something that is specific on PPC architecture.

Therefore it seems calling grub2-install with the --no-nvram option  
could be more a workaround for the missing /dev/nvram  
in the ReaR recovery system on PPC than the real solution  
which would be to get /dev/nvram in the ReaR recovery system  
also on PPC if it exists on the original system.

To get grub2-install called with the --no-nvram option  
it should be sufficient to adapt the code part

    if [[ $(awk '/platform/ {print $NF}' < /proc/cpuinfo) == PowerNV ]]
    then grub2_install_option="--no-nvram"
    fi

in usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
according to what `platform` vaule is shown in /proc/cpuinfo  
on your particular system - e.g. replace `PowerNV`  
by the `platform` vaule of your particular system.

A side note FYI:  
At ReaR upstream @schabrolles (from IBM France)  
who contributed basically all latest ReaR enhancements for PPC  
got other tasks by IBM so he does no longer actively work for ReaR.  
Currently there is nobody at ReaR upstream  
who could properly maintain the PPC related code in ReaR  
to keep it continuously up to date with newest things  
so ReaR on PPC basically rots at ReaR upstream :-(

Maybe as a note: it seems the existence of the /dev/nvram device is
probably dependend wether if the system is booted from OpenFirmware or
SMS:

**Install GRUB to /boot/grub (the default path). Option --no-nvram
prevents GRUB from setting the Open Firmware boot-device nvram
variable.**

Was the powerpc lpar/system in question booted via SMS or
openfirmware?  
Qemu allways uses OpenFirmware. Maybe backup was created while system
was booted via OpenFirmware and recovery ISO was booted from SMS? Or
vice versa.

@jsmeix thank you for reply.  
Yes, pSeries was from /proc/cpuinfo info.

Change some configuration in site.conf and add

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( /usr/local /home /srv /var /opt /crash /tmp /boot/grub2/powerpc-ieee1275 /dev)

Now in the tar file I have all filesystems ( I noticed that I do not
have e.g /opt ).

I booted system from ISO and change  
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
replace PowerNV to pSeries:

GRUB was install and all looks fine but ...  
When I booted system, it boot from cd-rom.  
Then I unmount cd from LPAR, system was properly boot from hard drive.  
But bootlist looks like:

    sles15sp2:~ # bootlist -o -m normal
    cdrom
    sda
    eth0
        speed = auto
        duplex = auto

        Client: 000.000.000.000
        Gateway: 000.000.000.000

So I'm not sure that the

    Set LPAR bootlist to '/dev/sdh /dev/sdf /dev/sdd /dev/sdb /dev/sdg'

is working correctly.

@abbbi  
I boot iso via SMS mode.  
In tar file I have /dev/nvram file, but when ReaR install Grub the file
is gone.  
I will talk about nvram with my team because I don't know anything about
it.

I doubt this. SMS is an extension on top of ofw, and uses ofw to boot.
qemu does not have SMS yet it has nvram (it has completely different ofw
implementtaion, though). In fact I have not seen a pSeries platform that
does not support nvram on using POWER7 and later hardware.

@viper1986  
you have now

    BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( ... /dev)

which is not right in general  
because you should not have device nodes in the backup  
because you should not restore device nodes from a backup  
because that could overwrite the current device nodes of the system  
where the backup is restored but one should not overwrite device nodes  
because the kernel (and udev) generate them right  
so overwriting device nodes may cause any kind of weird arbitrary
failures.

@jsmeix  
Thank you for information. I will delete /dev from BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE
and test recover again.

@viper1986  
please try out an additional setting in etc/rear/local.conf

Add to your etc/rear/local.conf

    MODULES_LOAD+=( nvram )

which should result an automated "modprobe nvram" during  
ReaR recovery system startup via its startup script  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh

The source code file of that startup script is  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/40-start-udev-or-load-modules.sh

The reason behind is that - as far as I know - on POWER architecture  
the nvram kernel driver is not or no longer built into the kernel  
but nowadays it is built as a kernel module.

When the kernel module nvram is loaded its associated device node
/dev/nvram  
should be created by the kernel itself and then it should work to call  
grub2-install without the additional --no-nvram option.

I.e. with `MODULES_LOAD+=( nvram )` things should "just work"  
so that you should no longer need your change in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
where you had replaced 'PowerNV' with 'pSeries'.

I got a confirmation from another SLES15 user on PPC that with

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
    MODULES_LOAD+=( nvram )

things work for him with ReaR version 2.4

Also

    MODULES+=( nvram )
    MODULES_LOAD+=( nvram )

should be sufficient

Since ReaR version 2.5 there is `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` by default
so only

    MODULES_LOAD+=( nvram )

should be sufficient since ReaR version 2.5.
