-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   How was this pull request tested?

On my SLES15-SP6 test VM:

    # usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue
    ...
    Skipping network interface 'lo': not bound to any physical interface.
    ...

    # usr/sbin/rear -d mkrescue
    ...
    Handling network interface 'eth0'
    eth0 is a physical device
    Handled network interface 'eth0'
    Skipping network interface 'lo': not bound to any physical interface.
    ...

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh  
show more consistent texts in user messages  
in particular to avoid during "rear -v mkrescue"  
the "lonely" message

    Skipping 'lo': not bound to any physical interface.

without any context  
in contrast to "rear -d mkrescue"

    Handling network interface 'eth0'
    eth0 is a physical device
    Handled network interface 'eth0'
    Skipping 'lo': not bound to any physical interface.

where the context (handling network interfaces) is clear.

Also do not in any case silently skip  
interfaces which are not 'up'  
but show that (at least) in debug mode.
