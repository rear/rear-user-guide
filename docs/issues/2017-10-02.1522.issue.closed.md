-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): snapshot
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): SLES10
-   Brief description of the issue:  
    Noticed on OBS that the rpm package build failed for SLES10 - I know
    we do not support it anymore, but still...

The is\_ip() function that contains this was introduced by  
@schabrolles via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ef0256256d38e8c52d7f3e17797ea9378f3727b4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/ef0256256d38e8c52d7f3e17797ea9378f3727b4)

@schabrolles  
could you try if you could also implement that functionality  
with some more traditional bash 3.0 compliant code?

@schabrolles  
only FYI you may have a look at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/758](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/758)  
and the resulting  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/be841759880e0a3a3a1282bba01d0cc0e3b5fc36](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/be841759880e0a3a3a1282bba01d0cc0e3b5fc36)  
where I had "fun with bash 3.x compliance" ;-)

@gdha  
do you think it is possible with reasonable effort  
to run several automated tests that run "bash -n"  
with various bash versions to catch such issues early?

@jsmeix Sorry, for the delay, a bit busy...  
Do you know if there is a way to easily test `bash-3.1` without
installing a SLES10 ?  
I tried `shopt -s compat31` but I can't reproduce the error with it :(

Do you have a better idea ?

@schabrolles  
my question about automated tests in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1522\#issuecomment-334099770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1522#issuecomment-334099770)  
was primarily meant for @gdha who implemented (as far as I know)  
the current continuous integration checks with Travis that are run  
automatically for each pull request.

My idea was if it is possible to run those tests on several systems  
e.g. older ones with older bash and newer ones with newer bash  
or perhaps only on an older one with an old bash as long as  
"bash -n" is the only actual test that is done.

Currently, e.g. on  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1526](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1526)  
click on "Show all checks" and then on "Details" which leads  
to a Travis page where a "Job log" is shown.  
On such a Travis job log click on "Raw log" to inspect  
the log in better readable form.  
Currently for me such a Travis raw log contains (excerpts)

<pre>
Operating System Details
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
...
bash version
GNU bash, version 4.3.11(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
</pre>

Therefore my question to @gdha was if it is possible  
with reasonable effort to use an older operating system  
with a sufficiently old bash for the "bash -n" tests.

@jsmeix @schabrolles No problem - I will test this next week on SLES10
SP4 systems, which is probably old enough

@jsmeix @gdha

The following seems to work for me for bash-3.1 and bash-4.X ..  
The only change is to use a variable to store the regex.

Could you confirm it works on your SLES10 ?

    pattern="^(([0-9]{1,2}|1[0-9]{2}|2([0-4][0-9]|5[0-5]))\.){3}([0-9]{1,2}|1[0-9]{2}|2([0-4][0-9]|5[0-5]))$"

    for test_ip in 1.2.3.4 1.a.3.4 1.999.3.4 ; do
    echo -n "$test_ip "
    if [[ $test_ip =~ $pattern ]]; then
            echo OK
    else
            echo FAILED
    fi 
    done

-   With bash 4.3

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1528](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1528)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

@schabrolles  
many thanks for the fix and even more thanks  
for finding a way that seems to solve the problem of  
quoted regex (bash &lt;3.2) and non-quoted regex (bash &gt;= 3.2), cf.
