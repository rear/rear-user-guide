Rear is not discovering any networking infrastructure (missing drivers?)
when a recovery disk is moved from a different manufactures kit. other
-&gt;DL380 gen7

Is it possible to run "rear" on a fully configured DL380 then use the
initrd.cgz from that image & transplant it into the other systems boot
media to bring the networking on line?

both systems are running centos7 & the same versions.  
disk partitioning is the same.

@razorfish-sl  
regardless that I have no experience at all with things  
like "prolient dl380 Gen7" or "DL380" I wonder what  
exactly you mean with "missing drivers?"

If you mean that certain kernel modules are not included  
in the rescue/recovery system, have a look at the current  
newest GitHub ReaR master where there is now  
support for some new special MODULES values  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'loaded\_modules' )  
MODULES=( 'no\_modules' )  
This way users can better specify what kernel modules  
get included in the rescue/recovery system.  
See the explanation in default.conf and the  
issues
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1355)

For system migration I would recommend to use  
MODULES=( 'all\_modules' )  
to be on the safe side.

And regarding having all firmware files in the recovery system  
(some NICs need that), see FIRMWARE\_FILES in default.conf  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1216](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1216)

I assume "no news is good news" so that it can be closed.

@razorfish-sl  
I think you can still add comments even when an issue is closed.  
If the issue still exists, you can reopen it but then provide  
more specific information so that others have a better chance  
to imagine what might go wrong on your particular system, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
and also see "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at

OK I think i have tracked this down on proliant systems.

Normally in /sys/class/net/  
There are link files for each Network interface, these are linked in to
the PCIE tree.

It seems that IF you move a rear recovery from another system to the
proliant, the network link files are NOT regenerated.  
This means that the network cannot be configured and you cannot get a
net connection.

maybe the 'proliants' have something weird with their PCI tree due to
all the embedded chips.
