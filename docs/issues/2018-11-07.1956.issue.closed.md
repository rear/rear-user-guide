Currently the [Relax-and-Recover
Development](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/mailman/listinfo/rear-devel)
mailing list receives an email for every change in our GitHub ReaR repo.

As GitHub is deprecGitHub is discontinuing their [email notification
service](https://help.github.com/articles/about-email-service-notifications-for-pushes-to-your-repository/).
We need to

-   \[ \] decide amongst @rear/contributors if we want to continue the
    GitHub commit emails
-   \[ \] find a new solution for delivering commit emails

One alternative that everybody can use is
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/applets/46106p-github-commits-to-email).

FWIW, it seems like the only postings on the rear-devel list are those
GitHub push notifications. Maybe it will be simpler for everybody
involved if those who want to have them solve this on their own.

I wish to also include @rmetrich here because I assume  
he and @schabrolles and perhaps also @gozora  
are in the same situation as I am:

As far as I understand  
[https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/)

<pre>
We have deprecated GitHub Services
in favor of integrating with webhooks.
</pre>

and  
[https://developer.github.com/webhooks/\#events](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events)

<pre>
Webhooks allow you to build or set up GitHub Apps
which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com.
When one of those events is triggered, we'll send
a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. 
</pre>

plus  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_(HTTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP))

<pre>
the POST request method requests that a web server accepts
the data enclosed in the body of the request message
</pre>

using GitHub webhooks requires each one to run a HTTP server  
that accepts data from "out there of the Internet" which means one has
to run  
a public accessible HTTP server with all the security related
consequences.

Because I am inside an internal corporate network behind a big-and-fat  
full-featurted corporate firewall I cannot run a public accessible HTTP
server  
and I am certainly not allowed to do that (even if I could) on any of my
own  
systems ("own" means where I am 'root') inside our internal company
network.

I will ask internally at SUSE what the official way inside SUSE is  
how SUSE employees should use GitHub webhooks.

I would be interested what the official way inside IBM, Red Hat, and HP
is  
how IBM, Red Hat, and HP employees should use GitHub webhooks.

@jsmeix Sorry I have no idea, because I'm no real developer ;-)

We (in IBM) have also the same issue related to security and Firewall.  
   
Webhook from github is a bit painfull as http connection from outside is
blocked by our firewall.  
   
Solution 1: Requesting an exception to have a server in a specific DMZ
where outside connection is allowed.  
BUT =&gt; Security enforcement is really high which really slow down
productivity (isolated network, crazy password policy, no root access,
tons of justification to porvide..)  
   
Solution 2: Mirror the external repo to our internal github-Entreprise
repo and run webhook from here.  
   
Solution 3: (my personal choice to work with my team) move to gitlab
which provide a lot of features for free (private registries, CI/CD,
docker regitry...).  
The CICD worker node are not working in a push way (gitlab-&gt; server
for build) but in a pull way thanks to a gitlabci-agent installed on the
server (server pull -&gt; gitlab.com). This allows CI/CD working behind
a Firewall.

My contributions to ReaR are pure hobby, as such I'm lucky not be
limited by paranoid corporate network rules ;-).  
I'm running my own web server out there in the Internet, so using any
kind of webhooks is just a matter of configuration for me. Either way,
I'm not paying much of an attention to repo changes mails, so I'll most
probably not miss this feature ...

FYI:  
On Mon. 12 Nov. I had asked internally at SUSE  
how SUSE employees should use GitHub webhooks  
but up to now I got no really useful reply  
(except some individual band-aid workarounds)...

@schlomo Guess we can close this?

FYI:  
For me the current GitHub email behaviour still works "good enough".
