-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Manually on Ubu22.04 and OL8.7

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This pull request adds NFS\_SERVER as a new restore method. In the
    rescue stage rear starts an NFS server and exports all mount points.
    With NFS version 4 the rootfs to be restored can be mounted with the
    following command:  
    `mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4 <ip>:/ /mnt`  
    Another server with working backup software can mount this share and
    restore all data to it.  
    Rear waits until the file 'rear\_finished.txt' is created and all
    connections to the nfs server are disconnected. After that Rear
    continues with the restore process

@codefritzel  
thank you for your contribution to enhance ReaR!

All new added files are shown in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2973/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2973/files)  
with a "No newline at end of file" mark  
which means the last line does not end with a newline character.  
As far as I know a newline character at the end of every line  
(including the last line) is required at least by some programs  
that read input line by line where only the newline character  
marks the end of a line so that a line without terminating  
newline character will not be read by such programs.

@codefritzel Could you please add some clear clarification why you need
a NFS\_SERVER workflow? Is NFS client not enough?

I can add some more context for this, I see three main scenarios for
restore via NFS server:

1.  In some cases there is a problem running the backup client in our
    rescue system, and then it might be "cheaper" to use an indirect
    restore scheme instead of spending more hours on enabling our rescue
    system to support that piece of commercial software
2.  From a security perspective, it is always better to connect from a
    high-security ("bastion") system to the periphery. For backups this
    means that one could implement an NFS-based backup solution with
    **pulling** the date onto a central server. For restore we then need
    to start an NFS server in ReaR to **push** the data back. This could
    be part of a self-written solution or even use a commercial backup
    tool that is installed only on the central backup server for
    licensing or other reasons.
3.  Implement asymmetric solutions, using one tool for backup and
    another tool for restore, in this case via NFS

In all those cases adding NFS server capabilities to the ReaR rescue
system is IMHO a useful addition. I'd also consider modifying it to be
an optional add-on feature instead of a stand-alone backup method. I
also envision introducing a general split of `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`, if
somebody needs this.

@schlomo Thanks for the heads up as it makes it clear to me why it might
be useful.  
@codefritzel That being said please add some more comments from your
side of the need of this new workflow, not just that it could be useful.
And, above all, without proper documentation it will be a workflow only
used by a happy few (amongst yourself I'm afraid).

Thanks a lot @codefritzel for the rework, I added you a bunch of minor
fixes/changes and then I think we are good to go.

Hi, looks useful, but I have a question: will the various extended
attributes/ACLs get restored properly? SELinux contexts are probably
handled in `usr/share/rear/restore/default/500_selinux_autorelabel.sh`,
but there are other extended attributes that matter. See:

    $ getfattr -m- -nsecurity.capability - /usr/sbin/* /usr/bin/* 2>/dev/null
    # file: usr/sbin/arping
    security.capability=0sAAAAAgAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

    # file: usr/sbin/clockdiff
    security.capability=0sAAAAAgAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

    # file: usr/bin/newgidmap
    security.capability=0sAQAAAkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

    # file: usr/bin/newuidmap
    security.capability=0sAQAAAoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

AFAIK if one uses NFSv4.2, then one is able to use such attributes over
the NFS mount, but I have not tried it. `-V 4.2` needs to be passed to
`rpc.nfsd` and mount option `v4.2` (or `nfsvers=4.2`?) should be
specified.

Another question about NFS. Is NFSv4 required because of its ability to
automatically export and access filesystems mounted under the exported
filesystem, i.e. to cross mountpoints? Seems pretty crucial for use in
ReaR.

@pcahyna that is one reason and it is much easier to support only v4
than v2, v3 and v4 together.

Thank you everybody for reviewing this. I'm going forward and merging it
now, we'll continue to improve this code as it undergoes more testing in
production.
