-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    The system was supposed to create a tar backup on a cifs mount. The
    problem was that the speed was 500KiB/s to a Windows share on a
    100MBit line. (The server itself has 1GBit bonding but that does not
    matter). During tests we never had such slow speed. We discovered
    that rear basically does the following: tar <files> | dd
    of=backup.tar  
    This is the case if no ISO\_MAX\_SIZE is set, otherwise dd would be
    replaced by split.  
    We were able to see in the network traffic that only very small
    packages were sent and ACK'ed by the samba server.  
    After adding bs=1M to the dd command the speed was now really fast
    in comparison: it used the full capacity of the line (about
    100MBit/s).

-   Workaround, if any:

We created a one-liner patch that adds bs=1M to the dd command in
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh which worked
pretty well for us.

@dsamx  
thank you for your explanatory report that makes things very clear  
and for your analysis what the root cause was and for your fix!

I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2370](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2370)  
so that the other ReaR maintainers could have a look.

I always had a vague feeling that making the backup via "rear
mkbackup"  
seems to run noticeably slower than restoring it via "rear recover"  
but I never analyzed things so perhaps this issue explains it.

I tested it in my usual testing environment where I run "rear
mkbackup"  
in a virtual machine and the backup.tar.gz goes to a NFS server  
and that NFS server is on the host where the virtual machine runs  
so in my usual testing environment there is no real outer network
used.  
Therefore I do not see a big improvement in my testing environment.

Before I had in backup.log from `tar` and `dd`

    Total bytes written: 3065948160 (2.9GiB, 9.7MiB/s)

    2379075+1 records in
    2379075+1 records out
    1218086742 bytes (1.2 GB, 1.1 GiB) copied, 303.749 s, 4.0 MB/s

and with the added `bs=1M` I get in backup.log from `tar` and `dd`

    Total bytes written: 3065036800 (2.9GiB, 11MiB/s)

    0+74145 records in
    0+74145 records out
    1217955985 bytes (1.2 GB, 1.1 GiB) copied, 285.225 s, 4.3 MB/s

The overall `time rear mkbackuponly`  
was before 5 minutes 12 seconds  
that decreased a bit to 4 minutes 53 seconds.

Nevertheless `bs=1M` can make things very much faster:

    # time dd if=/boot/vmlinuz of=/dev/null

    14320+1 records in
    14320+1 records out
    7331952 bytes (7.3 MB, 7.0 MiB) copied, 0.0235268 s, 312 MB/s

    real    0m0.025s
    user    0m0.017s
    sys     0m0.008s

    # time dd if=/boot/vmlinuz of=/dev/null bs=1M

    6+1 records in
    6+1 records out
    7331952 bytes (7.3 MB, 7.0 MiB) copied, 0.00251888 s, 2.9 GB/s

    real    0m0.004s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.004s

    # time dd if=/etc/os-release of=/dev/null

    0+1 records in
    0+1 records out
    265 bytes copied, 7.4226e-05 s, 3.6 MB/s

    real    0m0.003s
    user    0m0.002s
    sys     0m0.000s

    # time dd if=/etc/os-release of=/dev/null bs=1M

    0+1 records in
    0+1 records out
    265 bytes copied, 5.8819e-05 s, 4.5 MB/s

    real    0m0.002s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.002s

(on my Intel Core i3-4000M CPU @ 2.40GHz homeoffice laptop)  
so adding `bs=1M` seems to be an improvement in any case  
(it gets a bit faster even if less than 512 bytes need to be copied).
