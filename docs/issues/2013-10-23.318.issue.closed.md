Did you do a `rear mkbackup` before the upgrade? Show me the
`local.conf` file to be sure.  
Can you paste the rear.log file when the error occurred (not the
complete file, but with relevant info before the error popped up)

Hi,we did a rear -v mkrescue. rear mkbackup we didn´t but dsmc inc.  
This is the rear local.conf

    # sample local configuration
    # Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
    # OUTPUT=ISO
    # sample local configuration
    # Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///tmp
    BACKUP=TSM
    COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( /etc/adsm/TSM.PWD /opt/tivoli/tsm/client /usr/local/ibm/gsk8* /SZIR/data/inclexcl2)
    COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_TSM=( )
    PROGS_TSM=(dsmc)
    RESULT_FILES="/var/lib/rear/output/rear-system.iso"
    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}"
    vconfig
    vi
    vim )
    ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" )

It is better to use the syntax in `/etc/rear/local.conf` file:

    COPY_AS_IS_TSM=( "${COPY_AS_IS_TSM[@]}" /SZIR/data/inclexcl2 )

Hopefully, the file system `/SZIR` is part of VG vg00 (as you only
include vg00)?

The error that you got during the recovery
`Could not source '/mnt/local/etc/sysconfig/kernel'` exercise. Where
exactly did it happen? Before, during or after the TSM restore?

I believe the problem is with the following:

    ANS1036S The option '-PITD' or the value supplied for it is not valid. It was found in options file 'Command Line'
             at line number: 0
             The complete entry: '-pitd=10/20/2013'

TSM did not restore anything as it did not like the option `-pitd` I'm
not a TSM expert, but if I were you I would dig into the TSM manuals and
investigate what option is the correct one for your version of TSM? It
might have changed in the meantime...

@nmidc did you make any progress with a TSM expert?

test.

Hi  
if i am right we have to modify this line in
39\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh

old: TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_DATE=$( date -d "$REPLY" +%m/%d/%Y 2&gt;&8 )
||  
new: TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_DATE=$( date -d "$REPLY" +%Y.%m.%d 2&gt;&8 )
||\\

Alright, nice, with which version of TSM are you working? Could it be
that this value changed between TSM versions? Or, perhaps, it was wrong
all the time? I don't know as I didn't integrate TSM into rear.

In this case we are using Server Version 6 Release 2 Level 3.0

Hi Gratien D'haese,

could you please correct the commit 884f1b8. There is an issue with the
sequence of the date in the variable TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_DATE.

Please change it from:  
TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_DATE=$( date -d "$REPLY" +%m.%d.%Y 2&gt;&8 )  
to  
TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_DATE=$( date -d "$REPLY" +%Y.%m.%d 2&gt;&8 )

Thanks.
