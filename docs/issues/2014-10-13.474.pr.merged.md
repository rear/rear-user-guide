=&gt; The command to install the debian package (which automatically
configures the conf files) was missing.  
It autoselects all files in /etc as config file so conffiles can be
empty (but must still exists).

man dh\_installdeb  
package.conffiles  
This control file will be installed into the DEBIAN directory.

           In v3 compatibility mode and higher, all files in the etc/ directory in a package will automatically be flagged as conffiles by this program, so there is no
           need to list them manually here.
