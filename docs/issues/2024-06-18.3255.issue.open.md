Follow-up to \#3242.

PR \#3242 fixes IPv6 address support in OUTPUT\_URL/BACKUP\_URL (using
the square bracket address syntax that was broken due to unquoted
expansion of variables, which treated square brackets as shell
metacharacters).

It looks like similar unfixed issues exist with davfs:

I found it by analyzing the code only, I have not actually tested the
code in question.
