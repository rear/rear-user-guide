@gozora  
many thanks for the fix!

It looks much cleaner now (at least for me).

In particular I prefer to have that single task now  
in one single script (including its mount and umount)  
and no longer split into several scripts.

In 70\_create\_efibootimg.sh I wonder about the commented out code

<pre>
#mv $v -f $TMP_DIR/efiboot.img $TMP_DIR/boot/efiboot.img >&2
...
#ISO_FILES=( ${ISO_FILES[@]} $TMP_DIR/boot/efiboot.img )
</pre>

which is a copy from the old 70\_umount\_efibootimg.sh  
because I do not understand why that commented out code  
is there.  
It looks as if it is it meant as an alternative way how to do it  
but then I would like to know the pros and cons of both ways.

An addendum only FYI because the following  
is a matter of personal preference  
how one likes to implement it:

In general I wonder when a function (like efiboot\_img\_size)  
is only called in one single script if then the function  
should be better also defined only in that script?  
I.e. if a function that is "local" for a single script  
shouldn't be better defined locally in that script?

And even a step further:  
I wonder if a function is needed at all when  
some functionality is only needed one single time.  
Why not have such functionality implemented  
directly "inline"?

Of course it can make code better readable when  
certain tasks are split out into function definitions  
even if each task is done only once.

But I think the efiboot\_img\_size functionality is  
sufficiently small and simple to be also readable  
when its code would be directly "inline"  
in the 70\_create\_efibootimg.sh script.

Again: This is a matter of personal preference  
how one likes to implement it.

I forgot my main question:

Before the minimum EFI virtual image size was 32000 KiB  
(via "size=32000").

Now the minimum EFI virtual image size is 128 MiB.

Why?

As far as I understand it this could make the ISO image  
of the rear recovery system needlessly bigger.

Some users use rear on thousands of their servers  
and therefore they must store thosands of images  
of the rear recovery system (one for each server)  
and then about 100MiB more for each image can  
make a noticeable difference for them.

In other words:

When the exact right size of EFI virtual image is determined,  
why is there a minimum EFI virtual image size at all?

Why not always use the exact right size of EFI virtual image?

For the functions I just followed what was already written (I'm lazy
person and it is more convenient like this), but I share your view.
Local functions should be local, so if you prefer to have function
directly in *70\_create\_efibootimg.sh*, in can move it there.

The size topic is a bit tricky, but to cut the story short, smaller
(32MB) image size is fine when GRUB is used, (BTW. now I've realized
that this check was committed, I'll correct in in next pull request with
something similar to
[this](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ce01a145451f74f15c6610e8611d60cbc1ce360a/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/20_mount_efibootimg.sh)).
As GRUB is capable to "escape" virtual image into ordinary ISO
filesystem, and read kernel and initrd from there. ELILO is not, so you
must copy kernel together with initrd into image which makes it
significantly bigger.

And one interesting fact that I've learned the hard way; virtual image
must be aligned to 32MB ...

Regarding the efiboot\_img\_size function just do it as you like  
(i.e. it is perfectly fine to be lazy and leave it as is).

Regarding the size:  
I totally trust you because you are the expert here.

FYI regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ce01a145451f74f15c6610e8611d60cbc1ce360a/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/20\_mount\_efibootimg.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ce01a145451f74f15c6610e8611d60cbc1ce360a/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/20_mount_efibootimg.sh)

I wonder if there could be perhaps a bug because MB != MiB  
and perhaps it must be MiB (1024 x 1024)  
and not MB (1000 x 1000)?

<pre>
   size=128000
else
   size=32000
...
dd if=/dev/zero of=$TMP_DIR/efiboot.img count=$size bs=1024
</pre>

does neither result a 128 MiB nor MB nor 32 MiB nor MB efiboot.img

Is 128 x 1000 x 1024 or 32 x 1000 x 1024 really correct  
or must it be 128 x 1024 x 1024 and 32 x 1024 x 1024 for MiB  
or 128 x 1000 x 1000 and 32 x 1000 x 1000 for MB?

Cf.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte\#Unit\_symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Unit_symbol)

Accordingly 1000 x 1024 would be kKiB ;-)

Sorry, I got a bit confused

I see that  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ce01a145451f74f15c6610e8611d60cbc1ce360a/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/20\_mount\_efibootimg.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ce01a145451f74f15c6610e8611d60cbc1ce360a/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/20_mount_efibootimg.sh)
is old code.

In the new code that uses

<pre>
dd ... count=$(efiboot_img_size $TMP_DIR/mnt) bs=1M
</pre>

the kKiB versus MiB issue is fixed.

But I found a kKiB versus MiB issue still in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ia64/20\_mount\_bootimg.sh

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=$TMP_DIR/boot.img count=64000 bs=1024
</pre>

"git blame" shows that @gdha made that one.

@gdha  
should  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-ia64/20\_mount\_bootimg.sh  
be fixed to

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=$TMP_DIR/boot.img count=64 bs=1M
</pre>

I've just pushed a
[commit](https://github.com/gozora/rear/commit/4f37b15a4567786ff55e21faa1286335c8b99e9e)
about "near to be finished patch".  
However I can't imagine in my head about possible site effect so I need
to test if first.  
Once I have tests finished I'll create another pull request.  
BTW. I've moved **efiboot\_img\_size()** directly to
*70\_create\_efibootimg.sh*

I've done some testing (unfortunately only on my virtual guests) and all
seems to be working fine.  
If you have some better test possibilities (some real HW), please try to
test this patch before merging with main tree.
