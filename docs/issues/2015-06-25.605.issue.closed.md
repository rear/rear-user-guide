When booting in rescue mode we have seen errors passing by saying:  
`/sbin/modprobe.ksplice-orig: file not found` and as a result no kernel
modules get loaded.

This has to do with ksplice being installed (for more info read
[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/ksplice-linux-518455.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/ksplice-linux-518455.html))

To fix this add in the `/etc/rear/local.conf` file the following:  
COPY\_AS\_IS=(${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]} /sbin/modprobe.ksplice-orig)  
CLONE\_GROUPS=(${CLONE\_GROUPS\[@\]} oinstall)
