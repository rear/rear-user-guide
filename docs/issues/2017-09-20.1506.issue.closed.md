According
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#rear\_.2F\_rear116\_.2F\_rear1172a\_.2F\_rear118a](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#rear_.2F_rear116_.2F_rear1172a_.2F_rear118a)
SLES 11/12 is still using rear-1.18 with features of rear-19 included
(at least some new features).  
Is it not time that rear-2.2 gets integrated into SLES? I thinking about
the renumbering of the scripts for example.  
It would be nice that all major Linux vendors are at least on version 2.
RedHat released rear-2.0 with RHEL 7.4.

In general in SLES we do not do version upgrades  
unless that is really required.

Because we like to provide better support for POWER architecture  
a ReaR version upgrade to the upcoming 2.3 is planned for SLES12  
so that in particular our SLES12 customers on POWER architecture  
could enjoy all those fixes and enhancements from @schabrolles !

Good rationalisation, Let's hope that we will get another important
architecture to drive the inclusion of a new ReaR version in the future.
Maybe S390 would be a good candidate ðŸ˜„ Or maybe till then ARM will be
sufficiently established in the data centers.

I got already questions about ReaR on 'IBM z Systems' \[sic!\]  
( cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM\_System\_z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z)
;-)  
and also about ReaR on ARM architecture  
but in both cases I assume it will take some time.

As @jsmeix said,  
IBM ask to Suse to update the ReaR version to 2.3 to better support SAP
Hana on POWER (rear-1.18 was not POWER friendly enough).  
It seems to be recently accepted by Suse to update ReaR version in
"SLES-HA" for Suse 11 / 12 and the Next Suse release..... (please
@jsmeix, correct me if I'm wrong)

That's why, we need to have a very clean and polished version of ReaR
2.3 ;-)

@schabrolles the best way to get reliably quality in ReaR is to invest
into automated tests.

@schlomo, I've started to automate test on POWER with Ansible (Using
oVirt KVM-hyperviseur)  
It is currently only testing Backup/Restore on the same system

-   ISO generation
-   Backup with (NETFS or TSM ) + PXE
-   Reboot, then Recover
-   Reboot on recovered OS

=&gt; OS tested (Suse11, Suse12, ubuntu16.04, RHEL7)

Migration test on PowerVM is still made manually...

Nice. Do you see any way how you can port that to a VM that I can run on
non-PPC hardware? Maybe based on QEMU? That way all of us could test if
a change has an impact on PPC.

@schabrolles  
it is currently planned that ReaR 2.3 should be provided  
for SLEHA12 and even for SLEHA11 but I am not a  
decision maker for such things.  
And SLEHA15 will of course get ReaR 2.3 (or even newer).

I leave it as an exercise to the reader to find out  
about the numerical gap between '12' and '15' ;-)

@schlomo Ansible scripts can be run on every arch/system... the problem
is to adapt it to Pure KVM (but could be done... ) and having access to
a PowerVM hypervisor (not really possible).

My current plan is to continue the automation on my system to add
migration and PowerVM  
Then, I would like to generate automatically a test when a merge is done
on the git master branch and send a result by email to the team....

@jsmeix Q: rear118a does that support `ebiso` especially for SLES11 SP4
SAP HANA based systems?  
Answer: Yes - just read the changelog mentioned above.

@gdha  
in general rear118a does support ebiso, cf  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery\#rear\_.2F\_rear116\_.2F\_rear1172a\_.2F\_rear118a](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#rear_.2F_rear116_.2F_rear1172a_.2F_rear118a)  
but I never used that on a SLE11 system.  
I asssume the crucial point is whether or not ebiso works  
as intended also on a SLE11 system with UEFI.

@jsmeix ebiso was developed on/for SLES11, so yes it does works there
;-)

@gdha  
why do you ask about rear118a on SLE11?  
As far as I know SUSE provides officially only rear116 for SLEHA11  
so that using rear118a on SLE11 is not officially supported by  
the official SUSE support - as far as I know.  
Accordingly I think that for a SLE11 system with UEFI  
one could as well use the latest ReaR release 2.2  
or even the latest GitHub ReaR master code.  
Because ReaR 2.3 is planned to be provided also for SLEHA11  
I think it is even "the right way" to use now on SLE11  
already the latest GitHub ReaR master code  
to be closer to what is planned to be also officially  
supported by SUSE for SLEHA11.  
Note that right now there is no guarantee from me  
what will be officially supported by SUSE for SLE11  
because I am not a decision maker in this area.

@rear/contributors I suppose this question was answered sufficient.
Shall we close it?

It is o.k. for me to close it because it is sufficiently answered  
but it ia also o.k. for me to keep it open until ReaR in SLE11/12  
was really upgraded - I will report that here when it happened.

Just for information... as the version 2.0 (in rhel) is not usable on
POWER, a request was send from IBM to update ReaR to &gt;=2.3 for next
rhel7.5 and rhel8.... Let's see what RedHat will answer.

Because this is not an issue to be fixed for "ReaR v2.3"  
I set the more generic milestone "ReaR future".

FYI:

Currently SLEHA15 provides a `rear23a` package  
that contains ReaR version 2.3  
plus all later ReaR upstream GitHub commits up to  
commit e0363b07e66df0d64a4d2c61e29917b366553688  
but that has still issues with btrfs and GRUB  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1828)

Currently I am working on a `rear23a` package update  
that contains the current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
up to commit d9897b3cc5a2413057834722c06b21309b593519  
which means it contains ReaR version 2.4  
plus all later ReaR upstream GitHub commits up to  
commit d9897b3cc5a2413057834722c06b21309b593519  
but I keep the RPM package name `rear23a` so that  
an installed `rear23a` RPM package can be updated.

Currently it is planned that this updated `rear23a` RPM package  
should be provided for SLEHA15 and SLEHA12 and SLEHA11  
but I am not the actual decision maker for such things.
