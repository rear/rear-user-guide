Hello =)

i created a backup with the latest rear, restore works fine but i get
this message:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf604c75-da2f-484e-b233-81691a1aae43)

1.  looks like you're asking for info on this system, which info would
    you like to get?
2.  should i be worried about this message? what is it indicating? =)

Personally I know nothing about that code  
so I cannot help to actually debug this issue.

In particular I am not a Ubuntu user.  
Currently we at ReaR upstream do not have an active  
maintainer for Ubuntu / Debian.  
So ReaR support for Ubuntu / Debian  
can be only as good as voluntary contributors  
who use those Linux distributions contribute  
which is much appreciated!

In particular regarding Ubuntu:  
It seems Canonical is not sufficiently interested in ReaR  
in contrast to Red Hat and SUSE who pay developers  
(like me from SUSE and e.g. @pcahyna and @lzaoral from Red Hat)  
to contribute to upstream ReaR because Red Hat and SUSE  
support ReaR in their enterprise Linux distributions.

Nevertheless some generic info:

That "Could not list any LUN IDs" warning comes from  
usr/share/rear/finalize/default/880\_check\_for\_mount\_by\_id.sh

According to

    # git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/finalize/default/880_check_for_mount_by_id.sh

it was added on Nov 18 2009 via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/45ab5e0e8d29a182ad68fc20fb571518b72a4a6b](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/45ab5e0e8d29a182ad68fc20fb571518b72a4a6b)  
so that warning is there since a long time  
so I assume that likely it has nothing to do  
with the changes for the recent ReaR 2.8 release.

@xwhitebeltx  
did you use ReaR before the current ReaR 2.8 on this system?  
If yes, what older ReaR version(s) did you use?  
In this case I assume you did not get that warning  
with the older ReaR version(s)?

On Ubuntu scsi\_id can be found under directory `/lib/udev`.

    # /lib/udev/scsi_id --export --whitelisted -d /dev/sda
    ID_SCSI=1
    ID_VENDOR=ATA
    ID_VENDOR_ENC=ATA\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20

    ID_WWN_WITH_EXTENSION=0x5001517803d82e0f
    ID_SCSI_SERIAL=CVLI30130039240G 

However, `usr/sbin/rear:PATH=$PATH:/lib/udev:/usr/lib/udev` already has
this in its PATH.  
Therefore, @xwhitebeltx where is your `scsi_id` located on your system?

In SUSE (openSUSE Leap 15.6 in my case here)  
scsi\_id belongs to udev and is /usr/lib/udev/scsi\_id

    # type -a scsi_id
    -bash: type: scsi_id: not found

    # find / -xdev | grep '/scsi_id'
    /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id

    # rpm -qf /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id
    udev-254.21-150600.4.21.1.x86_64

My /usr/lib/udev/scsi\_id shows

    # /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id -h

    SCSI device identification.

      -h --help                        Print this message

      -x --export                      Print values as environment keys

where - as far as I see - the current scsi\_id options  
do not match the rather old code from 2009 in  
finalize/default/880\_check\_for\_mount\_by\_id.sh  
how scsi\_id is called there

    # apparently the usage of scsi_id changed over the times, so we try two ways to call it
    eval "$(scsi_id -g -x -n -s /block/"$sysfs" -d /dev/$device 2>/dev/null || scsi_id --export --whitelisted -d /dev/$device)"

On my openSUSE Leap 15.6 workstation I don't have a built-in SCSI
device  
(my NVMe disk does not belong to SCSI and 'lsscsi' shows nothing)  
but with an external USB disk I get

    # lsscsi
    [0:0:0:0]    disk    TOSHIBA  External USB 3.0 5438  /dev/sda

    # /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id -g -x -n -d /dev/sda
    /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id: invalid option -- 'n'

    # /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id -g -x -d /dev/sda
    ID_SCSI=1
    ID_VENDOR=TOSHIBA
    ID_VENDOR_ENC=TOSHIBA
    ID_MODEL=External_USB_3.0
    ID_MODEL_ENC=External\x20USB\x203.0
    ID_REVISION=5438
    ID_TYPE=disk
    ID_SERIAL=1TOSHIBA
    ID_SERIAL_SHORT=TOSHIBA
    ID_SERIAL_COMPAT=
    ID_SCSI_SERIAL=20170521000273

    # /usr/lib/udev/scsi_id --export --whitelisted -d /dev/sda
    ID_SCSI=1
    ID_VENDOR=TOSHIBA
    ID_VENDOR_ENC=TOSHIBA
    ID_MODEL=External_USB_3.0
    ID_MODEL_ENC=External\x20USB\x203.0

    ID_SERIAL=1TOSHIBA
    ID_SERIAL_SHORT=TOSHIBA
    ID_SERIAL_COMPAT=
    ID_SCSI_SERIAL=20170521000273F

So '--whitelisted' still works , I found it mentioned on  
[https://linux.die.net/man/8/scsi\_id](https://linux.die.net/man/8/scsi_id)

But '-n' does not (or does no longer) work.

And '-s /block/...' cannot (or does no longer) work  
because I don't have '/block/' but '/sys/block/...'

    # ls -l /sys/block/sda
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 28 13:24 /sys/block/sda -> ../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.1/0000:03:00.3/usb2/2-1/2-1:1.0/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda

@xwhitebeltx  
please provide us your "rear recover" log file.  
Therein in particular the part while  
finalize/default/880\_check\_for\_mount\_by\_id.sh  
is run is of interest for us.

In general:  
Caution with possible secrets in a ReaR log file.  
In particular in debugscript mode via the option '-D'  
ReaR logs executed commands via the bash command 'set -x'  
that print commands and their arguments as they are executed.  
So in particular when arguments contain secret values  
(e.g. something like a password or whatever else)  
such secret values may appear in the log file.

Hello dear people =)  
thank you for your responses, i will try to address them all:

@jsmeix - i did not try with earlier versions on this system, first time
was with the latest rear

@gdha - iscsi\_id on my system is on the same path you mentioned
/lib/udev/scsi\_id  
when i execute the same command it has no output since i only have NVMe
SSDs:  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61da33d5-4be2-474f-9162-f27c8dd52245)

@jsmeix - oddly enough my environment makes it hard to extract the log
as text, but i can screenshot the relevant part you talked about with
finalize/default/880\_check\_for\_mount\_by\_id.sh, not much information
there:  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b2cb1e-a61f-4283-bf0a-3367f71a197a)

@jsmeix - output of scsi\_id --help:  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fde9de97-04ff-485a-bc7b-1eda3c6f9485)

if i only have NVMe drives then is this warning still relevant? (the
"could not list any LUN IDs with scsi\_id warning)

    i would like to emphasize this is a realtime kernel (is it supported?)
    for example - it disables EFI runtime by default, and rear fails when restoring such environment.
    i had to re-enable the EFI runtime in order for rear to backup & restore properly.
    (command efibootmgr returned "EFI variables are not supported on this system" and was unusable,
    solution was to add "efi=runtime" to the "KERNEL_CMDLINE" variable in /etc/rear/local.conf to enable it)
    you can see it in the local.conf screenshot in my initial post

    my point is - maybe it's adding more layers of complexity to the environment

let me know if you require anything else, or if you think it is expected
behavior,  
thanks =)

@xwhitebeltx  
thank you!

Now I see how things go wrong in ReaR!

The crucial information was

    iscsi_id on my system is on the same path you mentioned /lib/udev/scsi_id
    when i execute the same command it has no output since i only have NVMe SSDs

I never tested "rear recover" on my openSUSE Leap 15.6 workstation  
where I don't have a built-in SCSI device (I have only a NVMe disk).

Now I can reproduce it on my SLES 15 SP6 KVM/QEMU virtual test machine  
with the following artificial modification in the ReaR recovery system  
before I run "rear recover"

    --- a/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/880_check_for_mount_by_id.sh
    +++ b/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/880_check_for_mount_by_id.sh
    ...
     # Note: we ignore swap here because we treat it specially somewhere else!
    -if [ -e $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/fstab ] && grep -v swap $TARGET_FS_ROOT/etc/fstab | grep -q by-id ; then
    +if true ; then
             LogPrint ""
    ...
                     # apparently the usage of scsi_id changed over the times, so we try two ways to call it
    -                eval "$(scsi_id -g -x -n -s /block/"$sysfs" -d /dev/$device 2>/dev/null || scsi_id --export --whitelisted -d /dev/$device)"
    +                eval "$( true )"
                     if test "$ID_SERIAL" ; then
    ...

because on my SLES 15 SP6 KVM/QEMU virtual test machine  
I do not mount things 'by-id' and  
I like to simulate that 'scsi\_id' returns nothing.  
With that artificial modification I get

    RESCUE localhost:~ # rear -D recover
    ...
    WARNING ! You are mounting some devices by ID. Please be aware that the IDs
    are hardware dependent and that you might have to adjust your fstab to match
    the new IDs. Currently your system has the following disks with LUN IDs:



    WARNING ! Could not list any LUN IDs with scsi_id. Please tell us how your
    system calls scsi_id. However, some disks just don't have any LUN ID. We
    would like to know more about such systems and how they look.

Note the empty output for  
"Currently your system has the following disks with LUN IDs:"  
and then the subsequent false alarm about  
"Could not list any LUN IDs with scsi\_id"  
regardless that my 'scsi\_id' replacement 'true' run successfully.

FYI  
regarding 'WARNING' in general see  
[https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)  
;-)

So I will have to overhaul that code  
to make it behave more fail-safe, cf.

@xwhitebeltx  
as far as I see from my analysis in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3383\#issuecomment-2621646197](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3383#issuecomment-2621646197)  
I think it is also false alarm on your particular system  
so you could safely ignore it.

To verify whether or not it is actually false alarm on your system  
run "rear -D recover" i.e. in debugscript mode ('-D')  
and inspect still inside the ReaR recovery system the log file  
/var/log/rear/rear-localhost.log  
therein in particular the part while  
finalize/default/880\_check\_for\_mount\_by\_id.sh  
is run.

Furthermore inspect the recreated etc/fstab  
still inside the ReaR recovery system which is there  
/mnt/local/etc/fstab  
whether or not it is OK as you need it and as you expect it  
for your particular system.

While you are still inside the ReaR recovery system  
after "rear recover" finished, you can correct things  
in the recreated system which is mounted below /mnt/local/  
(you may do "chroot /mnt/local/" into the recreated system)  
before you call "reboot" or "poweroff" in the recovery system  
to boot the recreated system (sometimes "poweroff" and then  
booting the recreated system via 'power on' works better).

@jsmeix  
thanks for the links =)  
yes i now understand that this is a false alarm in my case,  
after the restore system is booting fine and everything seems ok.

@xwhitebeltx  
could you please post here your etc/fstab  
so that I could see how one looks like  
when things are mounted 'by-id'?

FYI:  
On my SLES 15 SP6 KVM/QEMU virtual test machine  
with the SLES default btrfs subvolumes structure  
things are mounted via UUID:

of course,  
this is the fstab from my system:

this is a clean ubuntu 22.04 installation with realtime kernel and a few
minor modifications,  
the only thing mounted by id is the default root partition logical group
(LVM) created by the ubuntu installer

output from the second command you sent:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3391)  
should (hopefully) fix it.  
At least for me it seems to work as intended, see

But I cannot verify (with acceptable efforts)  
how various versions of scsi\_id in various  
Linux distribution environments may behave.

@xwhitebeltx  
the new user info text is like this when there are SCSI devices

    Automatically adjusting /dev/disk/by-id entries in etc/fstab is not supported:
      Those IDs could be hardware dependent so check /mnt/local/etc/fstab
      and verify all is correct or manually adjust /mnt/local/etc/fstab
      to the actual values of the recreated system in /mnt/local
      'scsi_id' reports '/dev/XXX' 123MiB: ID_VENDOR=VVV ID_MODEL=MMM ID_SERIAL=456
      'scsi_id' reports '/dev/YYY' 234MiB: ID_VENDOR=vvv ID_MODEL=mmm ID_SERIAL=789

cf.

In your case what is mounted via /dev/disk/by-id/...  
is not a SCSI device so 'scsi\_id' cannot show you  
what SCSI devices exist on the replacement hardware.

Nevertheless automatically adjusting /dev/disk/by-id  
entries in etc/fstab is also not supported in your case.  
So also in your case with NVMe devices you need to  
check your recreated /mnt/local/etc/fstab and verify  
all is correct or manually adjust your /mnt/local/etc/fstab  
to your actual values of your recreated system in /mnt/local
