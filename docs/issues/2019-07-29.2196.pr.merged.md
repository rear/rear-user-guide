-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Minor adjustments to \#2194. Do not overload the `kval` variable -
    intended for passing options to lvcreate - by adding extra keys to
    it, which are not supported by lvcreate. Introduce another variable
    `infokval` for this purpose and print those unsupported and purely
    informational keys only in comments.
