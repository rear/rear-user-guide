See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2244488622](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244488622)  
which reads (excerpts):

usr/share/rear/lib/sesam-functions.sh

The crucial part is

    sesam2000ini_file="/etc/sesam2000.ini"
    ...
    source $sesam2000ini_file

so it does source a third party file as

    source /etc/sesam2000.ini

I don't know the syntax of 'sesam2000.ini'  
so I cannot mitigate it.

Perhaps /etc/sesam2000.ini can be trusted  
to be sourced like other config files,  
for example /etc/sysconfig/kernel and  
/etc/dracut.conf and /etc/dracut.conf.d/\*.conf cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285\#issuecomment-2244555297](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3285#issuecomment-2244555297)

@rear/contributors  
it should be verified before the ReaR 3.0 release  
if third party code could be sourced here  
or if it is reasonably safe.

hi,

the file /etc/sesam2000.ini basically just includes  
the configuration variables that point to the installation  
path of the installed sesam component and its configuration files.

It looks basically like this:

    VERSION=5.1.0.51
    SM_BIN_SESAM=/opt/sesam/bin/sesam/
    SM_BIN_SMS=/opt/sesam/bin/sms/
    SMS_INI=/var/opt/sesam/var/ini/sms.ini
    STPD_INI=/var/opt/sesam/var/ini/stpd.ini
    SM_INI=/var/opt/sesam/var/ini/sm.ini
    SM_CTRL_INI=/var/opt/sesam/var/ini/sm.ini

It will not contain other things than these variable definitions.  
Speaking as SEP employee, this file can be trusted.

@abbbi  
thank you for your prompt reply!

When the syntax is strictly only

    VARIABLE=VALUE

it is not needed to 'source' it  
so security could be improved (with reasonable effort)  
to be safe even without the need to trust it  
by not executing it but only parsing it  
when for such simple syntax correct parsing  
is sufficiently simple to be implemented like

    myvar="$( grep '^VARIABLE=' /etc/sesam2000.ini | cut -d '=' -f2 )"

Or could it happen that a user specifies things like

      VERSION=5.1.0.51
    SM_BIN_SESAM='/opt/sesam/bin/sesam/'
    SM_BIN_SMS="$( echo /opt/sesam/*/sms/ )"
    test -s /opt/sesam/var/ini/sms.ini && SMS_INI=/opt/sesam/var/ini/sms.ini || SMS_INI=/var/opt/sesam/var/ini/sms.ini

i.e. things like indentation or quotation  
or command substitution or conditionals  
which would basically require execution?

@abbbi  
would you agree when I make a pull request  
to improve security by only parsing it  
(instead of executing it)?

Or would you reject such a change and prefer  
to execute it e.g. to be future proof against  
things like indentation or quotation  
or command substitution or conditionals  
which would basically require execution?

I removed the "critical/security/legal" label from this issue  
because it is no longer "critical/security/legal", cf.

no objections from my side..

I postponed it to the ReaR v3.1 milestone  
because things are currently OK, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3292\#issuecomment-2249670113](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3292#issuecomment-2249670113)  
so this could be improved for ReaR v3.1 as time permits.
