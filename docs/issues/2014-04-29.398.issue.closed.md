OK. I have been using rear for over a year and have thankfully have
never had to use it. I had done some rudimentery testing when I first
set it up, and everything worked great. But I recently did a restore of
a test server and had an issue. I use LVM for the OS file systems, and I
call the VG vg00. In my local.conf file I have the following.

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="nfs://192.168.1.30/var/opt/ignite/rear/"  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=1  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( vg00 )

I am under the impression that this only backs up anything in vg00. But
I notice in the backup.log that it also looks like it is trying to
backup data that is not in vg00. I have fs's on SAN that I do not need
backed up. The mountpoints are /test and /oracle/middleware. But this is
seem in the log.

block 21177092: /test/  
block 21177093: /test/lost+found/  
block 21177094: /test/test2  
block 21177095: /oracle/middleware/  
block 21177096: /oracle/middleware/lost+found/

test2 above is a file I created. So it looks like it is getting backed
up. Also those mountpoints point to multipath devices, which I thought
were ignored. It looks like they are, but the fs is still referenced in
the disk layout.

fs /dev/dm-2 /test ocfs2 options=rw,\_netdev,heartbeat=local  
fs /dev/dm-4 /oracle/middleware ocfs2
options=rw,\_netdev,heartbeat=local  
swap /dev/mapper/vg00-lv\_swap uuid=369d10ed-6e53-40cd-848d-fbe8d0233185
label=  
logicaldrive /dev/sda 0|A|1 raid=1 drives=1I:1:1,1I:1:2, spares=
sectors=32 stripesize=256  
smartarray 0

multipath /dev/mapper/fmw /dev/sdd,/dev/sdg,/dev/sdj,/dev/sdm
=============================================================

multipath /dev/mapper/mpathb /dev/sdb,/dev/sde,/dev/sdh,/dev/sdk
================================================================

multipath /dev/mapper/test /dev/sdc,/dev/sdf,/dev/sdi,/dev/sdl
==============================================================

/dev/dm-4 is /dev/mapper/fmw and /dev/dm-2 is /dev/mapper/test. So the
bad part is that the recover wiped the two ocfs file systems and did not
restore them. I was looking at EXCLUDE\_RECREATE, but for some of my
systems; that is going to be a huge pain. I have systems with tens of
mountpoints. Is there a way to set this so the disklayout only ever has
info vg00. I do not want any type of external SAN devices to be wiped,
or recreated.

Also, I am using an older rear version.

See `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` for more details about:

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()
    EXCLUDE_MD=()
    # NOTE: YOU MUST ALSO EXCLUDE THE CORRESPONDING MOUNTPOINTS IN EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
    EXCLUDE_VG=()

Thanks for the reply @gdha. I see that option, but it will be cumbersome
to maintain. I have some servers with 50 mount points. We add and remove
them quite often on development servers. I am looking for a way to not
have to maintain the list of mount points in the local.conf file. I want
my disklayout file to only have entries related to vg00, or whatever vg
I specify.

you can script this in the local.conf file if you wish (remember
local.conf  
is nothing more then a bash script too)

Interesting. I actually did not know that. I'll try that out. Thanks!

Thanks for the help @gdha. I added the following lines and it seems to
be working. I will have to do some further testing.

EXCLUDE\_MOUNTPOINTS=($(df -Pl | grep -v 'vg00|boot|tmpfs|Filesystem' |
awk '{print $6}'))  
EXCLUDE\_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE\_RECREATE\[@\]}" )  
EXCLUDE\_RECREATE+=($(df -Pl | grep -v 'vg00|boot|tmpfs|Filesystem' |
awk '{print "fs:"$6}'))

I do not do a lot of bash scripting, so it took some time to figure that
out how to use arrays in bash.
