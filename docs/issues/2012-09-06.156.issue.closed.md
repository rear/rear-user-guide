Hi,

Weird problem. I have an Oracle Enterprise Linux 6 with 2 disks.  
Per disk I have a volume group. Depending on the names of the volume
groups the disk restore  
script fails.

Here is a working scenario:  
The default volume group is named vg\_wlspro01 and the one i create is
called app\_vg.  
Using those names the restore succeeds.

The faulty scenario:  
The default volume group is named vg\_wlspro01 and the on I create is
called vg\_wlspro01\_app  
Using those names the diskrestores failed

This is the error:  
mke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)  
/dev/mapper/vg\_wlspro01\_app-lv\_app is mounted; will not make a
filesystem here!  
2012-09-05 16:30:10 An error occured during layout recreation.

When I look at the layout files i don"t see anything wrong but in the
diskrestore script i find this.

    if create_component "/dev/vg_wlspro01_app" "lvmgrp" ; then
    #Create /dev/vg_wlspro01_app (lvmgrp)
    LogPrint "Restoring LVM VG vg_wlspro01_app"
    if [ -e /dev/vg_wlspro01_app ] ; then
        rm -rf /dev/vg_wlspro01_app
    fi
    lvm vgcfgrestore -f /var/lib/rear/layout/lvm/vg_wlspro01_app.cfg vg_wlspro01_app >&2
    lvm vgchange --available y vg_wlspro01_app >&2
    component_created "/dev/vg_wlspro01_app" "lvmgrp"
    else
        LogPrint "Skipping /dev/vg_wlspro01_app (lvmgrp) as it has already been created."
    fi

    if create_component "/dev/vg_wlspro01" "lvmgrp" ; then
    #Create /dev/vg_wlspro01 (lvmgrp)
    LogPrint "Restoring LVM VG vg_wlspro01_app"
    if [ -e /dev/vg_wlspro01_app ] ; then
        rm -rf /dev/vg_wlspro01_app
    fi
    lvm vgcfgrestore -f /var/lib/rear/layout/lvm/vg_wlspro01_app.cfg vg_wlspro01_app >&2
    lvm vgchange --available y vg_wlspro01_app >&2
    component_created "/dev/vg_wlspro01" "lvmgrp"
    else
        LogPrint "Skipping /dev/vg_wlspro01 (lvmgrp) as it has already been created."
    fi

As you can see in the second part of the script the references used in
vgcfgrestore and vgchange are wrong  
and point to another volume group, one that already has been created.

I tried finding a solution but my knowledge is limited so i failed.  
Maybe you guys have better luck ( i'm pretty sure of that)

Regards

Bart

Which version are you using?

We'll try to reproduce it.

Can you try to change line 77 in
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/11\_include\_lvm\_code.sh from

        read lvmgrp vgrp extentsize junk < <(grep "^lvmgrp $1" $LAYOUT_FILE)

into

        read lvmgrp vgrp extentsize junk < <(grep "^lvmgrp $1 " $LAYOUT_FILE)

(Note the extra space after $1)

You can do this in your rescue image.
