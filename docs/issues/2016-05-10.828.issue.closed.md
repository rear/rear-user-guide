-   Relax-and-Recover 1.18 / Git
-   Debian GNU/Linux 8.4 (jessie)
-   Dell Poweredge R330

Built and installed deb-package from current master with
`make deb OFFICIAL=1.18`.  
Tried running `rear -v mkrescue` with the following conf:

    ### write the rescue initramfs to USB and update the USB bootloader
    OUTPUT=USB

    ### create a backup using the internal NETFS method, using 'tar'
    BACKUP=NETFS

    ### write both rescue image and backup to the device labeled REAR-000
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000

    ### From /usr/share/rear/conf/Debian
    # Add here the Debian ia64 specials which are not general ia64, e.g.
    # agetty vs. getty
    REQUIRED_PROGS=(
    "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"
    getty
    )

    PROGS=(
    "${PROGS[@]}"
    )

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}"  )

This fails when creating ISO image.

This error has come up previously on OpenSUSE \#804. Here it was solved
by using ebiso. But this is on Debian where genisoimage should work if I
understand [this

No ambiguous warning ...

Do you have `-efi-boot` option available?

All this EFI boot wars drives me nuts, I personally don't see a reason
for such big difference despite same version number is used.  
I guess Ubuntu guys did little something to make EFI boot work on their
version. Unfortunately I don't have currently any Debian distro to check
deeper.  
Maybe you can try to compile ebiso? (we don't have deb packages yet, as
I thought that EFI boot works fine on Debian).

One more thing I just realized ... You are using `OUTPUT=USB` ...  
Can you just test with `OUTPUT=ISO` ?

`OUTPUT=ISO` results in the same error.  
When trying to determine the reason for the difference between Ubuntu
and Debian I found the following workaround. This issue also appeared in
Mondo and some stage apperently.

[http://trac.mondorescue.org/ticket/782](http://trac.mondorescue.org/ticket/782)

I manually changed `-e` to `--eltorito-boot` in
`/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/82_create_iso_image.sh`.

Would it be sensible to include such a workaround in the
defaul/Debian.conf?

That is interesting, however I'm not sure that `--eltorito-boot` does
the same thing as `--efi-boot`...  
Did you try to boot from ISO image created using `--eltorito-boot`
option?

and maybe one more question that I should ask at the very begging. :-)  
Are you using `EFI boot` or `Legacy boot` on your Dell Poweredge R330?

I currently am using EFI boot, but have no qualms is switching to BIOS
boot.

I was able to boot from the created ISO when mounting it as a virtual
drive via iDRAC.  
I was not able to boot from the created USB Drive. It didn't show up as
a boot option.

If you really can switch to legacy boot, my humble advice would be DO SO
AND NEVER LOOK BACK ;-), you will save lot of trouble to your self ...  
I did a bit of experimenting with ReaR on USB and observed that
`rear format` creates ext/btrs like file system during initialization
and as native EFI FS is FAT, I'd say that ReaR does not support EFI boot
on USB device.  
@jsmeix @gdha @schlomo can you confirm?

I am afraid my knowledge in general about UEFI  
is very limited which means in general I cannot  
answer questions regarding UEFI - usually it is me  
who has questions about UEFI.

From my very limited own experience with UEFI  
I do fully agree with @gozora that if one can use  
traditional BIOS then use BIOS (and simply relax and wait  
until UEFI is generally well supported - except you really like  
to deal with various "technically interesting" issues - ideally  
when you also can provide GitHub pull requests that fix  
issues with UEFI in rear ;-)

@gozora  
I have a probably stupid question (which proves  
that I really don't know about UEFI):

What exactly do you mean with "ReaR on USB ... rear format ...  
ReaR does not support EFI boot on USB device"?

Shouldn't it work generically to let "rear mkrescue" create  
a UEFI bootable ISO image (e.g. via "ebiso") and then  
burn or dump that onto a CD or DVD or USB stick  
to get a UEFI bootable CD or DVD or USB stick?

Isn't it a different way to use "rear format"?

Regarding "rear format":

What I found documented about it:  
README.adoc reads (excerpts):

<pre>
create a bootable USB backup
</pre>

doc/rear-release-notes.txt reads (excerpts):

<pre>
External USB booting now uses extlinux instead of syslinux,
and therefore, the USB disk must first be formatted with
an ext2, ext3, ext4 or btrfs based file system
</pre>

doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc reads (excerpts):

<pre>
To prepare your USB device for use with Relax-and-Recover, do:
rear format /dev/sdX
This will create a single partition, make it bootable, format it
with ext3, label it REAR-000
</pre>

It seems nothing is documented about BIOS versus UEFI  
regarding "rear format" so that one must inspect  
the sources (fortunately rear is fee software so that  
one can inspect the sources ;-)

lib/format-workflow.sh reads (excerpts):

<pre>
# Usage: rear -v format -- -h /dev/<usb-disk>
# By default 1 partition will be created with ext3 format and label REAR-000
# With the --efi toggle you get 2 partitions (vfat and ext3) so we are able
# to make this USB UEFI bootable afterwards
</pre>

It seems with "rear format --efi /dev/sdX"  
one should get a UEFI bootable USB device.

But I never tried that myself.

@jsmeix  
To settle things down I'm very far from being UEFI expert and to my top
UEFI knowledge belongs being able to use pager when displaying help (it
is `help -b` btw) and changing colors (`cls <0-9>`) ;-).

From what I've understood UEFI recognizes (by default) only FAT file
systems. Means that if you plug in any device that does not contain FAT
and trigger `map` in UEFI shell, you will not able to see its content,
hence not able to boot.  
So as I firstly triggered `rear format` and saw the outcome I was quite
sure that UEFI will not be able to boot from such formatted USB..

information about `rear format --efi` is totally new to me, it looks
like it could really work due added vfat partition ...  
I'll certainly give it a try later today.

Thanks for pointing it out!

    Added some clarification on how to use the options in the format workflow.
    Added an --efi toggle to create an UEFI bootable disk (partitions only for the moment)
    issue #593
</pre>

which refers to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/593](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/593)  
but it seems that issue in not yet the actual issue  
where UEFI boot support was added to "rear format".

But the "partitions only for the moment" may indicate that  
UEFI boot support is perhaps not yet fully implemented  
for "rear format --efi".

It seems it is @gdha who knows the real details here...

@jsmeix @gozora UEFI USB booting is not supported for the moment - I
started with it (the format part only), but stopped as there was no real
reason to continue with this as `ebiso` could do the job for SLES. See
also \#603.

Hey there,

Using Debian 8 and rear-1.17.2. The same issue with option `-e` is
visible. To solve it I installed **xorriso** and set added
`ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/xorrisofs` to my */etc/rear/local.conf* file.
Now the error is gone and the backup works. I still have to test if the
image actually boot in UEFI. I'll test it and get back with that info.

In the mean time, maybe the Debian version should depend on **xorriso**
instead of **genisoimage** and ship `ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/xorrisofs`
in *default.conf*?

Cheers.

In general that should not do any harm, considering that xorriso really
works fine.

I am not a Debian or Ubuntu user but in general  
I think using xorriso for now only on Debian or Ubuntu  
looks like a good step into the right direction  
in particular because at SUSE we also had  
an (internal) request to support xorriso in rear.

to make a GitHub pull request with your changes

some kind of general xorriso support in rear.

It is not fixed for me unfortunately. I am backing up a Debian 9 system
installed in UEFI mode. And I also get:

@Signum why not create a dedicated config file for Debian? Use
`rear dump` to find out which config file would be appropriate for this
purpose? You could add `ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/xorrisofs` line to the
new config file.

Only FYI a general addendum:

In ReaR basically all is bash scripts, in particular config files  
are also bash scripts that get sourced (and executed).

Therefore one can do arbitrary bash scripting in config files as
needed  
to distinguish different cases for example in etc/rear/local.conf things
like

    if CONDITION_IT_IS_A_DEBIAN_9_SYSTEM ; then
        ISO_MKISOFS_BIN="/usr/bin/xorrisofs"
    fi

One must consider that etc/rear/local.conf is also used during "rear
recover"  
where etc/rear/local.conf is sourced within the rather minimal
environment  
in the running ReaR recovery system so that things like  
CONDITION\_IT\_IS\_A\_DEBIAN\_9\_SYSTEM must be sufficiently fail-safe  
that can be also evaluated within the recovery system - regardless
that  
ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN is not needed within the recovery system  
but evaluating CONDITION\_IT\_IS\_A\_DEBIAN\_9\_SYSTEM must  
not cause a fatal error (it can of course result a non-zero return
code).
