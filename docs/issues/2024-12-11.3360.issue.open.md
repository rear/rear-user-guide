Suggestion: Add Alma Linux and Oracle Linux to our supported distros

-   Add support in `run-in-docker` to build packages
-   Test from time to time

This is probably very relevant to our users as these two distros are the
remaining main RHEL clones that receive updates.

However, we really would like to see other people - e.g. users of those
distros - stepping in and support testing here.

And what about Rocky Linux?
