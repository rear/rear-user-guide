We are using bareos for backup and now have tested rear some days. We
setup an new VM (KVM on proxmox) and installed a default Ubuntu 14.04.
LTS installation.

We have created a rescue iso with rear with the command: rear -v
mkrescue  
This iso was created without errors and boots.

After the restore the files from bareos are also restored correctly. But
when we exit the rear recovery and reboot the system it shows only the
Ubuntu grub screen:

![grub](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7325949/7653184/0d4e2566-fb14-11e4-8705-814caf0df478.png)

When I press enter it shows only "booting from harddisk" but nothing
happens. The system does not boot after recovery with rear

After the resotre I have seen the following error, but I don't know if
this is related to the problem:  
bash: cannot set terminal process group (97): Inappropriate ioctl for
device  
bash: no job control in this shell

In the log there is the following error:  
grub-install: warning: cannot open directory '/usr/share/locale' : No
such file or directory.  
Maybe this is related to the problem.

There is no special setup, just a default ubuntu 14.04 installation with
one disk /dev/vda.

I have installed rear 1.1.7.0 from here:  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu\_14.04/all/rear\_1.17.0\_all.deb](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu_14.04/all/rear_1.17.0_all.deb)

/etc/rear/site.conf  
OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=[ftp://user:password@backupserver.mydomain.com/directory](ftp://user:password@backupserver.mydomain.com/directory)  
BACKUP=BAREOS  
BAREOS\_CLIENT=test2-fd

We have tried this 3 times and also setup a new VM, but always the same
problem.

I think this is a bug. Or was someone able to restore an Ubunut 14.04.
installtion?

Maybe this is also the same Problem as
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/584](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/584)
?

Thanks.

@layer7 Are you sure the restore went fine? It looks to me that the
restore took less then 1 minute to restore all files? Did you check the
/mnt/local/... directories?

Yes the restore took only about 1 minute.

I checked the /mnt/local direcotries and everything seems to be there.

I also check the bareos webgui which shows me also that the restore job
was sucessful. Here is the bareos webgui restore report:  
![bareos\_restore](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7325949/7765359/5b759dd4-005d-11e5-9835-b93a12da24a2.png)

You can see there that it has restored 62479 files (about 3 GB) with 64
MB per second. If you restore at 64 MB per second you can restore 3,8 GB
per minute. So the restore time is normal.

Please note that this was just a clean Ubuntu server installation with
some test files I created in one directory. So the size of the backup of
3 GB is also correct. The testfiles I created are also there after the
restore.

The backup is also complete. When I reinstall the Ubuntu (to get a vaild
grub MBR and valid partitions), boot a rescue system, mount the harddisk
in the rescue system and restore the same baroes backup completly to the
harddisk it took also about 1 minute to restore the complete backup. And
when I then reboot the server from the harddisk it does boot.

So I don't think it is a Problem with the bareos backup/restore.  
I think something installing the grub or restoreing the partitions does
not work correctly in rear.

I think more people have this problem but they don't know that they have
it because they don't have done the restore in the last time.  
Maybe the Problem was not there in previous ubuntu versions because they
have changed something on grub?

@layer7 could you retry with the latest snapshot as various issues with
ubuntu were fixed? You never know.

@aussendorf Is this what you also saw/noticed?

No feedback since more than one year  
indicates the issue has become obsolete  
so that I close it now.  
If needed it could be reopened but preferably  
file a new issue based on a current rear version.
