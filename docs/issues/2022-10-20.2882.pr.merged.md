    dh_*: warning: Compatibility levels before 10 are deprecated (level 9 in use)

this should be changed

I know nothing at all about Debian/Ubuntu packaging  
so I cannot review it - in particular I know nothing  
whether or not that change could cause regressions  
when building it on older Debian/Ubuntu versions.

@DEvil0000  
do you perhaps know if increasing that vaule could cause  
regressions when building it on older Debian/Ubuntu versions?

The last increase (from 5 to 9) happened  
on Jun 27, 2017 by @schlomo via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/56959b54fcf3ec02113fbf1f4281867270cf1170](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/56959b54fcf3ec02113fbf1f4281867270cf1170)  
so perhaps @schlomo might know if increasing that vaule  
could cause regressions when building it on older  
Debian/Ubuntu versions?

@gdha  
I noticed that also you did something in the past  
for Debian/Ubuntu packaging, so perhaps you might know  
if increasing the vaule in packaging/debian/compat  
could cause regressions when building it on older  
Debian/Ubuntu versions?

I kinda know debian packaging but don't know the details of debhelpers.
If there is a deprecation warning or such it is normally a good idea to
follow the suggestion.

I think I will "just merge" it today afternoon.  
If something breaks with package building on Debian/Ubuntu  
we can fix it as needed (e.g. revert this change as a band aid).
