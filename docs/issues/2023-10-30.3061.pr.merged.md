##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   Installed RHEL 9 system to a thin pool
    -   Extended the thin pool to another disk, while artificially
        keeping its metadata volume size unchanged, and using 100% of
        the VG (no free space in the VG left).
    -   Backed up and recovered

With ReaR version before this change, recovery fails with:

    +++ lvm lvcreate -y -L 1073741824b -n swap rhel_kvm-08-guest06
      Volume group "rhel_kvm-08-guest06" has insufficient free space (250 extents): 256 required.

swap is not part of the thin pool and is created after the thin pool.
Without the change, the thin pool consumes too much space in the VG due
to the metadata volume being too large, and there is not enough space
for the swap volume, leading to the error above. With this change the
recovery is successful.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Instead of letting LVM use the default pool metadata volume size when
restoring a layout with thin pools, use the size from the original
system. The pool metadata size will be saved in disklayout.conf as the
new key "poolmetadatasize" on the thin pool LV.

This makes the layout of the recovered system closer to the original
system.

Prevents some cases of recovery failures during layout restoration: if
the original system used a non-default (in particular, smaller) metadata
volume size, and the space in the VG was fully used, there would not be
enough space in the VG for recovery of all LVs (as layout restoration
would create a larger pool metadata size than before and if restoring to
disks of the same size, the space will be missing elsewhere).

Because the code already contains

    # Check for 'lvs' support of the 'lv_layout' field:

I wonder if the here new added `lv_metadata_size` field  
is always supported in practice - i.e. if it is also supported  
for reasonably older Linux distributions (older than RHEL 9)?

Here a general overview which fields are supported  
with older LVM versions:

I test with

    # lvs_fields="origin,lv_name,vg_name,lv_size,lv_layout,pool_lv,chunk_size,stripes,stripe_size,seg_size,lv_metadata_size"

    # lvs --separator=':' --noheadings --units b --nosuffix -o $lvs_fields 2>&1 | grep "Unrecognised field"

and reduce step by step lvs\_fields by what is reported as "Unrecognised
field".

On SLES10 SP4  
with lvm2-2.02.17  
those fields are supported  
origin,lv\_name,vg\_name,lv\_size,chunk\_size,stripes,stripe\_size,seg\_size  
i.e. those fields are not supported  
lv\_layout  
pool\_lv  
lv\_metadata\_size

    # lvs_fields="origin,lv_name,vg_name,lv_size,chunk_size,stripes,stripe_size,seg_size"

    # lvs --separator=':' --noheadings --units b --nosuffix -o $lvs_fields && echo OK
      No volume groups found
    OK

ReaR would fail on SLE10.

On SLES11 SP3  
with lvm2-2.02.98  
those fields are supported  
origin,lv\_name,vg\_name,lv\_size,pool\_lv,chunk\_size,stripes,stripe\_size,seg\_size,lv\_metadata\_size  
i.e. only one field is not supported  
lv\_layout

    # lvs_fields="origin,lv_name,vg_name,lv_size,pool_lv,chunk_size,stripes,stripe_size,seg_size,lv_metadata_size"

    # lvs --separator=':' --noheadings --units b --nosuffix -o $lvs_fields && echo OK
      No volume groups found
    OK

ReaR should still work on SLE11.

On SLES12 SP5  
with lvm2-2.02.180  
all those fields  
origin,lv\_name,vg\_name,lv\_size,lv\_layout,pool\_lv,chunk\_size,stripes,stripe\_size,seg\_size,lv\_metadata\_size  
are supported  
so ReaR should work on SLE12 and later.

Summary:

I do not care about SLE10.  
ReaR on SLE10 was never officially supported by SUSE.

I do no longer care about SLE11.  
ReaR on SLE11 was officially supported by SUSE.  
Meanwhile SLE11 is out of official SUSE support, see  
[https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/\#product-suse-linux-enterprise-high-availability-extension](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#product-suse-linux-enterprise-high-availability-extension)

    SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11
    General Support Ends    31 Mar 2019
    LTSS Ends               31 Mar 2022

But in this case ReaR should even still work on SLE11.

@jsmeix I tested that as well, lv\_metadata\_size (and lv\_layout) is
supported even on RHEL 6.

Given that

and

I propose to remove the whole lv\_layout\_supported=no branch, which
would simplify the code a bit.

@schlomo Good point! It also took me a while to realize that I can not
give the key any name that I want, unless I want to implement a special
case in 110\_include\_lvm\_code.sh . Please have a look at my last
commit.

@pcahyna  
feel free to remove all what belongs to "lv\_layout\_supported".

By the way:  
I noticed an outdated comment and an outdated message  
at another code place:  
Meanwhile, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29e739ae7c0651f8f77c60846bfbe2b6c91baa29](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/29e739ae7c0651f8f77c60846bfbe2b6c91baa29)  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2903](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2903)  
the code calls `lvm pvdisplay -C --separator '|' ...`  
but later there still is `lvm pvdisplay -c`

        # Check the exit code of "lvm pvdisplay -c"
        # in the "lvm pvdisplay -c | while read line ; do ... done" pipe:
        pvdisplay_exit_code=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
        test $pvdisplay_exit_code -eq 0 || Error "LVM command 'lvm pvdisplay -c' failed with exit code $pvdisplay_exit_code"

which should be updated to something like

        # Check the exit code of "lvm pvdisplay -C ..."
        # in the "lvm pvdisplay -C ... | while read line ; do ... done" pipe:
        pvdisplay_exit_code=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
        test $pvdisplay_exit_code -eq 0 || Error "LVM command 'lvm pvdisplay' failed with exit code $pvdisplay_exit_code"

I'd recommend merging this before it turns into a general overhaul of
that code area

@jsmeix thanks, fixed in the last commit (although it does not belong to
this PR that much).

@schlomo and the scenario is very much real. One can encounter quite
unusal setups in practice (sometimes due to creative ways of deploying
systems).
