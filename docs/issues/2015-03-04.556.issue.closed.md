Currently my code that supports btrfs in rear explicitly excludes
support for btrfs snapshot subvolumes. The main reason for this is
described in the "btrfs" secion at
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Currently SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 is installed by default in a way so
that what is mounted at '/' is a "normal" btrfs subvolume (the "/@"
subvolume).

For the upcoming first service pack for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 (i.e.
SLE12-SP1) it is currently planned to install it by default in a way so
that what is mounted at '/' is a btrfs snapshot subvolume (something
like "/.snapshots/1/snapshot").

Therefore I need to enhance my code that supports btrfs for recovery
when what is mounted at '/' is a btrfs snapshot subvolume.

This does not mean that I will implement support for any kind of btrfs
snapshot subvolumes.

It only means I will enhance my current code so that recovery of all
mounted btrfs subvolumes works regardless if there is a normal subvolume
mounted or if there is a snapshot subvolume mounted.

In other words: It will be still unsupported to restore all data in all
existing btrfs snapshot subvolumes. Only mounted btrfs snapshot
subvolumes will become supported.

Background information:

The reason behind the change to install it by default in a way so that
what is mounted at '/' is a btrfs snapshot subvolume is the following:

The snapshot subvolumes in "/.snapshots" are controlled by snapper (a
tool for filesystem snapshot management, see
[http://snapper.io](http://snapper.io)).

This change ensures that always what is mounted at '/' is controlled by
snapper (i.e. both after booting from a snapshot and also from the very
beginning after the initial installation).

This way there is no longer a special difference after the system was
booted from a snapshot compared to when the system was booted as it was
setup during the initial installation.

In the end this change will ensure that the system works the same even
after it was booted from a snapshot.

@jsmeix I assume this is a placeholder - I've put the milestone to 1.18
if that is Ok for you

Yes, it is meant for a future rear release after 1.17 and I will
implement it (i.e. you could assign it to me if this is o.k. for you).

I do very much appreciate your offer but currently I am not a
good-enough Git/GitHub user to be sure that I may not accidentally mess
up your things.

At least for now - I prefer to learn how to make proper GitHub pull
requests and after I got a somewhat experienced Git/GitHub user I might
even become rights for your master tree.

In particular for this feature I will have to work separated from rear
master with whatever changing beta versions of SLE12-SP1 and do some
trial and error work until I learned how to deal correctly with it and
then I can actually implement it for rear master - just as I did for the
generic btrfs support ( you should be really happy that rear master
never got my dirty-hack stuff that only works on SLE12-GA ;-).

For me it is topmost important not to cause regressions in rear master
like
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/555](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/555)
that is a really unfortunate side-effect of my change from "mount" to
"findmnt".

@jsmeix I agree with @gdha and salute your modesty. I'll be happy to
give your pull requests and issues a high priority and assist in any way
which you need.

Likely not yet for rear 1,18 (to be released about June 2015) but for
rear 1.19 (to be released about Dec. 2015).

FYI some very first information:

I did some reverse-engineering how our installer does the default btrfs
setup for SLE12-SP1.

Up to now I found out (by inspecting SLE12-SP1 beta3 installation on a
KVM virtual machine) that snapper is now needed (specifically
/usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper) in the installation system
(inst-sys for our installer and the rear recovery system for rear).

Currently I cannot estimate how long it may take to integrate snapper
into the rear recovery system.

Furthermore rear needs support for "chattr" (currently there is none in
rear):

Because for SLE12-SP1 some btrfs subvolume directories (/var/lib/pgsql
/var/lib/libvirt/images /var/lib/mariadb) have the "no copy on write
(C)" file attribute set (via "chattr +C /path/to/directory") chattr
support is needed in rear.

FYI:

For me the first basic step works (on a KVM/qemu virtual machine) that
is:

Recovery of a SLES12-SP1 system with default btrfs structure (but
currently without chattr support).

I made my current SLE12-SP1 specific implementation public available in
the openSUSE Build Service development project "Archiving" package
"rear" at

@jsmeix any plans to integrate the patch *SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch*

into the upstream track?

@gdha  
yes, but see "Reasoning and background information" in

I enhanced my SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch so that now  
on my test system it works for me to recreate  
the SLE12-SP1 default btrfs structure  
plus  
for mounted btrfs subvolumes that have the 'no copy on write'  
attribute set those btrfs subvolumes are recreated with that  
attribute set (by using 'chattr' on the btrfs subvolume directory).

From my current point of view the issue is hereby fixed  
specifically for SUSE.

@gdha  
please have a look at my SLE12-SP1-btrfs.patch in OBS project
"Archiving" package "rear" at
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Archiving/rear)

I tried to implememt it so that it should be backward compatible  
(i.e. I think my new stuff should not cause a regression)  
but to be really safe this would require testing  
(in particular on Red Hat, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, ...).

@gdha  
if you think it would be o.k. to have my current SUSE-specific  
implementation in rear upstream I can of course make a  
GitHub pull request.

@jsmeix looks ok to me - just prepare a pull request.  
Furthermore, concerning the example config files - perhaps we can add
these under `conf/examples/` ? What do you think?

It seems that changing btrfs default setup never ends,

regarding what they changed from SLE12 SP1 to SP2.

Hi, We are facing similar issue while recovering SLES 12 SP1 (Rear 1.19)
with default btrfs for systemvg. We can backup and create image fine
however during recovering it gives errors. Could you please help us in
overcoming this issue and it has became a kind of show-stopper atm. Is
there a workaround/patch/update to get it working on SLES12 SP1? I have
contacted SLES support and they said they only support REAR on SLES for
SAP version and not the normal SLES.  
I am not well-verse with github so please excuse my non-awareness
regarding posts. Your help/advice would be much appreciated.  
Thanks and regards,  
Vish

We also tried solution given in one of the thread -
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1036](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1036)
- we used snapper to get around it however it still failed as in
attached rear-sles12-test.log

Hi,

Attached where?

> we used snapper to get around it

did you run `rear mkrescue` and booted from newly created ReaR rescue
system?

What is size of your */dev/mapper/system-lvroot* ?
