See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319\#issuecomment-2355010955](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3319#issuecomment-2355010955)  
(excerpts)

    usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/dhclient-script and
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh
    originate from
    https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/38d5bd280654dd4e05a8a408daad8e08925c3ab0

    ...

    I guess that also
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/bin/dhclient-script and
    usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/dhcp-setup-functions.sh
    came from Fedora at the time of that commit
    i.e. on Dec 10, 2010

    On the one hand this indicates that this code in ReaR
    could be OK (because we may assume Fedora code is OK).

    On the other hand this code in ReaR is rather old
    (more than 13 years meanwhile) and I assume
    possible (security) bug fixes at Fedora
    were not backported into ReaR.

    So this code in ReaR should be checked if it is considered
    to be still sufficiently OK for what ReaR needs
    (DHCP client support in the ReaR recovery system)
