setting  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS=""  
BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_SUFFIX=""

makes a nice tar file in the backup, but fails to restore the files. i
think its still trying to do a tar xzf which fails because it's not
gzipped.

what option can i set to make it untar on recovery ?  
thank you

@scprsync  
how does it fail for you?

Using NETFS and ISO mode, storing on a Truenas ZFS NFS server.

When restoring a machine, with gzip disabled,  
the file download and install doesn’t restore any files.

It tried to do an nfs mount and untar the backup.tar file  
but it doesn’t extract any files

/mnt/local has directories, but no files… so of course  
the rest of the restoration fails

When allowing gzip it all works, creation, restoration…

When removing the gzip, it makes backup.tar , but then  
when restoring it doesn’t untar the files. It actually  
shows them being downloaded, just doesn’t untar them

i was guessing that REaR was still trying to tar xzf  
which would fail/error out because its not gzipped.

~chris

a different solution i tried was using pigz on creation.  
worked well,  
much faster to create a backup like 10x-15x depending on processors.  
But restoration fails.  
I'm guessing because it saves pigz as the restoration command  
and its not in the initrd.  
If it just used gzip to decompress, it would have worked,  
they are compatible.

rear version 2.6, debian 11

its restoring in / instead of /mnt/local.  
watching recovery says

"creating filesystem of type ext4 with mount point / on
/dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv" and then proceeds to untar in / instead of
/mnt/local and that of course breaks much of the rest of the script

i see that bind mount still works /mnt/local/sys /mnt/local/dev
/mnt/local/proc are there  
but /mnt/local/lib..var..home and the rest were untard in /

uploaded log, not sure why its untaring in /

we have a large number of machines, some of them with a good amount of
data. standardly with REaR, im getting 10-15MB/s creation rate, not
great. i found 2 ways to increase up to 100-150MB/s,

1.  not using gzip, breaks for me on restoration
2.  using pigz, breaks for me on restoration

@scprsync  
I had a first look at your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/10437505/rear-adcphltappserver46.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/10437505/rear-adcphltappserver46.log)  
and it shows (excerpts):

    +++ Print 'Creating filesystem of type ext4 with mount point / on /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv.'
    +++ wipefs --all --force /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv
    /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv: 2 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000438 (ext4): 53 ef
    +++ mkfs -t ext4 -b 4096 -i 16255 -U 73e56cee-dc12-4209-ae25-c48aba05a423 -F /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv
    ...
    +++ Print 'Mounting filesystem /'
    +++ mkdir -p /mnt/local/
    +++ mount -o rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv /mnt/local/
    +++ mount -o rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,remount,user_xattr /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv /mnt/local/

so dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv is mounted at /mnt/local/  
while "rear recover" is running.  
The 'Print' messages are meant from what it was on the original system  
(i.e. what was stored in disklayout.conf by "rear mkrescue/mkbackup")  
and what it will be finally on the recreated target system  
(i.e. after the reboot when "rear recover" had finished).

so `... | tar ... -C /mnt/local/ ...` should untar in /mnt/local/  
(at least this is what "man tar" tells what should happen  
as far as I understand what "man tar" tells).  
Did you "verify backup restore log messages in
/var/lib/rear/restore/recover.backup.tar.815.restore.log"?

@scprsync  
thank you for your description that "its untaring in /".

When I tried to reproduce it yesterday  
on a KVM/QEMU test VM with 2 GiB of RAM  
I had issues like this one which is from right now today:

    Restoring from '/var/tmp/rear.21UbIcsbfyqiwo3/outputfs/localhost/backup.tar' (restore log in /var/lib/rear/restore/recover.backup.tar.1497.restore.log) ...

    Restored 1551 MiB [avg. 45406 KiB/sec] 
    Killed

I noticed 'oom-killer' in the dmesg output like

    ... tar invoked oom-killer ...
    ...
    ... Out of memory: Killed process ... (rear) ...

But I failed to see the reason why it runs out of memory.

Now I see it:  
It is because 'tar ... -C /mnt/local/' untars in $(pwd)  
i.e. in '/root' in the ReaR recovery system  
if 'tar' is called without '--gzip'  
like this:

Because the ReaR recovery system runs in a ramdisk  
and my VM has only 2 GiB memory it runs out of memory.

In my above ReaR recovery system the

shows nothing that tells me (I am not a 'tar' expert) that  
'tar ... -C /mnt/local/' does not untar in /mnt/local/  
or even why it seems tar ignores '-C /mnt/local/':

there it stops logging (because oom-killer killed it).

I had noticed those "POSIX ACLs" messages also yesterday  
but I did not see the reason (because it untars into a ramdisk).

I use tar (GNU tar) version 1.34 (on openSUSE Leap 15.4).

Of course the actual target filesystems are mounted  
below /mnt/local in my above ReaR recovery system:

    RESCUE localhost:~ # lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

And with '--gzip' it works as expected (of course):

For me 'tar ... -C /mnt/local/' without --gzip  
works manually in the ReaR recovery system.  
I used the enforced MIGRATION\_MODE  
so that I can halt "rear recover"  
before the backup is restored  
at this user dialog

... I found something:

When I change in  
/usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
the actual restore command line from

        (   case "$BACKUP_PROG" in
                (tar)
    ...
                    if is_true "$BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_ENABLED" ; then 
    ...
                    else
    ...
                        dd if=$restore_input bs=1M | $BACKUP_PROG --block-number --totals --verbose "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}" "${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}" -C $TARGET_FS_ROOT/ -x -f -
                    fi

to

                        dd if=$restore_input bs=1M | $BACKUP_PROG --block-number --totals --verbose "${BACKUP_PROG_OPTIONS[@]}" -C $TARGET_FS_ROOT/ -x -
    f -

i.e. when I remove `"${BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS[@]}"`  
then it works for me.

Argh!

It "just works" (without code modifications) with

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

cf. the BACKUP\_PROG\_COMPRESS\_OPTIONS definition in default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1282](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1282)

    # BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS is an array ...
    ...
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( --gzip )

FYI:

How an array that is set to the empty string  
(actually when its only/first element is set to an empty string)  
evaluates versus how it evaluates when it is set to an empty array:

    # arr=( --foo )

    # arr=""

    # ( set -x ; echo --this "${arr[@]}" --that )
    + echo --this '' --that
    --this  --that

    # arr=()

    # ( set -x ; echo --this "${arr[@]}" --that )
    + echo --this --that
    --this --that

Note the one more space character in the first echo output  
so on first glance it may look same but there is a difference,  
cf. "Beware of the emptiness" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

How tar behaves with an additional empty argument:

    ~> ls -l /tmp/mydir*

    /tmp/mydir1:
    total 20
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users 10240 Jan 18 12:02 hello.tar
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users   227 Jan 18 12:02 hello.tar.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users     6 Jan 18 12:02 hello.txt

    /tmp/mydir2:
    total 0

    /tmp/mydir3:
    total 0

    ~> cd /tmp/mydir2

    /tmp/mydir2> cat /tmp/mydir1/hello.tar | tar -v '' -C /tmp/mydir3 -x -f -
    hello.txt

    /tmp/mydir2> ls -l /tmp/mydir*

    /tmp/mydir1:
    total 20
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users 10240 Jan 18 12:02 hello.tar
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users   227 Jan 18 12:02 hello.tar.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users     6 Jan 18 12:02 hello.txt

    /tmp/mydir2:
    total 4
    -rw-r--r-- 1 johannes users 6 Jan 18 12:02 hello.txt

    /tmp/mydir3:
    total 0

That empty arguments make such a crucial difference  
for tar and that tar reports nothing that it does  
not do what is requested by a '-C ...' argument  
loks like a bug in tar.

But that possible issue in tar is not something  
we at ReaR upstream will try to work around  
(except there is a generic, simple, fail-safe solution).

From my point of view it is in any case a bug  
when a program silently(!) ignores what is  
requested by its user (in particular when  
the program is run in verbose mode).

My version is slightly different (bs=1M isn’t in it),  
but I dropped the BACKUP\_PROGRAM\_OPTIONS and it now works

So

1.  

Thank you

1.  

Does this break anything for others?  
Can we get this change into the Debian 11 repository  
so that I don’t have to track it on 400 computers  
and can just install from repo?

And again, thank you.  
It’s a nice product.  
One that we used to do ourselves locally,  
but your is more robust and I like it.  
Honestly, more people should know about it.

@scprsync  
it seems you missed my last entry here  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911\#issuecomment-1387056556](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911#issuecomment-1387056556)

It reads in particular

    It "just works" (without code modifications) with

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=""

So use

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=()

to set it to an actually empty array  
instead of

    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=""

which sets the first array element to be an empty string

    # arr=( one two )

    # declare -p arr
    declare -a arr=([0]="one" [1]="two")

    # arr=""

    # declare -p arr
    declare -a arr=([0]="" [1]="two")

    # arr=()

    # declare -p arr
    declare -a arr=()

and I assume then things will "just work" also for you  
(without code modifications).

For more information and some details behind how tar behaves  
in this particular case see my complete last entry

A side note regarding the current (since ReaR 2.7)

    dd if=$restore_input bs=1M | ...

versus the before (up to ReaR 2.6)

    dd if=$restore_input | ...

in usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2369](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2369)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2458](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2458)  
where the former reads in particular (excerpts)

    ... the speed was 500KiB/s ... on a 100MBit line ...
    ...
    After adding bs=1M to the dd command
    the speed was now really fast in comparison:
    it used the full capacity of the line (about 100MBit/s).

I understand.

I added the bs=1M option.  
Restoration went from ~85MB/s -&gt; 220MB/s, significant improvement.

How large does /tmp need to be with a NETFS option?

Anyway, great tool, thank you a ton for your effort.

FYI:

Simple reproducers for the inexplicable behaviour  
when 'tar' gets an additional empty argument  
(I use GNU tar 1.34 on openSUSE Leap 15.4):

    $ tar -v -x '' -C /targetdir -f archive.tar

and

    $ tar -v '' -x -C /targetdir -f archive.tar

untar into the current working directory  
while

    $ tar -v -x -C /targetdir '' -f archive.tar

and

    $ tar '' -v -x -C /targetdir -f archive.tar

untar into /targetdir

I guess this might be related to the "Old Option Style"  
that is described in  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html\#Old-Options](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#Old-Options)

But I fail to see how the additional empty argument  
interferes with the -C option and its value.

I asked a colleague and here his reply:

    Suppose you have a tar archive ar.tar
    that contains two directories: A and B.
    So it might have:
      A/foo
      A/bar
      A/baz
      B/this
      B/that
      B/the_other

    If you run

     tar -x -f ar.tar -C /tmp A -C /var/tmp B

    Then tar would chdir to /tmp, extract the "A" directory,
    then chdir to /var/tmp and extract the B directory.

    If you don't have the first "-C /tmp",
    then "A" would be extracted into the current directory.

    If you have the name "" rather than "A" or "B",
    then tar would extract the entire archive
    (everything starting with "").

    With this understanding, your observations make perfect sense.
