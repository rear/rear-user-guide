@rear/contributors Please have a look, I'd like to do the last fixes on
Monday and merge because that is the limit for the Dell lab where I can
run tests.

Second impression: please do not mix formatting changes and actual
functionality changes in the same commit.
24c122798406e0d62887e0e2909bb942d44a88dd is about "Ensure minimum Bash
version ", but it contains hundreds of unrelated changed lines.  
I also have the impression that many of the formatting changes should be
avoided, as they make the code look worse (and less in line with the
examples in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
).

Im actually unhappy with

![image](https://github.com/rear/rear/assets/101384/fbd35124-119a-4d59-8cc5-ffe13bcb5aee)

because it mixes in all the backup methods into a single file instead of
using our directory based overlay architecture to separate the concerns
for each backup software. If it is OK with @rear/contributors then I'd
gladly pull this code apart by introducing a new
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH_ADDITIONS` variable that can be set for every backup
tool.

The reason why I didn't do that is that I cannot test this change for
all backup tools so that we would have to rely on eyeball inspection and
later tests by others.

Another thought: I added a feature to backup and restore the ESP because
PPDM doesn't backup `vfat` filesystems. I'm wondering if I should change
this code to be more generic so that it would either happen
automatically for any recovery that doesn't restore the ESP or that it
can be activated for those commercial backup tools that can't backup the
ESP themselves.

In my test case the ESP was ~7MB, not much at all.

I must say that a backup software that does not backup `vfat`
filesystems does not looks suitable as a backup method for ReaR. What if
the user has a vfat filesystem mounted somewhere else, and includes it
in layout?

Would it work to add a PPDM-specific check that there are not vfat
filesystems in the layout (except the ESP)?

thanks for the update, it looks much better now, but there are still
some places with unrelated white space changes remaining. Please also
drop the huge autogenerated html files from the PR, unless they have
been in the source tree before.

@pcahyna about the white space changes like `do source $script;` vs.
`$script ;` I have the challenge that there doesn't seem to be a
[shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd)
setting to allow that.

I really would like us to find a way to use automated formatting, as it
significantly reduces mental overhead for us developers. BTW, The
[Google Shell
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) also doesn't
require a blank before the `;` in a `do` statement, so maybe we don't
need to require that.

What I would specifically suggest is to amend our `.editorconfig` file
like this:

    root = true
    [*]
    end_of_line = lf
    insert_final_newline = true
    indent_style = space
    indent_size = 4
    shell_variant = bash
    binary_next_line = true
    switch_case_indent = true
    space_redirects = true
    keep_padding = true
    function_next_line = false

    [[bash]]
    shell_variant = bash

and be happy what `shfmt` makes out of it.

@schlomo a commit should not include changes unrelated to the purpose of
the commit, and should not mix formatting changes/style changes and
functional changes. It seems that your proposal implies reformatting
every source code file that one touches, which will result in a huge
number of unrelated whitespace changes, especially for longer files.
This will significantly *increase* the mental overhead for those reading
the diffs, searching in git log or using `git blame` (like I find myself
doing very often).

This seems though to be our preferred style according to the examples in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)
and most of the existing code. I am not saying that the style can't be
changed, but a PR about adding support for Dell PowerProtect Data
Manager is not the good place to discuss it or change the style.

@jsmeix I might have found an example where the `ldd` logic doesn't work
as expected, specifically the `cd` to the library directory before
running `ldd`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/58d6ec23941557af097def87ea25b13d340f834a/usr/share/rear/build/default/990\_verify\_rootfs.sh\#L179](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/58d6ec23941557af097def87ea25b13d340f834a/usr/share/rear/build/default/990_verify_rootfs.sh#L179)  
doesn't seem to work in this example:

    REAR lvrh9reart01:~/rear-ppdm/usr/share/rear # show libr
    declare -- DP_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/omni/lib:/opt/omni/lib64"
    declare -- LD_LIBRARY_PATH_FOR_BACKUP_TOOL="/opt/dpsapps/fsagent/lib:/opt/dpsapps/agentsvc/lib"
    declare -- NBU_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/openv/lib:/usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/lib/"
    declare -- NON_FATAL_BINARIES_WITH_MISSING_LIBRARY=""
    declare -- TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin:/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/cit/bin"
    REAR lvrh9reart01:~/rear-ppdm/usr/share/rear # cd /opt/dpsapps/agentsvc/lib/
    REAR lvrh9reart01:/opt/dpsapps/agentsvc/lib # ldd libssl.so.1.0.0 
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff53181000)
            libcrypto.so.1.0.0 => not found
            libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f3d18ed0000)
            libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f3d18800000)
            /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f3d18edd000)

instead, it only works with specifically setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

    REAR lvrh9reart01:/opt/dpsapps/agentsvc/lib # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH_FOR_BACKUP_TOOL ldd libssl.so.1.0.0 
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcb9fec000)

            libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fbba5e00000)
            /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fbba6abd000)

The system is RHEL 9.3.

I also found another false positive for the `systemd` libraries which is
apparently caused by the same problem (`ldd` not picking up libraries
from the current working directory):

    Testing each binary with 'ldd' and look for 'not found' libraries within the recovery system
    /usr/lib64/systemd/libsystemd-core-252.so requires additional libraries
            libsystemd-shared-252.so => not found

Actually, ` libsystemd-shared-252.so` is also in the same
`/usr/lib64/systemd/` directory, and the manual test shows the same
problem:

    [root@lvrh9reart01 systemd]# ldd libsystemd-core-252.so

@schlomo thanks for cleaning up the commit history, looks good now.  
I have not had a chance to review the latest changes (generalized ESP
restore and LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH stuff). I have some minor comments about
them that can be addressed in a separate PR.
