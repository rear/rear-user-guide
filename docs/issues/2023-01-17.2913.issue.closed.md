@sd2070953

all ReaR configuration variables are documented in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
online for ReaR 2.7 at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
and for ReaR 2.6 at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)

Both read (excerpt - long lines shown wrapped here):

    Here we define and describe all configuration
    variables and set them to a default.

    Do not change them here. Set them in your
    site.conf or local.conf file as needed.

So set in your etc/rear/local.conf file

    AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE=50
