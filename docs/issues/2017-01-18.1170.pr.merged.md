An "Abort" choice in any 'select' dialog is useless  
because simple \[Ctrl\]+\[C\] also aborts ReaR.

Cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1166)

With that change recovery with backup on USB  
and aborting at the USB backup selection dialog  
works as follows:

<pre>

When there are no objections I will "just merge" it.

Only FYI:  
Same kind of backup selection dialog is also in  
verify/RBME/default/540\_choose\_backup.sh  
but I won't touch that because I know nothing at all about  
the RBME (Rsync Backup Made Easy) backup method.
