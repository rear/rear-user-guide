'rear -v mkbackup' runs successfully and creates the bootable iso and
the backup.tar.gz file.

But the backup.tar.gz file is not included in the final iso image.  
I had to modify the following script to include it, but haven't tried a
restore yet.

The 81\_prepare\_multiple\_iso.sh script is missing for Linux-ppc64 so
ISO\_MAX\_SIZE should not be used?

@TobiasKarnat If you add `$TMP_DIR/isofs` to the array ISO\_FILES then
you will always add the backups to the ISO image even when you do not
want to do this. Please have a look at the Linux-i386 sub-directory. You
have to do similar steps (except for the efi stuff).

@TobiasKarnat Is your question answered? Do you still need further
assistance?

Sorry about the late response. We do actually always want to add the
backup to the ISO image.  
As the system is now productive, I only have limited access and can not
test any more.

I opened this issue to inform the developer that there is a bug and for
others which might need the same workaround.

Thank you.

I don't see it as a bug, it is a missing feature nobody added (yet). You
could add it yourself like I explained before, or sponsor the code
(`BACKUP_URL=iso://backup`) to include the backup into the ISO image for
the PPC track. However, if you are happy with your hack then that is
fine for me, but we will not add it to rear master branch as the code as
it is now is doing exactly what it is written for (write an ISO rescue
image without including the backup).

Some time ago, I was thinking of kind of "feature" for ebiso, that would
just take finished tar archive and simply add it to bootable iso. But
after a while I put it "on hold" as it didn't look to have much of a
value for me...  
Do you guys think such a feature can be useful in the future?

Re-open this issue when we found a sponsor to implement this missing
feature

@schabrolles Quick question: are you dealing with this item in your
tests as well?

@gdha No ... As you said, ISO image is just a bootable image that allow
you to start a recovery, recreate the disk FS structure and start the
restoration which is stored from on a separate DISK, Network Serveur
(NFS/FTP/SSHFS etc..) or backup server like TSM etc ...

If this function is available for x86, I should have a look ...

@gdha regarding your above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/697\#issuecomment-157374405](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/697#issuecomment-157374405)

<pre>
If you add $TMP_DIR/isofs to the array ISO_FILES
then you will always add the backups to the ISO image
even when you do not want to do this.
</pre>

I think only with things like BACKUP\_URL=iso://backup  
the backup becomes stored in $TMP\_DIR/isofs/backup  
and as far as I see in  
output/ISO/Linux-i386/820\_create\_iso\_image.sh  
the whole $TMP\_DIR/isofs content gets included in the ISO  
so that I think it is the right solution to always have  
whole $TMP\_DIR/isofs content in the ISO, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1375\#issuecomment-307358395](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1375#issuecomment-307358395)

But I could be wrong - this is only how the code looks to me  
on first glance.

@jsmeix  
It is a bit more complicated as everything seems to be based on
`isolinux` (from `syslinux` package) which only exists on x86 arch.

I made a simple "prototype" which seems to work.  
I add `$TMP_DIR/isofs` in the ISO\_FILES var (only when $TMP\_DIR/isofs
exists)? But there will be a problem for Large image (splitting iso in
multiple files).

@schabrolles  
I think it is sufficient to only document it when it does not work  
with huge ISOs that would need to be splitted into multiple files.

Reason:

ReaR's internal backup methods are not meant  
as professional backup solutions and in general  
ReaR is neither meant as a backup solution  
nor as a backup management tool,  
cf. "Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Accordingly there are some limitations what  
ReaR's internal backup methods can do.

ReaR is meant to recover the basic (operating) system  
(but not to backup/restore tons of user and application data)  
and for that purpose the backup of only the files  
of the basic system should be only some GiB  
that usually can be stored within a single ISO file.  
If not, the user must use a professional backup solution.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1383](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1383)
merged  
this issuse should be fixed.

@schabrolles  
as always many thanks for all your various contributions  
and testing that improve ReaR in particular on POWER!
