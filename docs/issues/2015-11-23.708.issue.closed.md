Currently '/mnt/local' is hardcoded at many places in the code.

I think it would be better to have a global variable like

<pre>
RECOVERY_SYSTEM_ROOT="/mnt/local"
</pre>

in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

I will implement it carefully step by step.

I cannot simply replace all '/mnt/local' by '$RECOVERY\_SYSTEM\_ROOT' in
an automated way (e.g. via "sed") because I need to carefully check that
each $RECOVERY\_SYSTEM\_ROOT is correctly replaced by its value.

E.g.

<pre>
echo 'command with /mnt/local in it' >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
</pre>

currently works as intended while

<pre>
echo 'command with $RECOVERY_SYSTEM_ROOT in it' >> "$LAYOUT_CODE"
</pre>

does no longer work.

FYI:  
It appears only with leading '/' but with and without trailing '/':

<pre>
github/rear $ find * | xargs grep 'mnt/local' | wc -l
245
github/rear $ find * | xargs grep '/mnt/local' | wc -l
245
github/rear $ find * | xargs grep '/mnt/local/' | wc -l
128
github/rear $ find * | xargs grep -l '/mnt/local' | wc -l
62
</pre>

245 places isn't too hard to change manually - but those are spread over
62 files...

I think the variable name RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT is better  
than RECOVERY\_SYSTEM\_ROOT because it means  
the root of the filesystem tree of the to-be-recovered-system  
and not the root filesystem of the recovery system.

Of course
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/710](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/710)
is not yet  
the final solution - but it should be a first working step  
(at least "rear mkbackup" and "rear recover" still works for me).

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/740](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/740)
I would like to rename RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT into TARGET\_FS\_ROOT.

I felt always unhappy with the name RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT  
but somehow I had no better idea how to call what it actually is.

During
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732)
I noticed that  
the name RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT is really misleading.

I would very much appreciate it if the rear upstream authors  
would agree to rename it into TARGET\_FS\_ROOT.

In particular because when the next rear version is released  
such a rename would be much more annoying.

@jsmeix I think this can be closed, no?

What we have is TARGET\_FS\_ROOT as global readonly variable  
that is set to "/mnt/local" (in usr/sbin/rear).  
That part is done.

But:  
What we do not have is the currently 221 lines fixed in 60 scripts  
that still contain hardcoded "/mnt/local..." strings, see my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708\#issuecomment-158906275](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708#issuecomment-158906275)

But there is no bug with the current situation  
of course provided nobody changes the  
TARGET\_FS\_ROOT value in usr/sbin/rear ;-)

Accordingly I changed the milestone from Rear v1.18  
to the uspecified "Rear future".

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/775](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/775)
I replaced all hardcoded /mnt/local with $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT

When this pull request is accepted there is no longer any hardcoded
/mnt/local in the scripts (except when it is set in usr/sbin/rear and in
a few comments) and this issue here can be finally closed.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/775](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/775)
this issue should be fixed (provided I did not cause any regressions).
