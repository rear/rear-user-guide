-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): 2.4 / Git (f3157906)

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

    Log file entry:

        Broken symlink './usr/share/misc/magic' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target

    Original system:

        # readlink /usr/share/misc/magic
        ../file/magic
        # ls -ld /usr/share/file/magic
        drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Feb 13  2018 /usr/share/file/magic/

The matching code in build/default/985\_fix\_broken\_links.sh is

    pushd $ROOTFS_DIR
        ...
            link_target=$( readlink $v -e $broken_symlink )
            if test "$link_target" ; then
                ...
            else
                LogPrintError "Broken symlink '$broken_symlink' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target"
            fi

I wonder what I should do when `readlink` cannot determine the link
target?  
I think when I get no link target I cannot fix the broken symlink?

By the way:  
Had I already stated somewhere that **"I hate symlinks !"** ?  
;-)  
This "fix symlinks in the recovery system" issue wasted already so much
time...

In the above case, my `ls -ld` shows that the link target exists.
`985_fix_broken_links.sh` currently interprets all relative links
relative to *its own* current directory (which is `$ROOTFS_DIR`). It
must interpret each relative link relative to the path of its link
source on the original and target system.

You might try this:

            [...]
            link_target=$( readlink $v -e $broken_symlink )
            if [[ "$link_target" != /* ]]; then
                link_target="$broken_symlink/$link_target"
            fi
            if test "$link_target" ; then
            [...]

Actually, your `985_fix_broken_links.sh` might be more useful than you
think. More on that later.

I see, the above won't work as your `find` does a relative search. If
you'd change this to an absolute search, then do the above test, and
then strip the leading `/` everything should be fine. I could test it
this, but no earlier than late afternoon.

No rush - take your time...

On the value of copying symbolic link targets in ReaR:

It helps on Debian systems, where **custom configuration packages**
modify configuration files from distribution packages. The MIT's project
Athena has created a special framework
[config-package-dev](https://debathena.mit.edu/config-package-dev/) to
support this. After installing a configuration package, it typically
looks like this:

    $ ls -l /etc/ldap/ldap.conf*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  19 2007-08-13 17:07 /etc/ldap/ldap.conf -> ldap.conf.debathena
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 347 2007-08-15 17:58 /etc/ldap/ldap.conf.debathena
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 333 2007-08-13 17:27 /etc/ldap/ldap.conf.debathena-orig

There are sound reasons why the config-package-dev framework relies
heavily on symbolic links:

> Using a symlink here rather than a direct replacement is necessary for
> technical reasons related to how Debian unpacks files. The diversion
> system in config-package-dev has been carefully tested to support
> uninstallation, upgrades, and cleanly recovering from when you hit ^C
> in the middle of installing something (or installation fails for some
> other reason).

With respect to ReaR it means that vital configuration files (such as
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) might be relative symbolic links. It is then
much easier for the user if these just work and she doesn't need to care
about which extra files to include.

@OliverO2  
Wow!  
Impressive what you achieved "no earlier than late afternoon" ;-)
