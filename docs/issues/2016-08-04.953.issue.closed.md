Current rear GitHub master  
with latest Git commit 01f35154b35de0d4829cfe2a5502d4f839c27d45  
(i.e. with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/944)
fixed)  
on SLES12-SP2-beta5.

In the recovery system after successful "rear recover"  
"reboot" does not work:

<pre>
RESCUE g62:~ # rear -d -D recover
...
Finished recovering your system. You can explore it under '/mnt/local'.

RESCUE g62:~ # reboot
Failed to start reboot.target: Transaction contains conflicting jobs 'stop' and 'start' for reboot.service. Probably contradicting requirement dependencies configured.
Failed to talk to init daemon.
</pre>

Easy workaround:

<pre>
RESCUE g62:~ # umount -a
umount: /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)
umount: /sys/fs/cgroup: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)
umount: /run: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)
umount: /dev: target is busy
        (In some cases useful info about processes that
         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)
umount: /: not mounted

RESCUE g62:~ # reboot -f
Rebooting.
</pre>

I guess something related to systemd needs to be enhanced  
in the rear recovery system to match newest fancy systemd stuff.

Because there is an easy workaround there is no time pressure  
to get this done for Rear version 1.19 and therefore I set  
the milestone to "Rear future".

Happens also on SLES12-SP2-RC1

Hi,

Identical problem in Fedora FC24, was OK in FC23 & 22.

Cheers,  
GM.

@GreasyMonkee  
thanks for your posting because it shows that this issue is not  
because of SUSE-specific fancy systemd changes but  
likely a generic isssue with newer systemd versions.

@gdha  
I added you as assignee here mainly FYI.

@GreasyMonkee @jsmeix Just did a test with a fresh Fedora24 without any
recover issues. Reboot went fine without any systemd error as well.
Sorry - cannot reproduce your issue.

**CORRECTION**: I do see it - it helps when you reboot the correct
window  
Typing `systemctl --force reboot` does work!

@gdha  
no need to be sorry when it works for you!

I guess that it sometimes works and sometimes fails  
is because with systemd booting and shutdown does  
no longer happen in a basically hardcoded way  
(as it was with SysVinit).  
In particular systemd has no longer basically hardcoded  
dependencies.

The following is a nice workaround for me  
in the rear recovery system:

<pre>
RESCUE g136:~ # alias reboot='umount -a ; sleep 10 ; reboot -f'
RESCUE g136:~ # type -a reboot
reboot is aliased to `umount -a ; sleep 10 ; reboot -f'
reboot is /bin/reboot
RESCUE g136:~ # reboot
...
Rebooting.
</pre>

FYI:

On my SLES12-SP2-RC2 system:

<pre>
g136:~ # type -a reboot
reboot is /sbin/reboot
g136:~ # ls -l /sbin/reboot
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root ... /sbin/reboot -> /usr/bin/systemctl
g136:~ # ls -l /usr/bin/systemctl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 692208 ... /usr/bin/systemctl
# rpm -qf /usr/bin/systemctl
systemd-228-114.4.x86_64
</pre>

In the rear recovery system that was generated  
on that SLES12-SP2-RC2 system by "rear mkbackup":

<pre>
RESCUE g136:~ # type -a reboot
reboot is /bin/reboot
RESCUE g136:~ # type -a systemctl
systemctl is /bin/systemctl
RESCUE g136:~ # ls -li /bin/systemctl
6638 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 692208 Aug 26 20:33 /bin/systemctl
RESCUE g136:~ # ls -li /bin/reboot   
6529 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 692208 Aug 26 20:33 /bin/reboot
RESCUE g136:~ # diff -s /bin/reboot /bin/systemctl
Files /bin/reboot and /bin/systemctl are identical
</pre>

By the way:  
We could save 692208 bytes in the rear recovery system  
by linking those indentical files.

@jsmeix perhaps we could replace the `/bin/reboot` with a script
containing `systemctl --force reboot` when systemd is in place?

@gdha before doing such a hardcoded behavioural change  
of how "reboot" normally works, I would wait some more time  
until hopefully more information could be provided  
why "reboot" sometimes fails with

<pre>
Failed to start reboot.target: Transaction contains conflicting
jobs 'stop' and 'start' for reboot.service. Probably contradicting
requirement dependencies configured.
Failed to talk to init daemon.
</pre>

so that we hopefully could solve the actual root cause.  
I think in the meantime using the workaround

<pre>
# umount -a ; reboot -f
</pre>

is self-evident and easy to do.

Stupid me!  
I noticed right now that both the SLES12-SP2  
/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-reboot.service  
and the rear  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/reboot.service  
contain

<pre>
ExecStart=...systemctl --force reboot
</pre>

i.e. the default behaviour is already an enforced reboot.

Plain "reboot" works for me on SLE12-SP2 when I remove  
in /usr/lib/systemd/system/reboot.service  
the whole "\[Unit\]" section so that it only is

<pre>
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --force reboot
</pre>

But I think there is a reason for the "\[Unit\]" section

<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Reboot
DefaultDependencies=no
Requires=shutdown.target umount.target final.target
After=shutdown.target umount.target final.target
</pre>

but I am not at all a sufficient systemd expert  
to know the reasons behind.

But e.g. "shutdown" also does not work for me on SLE12-SP2:

<pre>
RESCUE g136:~ # shutdown
Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
RESCUE g136:~ # shutdown -r now
Failed to start reboot.target: Transaction contains conflicting
jobs 'stop' and 'start' for reboot.target. Probably contradicting
requirement dependencies configured.
Failed to talk to init daemon.
RESCUE g136:~ # shutdown -P now
Failed to start poweroff.target: Transaction contains conflicting
jobs 'stop' and 'start' for shutdown.target. Probably contradicting
requirement dependencies configured.
Failed to talk to init daemon.
</pre>

From my current point of view I like most

<pre>
# umount -a ; reboot -f
</pre>

One of our (i.e. SUSE's) systemd maintainers told me  
that the root cause is probably that dbus is not usable  
in the rear recovery system and that with  
"systemctl --force reboot/poweroff/halt" no dbus is used  
so that it works this way.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2016-09-26 12:20](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/953#issuecomment-249554524):

I do not want to fiddle about dbus so that  
I start to like the idea to replace in the rear recovery system  
/bin/reboot /bin/halt /bin/poweroff /bin/shutdown  
by scripts that basically do

<pre>
umount -a
systemctl --force reboot
</pre>

<pre>
umount -a
systemctl --force halt
</pre>

<pre>
umount -a
systemctl --force poweroff
</pre>

For /bin/shutdown there is no "systemctl --force shutdown"  
so that probably a more elaborated script is need  
that calls by default /bin/poweroff but when  
'-r --reboot' is specified it calls /bin/reboot and when  
'-H --halt' is specified it calls /bin/halt.

a first attempt

and more fail-safe.

@GreasyMonkee  
could you test my new  
63\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh  
script whether or not it also makes it work for you?

To add it to your currently installed rear, download it from  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsmeix/rear/simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown\_issue953/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/63\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsmeix/rear/simplify_systemd_reboot_halt_poweroff_shutdown_issue953/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/63_simplify_systemd_reboot_halt_poweroff_shutdown.sh)

Then install it as  
/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/63\_simplify\_systemd\_reboot\_halt\_poweroff\_shutdown.sh

Then run "rear mkbackup" or "rear mkrescue", boot the new  
created rear recovery system and try out if in the rear recovery  
system reboot halt poweroff shutdown also "just work" for you  
(preferably after a "rear recover" when things are mounted).

Hi, I am not able to test it as I am overseas for the next month, will
be  
late October at earliest before I have access to my server.

Sorry that I cannot assist at this time, but shall test on my return.

Cheers,  
GM.
