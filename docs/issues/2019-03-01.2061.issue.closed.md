@dcz01 just an idea, but maybe you should exclude */etc/adsm/TSM.PWD*
from ReaR recovery system (`COPY_AS_IS_EXCLUDE_TSM`). I'm guessing that
presence of this file is causing this behavior.

@gozora Thanks for the fast answer.  
But would ReaR ask me the first time booting and executing the automatic
recover for the TSM user ID and password?

Yes I guess so, since *TSM.PWD* is holding cached login credentials ...

@gozora Ah well, then i'll test it.  
But i use an newer TSM client and there isn't a TSM.PWD anymore.  
Now there are many password and certification files stored in /etc/adsm,
so i must exclude the whole folder.

You should identify exactly file holding cached password, missing
certificates might be fatal ...

@gozora Yes, thats true. Missing certificates can lead to failing
connections because TSM is encrypting by default the traffic between
server and client at level 8.1.0.0.  
Then it's not simply to do so.

you - hope you don't mind?

But it isn't possible to exclude only the password file(s) because there
is an subfolder which contains the certificates for SSL/TLS.

If I understand it correctly than it should be enough to exclude
*TSM.IDX, TSM.KDB and TSM.sth*, to avoid storing cached passwords in
ReaR recovery system.

@gozora Yes, thats true. But now i show you the next issue if you do
so.  
The restore process hangs because all the output is redirected to an log
file and you can't enter the encryption key of some/the files which are
encrypted in TSM.

@dcz01

I'm guessing this redirection comes from
[389\_check\_TSM\_connection.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/389_check_TSM_connection.sh).
Unfortunately I can't do much about it because I'm very limited in my
TSM knowledge. Maybe @schabrolles can do something about it if he has
some spare time ...

There is however a way how you could deal with this, and it might even
be perfect solution to your problem. Some time ago, @jsmeix wrote
functionality that can download auxiliary files using `curl` during
`rear recover` (init) stage.  
In general you need to set *RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL* variable with
location pointing to tar ball containing files you want to download and
extract during `rear recover`. In your case, TSM login credentials could
be packed in that tar ball, and you could update this tar ball every
time your TSM password is changed without need to re-run
`rear mkbackup`.  
For more details check
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L290)

@gozora Your solution sounds very good, but this won't be possible.  
At first this must be done every 30 days when the password at the TSM
server expires and the client generates a new one and second how should
i do this when the server has crashed?

@dcz01  
I am not a TSM user (I have no proprietary third-party backup software
at all)  
but as far as I understand it what you need is that the TSM restore
programs  
work interactively so that you get a password dialog from TSM.  
Is it what you need or do I misunderstand something?

@dcz01  
you should have a look at  
usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
therein in particular things like `0<&6 1>&7 2>&8`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2019-03-04 11:05](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2061#issuecomment-469212978):

@dcz01  
right now I noticed in the comments in  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/389\_check\_TSM\_connection.sh  
that you had been already involved in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1534\#issuecomment-351067465](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1534#issuecomment-351067465)  
where to me as a non-TSM user is looked as if in  
usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/389\_check\_TSM\_connection.sh

    dsmc query session 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8

would be `enough for the prompt of the general TSM password`  
cf. the comment there to that after that `dsmc query session`  
the TSM password is known so that later in  
usr/share/rear/restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
things would work without one more TSM password dialog  
so that during `dsmc restore` we can redirect both stdout and stderr  
into the backup restore log file?

@jsmeix @schabrolles Yes, that is right.  
The only thing i would like to have or it would also be good for all TSM
users here, is that ReaR regardless in which mode it was bootet (manual
or automatic restore), if the TSM password is not valid that i can enter
it manually.  
This actual works only in the manual restore mode when booting/booted
like shown in my picture.
