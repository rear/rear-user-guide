-   How was this pull request tested?

I created a new ISO file on a laptop that had multiple interfaces and
the issue was resolved by this diff.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The DHCP client during recovery does not iterate correctly over all
network interfaces that are found. It incorrectly takes the first found
interface time and again. If the interface that is intended for recovery
is not the first one then the automatic recovery will fail. The user can
only work around the situation by running "dhclient" manually on the
correct interface.

@Signum  
thank you for finding the bug and for your fix!

@gdha  
I need your review here because I do not understand  
how the variable `DEVICE` is meant to be used.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
we use upper case variable names for global variables  
i.e. for variables that are used in more than a single script  
but in the scripts in skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/  
and in usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/  
the variable `DEVICE` is only used in 58-start-dhclient.sh

Now I wonder if the variable `DEVICE` is perhaps in some  
non-obvious way a global (config?) variable or if the variable  
`DEVICE` is really only used locally in 58-start-dhclient.sh.

In the latter case that variable name should be in lower case  
and according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
"For example `dev` is basically meaningless because  
there are so many different kind of device-like thingies"  
its meaningless name should be replaced by a meaningful name  
for example something like

<pre>
local network_interface
for network_interface in $( get_device_by_hwaddr ) ; do
</pre>

(I also replaced the backticks for better readability)  
because - strictly speaking - there are no network devices  
(there are no device nodes like /dev/eth0 for networking hardware  
instead the kernel has network interfaces for networking hardware plus  
non-hardware network interfaces like `lo` for the 'loopback `device`' -
argh!)  
cf. the 'DESCRIPTION' in the traditional `man ifconfig` but even there  
they also talk about devices - who cares - exact names do not matter,  
everybody "just knows" what `dev` is - and DevOps are Device Operators  
of course ;-)

@gdha  
if you have currently no time for a review,  
I would like to merge it "as is" tomorrow.

@Signum  
thank you for fixing that non-standard use case for ReaR!
