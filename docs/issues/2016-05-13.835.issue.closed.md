\[root@xjlappm1d init.d\]\# rear -V  
Relax-and-Recover 1.17.1 / Git

\[root@xjlappm1d init.d\]\# cat /etc/redhat-release  
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.7 (Santiago)

We're trying to use rear as a migration tool. The network files on the
recovery image need to be modified to work on the new subnet. Is there a
command line tool or process that lets you change the network files to
support the new network?

I was searching the documentation but could not find anything.

Thanks,  
John

Thank you that works!  
Does rear work with bonded networks?

@John-Leone yes it understands it to recreate these on a new system,
however, when booted from the rescue image there is no guarantee it
works (it might just be one interface).
