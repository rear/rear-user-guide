This is a follow-up of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1545)

Current ReaR master code:

Summary:  
When I do a backup on the ISO via "rear mkbackup"  
then recovery via "rear recover" works.  
But "rear mkrescue" with

<pre>
BACKUP_URL="iso:///mybackup"
</pre>

is useless and even dangerous because such an ISO can  
never work later for "rear recover" because a non-working  
backup URL is stored in that recovery system.

Doing "rear recover" with such a "rear mkrescue" ISO fails with

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear -d -D recover
...
ERROR: Backup archive 'backup.tar.gz' not found.
Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-e205.log for details
</pre>

In case of "rear mkrescue" there is no backup in the ISO  
so that such an ISO is useless because it can never work  
unless the backup is actually in the ISO.

Therefore backup in the ISO via something like

<pre>
BACKUP_URL="iso:///mybackup"
</pre>

conflicts with "rear mkrescue" so that the mkrescue workflow  
must be forbidden when the backup is configured to be in the ISO.
