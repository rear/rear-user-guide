-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal** /

-   

On some systems (for example centos6 and/or ubuntu) REAR backup with
Backup type SESAM  
fails during verify of the rootfs due to missing libraries:

    /opt/sesam/bin/sesam/Crypto.Hash._SHA256.so requires additional libraries (fatal error)
    libpython2.7.so.1.0 => not found
    /opt/sesam/bin/sesam/cPickle.so requires additional libraries (fatal error)
    libpython2.7.so.1.0 => not found
    ERROR: ReaR recovery system in '/tmp/rear.LyKD3Rt2V4XgYs2/rootfs' not usable

these libraries are part of the Sesam client integration itself but
unfortunately are not found  
due to the sesam installation directory not beeing part of
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH.

For TSM an alike issue has already been fixed as TSM sets the
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:

    ./usr/share/rear/prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh:# Find gsk lib diriectory and add it to the TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ./usr/share/rear/prep/TSM/default/400_prep_tsm.sh:      TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TSM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$gsk_dir

This patch does the same for the sesam client, installation directory is
used from the  
configuration file and not hardcoded.
