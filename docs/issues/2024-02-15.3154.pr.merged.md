-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Create an empty  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/.vimrc  
and delete the now false (directory no longer empty)  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/root/.gitignore  
because (as far as I vaguely remember)  
we have such .gitignore files so that we can  
have empty directories in git as described e.g. in  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-do-i-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-do-i-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository)

In build/GNU/Linux/130\_create\_dotfiles.sh  
dynamically generate .bash\_history entries  
depending on whether or not 'nano' and 'vi' are available,
