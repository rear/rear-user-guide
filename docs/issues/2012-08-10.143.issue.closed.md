Saving via nfs:// should probably append the creation date-time
associated with the hostname, otherwise a subsequent mkbackup will
overwrite the previous one. We export NFS dirs with root\_squash, so
it's not possible for root on the remote to create a dated subdirectory
via its autofs paths in which to save to latest mkbackup. I seem to
recall that this is done for USB-based mkbackups.

eg: local.conf:

BACKUP\_URL=nfs://host/xfs/backup/rear

mkbackup will create t/xfs/backup/rear/host-fqdn

containing that host's ISO and tarbball

Preferably, ReaR should create the mkbackup in
/xfs/backup/rear/host-fqdn/date or /xfs/backup/rear/host-fqdn-date

Personally I agree.

The reason this was not done for the NFS use-case was that we did not
want to break Relax-and-Recover for existing users, and because there is
not retention-plan for the NFS use-case implemented. It is not
impossible to do this, at some point in the future but we have to be
very careful if we do this. And there needs to be consensus which there
wasn't when we implemented the USB use-case.

Interesting, i'd sure like to hear the case against dated NFS retention,
but let me guess:

I can work around it, but ...

Is there a procedure for getting a vote (or some alternate rationale) on
this?

cheers

No procedure (yet). But maybe we should list all the possible options we
have together with the consequences, and do a vote.

Variable set in local.conf: APPEND\_DATE?

@cal-s with rear it is now possible to make incremental and full
backups:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://lnx01/vol/lnx01/linux_images_dr/rear
    # NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY may not be used in combination with BACKUP_TYPE=incremental!!!!
    #NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=y
    BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
    FULLBACKUPDAY="Mon"

It uses dates in its filenames. I guess this is more or less a solution
to your problem?

I'm testing with rear 1.16 and have not had any luck with incrementals.
I'm using the config gdha recommends immediately above this post. I've
run "rear mkbackuponly" three times in a row, modifying a few files in
between so I can check to see if only the incremental changes get picked
up. What appears to happen instead, is rear creates what appears to be a
full backup each time:

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2016177806 Jun 4 12:49
2014-06-04-1243-F.tar.gz  
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2014242030 Jun 4 12:59
2014-06-04-1253-I.tar.gz  
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2015048301 Jun 4 13:11 2014-06-04-1305-I.tar.gz

When I run the rear recover process, the first saved file is what gets
restored, (2014-06-04-1243-F.tar.gz). Should I be prompted during the
recovery process so that I can tell rear which bkup/incremental I want
applied? Thanks for your help - great program, I've just got to figure
incrementals out.

no time to work on this - sorry
