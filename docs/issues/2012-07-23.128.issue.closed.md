/USR/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/14\_include\_swap\_code.sh sets the mkswap
command as "mkswap -U" . However, this fails for RHEL/CentOS5, whose
mkswap command doesn't accept "-U" as an argument

Yes, I can confirm that on RHEL5/CentOS-5 `blkid` provides UUID
information, but that `mkswap` cannot create swap partitions with a
specific UID.

The solution here is to check the `mkswap` version using our features
framework and based on the version add the `-U` option where possible.
Only during broad distribution tests we can be sure this implementation
suffices.

-   RHEL6: mkswap (util-linux-ng 2.17.2) *does have -U*
-   RHEL5: mkswap (util-linux 2.13-pre7) *does not have -U*
-   RHEL4: mkswap from util-linux-2.12a *does not have -U*

According to the util-linux changelog
([http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.14/v2.14-rc1-ChangeLog](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.14/v2.14-rc1-ChangeLog))
this was added since v2.14-rc1 (or probably better to use versions newer
than 2.13.1.1).

Please test and reopen ticket if issue still exists.
