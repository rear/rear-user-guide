The UserInput return code is now simply 0 or 1:

The UserInput return code is the return code of  
the 'read' bash builtin that is called to get user input.

When the UserInput function is called with right syntax  
its return code is 0 for any actual user input and  
in case of any (non empty) automated user input.

The return code is 1 when the 'read' call timed out  
(i.e. when there was no actual user input)  
so that one can distinguish between an explicitly  
provided user input and no actual user input  
even if the explicitly provided user input is the same  
as the default so that it makes a difference  
whether or not the user explicitly chose and confirmed  
that the default is what he actually wants  
or if he let things "just happen" inattentively via timeout  
where it is important to have a big timeout  
so that an attentive user will actively provide user input  
to proceed even if it is same as the default.

Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449\#issuecomment-324401086](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1449#issuecomment-324401086)

The UserInput function logged already  
whether or not its 'read' call timed out  
but its various return codes were oversophisticated.

Now the UserInput function return code has a simple meaning:  
0 means "real input" while 1 means "fallback/default".

Now in caller scipts code like

<pre>
if input="$( UserInput ... )" ; then
    LogPrint "Got $input"
else
    LogPrint "Using default $input"
fi
</pre>

can be used if different behaviour is intended depending  
on "real input" versus fallback/default behaviour.

@schlomo  
I have the "Avoid stderr ..." comments explicitly because of your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395\#issuecomment-311678896](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395#issuecomment-311678896)  
to show why in this case ReaR does rightfully destroy information  
(here misleading information about possibly wrong bash coding).

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1395)  
I planned to clean up all '&gt;/dev/null' usage in ReaR  
(in particular both '1&gt;/dev/null' and '2&gt;/dev/null')  
but until I have done this (which needs some time)  
I need comments where a '&gt;/dev/null' usage  
is really right in ReaR.
