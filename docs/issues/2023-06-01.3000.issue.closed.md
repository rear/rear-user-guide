ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
Relax-and-Recover 2.6

OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
/etc/rear/os.conf"):  
"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4"

It got error when I try to restore the LPAR by command "rear -D -d
restore " .

Error message:

"restore" means restoring files from backup, not the full recovery of
the machine (including recreation of storage layout). If you want the
latter, use `rear recover`. If you really want to only restore the files
from backup, use `rear restoreonly`.

I have never used the latter though, so I don't know how exactly it is
used.

The primary intent of "restoreonly" is to restore  
several backups (together with "recover"), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc)

But "restoreonly" could be also used for other use cases  
provided the user understands the prerequirements  
so that "restoreonly" can succeed.  
For example  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2553\#issuecomment-785069808](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2553#issuecomment-785069808)  
shows a specific use case how "restoreonly" is used  
(together with "mountonly") to only restore the backup  
to recover from a so called "soft error".

@ChickenTim99

only FYI to be on the safe side because you use SLES12:

By default SUSE uses a rather sophisticated btrfs structure  
that accordingly requires matching special setup in ReaR.

See the SLES12 documentation  
[https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP4/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html](https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP4/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html)  
therein in particular the parts about  
"Limitations with Btrfs" and  
"Your SLE12 System Needs Matching ReaR Configuration"  
i.e. use when you use SUSE's btrfs structure use  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf  
as template.

In general see  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein in particular the sections  
"Disaster recovery with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)" and  
"SUSE support for Relax-and-Recover"
