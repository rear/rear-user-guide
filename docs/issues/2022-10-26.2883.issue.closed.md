-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    `rear format -- --efi` \# (same for all variations of rear format on
    a system booted with efi)  
    `rear mkrescue` fails due to grub-install failing.  
    the executed grub-install command from
    `/usr/share/rear/output/USB/Linux-i386/300_create_grub.sh` is:  
    `grub-install --boot-directory=/test --recheck /dev/sdc`  
    the error from grub-install is:

<!-- -->

      Installing for x86_64-efi platform.
      grub-install: error: cannot find EFI directory.

-   first analysis:  
    this is due to actually multiple issues with the grub install.

1.  target not set explicitly..  
    the issue is that grub-install defaults to `--target x86_64-efi` if
    the system is booted with efi. So you will not be able to install a
    legacy-bios (or 32bit) grub without setting the `--target`
    parameter. the documentation tells us `default=i386-pc` which is not
    exactly correct - this is more like a fallback default. So setting
    the target in the command should fix this one.

2.  in case of a hybrid bootable device (uefi and legacy-bios)  
    a) both grub packages (grub-efi-amd64-bin and grub-pc-bin) need to
    be installed. there is no check for that  
    b) grub-install must be called for each case individually with
    correct parameters

-3) for a efi install depending on your grub version it may be neccecary
to set more parameters-  
-a) `cannot find EFI directory.` so the `--efi-directory` may need to
get set similar to the `--boot-directory`-  
-b) the efi partition needs to be mounted at the `--efi-directory` path
wich may need to be `efi` or `EFI` directory within the boot path.-

-   What is actually working:  
    looks like grub in output usb mode is only working on a legacy-boot
    system and only for --bios.  
    looks like the newer grub version is more strict about those things
    and the parameters.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    do things manually or use another bootloader

since this is quite its own chapter i did not mix it with the older
ticket \#2648

to my current understanding `100_create_efiboot.sh` handles uefi
installations no matter if grub or non grub. it handles grub in a bit
strange manual way but should be fine. while the file
`300_create_grub.sh` only handles grub legacy boot - which may be used
in addition to uefi grub but this is not always the case.  
so point 3 of my first analysis is not correct since this is handled
differently. and point 2 is only partially true due to this file split

this patch solves the main issue for me. creating a usb backup device on
a system booted with efi and format options (both, efi and bios). This
however does not fix the efi only case - see todo 1 and is not well
suted for all target variants see todo 2.

there are however two TODOs left for which I am not sure what would be
the correct way to implement those in rear.  
open todos:

-   only call grub-install if legacy boot install is requested. maybe
    introduce something like USING\_BIOS\_BOOTLOADER or provide the
    format variable.
-   set the target as correct as possible. maybe use a switch case based
    on the target and possibly other info? or make this a config option?

@DEvil0000  
many thanks for your continuous analysis of  
ReaR recovery system UEFI booting issues!

For me with my single simple use case test  
BIOS and UEFI (without Secure Boot) booting  
the ReaR recovery system on a USB disk worked  
with openSUSE Leap 15.3, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829)  
and it also worked with RHEL 8, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829\#issuecomment-1165570472](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2829#issuecomment-1165570472)

Next week I will not have time for ReaR  
but the week after the next week I have (hopefully)  
time for ReaR to have a closer look at this issue.

But I am not a Ubuntu user so when things are  
different on Ubuntu there is not much what I can do  
in practice (I won't find time to install Ubuntu  
and try out how things behave there).

@DEvil0000  
WOW!  
Thank you for your proposed patch!  
It helps so much to see where things go wrong and how.

This issue may be introduced by a newer grub version used in ubuntu or
some other ubuntu specific thing. Looks like at least for some cases
setting the target (and efi\_directory in case efi install would be done
with the command - which is not currently) is a must now.  
Thank you for your work on this project ;)
