This means that files have been modified during the archiving  
process. As a result the backup may not be completely consistent  
or may not be a perfect copy of the system. Relax-and-Recover  
will continue, however it is highly advisable to verify the  
backup in order to be sure to safely recover this system.

Can `TMPDIR=/bigdisk` help?

The working directoy is created by this code in usr/sbin/rear

<pre>
    # Create temporary work area and register removal exit task:
    BUILD_DIR="$( mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX || Error ...
    ....
    Log "Using build area '$BUILD_DIR'"
</pre>

and "man mktemp" reads

<pre>
-t  interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component,
    relative to a directory: $TMPDIR, if set; else the directory
    specified via -p; else /tmp
</pre>

On my systems (SLES11 and SLES12) that just works:

<pre>
# mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
/tmp/rear.m0IKWVnqgMiOIu8
# TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
/var/tmp/rear.Bt146eGtAX53tB9
</pre>

But that way it does not work for rear:

<pre>
export TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ ; rear -d -D mkrescue
</pre>

because in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf there is

<pre>
# the TMPDIR influences the mktemp command to define an alternative basedir instead of /tmp
# useful in case he /tmp is not large enough to contain ISO images and/or backup archives
# be careful the directory MUST exist otherwise you will get an error by mktemp
TMPDIR=""
export TMPDIR    # the export is required so that mktemp can pickup the variable
</pre>

Bottom line:  
For rear the solution is to read default.conf and act accordingly  
as described in "man rear" ;-)

The current behaviour that default.conf sets TMPDIR to empty value  
looks like a bug to me:

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/969](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/969)
merged  
rear should behave in compliance with Unix standards.

For example

<pre>
TMPDIR="/var/tmp" rear -d -D mkrescue
</pre>

is now using build area '/var/tmp/rear...'.

FYI:  
In general regarding how to test the currently  
newest rear GitHub master code:  
Basically "git clone" it into a directory and  
then run rear from within that directory.

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git
# cd rear
# vi etc/rear/local.conf
# usr/sbin/rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>
