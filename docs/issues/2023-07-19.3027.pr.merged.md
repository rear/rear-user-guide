##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): N/A

-   How was this pull request tested?

Using an automated reproducer implemented using *systemtap*

1.  Create a file in `/dev` which will be embedded in the rescue
    environment

        # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/shrinking bs=10K count=3
        3+0 records in
        3+0 records out
        30720 bytes (31 kB, 30 KiB) copied, 0.000689566 s, 44.5 MB/s

2.  Execute the systemtap script in charge of shrinking the file while
    being copied

        # stap -v -g ./shrinking.stp
        [...]
        Pass 5: starting run.

3.  Execute `rear mkrescue` from another terminal

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

The files copied as-is in the rescue are copied using a
`tar -c | tar -x` command.  
It may happen that inodes are shrinking during the copy (e.g.
`/dev/mqueue/nnsc` (HPE device)), which can cause the `tar -x` command
to stop extracting the next files, due to the padding zeros inserted in
the shrank inode.  
This leads to an error when checking the integrity of the rescue
environment.

The solution is to add `-i` option when extracting, to continue the
processing.

Without the fix:

    ERROR: ReaR recovery system in '/var/tmp/rear.tpfZyNy6ayS53wP/rootfs' not usable (required libraries are missing)
    Some latest log messages since the last called script 990_verify_rootfs.sh:

The reason is everything after `/dev/shrinking` is not copied, because
`tar -x` stopped silently (without error, believing the end of the
archive was reached):

@rmetrich Hi - is this related to Message Queue brokers? Could you say
something about the background of this issue? I also saw from time to
time that `dd` seems to hang, but this could be the same issue as I saw
it on kubernetes nodes with RabbitMQ pods...

Yes this was seen with `/dev/mqueue/nnsc` device node, something shipped
by HPE apparently. One of my customer constantly hits the issue when
building the ISO.

Is `/dev/mqueue/nnsc` really a device node, or a regular file? I think
the content of device special files should not be copied - only the
inode (metadata) ...

It seems to be a regular file:

    /dev/mqueue:
    total 0
    drwxrwxrwt.  2 0 0   60 Jun 17 20:04 .
    drwxr-xr-x. 23 0 0 5740 Jun 18 19:30 ..
    ---x--x--T.  1 0 0   80 Jun 21 13:30 nnsc

But none of this really matters, all we must take care of is archives
with zero padding can be extracted properly.

I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are objections

Only for the log (for completeness):

I will never fully understand how 'tar' works.  
Neither the old GNU tar version 1.15.1 man page (see above)  
nor the newer GNU tar version 1.34 man page (in openSUSE Leap 15.4)

    -i, --ignore-zeros
    Ignore zeroed blocks in archive.
    Normally two consecutive 512-blocks filled with zeroes mean EOF
    and tar stops reading after encountering them.
    This option instructs it to read further and
    is useful when reading archives created with the -A option.

explain why "blocks filled with zeroes mean EOF" in 'tar'.  
At least for me this is unexpected behaviour of a program  
when reading a sequence of zero bytes means EOF  
so "sequence of zero bytes" == "end of file" ?

It's probably not useful, as most of the devices in `/dev` are (knowing
that all is supposed to be generated, on RHEL at least).

Related to this pull request  
but not actually belonging to this pull request:

We copy by default all in /dev/ into the recovery system

    # find /dev | wc -l
    732

    # usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
    ...

    # find /var/tmp/rear.nSzlPYGQ1Nk9v9w/rootfs/dev | wc -l
    728

because of

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /dev ...

in usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf\#L231](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf#L231)  
which is there since the beginning according to

    # git log --follow -p usr/share/rear/conf/GNU/Linux.conf

I made a separated issue

@rmetrich  
thank you for your problem analysis and your fix!

It is much appreciated to get ReaR working  
more fail-safe even in corner cases like this one.
