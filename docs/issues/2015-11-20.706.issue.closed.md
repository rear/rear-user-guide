At the end of "rear recover"  
the log file /var/log/rear/  
and other recovery related data  
like /var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
and its matching /var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh  
exist only in the rear recovery system.

When the rear recovery system is shut down  
the "rear recover" related data is lost.

I like to implement that "rear recover" by default copies  
the recovery related log and data into the recovered system  
so that this data is later available for example for a detailled  
analsysis of the recovery.

To keep the recovery related log and data strictly separated from  
the other rear logs and data I like to use a separated directory  
var/log/rear/recover for this.

In short:  
I like to implemet that at the end of "rear recover"  
basically the following is done:

<pre>
mkdir -p /mnt/local/var/log/rear/recover
cp -p /var/log/rear/rear*.log /mnt/local/var/log/rear/recover
mkdir /mnt/local/var/log/rear/recover/layout
cp -pr /var/lib/rear/layout/*  /mnt/local/var/log/rear/recover/layout
</pre>

I did a "rear --debugscripts xv recover" and the above  
commands manually and /mnt/local/var/log/rear/recover  
needs 1.1 MB disk space and with plain "rear recover"  
/mnt/local/var/log/rear/recover needs needs 80 kB for me.

I do not think this "wastes disk space" and therefore  
I think it can (and should) be done by default.

If there is so little free disk space that about 2 MB  
for 'rear recover' with 'set -xv' and about 100 kB  
for plain 'rear recover' makes a noticeable difference,  
then that only points out the real problem  
("too little free disk space").

@jsmeix I have no objection against it.  
Perhaps we could in the meantime also tackle issue \#21 ?

I will implement this one together with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/21](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/21)

Why not copy it to `/root` in the recovered system - similar to how Red
Hat's Kickstart leaves there the kickstart file and log?

In any case, I would make sure that only root can read those files.

I already implemented that only root can access files  
in /var/log/rear/recover

But I wonder why everybody can read the other files  
in /var/log/rear and /var/lib/rear ?

In other words:  
I wonder why it seems what "rear mkbackup" results is o.k. to be read by
any user while what "rear recover" results is not?

@jsmeix @schlomo Personally, I don't think a log file is a security
threat if it is readable. We only have to make sure there are no
passwords or any other sensitive data visible. And, I believe we already
have done that in the past (\#560)
