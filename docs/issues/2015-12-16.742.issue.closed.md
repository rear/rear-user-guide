Would it possible to create a test suite for rear?  
Or even rear already include it, but I did not find them.

YES, we all want this.

So far we have `make validate` and @aussendorf built something for their
Bareos product.

@aussendorf I am trying to thing how to test ReaR. Any suggestions or
examples?

I guess that it would be awesome to have it and test at least basic
functionality.

@dagwieers and I have had a plan for this for a few years already, but
we never got around to actually doing it. Dag already has a server for
it.

I'm running a DR test every week automatically as an Ansible playbook.
Building on that, our plan was to:

-   create a master ReaR image that has all the necessary tooling
-   boot it
-   upload and run a script that creates the test layout
-   select a distribution tar and extract it over the layout
-   boot the newly created system
-   install the ReaR version under test
-   make a ReaR image
-   recover the system

Thoughts?

Furthermore I was also thinking about a rear test workflow to run unit
tests, but given that tools on different distributions have a different
output, you would end up in mocking hell. I think there is more value in
end-to-end tests.

Hello,  
I've integrated a ReaR test into our overall Bareos CI tests. We have VM
(xen) templates for every distribution we support. Whenever we build new
Bareos packages, we automatically clone those VMs, and install,
configure, run backup/restore, install debug-packages, create
traceback-files, de-install, and some other stuff.

For ReaR I've included a fully automated test in our framework that:

-   creates a rear image (iso)
-   takes that iso as boot-image for vm (via xen api)
-   boots ReaR system (to do this I needed the patch, to configure the
    default option in isolinux.cfg)
-   connect by ssh and run "rear recover"
-   remove iso
-   reboot
-   do some sanity checks.

Everything controlled using jenkins.

The scripts are integrated into a broader scripting system so it does
not make much sense to post them partially.

Ok, @jhoekx and me sat together today to look into automated testing and
we did 2 things today.

-   We integrated the 'make validate' step as part of a TravisCI hook,
    so that commits automatically get syntax checked by Bash.
-   We started a separate project, named 'rear-test' (lacking a better
    name) with the goal to have automated backup and restore tests using
    different methods.

This last part is unfinished yet, it currently only includes a single
Ansible playbook to create a CentOS 7 image. The ultimate goal is to
include Ansible playbooks that use prior generated images to set up
infrastructure (if needed) and perform the backup and restore tests on
pre-made configuration files.

We intend to have OS-independent playbooks for testing, so that they can
be used for different Linux distributions. Since each backup and restore
method test only needs a specific Rear configuration, it should be
straightforward to reuse this for different OS images. So we do intend
to have SLES, Ubuntu, Arch and whatever interests users to contribute.
However our aim now is to ensure we have the proper framework set up
first.

Once we have these tests implemented, I expect some opportunities to
improve Rear for automated testing so it becomes easier to find specific
error-conditions (that may or may not be fatal to Rear). Because it is
essential that we can find issues in an automated way.

@dagwieers & @jhoekx thank you so much! This is really great news.

I have only one suggestion: Maybe we should rename the repo to
`rear-integration-tests` or something else that is a bit more
self-explanatory? I am only worried that people would think at their
first glance that this is just some test and not for real. Or that it
contains the bleeding edge test stuff...

Ok, renamed to `rear-integration-tests`.

Issue \#38 was the original request (we can close that one) and we
better use this issue for further discussions etc.

@rear/owners set the milestone to **Rear future** as that describes it
much better - it is something that might be available in the future
(perhaps sponsored?)

We have
[https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing)
in place to test daily ReaR builds (we do this on request for customers
- yes those who pay for it)

The "Relax-and-Recover Automated Test" project already proofed it works
sufficient to test new versions of ReaR. More enhancements are needed,
but as mentioned before we will only implement new features when these
are sponsored. With this I think we can close this topic.
