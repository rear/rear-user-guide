Hi,  
at the moment rear only runs "rear mkrescue" if the disklayout has
changed. This could lead  
to problems after some kernel updates, so that the recreated initrd
would no longer fit to  
a recoverd kernel. Please implement a mechanism that takes changes in
initrd configs into account.

Thanks  
Best regards  
Tim

Rear itself does not run `rear mkrescue` upon changes, however there is
a cron-job you can schedule for doing exactly this. Depending on the
return code of the `rear checklayout` command you can learn of something
is different (and possibly requires a new initrd). But this check does
more than just check the layout.

If you look at
*usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/51\_compare\_files.sh* you can
see that it checks all files/paths in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES for changes,
and by default (according to *usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf*) this
happens for:

    CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( '/etc/drbd/' '/etc/drbd.conf' '/etc/lvm/lvm.conf' '/etc/multipath.conf' '/etc/rear/' '/etc/udev/udev.conf' )

You can customize this environment variable, or contribute improvements
that are more widely useful. We are happy to learn what can be improved
in this regard.

Hi,  
good hint! I have now CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES=(
${CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES\[@\]} '/etc/grub.conf' ) and it works.  
I am not sure if /etc/grub.conf or better /boot/grub/grub.conf exist in
every distro out there. If so, it might be a good idea to add it to the
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES= in default.conf

best regards

@goldzahn: You are right, however I wonder if the bootloader
configuration should be made conditional to the bootloader used on the
system. So maybe we should put some logic into
*layout/compare/default/*, e.g. *20\_include\_bootloader\_config.sh*.

@dagwieers Think it would be better to have the script under
`./layout/save/default/` directory so we cover both `savelayout` and
`compare` work-flows.

Hi, another case are changes in network configuration. If the backup IP
or routing has changed and you don't create manually a new rear iso you
got a problem to interact with your TSM server and suchlike.

So what would you suggest:

-   extend CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES for */etc/network/interfaces*
    respectively */etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*\*

or

-   extend some logic in ./layout/save/default/

so that rear checklayout returns != 0.

@alxgu could you check if latest changes are working for you?

Hi gdha,

it works fine. Thank you for your work.
