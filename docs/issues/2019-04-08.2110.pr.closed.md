Looks ok to me. Any example of why it would be wrong to print multiple
lines?

@rmetrich The "problem" is that in this case with Dynatrace the loaded
library has "/$LIB/" in the name and, as far as i know, the actual
full-path of the lib is evaluated during runtime of the process.  
As described in the referenced issue \#2109 it gives stderr messages,
which somehow are false-positive.  
In the Dynatrace example the /lib64/liboneagentproc.so is already loaded
so "/$LIB/liboneagentproc.so" is not needed anymore.

I hope my answer makes sense and i didn't mix it up to much while
translating my thoughts into english ;)

Regarding my issue comment
([https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2109\#issuecomment-480815587](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2109#issuecomment-480815587))
this PR would be obsolet or let's say "cosmetic", if you still want to
merge it.  
Thanks for pointing me to \#1980.

@rmetrich  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2110\#issuecomment-480816157](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2110#issuecomment-480816157)  
my gut feeling tells me it would be better to not merge it,  
I guess my gut feeling is "never change code that works".

FYI: I found out how one can un-approve a pull request:  
It does not work to do another review where one selects only "comment"  
but it works to re-request oneself to do a review.

@rmetrich  
I assigned it to you so that you can decide whether or not to merge it.

I'll be happy if you merge it, but i would also understand when this is
rejected because of "never change code that works" - no problem for me.

I'm ok as long as it still works. Could a test be made with NBU?

@jgrumboe I assume you were hitting this issue when using TSM as
external backup solution?

@gdha "Maybe". Yes, we do have TSM as external backup solution and No, i
don't think it's TSM related. The function to scan loaded libs is
general I think.

Update: Now i get it, because of the previous comment regarding testing
with NBU. (facepalm) Sorry, can't help with that and Yes, we have TSM :)

Not urgent or "must have" for ReaR 2.5 so postponed to ReaR 2.6

preference in this case.

@rmetrich @jsmeix If this PR is not merged before end of November 2019 I
will close it without further notice (say not merging the changes).
Agree?
