Dears

I'm using rear most of the time and it worked very well. but yesterday i
created rescue and backup file for a physical machine with rhel 5.9. and
i needed to restore it on 5 other physical machine. it worked for 2
times very well but after that rescue image could not detect network.i
configured network manually but it didn't resolved.  
I checked network cable and all switch and they worked fine and when i
replaced it with one of restored HDD, the network worked fine.

Manually network configuration:

    ifconfig eth0 60.1.1.200 netmask 255.255.224.0 up
    add route default gw 60.1.0.1

And my rear `local.conf`:

    # sample local configuration

    # Create Relax-and-Recover rescue media as ISO image
    OUTPUT=ISO

    # the following is required on older VMware VMs
    #MODULES_LOAD=( vmxnet )

    BACKUP=NETFS
    #BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.41.5/tools/rear/
    NETFS_URL=nfs://60.1.1.1/tools/rear/
    NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=Y

    BACKUP_PROG=tar
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS="--gzip"
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=".gz"

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' '/data/' '/data1/' )

    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=(
    /data
    /data1
    )

    REQUIRED_PROGS=(
    "$0"
    bash
    awk
    dd
    df
    getopt
    ip
    tar
    sort
    mv
    uniq
    mingetty
    grep
    loadkeys
    kbd_mode
    dumpkeys
    diff
    join
    pwd
    file
    pidof
    sync
    ifconfig
    ping
    route
    parted
    mkinitrd
    )

Please do not re-define the `REQUIRED_PROGS` variable in the
`/etc/rear/local.conf` file!  
It is better to use the following syntax:

    REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}"  must_have_binary )

I suspect that you missed a network kernel module or a module that was
not automatically detected and loaded. Check the network adapter cards
type and see if the module was present in the image. And if it was
present, try the `modprobe` command first.

BTW, we might consider to not use \#\#\# in the sample configs as that
gets  
converted into headings when people paste the configs into github :-)

@schlomo Yeah, it's quite unfortunate :-( I do like the fact that
documentation and examples are differently commented, especially when
commenting/uncommenting in block it helps avoid mistakes and adds to
readability. The fact that Github uses Markdown and Markdown uses a
senseless default (\# for headers) is problematic.

But it doesn't matter that it is '\#\#\#' or '\#', both generate titles.
People simple have to remember to quote examples using *\`\`\`*... And
we'll be doomed for eternity for Github's and Markdown's bad
decisions... I hate Markdown with a vengeance.
