Hi,

-   rear version : 2.2
-   OS version : Debian Unstable
-   Brief description of the issue:

Following some report in Debian (
[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=857189](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=857189)
),  
the BindTo option in systemd service files was renamed to BindsTo some
time ago while still being understood :  
[https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/7f2cddae09fd2579ae24434df577bb5e5a157d86](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/7f2cddae09fd2579ae24434df577bb5e5a157d86)  
It's being used in :  
./usr/share/rear/skel/default/usr/lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service:BindTo=dev-%i.device  
So maybe that can be upgraded.

F.

Hi frediz,  
Did you try from a fresh 2.2 from git or a real rear-2.2.0 stable ?

I've push a patch last week about systemd serial console detection
(\#1442).  
With this one, it should use `systemd-getty-generator` from the system
to automatically create the links.

I assume with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1442](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1442)
merged  
this issue is avioded and/or fixed.  
If not, this issue can be reopened or a new issue should be  
created if there is a subsequent related but different problem.
