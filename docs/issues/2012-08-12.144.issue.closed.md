[\#144 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/144) `closed`: Old website should redirect (even for deep links)

As mentioned on \#24, the old website only redirects the main page (e.g.
[http://rear.sf.net/](http://rear.sf.net/)) to the new location
([http://relax-and-recover.org/](http://relax-and-recover.org/)) but not
for sub-pages (e.g.
[http://rear.sf.net/documentation.php](http://rear.sf.net/documentation.php)).
Because of this old users (through old links) or new users (through
Google) end up on our old documentation and web-pages.

@gdha How can we fix this the best way ?

I guess the best thing we could do at SF are deleting all pages except
the  
main one. That would fix that problem, right?

But only if we can put an error page. Otherwise I would suggest
replacing  
all existing pages with the same one that has a Location 301 http-equiv
to  
tell also search engines about the permanently moved page.

I prefer indeed having 301 (permanent redirects) to similar content on
the new website.

Just made the redirect pages on sourceforge.net - it seems to work. Wait
for a day or two to be really sure everything is fine (and no complaints
arrive).

@gdha Great work. I quickly verified some common links and it works
well. I hope Google properly handles http-equiv refreshes, and it seems
they do:
[http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/](http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/)
