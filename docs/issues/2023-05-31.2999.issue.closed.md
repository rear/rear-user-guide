I noticed that `NETFS` stores the content of `/var/tmp` which is IMHO a
mistake.

I'm wondering where to add `/var/tmp`?

1.  to `BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE`
2.  to `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH`
3.  to both?

@jsmeix what do you think?

@schlomo  
is `/var/mp` a typo in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2999\#issue-1735023344](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2999#issue-1735023344)  
?

What exactly do you mean with 'store'?  
Do you mean "NETFS shouldn't backup /var/tmp"  
?

In general I think /var/tmp should be included in the backup by
default  
because according to how I understand what /var/tmp is meant for:

    # man file-hierarchy
    ...
      /var/tmp/
        The place for larger and persistent temporary files.
        In contrast to /tmp/, this directory is usually mounted from a
        persistent physical file system and can thus accept larger files.
        (Use /tmp/ for small ephemeral files.)
        This directory is generally not flushed at boot-up,
        but time-based cleanup of files that have not been accessed
        for a certain time is applied.

Therein the crucial parts related to this issue are for me  
"persistent temporary files" and "not flushed at boot-up"  
from which I deduce that /var/tmp/ should also by default  
persist disaster recovery i.e. not flushed at disaster recovery.

See also what I think what disaster recovery should do  
in "Goal: Recreate a destroyed system" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

    ... recreate it as much as possible as it was before ...

Only if data in /var/tmp/ can never be useful  
after the system was recreated, then /var/tmp  
could be excluded from the backup by default.

So if it gets cleaned time based then we can also skip it in backups to
reduce backup size and speed up restores

By definition nobody should expect those files to persist, it must be ok
to delete then any time.

Therefore my question: to which variable should i add the directory to
excite it from backup?

And yes, I want to minimize the backup by default.

No,  
when it gets cleaned time based, we cannot skip it in backups  
because we have no right to overwrite  
the user's time based cleanup procedure.

E.g. when the user wants to keep files in /var/tmp  
that have not been accessed for more than one month  
and a disaster recovery happens, then after backup restore  
all files in /var/tmp that have not been accessed for  
less than one month must have been restored by default.  
This way on the recreated system the user's time based cleanup  
method will continue to behave as it did on his original system.

You are free to minimize your backup as you like  
but STOP to impose your will on our users!

`/var/tmp` is typically used for editor temporary files (if not saved
next to the file being edited). When your machine crashes, you don't
want to lose the files you had been editing but had not saved. That's
why the recovery files should be kept in a place that does not get
cleaned up on boot.

Whether it should be included in the backup is a matter of taste for me.
If this is desired, `BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE` is the right place IMO
(currently the default value is

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' "$VAR_DIR/output/*" )

I hope that in any case, ReaR's temporary directory is not included in
the backup (I changed the default location to `/var/tmp` in \#2664)

it is not: `BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( "$BUILD_DIR" )` in `usr/sbin/rear`

Thank you @pcahyna, the argument about crash recovery files is really
good.

Only FYI  
as an example how /var/tmp/ looks  
on my homeoffice laptop that I use since March 2020  
(the time when I started to work in homeoffice)  
and I had never cleaned up /var/tmp/ since then:

My /var/tmp/ is only 16 MiB so nothing to worry about.

Therein 15 MiB are many /var/tmp/zypp.\* leftover directories, cf.  
[https://forums.opensuse.org/t/all-versions-there-are-over-500-000-zypp-directories-in-var-tmp-a-fix/141834](https://forums.opensuse.org/t/all-versions-there-are-over-500-000-zypp-directories-in-var-tmp-a-fix/141834)

The rest are mainly /var/tmp/systemd\* directories from only today  
(i.e. systemd properly cleans up its stuff in /var/tmp)  
so almost nothing is left from other programs in /var/tmp.

In my case an empty /var/tmp/efi\_virt/ directory is the only  
thing in /var/tmp except /var/tmp/zypp.\* and /var/tmp/systemd\*

@jsmeix if running ReaR often you could have ReaR leftovers there :-)
(ReaR uses `/var/tmp` by default not because it needs persistence across
reboot, but because it needs lots of space. Unfortunately, FHS does not
seem to have a place for temporary files intended to have lots of space
and at the same time not persistent.)

@pcahyna  
I think since you reworked how ReaR cleanes up its build area  
ReaR behaves perfectly well i.e. it behaves as good as possible,  
in particular without blindly removing unintended data by accident.

That there is no place for big non-persistent temporary files  
is the root cause of all nowadays mess with temporary files.

See what I had written (meanwhile this part became removed) in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=openSUSE:Tmp\_on\_tmpfs&oldid=50818](https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=openSUSE:Tmp_on_tmpfs&oldid=50818)

    Consequence

    Applications that write huge files to /tmp/ which are
    not meant to be preserved between system reboots work
    in compliance with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
    and cannot be "fixed" by using /var/tmp/ instead
    because files in /var/tmp/ cannot be cleaned up
    automatically when the system is booted.

    This conflicts with what is requested regarding
    "My CD burning application writes huge .iso files
     to /tmp, and this breaks on tmpfs! - The application
     should be fixed to use /var/tmp."
    at Fedora in
    https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/tmp-on-tmpfs#Comments_and_Discussion

    If /tmp/ is on tmpfs there is the question what the right place is
    for arbitrary kind of huge temporary files which are not meant
    to be preserved between system reboots? 

This question is not properly answered up to now.  
Instead postings that ask this question get removed.  
I am fed up and finished with any discussions  
about "the right handling" of temporary files.  
All is lost unless the basic questions get solved.  
And this is not something that belongs to ReaR.

Modernized question:  
"My application writes huge files to /var/tmp  
but when the system crashes (e.g. kernel panic)  
those huge files are still there after reboot."
