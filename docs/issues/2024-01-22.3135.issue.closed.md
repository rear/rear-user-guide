In default.conf we describe several cases  
where the user can specify commands to be run by ReaR  
and we run those user specified commands usually via

    eval $command

to make it easier for the user to specify e.g.

    command='echo current date: $( date )'

and get `$...` evaluated not when it is specified  
but when it is executed.

But in general `eval arbitrary $...` is problematic, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089\#discussion\_r1412293833](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089#discussion_r1412293833)  
and the subsequent comments therein.

And with the hardcoded `eval` the user can not specify  
when he does not want to get `$...` evaluated like

    command='echo to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"'

because

    # command='echo to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"'

    # $command
    to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"

    # eval $command
    to show the date use echo current date: Mon 22 Jan 2024 11:53:31 AM CET

By the way: Note the mising double quote characters with `eval ...`

So our hardcoded 'eval $command' is problematic  
and it is against final power to the user.

Therefore I am thinking about to remove our hardcoded 'eval'  
and explain in default.conf that the user must manually  
specify 'eval' when he needs it.

So instead of

    command='echo current date: $( date )'

the user would have to specify

    command='eval echo current date: $( date )'

and ReaR could simply and safely call plain `$command`  
for example like

    # command='eval echo current date: $( date )'

    # $command ; sleep 1 ; $command
    current date: Mon 22 Jan 2024 11:59:39 AM CET
    current date: Mon 22 Jan 2024 11:59:40 AM CET

This would be a big compatibility break, so it should belong to ReaR
3.0, not 2.8.

I am not even convinced that this change would be an improvement. Yes,
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089\#discussion\_r1412293833](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089#discussion_r1412293833)
I noted that `eval` of an arbitrary variable expansion is problematic.
But I said that in the context of something like
`eval echo "Launching \'$RECOVERY_COMMANDS_LABEL\' automatically"`,
where the user does not expect that the `$RECOVERY_COMMANDS_LABEL`
string is being passed to `eval` (one expects it to be some arbitrary
string for display). As I clarified in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089\#discussion\_r1412295915](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3089#discussion_r1412295915)
, I believe `eval "$command"` to be fine. `$command` is documented to be
executed this way, so it is not an arbitrary string.

Your argument about "with the hardcoded eval the user can not specify  
when he does not want to get $... evaluated" is interesting, but I don't
consider it convincing. Let's say I want the literal string
`to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"` displayed. In
plain shell, I would use

    echo 'to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"'

without the single quotes it would not have worked either, so to assign
it to `command` one needs to quote it properly at one more level:

    command="echo 'to show the date use \"echo current date: \$( date )\"'"

which then works as expected:

    $ eval "$command"
    to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"

unwieldy? yes. Against "final power to the user"? I would not say so.
The bash quoting rules are well documented and it is quite easy to
understand what one needs to put into $command: it must get assigned the
same string as one would type at the command line. The complexity arises
from the amount of quoting that is sometimes needed to achieve the
result. The `$'...'` quoting mechanism can help a bit here - one is
forced to quote only the `'` character and nothing else:

    $ command=$'echo \'to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"\''
    $ eval "$command"
    to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"

which looks a bit better.

Your suggestion to call the command as merely `$command` sounds simpler,
but this simplicity is IMO superficial and hides lots of surprising
complexity. Let's say that in your example I want to put some extra
spaces for readability:

    # note the doubled spaces
    $ command='echo to show the date use  "echo current date:  $( date )"'

result:

    $ $command
    to show the date use "echo current date: $( date )"

where are my spaces? Maybe you would expect the extra space before `"`
to disappear, but what about the one before `$(`, which is inside a
quoted string? What has happened? Let's examine a simpler example:

    # note the triple spaces
    $ command="echo 'a   b   c'"
    $ $command
    'a b c'

where are my triple spaces and what is the `'` character doing there?
Let's examine the result of the `$command` expansion:

    $ for i in $command ; do $i ; done

    bash: 'a: command not found
    bash: b: command not found
    bash: c': command not found

What happens is that the shell performs whitespace splitting on the
value of `$command`, resulting in for words:  
`echo` `'a` `b` `c'` and then executes this sequence (with `echo` as the
command and `'a` `b` `c'` as its three arguments).

I must say that when you let the shell to split the command string into
words and then execute the sequence of words, it is so difficult for me
how to make it do what I need that I much prefer `eval` with the
"quoting hell" needed to prepare its input (which is in most cases even
quite unnecessary).

Worse, how do you execute multiple commands?

    $ command="echo a  b  c ; echo d e f"
    $ $command
    a b c ; echo d e f

not only are the extra spaces eaten - the `;` is not intepreted and the
second `echo` is not executed at all. Yes, you could use `eval`:

    $ command="eval echo a  b  c ; echo d e f"
    $ $command
    a b c
    d e f

-- almost right, but I still don't know how to get the extra spaces
there, some word splitting is still going on:

    $ command="eval echo 'a  b  c' ; echo d e f"
    $ $command
    a b c
    d e f

not quite right either, neither is

    $ command="eval 'echo a  b  c ; echo d e f'"

:

    $ $command
    bash: echo a b c ; echo d e f: command not found

I admit I am lost here.

The underlying problem is that with `eval $command` it gets processed
twice: when `command` gets first assigned in the config file (
`command=...` ) and then when `eval $command` evaluates it. Both steps
have fairly easy rules. With merely `$command` you get another
processing step after $command is expanded but before it gets executed:
word splitting on whitespace (and probably other stuff, like filename
expansion), which complicates the process, despite the execution of
`$command` being simpler than the execution of `eval $command`.

@pcahyna  
thank you so much for your detailed explanations.

In particular your reasoning

    I believe eval "$command" to be fine.
    $command is documented to be executed this way,
    so it is not an arbitrary string.
    ...
    The bash quoting rules are well documented and it is quite easy
    to understand what one needs to put into $command:
    it must get assigned the same string
    as one would type at the command line.
    The complexity arises from the amount of quoting
    that is sometimes needed to achieve the result.

convinced me that the current `eval "$command"` is fine  
and now with this issue here it is even perfectly well  
documented WHY the current `eval "$command"` is fine.
