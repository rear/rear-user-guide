Sorry, I thought you wanted separate PRs for each issue. I'll link
\#2445 to \#2442 instead.

In general separated pull requests for separated issues are prefrerred  
but in this case the fix for this issue here was also included in the  
code chages of other pull request i.e. the fix for this issue here was  
submitted via two pull requests and that is what I liked to get sorted
out.  
In this case it is perfectly OK to have both in one pull request
because  
the two issues are not such big code changes that one gets confused  
what code changes belong to what part of the issues.
