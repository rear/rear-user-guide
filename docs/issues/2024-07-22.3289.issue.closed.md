@thomasmerz  
as always I have no idea how that OBS key stuff actually works.  
To me all that is obscure and behaves inexplicably.

So I need details how I could reproduce your issue.  
Ideally exact command lines that I could type in  
and what their output is on your system  
so I could compare your output with mine.  
I do not use graphical GUI tools so I could not  
reproduce issues with graphical GUI tools.

FYI  
what I did so far  
(basically blind attempts to "see" something):

which matches

I was just doing some `zypper` commands when I saw this "has expired"

I'm using the same repo for OpenSUSE 15.5 as your example above:

Got that beast!

See in my previous  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289\#issuecomment-2242869945](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289#issuecomment-2242869945)

    # osc results -v Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.7 | grep '^15.5'
    15.5  x86_64   rear-2.7  outdated (was: finished: unchanged)
    15.5  ppc64le  rear-2.7  succeeded

That `finished: unchanged` triggered something in my mind:

I think I vaguely remember that OBS does not re-publish  
a rebuilt package, when the build result is `unchanged`  
(i.e. `osc rebuild` rebuilds but that does not enforce  
to also re-publish it).

So I tried what happens when I artificially change  
something so that the build result gets `changed`.

I did in rear.spec spelling fixes in comments 'rear' -&gt; 'ReaR'  
see  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/revisions/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7](https://build.opensuse.org/package/revisions/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7)  
and the actual changes  
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7?linkrev=base&rev=4](https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/Archiving:Backup:Rear/rear-2.7?linkrev=base&rev=4)

This automatically triggered a rebuild of  
Archiving:Backup:Rear rear-2.7 for all build targets  
and now - after that rebuild finished - I get

    # curl https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/15.5/repodata/repomd.xml.key | gpg
    ...
    pub   rsa2048 2020-01-17 [SC] [expires: 2026-09-30]
          985D26DB176472E45FFE5FF51B4DD1E2FFC8DD5F

which now matches what

    osc signkey Archiving:Backup:Rear | gpg

shows, cf. my above

@thomasmerz  
thank you for your prompt reply that it now also works for you.

I noticed that your Archiving:Backup:Rear repository  
is named `Relax-and-Recover snapshot packages`  
and also other values contain 'snapshot'  
but I had removed the Archiving:Backup:Rear:Snapshot  
repository some time ago, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3056](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3056)  
so I assume your Archiving:Backup:Rear repository  
is somewhat old and perhaps somewhat outdated.

Perhaps things work better when you remove that  
old and possibly somewhat outdated repository  
from zypper and (re)-install it from scratch  
as I did it above in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289\#issuecomment-2242937020](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3289#issuecomment-2242937020)

But this is only an offhanded proposal.  
I don't know your system environment  
and/or your respositories setup so perhaps  
better don't touch it more than actually needed?

You fixed it, you got the praise 👏🏼  
My repo was already latest/correct, but the name was something old.
Thanks for your hint I had to check with your "URI:

:-)  
actually I did not fix it (i.e. I did not correct a bug)  
but I learned now how to work around this bug in OBS:

It seems OBS does not re-build or re-publish a package  
when metadata changed (at least not when expiration date  
of a key changed).

I think when metadata of a published package changed,  
then OBS should normally (i.e. except exceptions)  
automatcally re-build and re-publish the package.

I think such an enhanced re-build and re-publish behaviour  
would be in line with the current automated re-build  
of a package which is:  
When the package sources changed but also when  
another package changed that is needed to build  
(i.e. when something changed that gets installed by OBS  
into its build system), simply put: when the build system  
of a package changed, then the package gets automatically  
re-built by OBS.

Bottom line (or "lesson learned"):  
I think for all ReaR source packages in OBS  
I should do some artificial source change once a year  
to trigger a complete re-build and re-publish.
