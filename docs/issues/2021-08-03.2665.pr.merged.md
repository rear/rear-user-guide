-   How was this pull request tested?

    -   Run `rear mkrescue` in a KVM virtual machine on RHEL 8 without
        `powerpc-utils-core` (which contains those two utilities) and
        checked that it immediately aborts with
        `ERROR: Cannot find required programs: ofpathname`. With
        `powerpc-utils-core` installed and `/usr/sbin/bootlist` manually
        removed it succeeds and the initrd contains `ofpathname`. With
        `powerpc-utils-core` installed normally it succeeds and the
        initrd contains both `ofpathname` and `bootlist`.
    -   Run `rear mkrescue` in a PowerVM LPAR on RHEL 8 without
        `powerpc-utils-core` (which contains those two utilities) and
        checked that it immediately aborts with
        `ERROR: Cannot find required programs: ofpathname bootlist`.
        With `powerpc-utils-core` installed it succeeds and the initrd
        contains both `ofpathname` and `bootlist`.
    -   Run `rear mkrescue` on a PowerNV server (bare metal) on RHEL 8
        without `powerpc-utils-core`, it completes fine. Verified that
        if `powerpc-utils-core` is installed, the initrd contains both
        `ofpathname` and `bootlist`.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

As reported by @rmetrich, the `ofpathname` binary is called by
grub2-install. Therefore, it is required in the rescue system in order
to make the recovered system bootable, except for the PowerNV (Not
Virtualized - bare metal) case. Under PowerVM, we also need the
`bootlist` executable to make the system bootable.

Add those two binaries to `REQUIRED_PROGS` instead of `PROGS` under the
appropriate conditions.

Do not handle PowerNV for ppc64: according to
89ddb9fc17adb022ce9c10be0c3e5b835ba139d7, only ppc64le Linux can run in
PowerNV.

(Wouldn't it be simpler though to symlink Linux-ppc64.conf to
Linux-ppc64le.conf? Their differences seem to be minimal.)

@rmetrich can you please review?

Only as a side note:  
On my openSUSE Leap 15.2 x86\_64 system  
I have grub2-2.04 but I neither have ofpathname nor bootlist  
so this issue seems to be strictly POWER specific.

@rmetrich @pcahyna  
I have a general question:  
When GRUB2 is used as bootloader on a machine  
and grub2-install requires certain helper programs  
I wonder how GRUB2 could have ever been installed as bootloader  
on the original system without having its helper programs available?  
I.e. I wonder how with `PROGS+=( bootlist ofpathname )`  
it could ever happen that bootlist and/or ofpathname  
are not available on the system?

@rmetrich  
I assigned it to you so that you could merge it as you like.

@rmetrich how did it happen that the system ended up in this state? But
I suppose that in general GRUB is installed by the installer, which
might have a different set of toools available than the installed
system. Also, the package might be removed by the user after
installation, because the GRUB packages do not declare a dependency on
it (that might be considered a bug in GRUB packaging).

@rmetrich can the PR be merged, please?
