During recovery, the number of inodes in a file system is reset to the
default instead of using the original value.

this depends on file system type in use and after the mkfs we cannot
tunefs it anymore. I find it pretty hard to decide if this is a bug or
not. Missing feature perhaps?  
Btw by extending the LVOL you increase the inodes too. Is this not a
valid work-around??

Hi,

I don't think this is a valid workaround. I am in particular concerned  
about file systems with a lot of small files. For these it might be  
necessary to change the bytes/inode ratio (-i option in mkfs.ext3) to  
prevent a half full file system with all inodes consumed.

Werner.

@wdpoorte I agree we should in fact record the max number of inodes of
each filesystem in the layout.conf, and restore that during the creation
of the filesystem. That's the only safe option we have. That is why I
marked your report as a bug. However I think we have higher priority
issues to fix at this time, but we welcome pull-requests or discussions
about this functionality.

I'll consider creating a pull request - a good opportunity to learn
git.  
Then I can also create a pull request for the lvmvol dash issue if
needed.

@jhoekx @wdpoorte I wonder if some of the other possible options to
mkfs.ext2 should be recreated in the same manner ? Possible options are:
*fragment-size*, *blocks-per-group*, *number-of-groups*, *inode-size*,
*journal-options*, *features*

I don't mind if we decide that all or some of these are on a request
basis, but I want to make sure that we at least looked at them and make
a conscious decision.
