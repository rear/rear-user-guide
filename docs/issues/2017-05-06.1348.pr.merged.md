This is the first draft of TSM backup.

Now, a TSM incremental backup is started when the command
`rear mkbackup` or `rear mkbackuponly` is executed.

-   TSM client must be installed and properly configured
-   file exclusion is managed by TSM in configuration files.

@schabrolles  
many thanks for your contribution to make  
TSM support better in ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)

<pre>
Just be courageous and enhance the curently rather
poor TSM support in ReaR - it cannot get worse ;-)
</pre>

@schabrolles When `rear mkbackup` triggers a TSM incremental shouldn't
we describe this change in behaviour somehow? It was said
`rear mkbackup` is the same as `rear mkrescue` with commercial backup
software. Now at least for TSM `rear mkbackup` behaves different, no?

@jsmeix @schlomo what are your thoughts?

@schabrolles Could you refresh this PR? Or, when it is polished then you
may commit this PR.

@jsmeix could you have a quick look before I merge this one.  
Thanks.

@schabrolles  
could you also have a look at my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1643\#issuecomment-354775699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1643#issuecomment-354775699)

Regarding this pull request here:

1.  

To me the code related to the include\_list array looks "problematic"  
because it seems you use an array as if it was a string.  
In general with

<pre>
for word in foo bar baz ; do arr+=( "$word " ) ; done
</pre>

each array element gets a trailing blank character:

<pre>
# for element in "${arr[@]}" ; do echo "'$element'" ; done
'foo '
'bar '
'baz '
</pre>

Accordingly I think your code should be

<pre>
# Create TSM friendly backup include list.
for backup_include in $( cat $TMP_DIR/backup-include.txt ) ; do
    include_list+=( "$backup_include" )
done
</pre>

Then I wonder why you don't use

<pre>
... dsmc incremental ... "${include_list[@]}" ...
</pre>

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1068)

<pre>
using ${array[@]} without double-quotes is ... problematic
</pre>

In particular because for me on SLES12 with btrfs I have

<pre>
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/var/cache/*' '/var/lib/mailman/*' '/var/tmp/*' '/var/lib/pgsql/*' '/usr/local/*' '/opt/*' '/var/lib/libvirt/images/*' '/boot/grub2/i386/*' '/var/opt/*' '/srv/*' '/boot/grub2/x86_64/*' '/var/lib/mariadb/*' '/var/spool/*' '/var/lib/mysql/*' '/tmp/*' '/home/*' '/var/log/*' '/var/lib/named/*' '/var/lib/machines/*' )
</pre>

and then backup-include.txt contains e.g.

<pre>
# cat /tmp/rear.PAoykNbFTZqPeEW/tmp/backup-include.txt
/var/cache/*
/var/lib/mailman/*
/var/tmp/*
/var/lib/pgsql/*
/usr/local/*
/opt/*
/var/lib/libvirt/images/*
/boot/grub2/i386/*
/var/opt/*
/srv/*
/boot/grub2/x86_64/*
/var/lib/mariadb/*
/var/spool/*
/var/lib/mysql/*
/tmp/*
/home/*
/var/log/*
/var/lib/named/*
/var/lib/machines/*
/
</pre>

I wonder if possibly unquoted '\*' characters might lead  
to unwanted bash evaluation of the include\_list array  
elements?  
I.e. check the log file what the actual "dsmc incremental"  
command options are and whether or not they are  
as intended.

1.  

The new TSM\_DSMC\_BACKUP\_OPTIONS config array variable  
should be explained (or at least mentioned) in default.conf

1.  

The condition

<pre>
if test $dsmc_exit_code -lt 12; then
</pre>

has the implicit assumption all dsmc exit codes &gt;= 12 are errors.  
Is this really true or is only dsmc exit code 12 a real error?

1.  

I still have the question in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1348\#pullrequestreview-36713346](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1348#pullrequestreview-36713346)  
see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)  
I guess that the include\_list array implements that  
via BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE (cf. item 1 above)  
but then this behaviour should be explained in  
the "BACKUP=TSM stuff" section in default.conf

@schabrolles I'm OK with this PR.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823\#issuecomment-357253860](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823#issuecomment-357253860)  
the current implementation that calls

<pre>
dsmc incremental ... "${include_list[@]}"
</pre>

might be in conflict with what the user has set in TSM own files  
which tell what to backup and what to exclude.

There should be only one single authoritative source of information  
that tells what to include in the backup and what to exclude.

Accordingly I think it works perhaps more fail-safe to remove  
the current include\_list array code and call only plain

<pre>
dsmc incremental
</pre>

to get a TSM backup that contains what TSM own config files tell.

But this is only a blind comment from a non-TSM user.  
In the end whatever works reasonably for you is o.k.

@jsmeix , I need to perform additional test to understand how
include\_list and TSM include file interact.

@schabrolles  
do you perhaps find some time to merge it?  
A very first initial state is perfectly fine.

@jsmeix,  
Let me retest this one on my systems on top of the current master branch
to be sure.  
I'll merge it next week.
