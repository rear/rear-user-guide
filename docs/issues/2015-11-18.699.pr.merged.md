This is a huge pull request with lots of things in it.

Its initial intent was
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/688](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/688)  
by adding a separated debugscripts option so that e.g.

<pre>
rear --debugscripts 'ue +h -o pipefail' help
</pre>

now works as an initial proof of concept that rear can be  
made working with things like 'set -eu'.

Because my final goal behind
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/688](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/688)  
is to make rear working with things like 'set -ue -o pipefail' I like  
to have as a precondition support for advanced debugging settings  
built-in in rear (instead of manually modifying the scripts).

While I implemented the debugscripts option I tested how it works  
with things like

<pre>
rear --debugscripts 'xvue -o pipefail' help
</pre>

and during this testing I fixed all what fails in the rear scripts.

Unfortunately because of this that pull request here is big and
implements three things at once:

1.)  
The new debugscripts option which is fully backward compatible because
the behaviour of the other options does not change.

2.)  
I fixed all what fails because of 'set -ue -o pipefail' for the "help"
workflow as a very first step into that direction.

3.)  
When I was working on a particular piece of code I also changed it as
needed to be better in compliance with the "Coding Style" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

If you agree with what I did here, I will continue to make rear working
with 'set -ue -o pipefail' step by step also for other workflows.

In any case I would very much appreciate it if you carefully check what
I changed.

I assume at least in some cases you may wonder about the code before and
afterwards - in this case please ask me - I think there are several
places in the code where it is not clear what is actually meant so that
I could have made plain wrong changes because I failed to understand
what the actual intent is of a particular code.

Many thanks in advance for your review!

I forgot:

For me also e.g. "rear -d -D mkrescue" still works so that for me it
does not seem to be totally broken what I did - nevertheless I
appreciate a careful review.

FYI:

Right now I tested on a SLES12-SP1 KVM/Qemu virtual machine  
with 2.5TB virtual harddisk using SUSE's special 'gpt\_sync\_mbr'  
and SLES12-SP1 default btrfs and xfs for /home that

<pre>
rear -d -D mkbackup
</pre>

and

<pre>
rear -d -D recover
</pre>

still "just work" for me.
