To contribute I was pointed to
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/\#contributing](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/#contributing)

The website suggests to checkout new branches against `upstream/dev`

However that leaves me with to old 2-digit file naming scheme, instead
current master 3-digit file naming scheme:

    00_remove_workflow_conf.sh  04_check_output_scheme.sh         31_include_uefi_tools.sh   50_guess_bootloader.sh
    02_translate_url.sh     05_check_keep_old_output_copy_var.sh  32_include_uefi_env.sh     95_check_missing_programs.sh
    03_translate_tape.sh        10_init_workflow_conf.sh          40_save_mountpoint_details.sh

This makes contributing complex. Something seems to need an update.

@ProBackup-nl This morning I did synchronization between our dev/master
branch. They are now equal.
