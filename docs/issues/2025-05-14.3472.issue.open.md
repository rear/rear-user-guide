### Requesting support or just a question

Can't get Relax and Recover to boot on OpenStack (OpenMetal),
hypervisor.

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output

    Can't get Relax and Recover to boot on OpenStack (OpenMetal), hypervisor. Downloaded the R&R file for JetBackup, and it refuses to boot.

### Additional information

Just says no boot device found. Is there specific meta data i need to
use? I tried sata, q35, uefi, bios etc.. no go

What is a "R&R file for JetBackup" ? How was it generated?  
I used to use ReaR in OpenStack virtual machines with BIOS and with
`OUTPUT=USB`. I know that it also works with `OUTPUT=ISO` One can not
boot from an ephemeral disk in current OpenStack versions, though.

Jet Backup allows you to create an iso that you can boot from to restore
a backup image in CloudLinux, cpanel, etc..  
Could you send me what you have for metadata completely for your iso?
very glad to hear you were able to get it work

I have not used an ISO image with OpenStack myself. I believe you should
contact JetBackup support instead, as they should know how JetBackup
generates an image and how it should be used.

Yeah, i was just curious what metadata you used for your ReaR in
openstack in the past. like what allowed it to boot up
