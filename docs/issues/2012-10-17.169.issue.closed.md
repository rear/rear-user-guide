As
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/)
is still under construction, I have some difficulties understanding the
variables OUTPUT, BACKUP\_URL and OUTPUT\_URL, even after looking at the
comments in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:

Say I want to create an emergency USB stick that allows me to recover to
a bare metal system, and provide a backup of the OS essential partitions
on a SAN disk, for space and performance considerations.

Would the following setting be appropriate, e.g.

OUTPUT=USB  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-id/usb-ADATA\_USB\_Flash\_Drive\_1090710000000089-part1  
OUTPUT\_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600508b400054dda0000c000003b0000-part1

Thanks in advance, Tom

Hi,

I think you should exchange BACKUP\_URL and OUTPUT\_URL. OUTPUT\_URL
and  
OUTPUT define where the bootable rescue media goes. BACKUP\* defines
where  
the backup goes.

Hm,

but actually my BACKUP\_URL points to ADATA\_USB\_Flash\_Drive, and my
OUTPUT\_URL points to a SAN disk.  
The "USB" in OUTPUT=USB is appropriate, according to the following line
from default.conf:

NOTE: "USB" means any local block-storage device and includes also eSATA and other external disks

OUTPUT\_URL=san-device means that you want to boot off that san device
for  
recovery.

OUTPUT=USB means "make the block device named by OUTPUT\_URL bootable
with  
the rescue media"

The man page should be enhanced a bit to describe it a little better
