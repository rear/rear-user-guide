I like to implement a new kind of "backup" method:

<pre>
BACKUP=ZYPPER
</pre>

It is not an usual file-based backup/restore method  
where one can get the files of an old system  
back as they had been before.

This new kind of "backup" method does not work  
on files but on RPM packages.

During "rear mkbackup" it will basically save  
only the list of installed RPM packages and  
during "rear recover" it will basically  
only install those RPM packages.

This issue emerged as successor of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732)  
and is intended to replace it.

In contrast to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732)  
where a whole new workflow was intended to be implemented  
the new BACKUP=ZYPPER method is intended to provide the  
same functionality i.e. "install a system from scratch" but  
BACKUP=ZYPPER integrates much nicer into the  
existing ReaR framework.

Why BACKUP=ZYPPER and not BACKUP=RPM?

Because zypper provides RPM packages repositories  
management, i.e. using the higher level 'zypper' instead  
of the low-level 'rpm' saves me much implementation work  
because I do not have to implement RPM repositories  
management in ReaR but can just let zypper do that, cf.  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
"Generic system installation with the plain SUSE installation system"  
where I also used 'zypper' in my installation script  
(a few 'zypper' commands did all the stuff).

When BACKUP=ZYPPER works o.k. and  
when users are interested in using ReaR also  
for system deployment, it should be (relatively) easy  
to add more such kind of "backup" methods to also  
support other software package installers in ReaR.

The intended use-case why I think ReaR should  
support system deployment:

As far as I know one reason why users like ReaR so much is  
that ReaR is one same disaster recovery tool that they can  
use on all their various different kind of Linux systems  
(e.g. Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, ...), cf.  
"Native disaster recovery with AutoYaST is deprecated"  
in
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

From that I conclude that basically nobody is interested  
in a Linux distributior specific disaster recovery tool.

As far as I know another reason why users like ReaR so much  
is that ReaR is pure bash (the native system administration  
language) which means they can (relatively) easily adapt it  
as they need it for their various kind of Linux systems.

Why not make them even more happy so that they can  
also use ReaR generically for all kind of installations  
on all kind of their Linux systems?

Perhaps you may wonder about why a user should use  
ReaR for system installation when each Linux distribution  
already comes with its own specific installer?

As far as I know in big environments (with hundreds  
or even thousands of systems) nobody uses the  
Linux distribution's installers to manually install  
each particular system.  
In big environments they use whatever deployment tool  
for mass-installations (e.g. AutoYaST for SUSE).

As far as I know in big environments they use the  
Linux distribution's installers basically only during  
their initial evaluation and testing phase until they  
know what they want to get.  
Then they set up their deployment tool and let it do  
the actual productive mass-deployments.

Therefore the intended use-case for  
ReaR system deployment is:

Use the Linux distribution's installer to set up  
one or several "template systems".  
On each of those "template systems"  
run "rear mkbackup" and do the actual productive  
mass-deployment via "rear recover" probably  
together with "RECOVERY\_UPDATE\_URL", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841)

Another use-case for ReaR system deployment  
could be when systems get re-installed regularly  
to maintain 100% clean and 100% updated systems  
like thin clients or any other systems without local data  
storage where only the plain operating system and  
application binaries are stored on local disk, nowadays  
also servers with data storage via SAN.

And what is the ultimate goal behind all that?

My ultimate goal is to get ReaR out of the "rear seat"  
and put it on a "front seat" - even more:  
I would like to get ReaR on the "driver's seat".

My ultimate goal is to move ReaR forward  
from something where its users basically say

<pre>
ReaR is nice tool that we have to be better
prepared in case a disaster happens but that
we hopefully never have to actually use.
</pre>

to something where its users could say

<pre>
ReaR is an essential part of our system administration.
ReaR is THE deployment tool and at the same time
ReaR is THE backup and recovery tool
for all our various different kind of Linux systems.
</pre>

Hello @jsmeix,  
Looks like SuSE only feature, or am I wrong?  
Once package list to install list is saved, from which source will they
be installed during deployment? (DVD, official repos, local repos ...)?

BACKUP=ZYPPER only works on systems  
where 'zypper' is there, cf. above:

<pre>
When BACKUP=ZYPPER works o.k. and
when users are interested in using ReaR also
for system deployment, it should be (relatively) easiy
to add more such kind of "backup" methods to also

</pre>

Of course I will first implement something for  
the systems of the company that pays my salary ;-)  
Then people from Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu,...  
could implement same functionality for their  
software package installers (based on my work).

Regarding what package repositories will be used  
during "rear recover":  
By default the ones that are active on the original system  
(i.e. basically what 'zypper lr -u' shows), but anything  
else will also be possible, cf. above

<pre>
mass-deployment via "rear recover" probably
together with "RECOVERY_UPDATE_URL", cf.
https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/841
</pre>

hmm, fully understand you monetary reasons, we all need to eat from time
to time ;-).  
Anyhow didn't you thought about something more generic (then ZYPPER)?
Because if e.g. RH guys add their code (e.g. for Yum) naming could
become confusing over time ... (just an idea, in general I don't have
anything against zypper ;-)).

E.g for Red Hat one would keep it separated via

<pre>
BACKUP=YUM
</pre>

cf. what we learned about keeping separated backup  
methods separated in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1048](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1048)

With support for multiple backup methods in ReaR  
it does no longer matter on what particular backup method  
the user must decide - he can freely combine what he likes.

My actual main reason for using 'zypper' is that I know it  
and that I already have some experience how to use it  
on plain command line for installation from scatch, cf.  
"Generic system installation with the plain SUSE installation system"
in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

I like to get a first usable result soon  
so that I and others can play around with it to see  
how all that actually works (or fails) in practice.  
Therefore I like to avoid unexpected troubles  
with low-level implementation details.

If BACKUP=ZYPPER works well, I could perhaps  
implement a generic BACKUP=RPM later if needed, cf.  
"Why BACKUP=ZYPPER and not BACKUP=RPM?" in

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1209](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1209)  
merged BACKUP=ZYPPER works now in a basic way  
at least on SLES12, cf.

Because there is zero user response for BACKUP=ZYPPER  
(in particular zero SUSE user response) I leave it as is.
