-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I used `DISKS_TO_BE_WIPED=""` a lot on my openSUSE test VMs

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In ReaR 2.7 default.conf has DISKS\_TO\_BE\_WIPED='false'  
so no disk is wiped to avoid possible regressions  
until this new feature was more tested by interested users, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

Now after ReaR 2.7 release I like to have this feature tested  
by default by users who use our GitHub master code.
