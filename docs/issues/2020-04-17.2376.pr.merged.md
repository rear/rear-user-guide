I would appreciate it if another ReaR maintainer  
could additionally have a look and also approve it  
or request changes if needed.

After doing some more testing with overrides, I found a bug: The present
code will accept an enabled DHCP client on *any* network connection.
However, with Docker there may be additional network connections
configured with DHCP enabled. These should be ignored. Fix upcoming.

@OliverO2  
while you are working on that file could you  
by the way also improve

    COPY_AS_IS=( "${COPY_AS_IS[@]}" "/etc/localtime" "/usr/lib/dhcpcd/*" )
    PROGS=( "${PROGS[@]}" arping ipcalc usleep "${dhclients[@]}" )

to

    COPY_AS_IS+=( "/etc/localtime" "/usr/lib/dhcpcd/*" )
    PROGS+=( arping ipcalc usleep "${dhclients[@]}" )

cf.

@jsmeix  
Sure, also `dhclients+=("$x")` in line 19, I guess...

@OliverO2  
yes of course!  
You know my current regexp doesn't find all ;-)  
By the way: I am finished with what my current regexp found :-)

@jsmeix

Done. I wanted to clean up the entire `dhclients` variable setting but
didn't dare to: I'm still not sure what `dhclients` changes in
array/string type across the file are all about.

For me it looks like that the `define_dhclients_variable` function could
be replaced by something like

    define_dhclients_variable() {
        dhclients=$(printf "%s\n" "${DHCLIENT_BIN##*/}" "${DHCLIENT6_BIN##*/}" dhcpcd dhclient dhcp6c dhclient6 | grep . | sort -u)
    }

I think @gdha is our DHCP expert here ;-)

@jsmeix  
Yes, these type changes between string and array are what I was
wondering about. I'll come up with a commit trying to clean up that
dhclient stuff.

@jsmeix The old code was a bit too messy for my taste that I re-wrote it
to what I think was really intended. Also added a few checks which were
not there originally. See commit remarks and code.

What still remains: The distinction between `DHCLIENT_BIN` and
`DHCLIENT6_BIN` is not really necessary as even the code picking up
these variables in `58-start-dhclient.sh` does not really need it.
However, these variables (although still undocumented in `default.conf`)
might be present in some user's local configuration files.

According to

    localhost:~/rear.github.master # find . -type f | xargs grep -l 'DHCLIENT_BIN'

    ./usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh
    ./usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/210_include_dhclient.sh

DHCLIENT\_BIN and DHCLIENT6\_BIN are internal variables.

In general what is not documented in default.conf  
is not meant as a user config variable.

We have tons of internal variables with uppercase names  
that are not meant as user config variables,  
cf. the section "Variables" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

    All variables that are used in more than a single script must be all-caps:
    $FOO instead of $foo or $Foo.

Of course we also have globally used variables  
that do not have uppercase names e.g. `backuparchive`:

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs egrep -l 'backuparchive=|\$backuparchive' | wc -l
    18

:-(

@jsmeix The problem is that configuring `DHCLIENT[6]_BIN` in
`local.conf` was suggested in comments of `210_include_dhclient.sh`
before. Comments and actual code were also not consistent as the
comments suggested one could define dhclient binaries beyond what was
included in the known clients list. However, `58-start-dhclient.sh`
could not deal with such an unknown client.

@OliverO2  
personally I would say feel free to clean it up mercilessly  
to make things straightforward and consistent.

Personally I was too often completely confused  
with the DHCP setup code so I would so much appreciate  
a generic cleanup in this area.

With a more straightforward code we could much more  
reliably maintain that code in the future.

@gdha  
what do you think about a generic cleanup of the DHCP setup code?

@OliverO2  
in particular you can safely remove all what is not supported by  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh  
because no user reported that something is missing in this area  
which indicates that no user uses more than what is supported by  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

@OliverO2 @jsmeix the dhcp code was an ugly copy/paste from ?? (old RH
code I guess) and does indeed require a serious facelift.

@gdha @jsmeix OK, so I'll clean up the last bits and then ask you to
have a final look.

@gdha @jsmeix

-   \[x\] Did the final cleanup (as far as I am concerned).
-   \[x\] Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS Desktiop and Server edition.

Over to you!

Thanks for your thorough review. Always appreciated.
