I'm trying to restore a CentOS 5.8 system using this config:

    RESCUE birch:~ # less /etc/rear/local.conf
    # sample local configuration

    # Create Rear rescue media as ISO image
    OUTPUT=ISO

    # optionally define (non-default) backup software, e.g. TSM, NBU, DP, BACULA
    BACKUP=REQUEST_RESTORE

    # the following is required on older VMware VMs
    MODULES_LOAD=( vmxnet )

    # to see boot messages on the serial console (uncomment next line)
    # KERNEL_CMDLINE="console=tty0 console=ttyS1"

The ISO boots fine and the partitions are set up. But at the very end
when it looks likes it's going to chroot /mnt/local to install the
initrd it crashes like this:

If I do a complete backup using rsync to a NAS it's fine.

What version of Relax-and-Recover are you using ?

From the post on the mailing list it was clear that the cause of the
error is the lack of restore when Relax-and-Recover ask you to perform
the (manual) restore. That is what `REQUESTRESTORE` means.

Can I close this ticket ?

in docs/03-configuration:

BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE::  
No backup, just ask user to somehow restore the filesystems

The intent is not very clear at all :) in addition to REQUESTRESTORE
being misnamed in the doc. Is there somewhere else that this option is
described in more detail?

I agree the documentation could be improved. Please send a pull-request
for documentation improvements.

The most detail is in the scripts itself:

    [dag@moria rear]$ find . -name REQUESTRESTORE
    ./usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE
    [dag@moria rear]$ cat ./usr/share/rear/restore/REQUESTRESTORE/default/20_prompt_user_to_start_restore.sh 
    #
    # the user has to do the main part here :-)
    #
    #

    LogPrint "$REQUESTRESTORE_TEXT"

    if [[ "$REQUESTRESTORE_COMMAND" ]]; then
        LogPrint "Use the following command to restore the backup to your system in '/mnt/local':

        $REQUESTRESTORE_COMMAND
    "

        LogPrint "Please restore your backup in the provided shell, use the shell history to
    access the above command and, when finished, type exit in the shell to continue
    recovery.
    "
        rear_shell "Did you restore the backup to /mnt/local ? Are you ready to continue recovery ?" \
            "$REQUESTRESTORE_COMMAND"
    else
        LogPrint "Please restore your backup in the provided shell and, when finished, type exit
    in the shell to continue recovery."

        rear_shell "Did you restore the backup to /mnt/local ? Are you ready to continue recovery ?"
    fi

So `REQUESTRESTORE` is correctly named in the documentation, and during
recovery the process clearly indicates what is expected from the user.
You can provide a separate message (via `REQUESTRESTORE_COMMAND` to the
user to hint what the restore command should be. This "backup" method is
in fact a placeholder and the default backup method (lacking any
information to the backup strategy since none was provided in the
configuration).

I guess the failure here is that the OP used `REQUEST_RESTORE` instead
of `REQUESTRESTORE` and as a result there was *no* backup method used,
so Relax-and-Recover fails automatically during the chroot bash test...

The irony here is that if the OP would not have selected any backup
method, `BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE` would have correctly been the used
configuration.

@cal-s Thanks for noticing !

A solution to the above case could be to test whether any recovery
script would be selected for the `BACKUP` method specified and if there
is no script found an error could be shown to the user that this BACKUP
method has no recovery script. That's the only way we can be sure that
the user made an error.

We can help you test this in any way you see fit. We're not using a live
system as we are evaluating the product for our use.

Please explain the intent behind the BACKUP variable as set (maybe) in
local.conf? I have it set (see below), which allows direct restore from
a NETFS location:

BACKUP\_URL=nfs://server/xfs/backup/rear/14092012  
BACKUP=NETFS

Is "BACKUP=whatever" not even used during mkbackup and only used on
restore (i would guess it's put somewhere for restore reference)? When
one sets (or not) BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE, is it left for the user to
then: "Please restore your backup in the provided shell", assuming they
know where and what said backup was. How would one deal with this? untar
the mkbackup tarball/tape to /mnt/local and proceed?

The `BACKUP` method is used during mkbackup. But obviously
`BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE` means, we don't manage the backup with
Relax-and-Recover and ask the user to restore using whatever means
necessary. Again, the `REQUESTRESTORE_COMMAND` may give a hint to what
the restore procedure should be. On the other hand, it is not required.

It all depends on whether you want Relax-and-Recover to take care of the
backup, whether the rescue image should include specific tools and what
the process is to restore. If you know all of this in advance,
`REQUESTRESTORE` is not for you. If you have any specific needs,
Relax-and-Recover can guide you with those.

Obviously the default for *all* users is that we don't know anything
about your specific case, so that means: `REQUESTRESTORE`. We do not do
anything in advance, and you are on your own for restoring the data.

Honestly, I don't think we need to take care of typos in the
configuration,  
or only to a very limited extend.

If we really want to check for non-existant backup methos then each
method  
should set a flag in the pre stage so that we can bail out with a  
meaningful message later on, if the flag is not set.

IIRC we do something similar for the boot loader already.

@schlomo Fair comment.
