Much like we currently allow the following configuration directives:

    # Exclude components from being backed up, recreation information is active
    EXCLUDE_BACKUP=()

    # Exclude components during component recreation
    # will be added to EXCLUDE_BACKUP (it is not backed up)
    # recreation information gathered, but commented out
    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=()

    # Exclude components during the backup restore phase
    # Only used to exclude files from the restore.
    EXCLUDE_RESTORE=()

We would like to have `INCLUDE_BACKUP`, `INCLUDE_RECREATE` and
`INCLUDE_RESTORE`. This enables users to specify a limited number of
components to backup, recreate or restore.

The `INCLUDE_*` and `EXCLUDE_*` options could be mutual exclusive, or
could be ordered somehow (up to the developer to see what is possible
and how it is implemented).

@rear/contributors too many options are confusing and our default.conf
file already contains lots of variables... I'm not in favor of adding
more variables...
