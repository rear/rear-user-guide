##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `make srpm` and `make rpm`

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Several improvements to the Makefile targets that generate
    distribution packages:

    -   The dist tarball (`dist/$(name)-$(distversion).tar.gz`) has been
        considered always up to date by make, and thus not remade when
        any of the files changed. This has caused "make srpm" (and other
        targets depending on the dist tarball - "make rpm", "make deb"
        etc.) to build packages without newer changes to the sources.  
        Fix by marking `dist/$(name)-$(distversion).tar.gz` as a phony
        target that will be always rebuilt.
    -   The source RPM has been specified as a glob pattern:
        `dist/$(name)-$(version)-*.src.rpm`. This breaks when there are
        multiple source RPMs under dist/ - leftovers from previous
        builds. It forces us to use clean or package-clean always before
        using "make rpm", which is not ideal.  
        Fix by determining the actual full package name (with the dist
        tag) by parsing the spec file and using that.
    -   Do not `%define` rpmrelease in the spec file, define it on the
        command line in Makefile instead. Allows us to eliminate one
        `sed` transform of the spec file to set rpmrelease to the
        desired value.

@pcahyna can you have a look at
[https://github.com/pcahyna/rear/actions/runs/5176475050](https://github.com/pcahyna/rear/actions/runs/5176475050)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/actions/runs/5176703833](https://github.com/rear/rear/actions/runs/5176703833)
worked (current `master` without your change).

In general, for any change to the `Makefile` I kindly ask to keep this
GH Action working and to check that the `tar.gz` is the same (identical)
for every OS.

> @schlomo why are you merging 'master' into this branch, is there some

Yes, I removed Fedora Rawhide from the list of distros as that was
broken and prevented the Build Packages GH Action from working and your
change needs to be tested against that.

Can you please try to fix this?

The reason it is not part of the CI checks is 1) it runs very long and
2) I want to see it stabilize more before adding it.

I thought to maybe run it nightly instead of after every commit, I'll
also add support to publish the resulting binaries via GH.

is that error hidden deep in the logs indeed, but it does not affect the
visible result).  
By the way, I don't see the result of the GitHub action at

the top level and in every subdirectory there should be the same tar.gz
(at least of the same size). See

Do you know what the change is? The previous commit did not have this
problem and I don't see what in the last commit could have broken it.

Sure, although I would not consider it a priority if you are willing to

What's the problem with Fedora Rawhide by the way?
