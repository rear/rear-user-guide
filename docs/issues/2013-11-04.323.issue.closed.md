    Scanning ./backup
    File ./backup/backup.tar.gz.01 is larger than 4GiB-1.
    There is no way do represent this file size. Aborting. See -iso-level 3 or -allow-limited-size options
    2013-11-04 10:43:57 ERROR: Could not create ISO image rear-lnx02_01.iso (with /usr/bin/mkisofs)

From the man page of `mkisofs`:

-allow-limited-size  
When processing files larger than 2GiB which cannot be represented in
ISO9660 level 1 or 2, add them with a shrunk visible file size to
ISO9660 and with the correct visible file size to the UDF system. The
result is an inconsistent filesystem and users need to make sure that
they really use UDF rather than ISO9660 driver to read a such disk.
Implies enabling -udf. See also -iso-level 3

Ran into above error with a configuration like the following
(rescue+backup on same ISO image(s)):

    #-> grep -v \# /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4500
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://lnx01/vol/linux_images_dr/rear

Yes, ISO is limited. Do you feel like submitting an UDF patch?

Is there a reason against always doing UDF? What about booting off UDF  
media?
