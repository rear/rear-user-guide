##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): Fixes \#3375

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    `rear -d mkrescue` before and after the change and check that rootfs
    (`/var/tmp/rear..../rootfs`) has only trivial changes and that
    `/var/tmp/rear..../rootfs/var/` contains the `run -> ../run`
    symlink.

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Introduce a script that can create symlinks and empty directories in
    the rescue ramdisk if they exist in original system. This way one
    can avoid having plenty of empty directories under
    `usr/share/rear/skel`. For now, use it to create the `/var/run`
    symlink. Not having it as an actual symlink in the source tree helps
    avoiding pitfalls associated with symlinks in the source tree, in
    particular the packaging problem that RPM is not able to change a
    directory into a symlink and vice-versa during upgrade (before ReaR
    2.8 it was a directory, not a symlink):
    [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Directory\_Replacement/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Directory_Replacement/)
    and issue \#3375.

Hi @jsmeix , thanks. I will rebase my branch. The problem with the
codespell check is that it is triggered even by what it sees as an error
in the old version, untouched by the commit. So if you ignore the error
once, because it is a false alarm, you will get it again and again.
Which is the situation that we wanted to avoid with Differential
ShellCheck.

Note also that the title of the check in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3380/checks](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3380/checks)
is "ðŸ”¸ Check for Spelling Errors for Changed Files", but this is
misleading, as it then complains about an error in an unchanged file.

Which is weird, as there is this argument:
`--exclude-file ./exclude_file` and ./exclude\_file contains
`./doc/rear-release-notes.txt` as shown in the output of the previous
action.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3380/checks](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3380/checks)  
I see

    /usr/bin/docker ... --rm -e "EXCLUDE_FILE"

so it looks as if the exclude file gets removed?  
But I know nothing at all about how that stuff actually works.

No,

           --rm true|false
              Automatically  remove  the  container  when it exits. The default is
           false.

The question though is whether the file gets passed into the container,
and if yes, whether it is at the path where the command expects it (IOW
whether the working directory of the command is the directory where the
file resides).

@jsmeix in the maintainer talk we talked about not doing a "patch
release" 2.8.1 but just a regular next release 2.9. See the notes for
more context. WDYT?

I edited the milestone "ReaR 2.8.1" title to "ReaR 2.9".  
Personally I don't care much about version numbers  
(except that they must be strictly monotonic increasing).

Seems to me there is still a bug in codespell itself - see

Done.

No, I only wanted to implement @schlomo 's proposal and took me some
time to return to it.

I am now going to do a 2.9 release using the steps from \#3370 and

@pcahyna  
I dare to ask you for a big favour:  
Could you while you are doing it review our  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Release-process)  
and (preferably even pedantically) verify  
to what extent those instructions are accurate?

I modified it a lot during my ReaR 2.8 release  
but I was somewhat under stress at that time  
so my current version is likely not yet OK.

@jsmeix sure! So far I will only skip the release branch creation.

I am glad to see that I did not introduce real mistakes  
by my changes during my ReaR 2.8 release.
