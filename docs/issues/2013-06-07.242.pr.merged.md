There is no reason to define a non-existing Source1 that we create
ourselves. The cron-job is created in %prep so it's not a real "source"
in fact.

There is also no reason to change "rear" by the package name, I know
some people think that is a best practice, but it makes it more
error-prone and doesn't help in readability. And you can't easily grep
for filenames because of it. Explicit trumps implicit. Less abstraction
wins too.
