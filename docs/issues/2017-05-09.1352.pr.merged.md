cleanup linux-functions.sh and some related code  
in 390\_copy\_binariesâ€¦\_libraries.sh and  
in \_input-output-functions.sh as a preparation step  
that is related to solve issue1202

This is a major cleanup.  
I did "rear mkrescue" with and without that changes  
on my SLES12 test system.  
I compared the contents in the two /tmp/rear.XXXX/rootfs  
and both contain same files (in particular same binaries  
and same kernel modules).  
Of course also "rear recover" still works with that changes for me  
so that from my current point of view it looks promising...

In linux-functions.sh I removed the leftover functions  
FindDrivers has\_module has\_any\_module add\_module cp\_bin rpmtopdir  
because those functions are nowhere called (has\_module was only  
called by has\_any\_module and add\_module).  
Here my results in current rear master (without that cleanup):

<pre>
# for f in FindDrivers has_module has_any_module add_module cp_bin rpmtopdir ; do echo $f ; find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ | xargs grep "$f" ; echo ; done

FindDrivers
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:FindDrivers() {

has_module
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:has_module () {
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:          has_module "$module" && return 0
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:          has_module "$module" || modules="$modules $module"

has_any_module
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:has_any_module () {

add_module
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:add_module () {

cp_bin
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:cp_bin () {

rpmtopdir
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:function rpmtopdir () {
</pre>

In linux-functions.sh in the ResolveModules function  
I removed usage of print\_modprobeconf because  
that variable was nowhere set in the code before:

<pre>
# find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ | xargs grep 'print_modprobeconf'

usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:                  if [ "$print_modprobeconf" = 1 ]; then
usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.sh:                          print_modprobeconf=0
</pre>

and I removed usage of $boot\_dir/etc/modprobe.conf  
because boot\_dir is not set in any script that runs before  
build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh  
which is the only script that calls ResolveModules  
so that $boot\_dir is always empty in ResolveModules.  
FYI:  
boot\_dir is used later in output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh as

<pre>
local boot_dir="/boot"
</pre>

but that is useless for ResolveModules and 940\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
is only run when GRUB\_RESCUE is 'true'.

If there are no furious objections  
I would like to merge it tomorrow.

For the fun of it:  
There is now a nice 'awk' gem where the plain code  
is totally incomprehensible without explanatory comments  
(at least for me).
