We actually got some great feedback

@schlomo I wonder if we still need to add this into our sources? This is
something that should be part of the documentation.

The fact that these still come in shows me that it is still relevant.
Also, the info is shown at the end of `rear dump` and I really like this
immediate feedback to users with "somebody else was happy to use ReaR on
your OS".

I'd see showing this on the ReaR homepage as an additional feature and
we could automatically extract it from the source location here as part
of the build process, but we would have to struggle with two repos and
triggering GH workflow runs in the ReaR docs repo each time something
changes in the validations... Not a big prio IMHO.

Finally, people submit it and I want to honor them and their efforts by
publishing it. It was actually my lapse to not do so diligently and I'll
go back to publish them as I receive them. This PR is therefore only
about catching up.
