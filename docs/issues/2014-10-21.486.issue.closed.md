Open issues before patch is ready to migrate:

-   ssh connection didn't find in "auto mode" the
    /root/.ssh/known\_hosts and perhaps also the id\_rsa file - is it
    running without "id root" ?
-   start of init script /etc/init.d/vboxadd
-   mkdir of /vagrant and perhaps additional shared folders if available
-   test/check of auto-mounting /vagrant and additional shared folders
-   if inclusion of user vagrant with homefolder /home/vagrant is not
    wanted i can remove it
-   if vagrant provision is needed on recover instance we need add sudo
    functionality

Testing branch for it:  
[https://github.com/Reiner030/rear/tree/vagrant-integration](https://github.com/Reiner030/rear/tree/vagrant-integration)

Vagrant file with provisioning script and additional files needed:

Dear @Reiner030, could you please also add a "what problem does this
solve" section? Maybe I missed something (sorry), but I am not sure that
I understand what you are trying to achieve. DR tests with the help of
vagrant? Automated testing framework? ReaR as a deployment tool? I would
be happy to understand your goal, maybe I can help with it.

Hello @schlomo , my initial idea was "only" to have /offer easily an
environment that can be used/tested by multiples developers.

But there is also a nice "live" intention to have ReaR support for
VirtualBox because there are projects like
[http://vboxweb.blogspot.de/](http://vboxweb.blogspot.de/) /
[https://code.google.com/p/vboxweb/](https://code.google.com/p/vboxweb/)
and
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvirtualbox/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvirtualbox/)
to setup VirtualBox as "server" hosting.  
I saw also a commercial variant for this:
[http://www.hostedvirtualbox.com/](http://www.hostedvirtualbox.com/) .

Optionally it would also nice to have more support like VMware, Xen
(used e.g. by AWS and JiffyBox) and perhaps further virtualization
environments to have a hoster / "cloud" independent backup solution.

Hello @rainer,

if I was a hoster and wanted to offer a backup solution I would go for
VM  
snapshots + data deduplication. That way I could be independant of
what  
users to inside their VMs (and not have to support my software in
their  
servers!) while keeping backup costs down.

What I could imagine to be really useful would be to be able to do a
quick  
"virtual" recovery test, either on the same machine or on some central  
server.

And of course adding automated integration/system tests would really
help  
to develop ReaR as it would help us to increase code qualitty. Due to
the  
strong ties with hardware and the myriads of different scenarios,
testing  
is IMHO the biggest challange for ReaR development.

Kind Regards,  
Schlomo

Hallo @schlomo

ok, but I am looking "only" onto it from the user-side. I want to be
independent of hosting solutions like Amazon or other providers and
their offered backup solutions. What helps a nice snapshot system if
it's not reachable ? ;)

From this view I find duply/duplicity very helpful because the main
backup mechanism is always secure and the same one. I have only to
switch the backend provider. And ReaR in front of it would make the
solution additional fast recoverable between most plattforms. ;)

I know a company which had only put on AWS Ireland some years ago.The
datacentre gone down and the admin was called after half a day offline
time from his holiday (luckily i wasn't the one).  
He had to setup all servers manually up again ("handmade" by devops)
which took over 2 days but they were faster up again than AWS ... If I
remember right they luckily saved their backup on a German cheap hoster.
^^  
With ReaR (ok, and systems like puppet, chef, salt) it would be even
faster and more easier task).

For developing/testing the above linked patch/branch should be mostly
done. The vbox service would be helpful to have access to outside data /
filestorage if needed.  
Perhaps it make sense to separate the modifications into "provider"
files for each virtualization or environment like it's done for the
different linux variants. But there I have actual no clue howto best
organize it to fit your structure.

Bests

@Reiner030 Do you want to keep this issue open? Or can it be closed?

No feedback since almost one year  
indicate that this issue has become outdated  
so that I like to close it now.  
If needed it could be reopened but preferably  
a new issue based on a current rear version  
should be submitted.
