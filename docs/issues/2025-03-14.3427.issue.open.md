### Requesting support or just a question

HTTP 404 for discussions content links

### Additional information

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681\#issuecomment-928937450](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2681#issuecomment-928937450)  
references a discussion

    In general regaring the size of the ReaR recovery system
    and how it could be reduced see also
    https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2640#discussioncomment-908335

But this discussion comment link and also the plain

    https://github.com/rear/rear/discussions/2640

results now a HTTP 404 "page not found" error.

So my question:  
Did we just throw away our discussions contents  
or are our discussions contents somewhere saved  
so that they are still somewhere public accessible?

I believe we agreed on removing the discussions in our ReaR meetings
long time ago together with the mailing lists.  
However, we did made issues on the discussions that were not covered yet
and could bring some value to ReaR.  
We can talk about it on our next meeting.
