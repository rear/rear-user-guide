In default.conf we have comment:

This is currently not true, because doesn't matter how is
USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING set, dhcp configuration will be triggered in
rear recover.

@gozora  
I think you may have fixed it at the wrong place.

I think prep/GNU/Linux/21\_include\_dhclient.sh is meant  
to prepare the recovery system so that dhclient can be  
used from within the recovery system and the sufficient  
condition for that is a non-empty USE\_DHCLIENT.

I think USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING is not meant  
to have no dhclient binary in the recovery system  
but it is meant that no dhclient binary is automatically  
run in the recovery system.

In short - I would expect that with

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="yes"
</pre>

I get a dhclient binary in the recovery system  
but there is no automated networking setup  
in the recovery system via dhclient.  
I.e. if I want I could run dhclient manually  
in the recovery system.

I think you need to fix it in the system-setup setup scripts  
of the recovery system, probably something like  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh

I guess therein the

<pre>
[[ -z "$USE_DHCLIENT"  ]] && return
</pre>

is insufficient and should be probably something like

<pre>
# without USE_DHCLIENT there is no dhclient binary in the recovery system
# so that networking setup via DHCP is not possible:
test "$USE_DHCLIENT" || return
# with USE_STATIC_NETWORKING no networking setup via DHCP must happen
# see default.conf: USE_STATIC_NETWORKING overrules USE_DHCLIENT
test "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" && return
</pre>

@gdha I added you here because I think you implemented  
USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING and know best how that  
is menat to be used together with USE\_DHCLIENT.

This is exactly what this patch is doing ;-). You have DHCP client bin
in your recovery system it is just not executed.

I can only agree that it makes more sense to put it into
*58-start-dhclient.sh*, will correct it ...

I do not undrestand how with your initial commit via

<pre>
if [[ ! -z "$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]]; then
     REQUIRED_PROGS=( "${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" $DHCLIENT_BIN $DHCLIENT6_BIN )
</pre>

the dhclient binaries get added to the recovery system even for

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
USE_STATIC_NETWORKING="yes"
</pre>

Stupid me!  
The

<pre>
! -z "$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING"
</pre>

condition is obviously already too complicated for me  
(while simultaneously working on
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/963](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/963)
;-)

:-) now it should be more readable ...  
My initial problem was that I've set **USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING** in
*site.conf* which seems not to be parsed during rear recover boot
stage.  
Setting it to *local.conf* works just fine ...
