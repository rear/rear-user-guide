-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): /

-   How was this pull request tested? Manual test

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

I've had the case where I needed to pass custom parameters to lftp.  
This PR introduces a new variable `OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS`  
which can be set in `local.conf` or `site.conf`.

Example usage:

    OUTPUT_LFTP_OPTIONS="set ftp:ssl-force true; set ftp:ssl-protect-data true;"

@vigri  
thank you for your improvement to ReaR!

I am not a lftp user so I cannot test/verify things on my own  
but your code changes look good to me from plain looking at the code.

@rear/contributors  
I would like to have another review by another ReaR maintainer  
to be more on the safe side.

Hello @jsmeix,  
I've made the changes you suggested.

Please let me know, if you think there is a better position inside
`default.conf`.

thank you for your review!

I would like to merge it today afternoon  
if no objections appear until then.

Btw, before this patch one can configure lftp using
`~/.lftprc and ~/.lftp/rc (or ~/.config/lftp/rc if ~/.lftp` as described
in [man](https://lftp.yar.ru/lftp-man.html) .

V.

In general the advantage of ReaR config variables over config files is  
that ReaR config variable settings apply specifically only to
usr/sbin/rear  
both on the original system and also in the ReaR recovery system  
while config files apply to a particular user account or system-wide.

This leads to an interesting question:

Assume the user root has a `/root/.someprog.conf` file.  
Then during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" `someprog` is run  
with the specific settings in `/root/.someprog.conf`  
while during "rear recover" `someprog` is run with its default
settings  
because the ReaR recovery system contains only

    /tmp/rear.3sLuDsk2QvoZSRT/rootfs/root
    /tmp/rear.3sLuDsk2QvoZSRT/rootfs/root/.ssh
    /tmp/rear.3sLuDsk2QvoZSRT/rootfs/root/.ssh/known_hosts
    /tmp/rear.3sLuDsk2QvoZSRT/rootfs/root/.bash_history

where `.bash_history` is a ReaR specific one, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130\_create\_dotfiles.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/build/GNU/Linux/130_create_dotfiles.sh)

Some thoughts from my perspective:

-   As `LFTP_PARAMS` is used only for `OUTPUT` it should be named
    `OUTPUT_LFTP_PARAMS` so that `rear dump` will also show it. At the
    moment it will be very difficult for us to debug problems related to
    wrong params set here.

-   The `LFTP_PARAMS` must end with a semicolon **;** which I find
    dangerous. I strongly suggest to protect the integrity of the code
    by adding that if it is missing (what happens if lftp finds `; ;` in
    the commands?)

While looking at the `lftp` related code I realized some further
aspects, which are not related to this PR:

Concatenating the lftp commands is in general dangerous as it can lead
to quoting related user pain. Maybe instead we should use the `-f`
option to execute a generated script file? That script file could be
composed of initializing stuff that the user can extend via an
`OUTPUT_LFTP_SETUP` variable and contain also the generated lines that
are now given via `-c`.

I can imagine that this approach will increase the stability of our
lftp-related features and also make it easier to debug those as the
script file would be stored in our temp are and could be written to
debug log before execution.

For this PR I would therefore suggest to at least rename the variable to
be more consistent with the variable names and to support `rear dump`.
Rewriting the lftp calls can then be also done later.

I agree that a more specific variable name like `OUTPUT_LFTP_PARAMS`  
is better because a generic variable name like `LFTP_PARAMS`  
will cause problems if in the future `lftp` might be called in another
context,  
cf. the section "Code must be easy to read" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
that reads in particular "Variables and functions must have names  
that explain what they do, even if it makes them longer. "

In general our user config variable names are rather inconsistent.  
For example we have `ISO_MKISOFS_OPTS`  
that is also only OUTPUT related and  
it has `OPTS` instead of `PARAMS` while others have `OPTIONS`  
and so on...

This is a good point. I'll think about that and refactor the code.

@vigri @schlomo  
in general regarding user config variable value syntax checks:

In general we don't do syntax checks in ReaR.  
Usually the user is free to set arbitrary stuff  
and then things may just fail arbitrarily.  
For one single example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2206](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2206)

Im very many cases we don't even error out in ReaR  
in the first place when mandatory program calls fail  
but let things blindly proceed until things fall apart later  
at an arbitrary unexpected place with an inexplicable  
and weird error message.  
Here the best example is our  
`More than 128 partitions is not supported`  
error message that one can get when  
"something went wrong in the layout code"  
cf. the comment in the code  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh\#L405](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh#L405)

So what we should do first and foremost is to error out  
in the first place when a mandatory program call fails.

In particular we can easily error out during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
because here it does not cause harm to error out because the user can  
relatively easily correct things and re-run "rear mkrescue/mkbackup".

Cf. "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

In contrast we usually do not error out during "rear recover"  
after the backup was successfully restored because at that late state  
of the recovery it is better for the user to only inform him when
things  
like recreating the initrd/initramfs or installing the bootloader
failed  
and finish "rear recover" nevertheless than to abort "rear recover".

When recreating the initrd/initramfs or installing the bootloader
failed  
the user can after "rear recover" finished still in the ReaR recovery
system  
manually recreate his initrd/initramfs and/or install his the
bootloader  
e.g. via chroot into the recreated system
`chroot /mnt/local bash --login`  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/890\_finish\_checks.sh\#L23](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/default/890_finish_checks.sh#L23)

For example assume recreating the initrd/initramfs failed but  
installing the bootloader worked then the recreated system  
could be perfectly OK (the user must decide whether or not)  
because often it is not needed to recreate the initrd/initramfs  
because usually booting works with the initrd/initramfs from  
the original system that was restored from the backup.  
This is in particular when the hardware (it could also be virtual
hardware)  
of the replacement system did not change compared to the original
system  
so that the original system initrd/initramfs also works  
on the replacement hardware.

@vigri in such cases (give error message for failed external commands)
it helps to create a local temporary variable, e.g. `llftp_call_args`
that is then used both for `lftp` and in the error message if `lftp`
fails. Thus users have a chance to spot the problem immediately.

And - by the way - in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382)  
we are right now developing a method to show  
a program's STDOUT and STDERR both in ReaR's log file  
and on the user's terminal, see in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r417852393](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r417852393)  
and the subsequent comments therein.

So if `lftp` is normally quiet on STDERR we may show  
the `lftp` STDERR output on the user's terminal  
so that he can immediately see when there is  
e.g. a syntax error in the `lftp` command  
for example with something like

    lftp ... 2>> >( tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE 1>&8 )

@schlomo  
could you have a look at my questions in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r419378558](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r419378558)

Perhaps you could help me to better understand what actually  
goes on behind the surface with such advanced nested redirections  
together with (possibly also nested) process substitutions?
