@jsmeix  
I am aware of your recent changes to array variable handling. This is
just another one I had detected by looking at the log file.

related discussion: \#2220

In that issue, I advocated removing such empty elements in lists, while
@jsmeix advocated guarding against them in places which iterate over
those lists, i.e. make sure everything behaves properly even in presence
of those empty items.

@OliverO2  
thank you for finding more such cases!

I know that my current regexp

    grep -q '[[:alpha:]_][[:alpha:]_]*=( "${[[:alpha:]_][[:alpha:]_]*\[@\]'

cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2364\#issue-599621303](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2364#issue-599621303)  
does not find all of them but I use it as a start to find most of them  
and after I had fixed those I will do some more advanced search.

Those dummy initial empty array elements are no longer needed  
when `ARRAY+=( additional elements )` is used everywhere.  
It also works to initialize an array: `new_arr+=( initial elements )`  
so `arr=( some elemets )` is only needed to overwrite an existing array.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a266b3c88002ce2d1e0569512b55ffd6bbcaf008](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/a266b3c88002ce2d1e0569512b55ffd6bbcaf008)  
the dummy initial empty array elements usage is fixed in  
usr/share/rear/conf/Linux-i386.conf

I also found dummy initial empty array elements usage in  
usr/share/rear/prep/YUM/default/400\_prep\_yum.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/prep/ZYPPER/default/400\_prep\_zypper.sh  
where things look a bit more complicated

@pcahyna  
I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say e.g. in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220\#issuecomment-527479184](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220#issuecomment-527479184)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c19647fcd95f0c3f4020f39f5fad428e8359ec92\#r32912521](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c19647fcd95f0c3f4020f39f5fad428e8359ec92#r32912521)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c19647fcd95f0c3f4020f39f5fad428e8359ec92\#r32912816](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/c19647fcd95f0c3f4020f39f5fad428e8359ec92#r32912816)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220\#issuecomment-527629760](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220#issuecomment-527629760)

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220\#issuecomment-526612502](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220#issuecomment-526612502)

    So my current conclusion is to revert those things (in particular the dummy
    array elements) that I had added to make the code work with 'set -u'
    because those added stuff breakes other code at other places.

Therefore  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2364](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2364)  
is one part to clean up our old clumsy array usage in ReaR.

Another part is to get rid of those dummy empty array elements.

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/81f1345f67fa80e05c6eedec392a43721f6fe2d8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/81f1345f67fa80e05c6eedec392a43721f6fe2d8)  
this issue should be (hopefully completely) fixed.

@jsmeix @OliverO2 Thank you both for your extended effort to improve
ReaR - we are proud to have members as you.
