Hello guys,

In
[system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh)
we have following code:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ed61745b98048b59e1990be591210d6a324e485a/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh\#L4](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ed61745b98048b59e1990be591210d6a324e485a/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh#L4)

Which just simply checks if `USE_DHCLIENT` is empty or not, so if one
uses `USE_DHCLIENT=no`, content of script will be executed regardless.

I've found similar problem here as well:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ed61745b98048b59e1990be591210d6a324e485a/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh\#L111](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ed61745b98048b59e1990be591210d6a324e485a/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh#L111)

So again, if one have explicit `USE_DHCLIENT=no` set (and empty
`USE_STATIC_NETWORKING`), his network configuration in ReaR recovery
system will be skipped.

Since comment in
[default.conf](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2571)
states (allows both Yes/No values):

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ed61745b98048b59e1990be591210d6a324e485a/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2571-L2574](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ed61745b98048b59e1990be591210d6a324e485a/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2571-L2574)

I think that mentioned conditions should be changed to something like:

    [[ -z "$USE_DHCLIENT" ||  $USE_DHCLIENT =~ [fF]$|[nN]$|[nN][oO]$|[fF][aA][lL][sS][eE]$|0$ ]]

resp:

    [[ "\$USE_DHCLIENT" =~ [tT]\$|[yY]\$|[yY][eE][sS]\$|[tT][rR][uU][eE]\$|1\$ && -z "\$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return

What do you think?

V.

Sigh!  
This is just another legacy code part of the old "binary" variables
handling  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L27](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L27)  
that needs to be made fail-safe and (as side-effect) more user-friendly.

In system setup `skel` scripts we can use the `is_true` and `is_false`  
functions because we source lib/global-functions.sh in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00-functions.sh\#L30](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00-functions.sh#L30)  
(and etc/scripts/system-setup.d/00-functions.sh is sourced  
by etc/scripts/system-setup which is run by PID1/init/systemd).

For an example where `is_true` and `read_and_strip_file` are used see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh\#L266](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh#L266)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh\#L105](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh#L105)

By the way via

    # cd rear.github.master
    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep 'USE_DHCLIENT' | grep -v ': *#' | less

I found

    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh:[[ ! -z "\$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "\$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return
    usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/350_routing.sh:[[ ! -z "\$USE_DHCLIENT" && -z "\$USE_STATIC_NETWORKING" ]] && return

i.e.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310\_network\_devices.sh\#L111](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/310_network_devices.sh#L111)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/350\_routing.sh\#L37](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/350_routing.sh#L37)  
which write same kind of conditions into  
the generated system setup scripts

    network_devices_setup_script=$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

and

    network_routing_setup_script=$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/62-routing.sh

This makes things bit easier. Thanks for "heads up!"

I'll prepare PR (hopefully) soon!
