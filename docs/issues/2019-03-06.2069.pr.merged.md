-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

Hopefully low impact because this change should only  
make things work better by default in the recovery system  
without really bad side effects.  
The somewhat bigger default recovery system should  
not be a really bad side effect.

There is one backward incompatible change:  
Before the user had to specify in local.conf

    MODULES=( "${MODULES[@]}" 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )

to get additional kernel modules included  
but now the user must specify

    MODULES=( 'moduleX' 'moduleY' )

for that because with `"${MODULES[@]}"`  
the default value `all_modules` would be kept  
which triggers to get all modules included.

-   How was this pull request tested?

By me on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system with

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
    MODULES=( 'loaded_modules' )
    MODULES=( 'no_modules' )
    MODULES=( 'hwpoison-inject' 'trusted' )
    MODULES=()

and to me things look o.k.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Now there is in default.conf

    MODULES=( 'all_modules' )

which results that some additional adaptions were needed  
in build/GNU/Linux/400\_copy\_modules.sh and conf/GNU/Linux.conf  
because now the default value is no longer empty.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it today afternoon
and  
if hell breakes loose afterwards I can fix it or even revert it for ReaR
2.5. ;-)
