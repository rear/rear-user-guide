Normally rear should find the kernel on Ubuntu without any special
configuration. Could check if the file  
`/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)`  
is available.

Is it possible that your /boot dir is on a separate partition which is
not mounted while running rear?

A few other options:

-   you run your own custom kernel that is using a different
    naming-convention ?
-   you updated your kernel (a few times) and the currently running
    kernel is no longer available on the system ?

I wonder if there's a better way to find the currently running kernel
without having to reside to a standard (or distribution-specific) naming
convention. Something from */sys/kernel/* or */proc/* ?

How should the kernel know from where it came? That information is
private to the boot loader. So we should find out how to ask the boot
loader.

I think in ReaR we should actively support distro-specific ways to
install a kernel. If the user does something custom then the user should
also tell ReaR where to find the kernel image.

Just as the bootloader informs the kernel of the command line arguments,
the bootloader could inform the kernel of its own location. I know there
is probably little use for this (contrary to the command line, which is
the purpose), but in our case there is some value. Even when the
location (boot-device + filename) may not be available or even
resolvable.

Compare this to binaries that get invoked, a binary *does* know its own
name (e.g. $0 or argv\[0\] or $ARGV\[0\] or sys.argv\[0\]). It's not
inconceivable to have a similar mechanism.

Sure. But how do you get popular boot loaders to hand this information
to the kernel?

Could be the same convention, first argument is a device/filename tupple
(in whatever format is acceptable/agreed). Of course this requires a
modification to the bootloader, however it should not require a
modification to the kernel itself. Except of course if the kernel would
do something with that information, somehow. Would be useful to us in
this case.

We cannot really ask the bootloader because we don't know (and it surely
doesn't either) what entry (if still available) is acceptable for the
running kernel. We could try and grep for versions on kernel-option
lines for each individual bootloader configuration file, but that's
problematic. And even then we wouldn't be sure why we cannot find it on
disk.

@thumm Indeed, in /boot there isn't my current kernel. I discovered a
problem with all the updates in my ubuntu - I think grub 2 killed me.
I'll be back when my system does what it should ...

I am going to close this issue as we know what caused it and we have no
means of preventing it in 100% of the cases. Do feel free to reopen if
there's new information.
