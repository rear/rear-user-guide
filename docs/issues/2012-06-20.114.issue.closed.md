We would like to migrate the users and archive from the Sourceforge
mailing list to our own setup for 2 main reasons:

-   Sourceforge adds advertissements to mails
-   The archive is hard to browse (and not well indexed by Google)

The aim is to move:

-   rear-announce -&gt; <rear-announce@lists.relax-and-recover.org>
-   rear-users -&gt; <rear-users@lists.relax-and-recover.org>
-   new: <rear-devel@lists.relax-and-recover.org>

And while moving, to also get rid of the added advertissements to each
mail.
