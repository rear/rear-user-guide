Hi,  
On RHEL 6.4 with lvm on three hard drive (sda, sdb, sdc and boot
partition on sda1) :

The ouput of lsblk :

Rear install grub on sda, sdb, and sdc.

The question is did your system boot up properly?

Yes only if the first boot order is on sda.

Hum, seems to me we might have hit one of the problems with grub itself
- see
[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grub/2009-11/msg00024.html](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grub/2009-11/msg00024.html)

@dagwieers in script 21\_install\_grub.sh you've added the check:

    if (( $? == 0 )); then
        NOBOOTLOADER=
    fi

I wonder shouldn't we have foreseen an exit out of the do-loop when grub
was successful?

I don't understand the aim of the do-loop.  
When Rear restore a system with 2 or more disks. Rear have to install
Grub only on the MBR of one disk (which contains the boot partition).

I don't know the exact reason anymore, but @dagwieers had a good
explanation for why we should do it on all disks. I think it was
multipath related.

Is it causing problems?

With any kind of MPIO or SW RAID you should anticipate booting off any
of  
the related devices.

BTW, if you don't test that "feature" then it probably won't work (sad  
experience I made with SW RAID and first disk broken).

Yes Schlomo, that's indeed the explanation.

We had to recover machines with a software RAID over two HW RAID
controllers. In order to let them boot reliably we had to add the loop.

IMHO, any disk with a copy of the OS on it should be bootable. If we
don't  
know which disks have an OS on it, then better make them all bootable.

However, the question here is: did every disk contain a boot partition?
Apparently not, so it might be that we should check this first before
applying blindly grub on it - as I said before the exit code of the old
grub is bad (or always 0 even if it fails).

Is there something that fails when you add multiple MBRs?

If not, the comments in finalize/Linux-i386/21\_install\_grub.sh seem to
indicate we encountered a case where we needed to boot from another disk
and that it was fixed by adding it to all disks. As long as that's not
causing problems, I would continue to do so.

Do we all agree it is the expected behavior? As long as the system boots
up properly it is not considered as a problem.

It's not causing problems for the moment.  
But I'm interested by explanations of @dagwieers.

guess we better close this issue?
