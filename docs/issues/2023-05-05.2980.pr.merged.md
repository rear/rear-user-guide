##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    manually on Ubu2204

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This PR makes the SYSLINUX timeout at OUTPUT=ISO configurable.

This setting can save time during tests. Especially if you are too lazy
to start the graphical VNC console of a VM. ðŸ˜ƒ

@codefritzel  
thank you for your enhancement  
that provides final power to the user  
at one more place where things were hardcoded before!

@rear/contributors  
I would like to merge it next Monday afternoon  
unless there are objections from you.

If you see a big value in setting the boot loader timeout separate from
the general user input timeout then I'd love to see a unified variable
for that, which is recognised by all our boot methods (ISO with syslinux
or with UEFI, PXE, USB, GRUB ...). Having different variables for the
same purpose for different boot loaders is not user friendly IMHO.

If you don't want to put in that effort then I'd suggest to simply use
the `USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT` *also* for syslinux as a small improvement
step.

I think it would be better to create a new variable `BOOTLOADER_TIMEOUT`
for this purpose.

@schlomo I really like this suggestion, we have already too many output
and bootloader (or both) specific configuration variables (the various
`ISO` or `GRUB` or `BIOS` variables, of course some of them are
specific, but some are not).

Since the variables are already there, unifying them would be a breaking
change and thus a great (IMO) topic for 3.0 (

@pcahyna @schlomo  
feel free to contribute such a general cleanup  
of our long grown pile of various kind of  
messy recovery system bootloader stuff.  
It would be more than very much appreciated!  
I cannot do that because I am not at all a bootloader expert.  
All I can do is a tiny fix here a tiny fix there limited  
to what I can imagine that (hopefully) no regressions happen.

@schlomo  
could you approve its current state if it is OK for you  
(your change request from 3 days ago is still there)?

I would like to merge it tomorrow afternoon  
unless there are other objections.
