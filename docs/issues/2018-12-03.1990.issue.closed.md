Hi

I have created a backup successfully with no errors on my NFS server
from a machine. Then during examining the log file, I encountered
multiple statements stating: **"tar: /...../ : file changed as we read
it".**

1.  Is the archived file healthy? Is the whole backup healthy and
    recoverable?

2.  Although these files may not be important in many cases, I wanted to
    know how ReaR treats these files. Consider a huge database file that
    changes as ReaR tires to back it up. what would happen to these huge
    files?

3.  If the huge file gets damaged by this method, is there any other
    ways to backup the machine using rear to keep the file healthy?

Thanks in advance !

It is your task to ensure your backup is consistent.

Cf. the paragraph about "What 'consistent backup' means" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

E.g. you may have to stop certain running processes  
(e.g. whatever services or things like that)  
that could be also running while the backup is done  
(and re-enable them after the backup was done).

ReaR only calls the backup tool (in your case `tar`)  
but ReaR does not do anything to ensure none of the files change  
that get included in your backup while the backup tool runs  
(because ReaR cannot know what to do to ensure that).

Cf. the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)
