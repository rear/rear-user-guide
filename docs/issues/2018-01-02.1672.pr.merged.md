-   moved function to find duply conf file to global-functions.sh as it
    is used by the prep and restore phase

-   new script (110\_check\_temp\_dir\_with\_duply.sh) to make sure the
    TEMP\_DIR is /mnt/local/tmp instead of tmp (to avoid out of disk
    space) and it must be located in the restore dir and not in the
    verify as /mnt/local is not created yet at that time

-   Be a bit more verbose in script 150\_restore\_duply.sh  
    ***This should fix all implementation issues with the `duply`
    wrapper for duplicity (issue \#1664)***

Will merge it as it worked for me - still need to test duplicity on its
own (without using the wrapper)
