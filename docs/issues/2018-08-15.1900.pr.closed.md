@ayushdewan  
many thanks for your general attempt to enhance the current  
automated ReaR testing also for the POWER architecture.

In particular regarding POWER specific issues  
@schabrolles is our ReaR upstream expert.

In particular regarding automated ReaR testing  
@gdha is our ReaR upstream expert, see in particular his  
[https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests](https://github.com/rear/rear-integration-tests)

Regarding this particular pull request:

The current code for the `validate` target in Makefile  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/Makefile)  
basically only calls `bash -n` for usr/sbin/rear and all ReaR scripts  
and the ReaR config files (i.e. all what gets sourced) via (excerpt)

<pre>
        find etc/ usr/share/rear/conf/ -name '*.conf' | xargs -n 1 bash -n
        bash -n $(rearbin)
        find . -name '*.sh' | xargs -n 1 bash -O extglob -O nullglob -n
</pre>

i.e. curently the `validate` target only validates plain bash syntax  
but there is not any kind of functional validation (nothing is actually
run).

Accordingly I would assume that validating the plain bash syntax  
is currently sufficient for one single `os = linux` in .travis.yml  
so that I wonder what the actual benefit of this pull request is  
that would validate the plain bash syntax additionally for  
`os = linux-ppc64le`.

@ayushdewan  
could you explain what your goal behind this pull request is  
and/or what I perhaps misunderstand?

My goal for this pull request was just to make sure that new versions of
the repository still support builds on Power but it seems like it will
regardless of whether its specified in the .travis.yml.

@ayushdewan  
I never had any problem "building" rear on POWER. As it is based on
Shell script, I'm not sure we need something special to make it work on
POWER. IMHO, Most of the specificities of POWER arch must be handled
inside the current ReaR code.
