##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

Fixes \#2434. (problem introduced in PR \#2293).

-   How was this pull request tested?

Success was reported by @yontalcar in \#2434 (for RHEL 7 and RHEL 8 only
though).

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Sometimes the search command in GRUB2 used in UEFI ISO does not find the
root device. This was seen at least in Debian Buster running in Qemu
(VirtualBox works fine, RHEL/CentOS in Qemu works fine as well).

To make ReaR work in this case, set $root to a sensible value before
trying `search`. The GRUB2 image created by grub-mkstandalone has $root
set to memdisk, which can't work.

This essentially matches how it used to work before PR \#2293.

@gozora  
I dared to assign it to you because I spotted `UEFI` soewhere here ;-)  
(of course I will also have a look)

@gozora  
feel free to merge it if things look OK for you  
(in particular when my comment describes things correctly).
