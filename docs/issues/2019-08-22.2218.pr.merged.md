-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    The rear package in Fedora and derived distributions drops a file to
    /etc/cron.d which runs `rear mkrescue`.  
    When the recovery system is broken (an example is \#2144),
    `rear mkrescue` will fail and leave the build area behind, without
    giving a hint that the build area should be removed (because this
    hit is printed only when running rear with the -v flag).  
    This change:
    -   does not disable the removal of the build area when used
        noninteractively - instead it gives a hint how to keep the build
        area should one really want it
    -   when the build area is kept, print a more prominent message,
        even when run without -v.

according to a review by @xjezda00, I introduced a new variable
`KEEP_BUILD_DIR_ON_ERRORS` which can be used to restore the previous
behaviour of keeping the build dir on errors always by setting it to

Offhandedly I think I did it wrong to set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 in a
script  
because this is against what the user specified and I am in general
against it  
when ReaR works in an automated way against the user because I want  
the user to always have the final power.

So if the user wants to keep the build directory for whatever reason  
he can run ReaR with the -D option or he can specify
KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1  
in his etc/rear/local.conf file.

So from my current point of view I think the right, clean, and simple
solution is  
to remove the KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 settings from the
990\_verify\_rootfs.sh script.

Furthermore that I had not added a comment that explains why I thought  
it would be right to set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
(which is against
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style))  
basically proves that I had done that without a real good reason.

Finally that the current attempts to solve it result more and more  
complicated code indicate that the actual root cause is "something
else"  
(i.e. the actual root cause are my wrong hardcoded KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1  
settings in the 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh script).

I found it strange as well. Just removing it would be definitely a
simplification, but it would be less helpful for debugging of errors, as
@xjezda00 pointed out in
[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1693608\#c4](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1693608#c4)
. I would recommend keeping the error message part of the PR if this
solution is accepted:

@schlomo  
I added you as reviewer here because I would like to get your opinion  
about the generic issue that lays behind here:

I had added a hardcoded KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
when that script detects an error in the ReaR recovery system so that  
the user could directy inspect the contents of the recovery system  
without the need to re-run "rear mkrescue" with the -D option  
or with KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 explicitly set by the user.

But this way it works in case of an error against what the user had  
specified when he runs it without -D or without KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1.

@pcahyna  
more clear messages that help the user to better understand what goes
on  
are much appreciated.

By the way:

Another generic improvement could be to make KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR a ternary
variable  
(but that requires changes at all places where KEEP\_BUILD\_IR is
used)  
so that the user gets real final power to enforce "yes" or "no" as he
wants.

Currently KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="no" behaves same as KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1  
because of the "non-empty means yes" boolean behaviour in ReaR, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh\#L124](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/framework-functions.sh#L124)  
which is confusing for the user and currently we cannot decide in our
code  
if the user actually wants "no" when KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR is empty.  
I.e. currently we cannot distinguish between the default value  
and an enforced user setting.

That was my thinking as well. I wanted to use the empty value as meaning
"not set by user", but then I realized that it already means "false".
Unfortunately, switching it to ternary means a compatibility break. By
the way, your reasoning that "non-empty means yes" is confusing for the
user is valid, but applies to most of the variables, because this
boolean (not ternary) semantics is very common in ReaR.

@pcahyna  
I don't think that switching it to ternary means a compatibility break  
as long as "empty" means "no" by default/fallback  
(and "yes" if the -D option is used).

But an explicit KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="no" would enforce  
that BUILD\_DIR is never kept.

This way we would be able to set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="yes" in a script  
but only if it is not already set to "no".

And then we might even still set it in 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh as
follows  
(provided we come to the conclusion it is really a good idea to do that)

    if ERROR_CONDITION ; then
        # Keep BUILD_DIR for easier debugging of the error
        # unless the user had explicitly specified he never wants that:
        is_false "$KEEP_BUILD_DIR" || KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"
        Error "..."

@jsmeix Indeed, this we do not break compatibility in the usual case,
where the user sets KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR to a string accepted by `is_true`
to indicate `yes`. (Potential problem is, anything that is not false and
is not empty is now treated as true, which would not be compatible with
the change. (A particularly silly case is if the user sets
KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR to 0 or "no" to mean "yes".))

Still, your snippet does not address the concern that by default,
automated runs of ReaR clutter /tmp on errors. We could do

    if ! is_false "$KEEP_BUILD_DIR" && tty -s; then
       KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"

but it would be not possible to get the previous behaviour (keep the
build dir on error only) - @xjezda00 's concern.

    if ! is_false "$KEEP_BUILD_DIR" &&  { tty -s || test "$KEEP_BUILD_DIR" == errors; }; then
       KEEP_BUILD_DIR="yes"

would do it (there would be a special value "errors" which would
indicate, keep it only on errors).

What to do with scripts that check the value of KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR before
990\_verify\_rootfs.sh modifies it? Such as
build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/391\_list\_executable\_dependencies.sh (
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659/files\#diff-94b2089c3ecae157af07001369db4783](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659/files#diff-94b2089c3ecae157af07001369db4783)
), which is now maybe the only one, but in the future there may be more
of them.

@pcahyna  
I would assume that users who set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR to a strange value  
have to expect strange things ;-)  
When someone sets it to "no" and now it behaves this way,  
I think this change is rather a fix than a regression.  
When someone sets it to 'X' that neither `is_true` nor `is_false`  
he wold get the default behaviour which is a minor regression for him.  
Of course we would document such a change in the release notes  
so the users are informed.  
I think we cannot keep 100.0% backward compatibility in any case  
when there is a good reason for a change with minimal regressions.  
We did several such changes in the past, cf. the various  
"backward incompatible changes" parts in our release notes  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)

I like variables that have in the end a boolean 'yes/no' meaning  
but also support enhanced ways to specify more exactly how things are
meant  
so I like it when KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="errors" means "yes but only in case
of errors".

I do not see a problem with scripts that check KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR.  
For example `if is_true $KEEP_BUILD_DIR; then` in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659/files\#diff-94b2089c3ecae157af07001369db4783](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1659/files#diff-94b2089c3ecae157af07001369db4783)  
looks fine to me in particular when KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR gets ternary
semantics.

Ok, I will update the PR to introduce this semantics instead of
`KEEP_BUILD_DIR_ON_ERRORS`.

The problem is that this script checks the value, then
990\_verify\_rootfs.sh changes it to something else (it is sourced
after).

@pcahyna  
you are right.

I had thought 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh sets KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1  
only when it errors out.

But now I see there are two cases where 990\_verify\_rootfs.sh  
sets KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 but does not error out later:

    if contains_visible_char "$broken_binaries" ; then
        LogPrintError "There are binaries or libraries in the ReaR recovery system that need additional libraries"
        KEEP_BUILD_DIR=1
        ...
                        LogPrintError "$binary requires additional libraries (specified as non-fatal)"
        ...
                LogPrintError "$binary requires additional libraries"

In those two cases `fatal_missing_library="yes"` is not set.  
This needs to be corrected because there is no reason  
to automatically keep BUILD\_DIR when there is no error.

I mean that in those two cases where `fatal_missing_library="yes"`  
is (correctly) not set, it needs to be corrected that
KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1  
is set.  
E.g. the KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 at the beginning of the `if` clause  
must be removed and at each place where `fatal_missing_library="yes"` is
set  
also KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 must be set.  
Alternatively KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1 can be set directly before the BugError
and Error calls  
at the end of the script.

@jsmeix I had something else in mind than the problem you have found.
The issue is that
`build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/391_list_executable_dependencies.sh` gets
sourced, `KEEP_BUILD_DIR` is not true, then `990_verify_rootfs.sh` gets
sourced and can set `KEEP_BUILD_DIR` to true. But
`build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/391_list_executable_dependencies.sh` behaved
as if it were not true, i.e. the behaviour was inconsistent with the
final value.

As far as I understand the code in  
build/OPALPBA/Linux-i386/391\_list\_executable\_dependencies.sh  
the intent is to do that when the user had set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR.  
@OliverO2 may explain his intent behind here in more detail.

In contrast we set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR automatically in  
990\_verify\_rootfs.sh only when it errors out because  
here the intent is to make debugging easier for the user.

So I think that both intents are independent of each other  
so that the default behaviour does not need to be the same  
for different intents.

For me a crucial point is "final power to the user" so that an  
explicit user setting KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR="no" must be obeyed  
which means we must not automatically set KEEP\_BUILD\_DIR=1  
i.e. ReaR must not work against what its user has specified.

this should be the effect of the last changes. I rebased the last commit
to include updates to the description in default.conf, so it is ready to
be reviewed, and, after testing, merged.

@rear/contributors  
I am still not in the office and will not be for some more weeks  
so I cannot actually test anything in ReaR.  
Therefore I would appreciate it when one of you  
could also review it and merge it if it is o.k.
