@jsmeix your rework of function *efiboot\_img\_size()* was implemented
(for me a bit harder to read, but it does its job well after all ;-)).

@gozora  
many thanks for your feedback about readability of  
my efiboot\_img\_size code from your point of view.

Can you describe why my code is harder to read for you.

I like to provide code that is well understandable by others.

Background information:

I am very interested in comprehensibility of source code.

For me the primary purpose of source code is  
to tell others what the author of the code had in mind  
what the computer should do  
and how and why it should do it  
from the author's point of view.

This way others who read the author's code  
can easily understand what the author had in mind  
so that others can - as neded - easily fix issues  
or adapt and enhance the author's code.

For me it is only a secondary condition that code  
correctly tells the computer what to do.

If code fulfills its primary purpose (telling others  
what it does and why), then even code that is  
not correct can be easily corrected (by others).

In contrast if code only fulfills the secondary condition  
(it only works correctly) but for others it is hard to  
understand what is meant with that code, then  
such code cannot be well maintained so that  
in the end such code will die out (and be completely  
replaced with code that can be easily maintained  
by others).

Don't take my self as some reference for coding style, I'm rather hobby
programmer than professional developer, so I certainly lack routine in
reading other peoples code and more importantly I often have trouble to
understand other people intentions in code. So if something is hard to
read for ME, it doesn't mean author did something wrong, it means that I
need to work on my skills ;-).  
C uses similar shortcuts (I think it is called ternary if) e.g.
`result = a > b ? x : y;` but I don't like them much as they are quite
unreadable (or you must boost your brain thinking what will happen in
which case). I much rather like `if [else if] else` as they can be read
as a book and you have output from somehow smooth ...

Please take all this as my personal opinion, maybe you could discuss
this with more experienced programmers or maybe some who actually
teaches programming, because such discussion certainly needs someone
with academical/teaching skills.

Just for the fun of it:

Lucky you! - when you only "often have trouble to understand  
other people intentions in code".

Poor me! - because I almost always have trouble to understand  
other people intentions in code.

Usually I do understand what code does  
(i.e. the low level implementation details)  
but I do not understand the reasoning behind.

E.g. what is the intention behind:

<pre>
#! /bin/bash
j=0
for i in $( seq 1 2 $(( 2 * $1 - 1 )) )
do (( j += i ))
done
echo $j
</pre>

Well I guess you encounter much more alien code daily as I do...  
Anyhow that code looks like bad joke interview question :-).

@gozora  
only FYI:  
My above code is no "bad joke interview question".  
I made it myself while I wrote

It sums odd numbers, nice!  
Did you use this in some project?

That it sums odd numbers is the low level implementation detail  
(i.e. what the code does) but what is the intent behind?  
I.e. why should one sum odd numbers?

A hint why one should sum odd numbers:

1

<pre>
A
</pre>

1 + 3

<pre>
B B
A B
</pre>

1 + 3 + 5

<pre>
C C C
B B C
A B C

1 + 3 + 5 + 7

D D D D
C C C D

or is this some strange way how to calculate power of some number?

Yes!

The purpose is calculating the square number of its input "$1":

<pre>
# cat -n ./sq.sh
     1  #! /bin/bash
     2  j=0
     3  for i in $( seq 1 2 $(( 2 * $1 - 1 )) )
     4  do (( j += i ))
     5  done
     6  echo $j
# ./sq.sh 1
1
# ./sq.sh 2
4
# ./sq.sh 3
9
# ./sq.sh 123
15129
</pre>

You are welcome!

And finally here same functionality implemented  
with meaningful code:

<pre>
# cat -n ./square_number.sh
     1  #! /bin/bash
     2  # calculate the square number N^2 of its input N
     3  # by summing up the first N odd numbers 1 3 ... 2*N-1
     4  # where each nth partial sum is the nth square number
     5  # see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number#Properties
     6  N=$1
     7  if ! [[ $N =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]
     8  then echo "Input must be non-negative integer." 1>&2
     9       exit 1
    10  fi
    11  square_number=0
    12  for odd_number in $( seq 1 2 $(( 2 * N - 1 )) )
    13  do (( square_number += odd_number ))
    14  done
    15  echo "$N^2 = $square_number"
# ./square_number.sh 
Input must be non-negative integer.
# ./square_number.sh 0
0^2 = 0
# ./square_number.sh 1
1^2 = 1
# ./square_number.sh 2
2^2 = 4
# ./square_number.sh 3
3^2 = 9
# ./square_number.sh 123
123^2 = 15129
# ./square_number.sh -123
Input must be non-negative integer.
