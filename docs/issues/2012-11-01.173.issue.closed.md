I would like to take only OS or selected partitions backup to restore on
different system. Is there any configuration file where I can tell the
rear backup to exclude any particular partition or mounts.

See the
[documentation](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.txt)
as well as in `/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf` on your system.
Parameters should be set in `/etc/rear/local.conf`.
