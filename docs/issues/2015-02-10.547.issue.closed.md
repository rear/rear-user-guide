Hi,

First off what a fantastic idea this software is, thank you to all
involved with creating it.

One small issue I had was that I needed to start portmap when restoring
from an nfs backup for an elastix install (based on centos).

The version of rear I was using was:  
Relax-and-Recover 1.16.1-git201502062215 / 2015-02-06

It was failing when the restore process was trying to mount the nfs
share. Starting portmap on the command line  
: portmap  
before running  
: rear recover  
cured the problem.

Regards,

Darren

Could you run `rear dump` once to see some more details about your
distro?

@djsharman When you run `rear recover` then script
`/usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/08_start_required_daemons.sh` will
be called automatically which should start the `portmap` daemon. Could
you verify the rear.log file to check if you find anything?

@gdha,

Having a look in the log, it seems like the

verify/NETFS/default/06\_mount\_NETFS\_path.sh

script falls over before I see any mention of the

verify/NETFS/default/08\_start\_required\_daemons.sh

script being called.

I'm not sure what is setting the sequence of the scripts starting  
(filename?), but this does seem like a smoking gun.

Full log is below in case it helps.

Regards,

Darren

@djsharman that is what I like! Very good catch indeed. I've fixed it in
the meantime.
