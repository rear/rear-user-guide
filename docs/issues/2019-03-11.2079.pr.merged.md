##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High** (in specific Btrfs use cases, ReaR recover would
    fail)

-   Reference to related issue (URL):
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2067](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2067)

-   How was this pull request tested? On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS with
    different combinations of Btrfs file systems and subvolume
    hierarchies.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR aims to recreate all Btrfs file systems which have been mounted
on the original system. It is a re-write of the original Btrfs subvolume
code.

Although this code is simpler and focuses on mounted subvolumes only,
its effects are intended to be entirely compatible with Btrfs scenarios
addressed previously (e.g. using `snapper`). The assumptions are:

1.  *All* Btrfs subvolumes, which were actually mounted on the original
    system, are relevant for recovery and will finally be populated with
    backup data (or if not, at least their existence won't hurt).
2.  Non-mounted subvolumes are not relevant for recovery at all.

Of course, we can only know for sure when people would actually try this
on different systems. The code is not enabled by default, but must be
activated by putting a line like this into the local configuration:

    BTRFS_SETUP_IMPLEMENTATION="new"

Hope this helps.

@OliverO2  
Wow! I am deeply impressed.

By plain looking at the code I think your new
btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup()  
will not correctly recreate SUSE's SLES 12 SP1 (and later) special  
btrfs subvolumes setup with a snapper controlled default subvolume  
because it does not call `/usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper`, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_mount\_subvolumes\_code.sh\#L209](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130_include_mount_subvolumes_code.sh#L209)  
and subsequent lines what it does, in particular

    ... Configuring snapper for root filesystem ...
    ... creating snapshot of first root filesystem ...

In SLES 12 SP1 (and later) for the subvolume that is mounted at `/`  
there is already a snapper snapshot (that is needed to be able to  
roll back to that initial pristine installation state).

Because your new btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup() is a strictly separated
add-on  
that already works for Ubuntu 18.04 I would like to merge it right now
as is  
so that we have it in ReaR 2.5 and then we can improve things step by
step  
as needed.

I plan already one change:  
I would like to be able to use both the old btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup()  
and the new btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup() as neeeded for each `$device`.  
This means both functions must have different names and a new  
config variable BTRFS\_SETUP\_NEW\_IMPLEMENTATION would be an  
array that contains those `$device` values where the new function is
used  
and layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/130\_include\_mount\_filesystem\_code.sh  
will be adapted to call the right btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup... e.g. like

    if IsInArray "$device" ${BTRFS_SETUP_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION[@]} ; then
        btrfs_subvolumes_setup_new $device $mountpoint $mountopts
    else
        btrfs_subvolumes_setup_old $device $mountpoint $mountopts
    fi

Of course the names should be better...

@rear/contributors  
if you do not object, I would like to merge it as is today afternoon.

@jsmeix Thanks for looking at it that quickly!

As I've already indicated, I won't be able to really spend time on ReaR
stuff for the rest of this month. Nevertheless, feel free to add missing
functionality in the mean time.

Regarding switching between old and new implementation:

-   Rename the function any way you like, the current function name
    override is just a provisional solution.
-   Ideally, in the end we'd have only one implementation and it would
    be functionally complete and as simple as possible.
-   Could you explain a bit more of your use case for per-device
    switching? When would one use that instead of using just one
    implementation for all devices?
-   If per-device switching is required, I'd ask you to include a
    setting which says "use the old/new implementation for all devices"
    without forcing the user to figure out which devices were actually
    relevant. That way we could use such a setting it in a network-wide
    configuration for differently configured systems.

Regarding snapper:

-   Unfortunately I could not figure out quickly what
    `installation-helper` does as I did not find a manual page and the
    source code does not provide sufficient information about its
    purpose at first glance.
-   My idea was that any snapper configuration should be restored from a
    backup and from then on everything should run smoothly without extra
    assistance.
-   If I'm wrong and snapper really needs extra assistance, the
    necessary code should be built into the new solution, of course.
    (Unfortunately, I cannot really help here, as I do not plan to use
    snapper due to complexity issues - I'm using a pretty simple
    internal Btrfs-only snapshot solution.)

Regarding nitpicking ;-):

-   I decided to stick with plain bash code, as it's easily testable
    without including any library functions. `is_true` seems geared
    towards user-controlled configuration variables with a possible
    variety of values. `mount_required` is just a tiny little internal
    thingy with strictly controlled values.

Of course the goal is to have only one implementation  
that is functionally complete and simple and straightforward.

My use case for per-device switching is to be able to still use  
the old btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup for snapper controlled btrfs
filesystems  
(in prticular when btrfs is used as root filesystem on SLES12)  
while the new btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup could be used for  
additional btrfs filesystems that the user may have created manually.

With `BTRFS_SETUP_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION=( 'yes' )` (or `true` or `1`)  
versus `BTRFS_SETUP_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION=( 'no' )` (or `false` or `0`)  
the new btrfs\_subvolumes\_setup can be enforced for all btrfs
filesystems  
or forbidden to be used for any btrfs filesystem.  
With `BTRFS_SETUP_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION=()` we could implement  
some autodetection what code should be used and so on...  
cf. AUTORESIZE\_PARTITIONS or MODULES and similar variables.

Neither could I figure out with reasonable effort what that  
`installation-helper` thingy does - and I had even inspected  
its source code but there one gets lost in function calls...  
...so that I just call it as a black box that "does the right thing".  
I know what it does from a general higher point of view  
but the details may change for each SLES service pack, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368\#issuecomment-302410707](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368#issuecomment-302410707)  
so calling it as a black box that "does the right thing"  
is the only right thing I can do in ReaR with reasonable effort  
and I do not plan to understand the internals due to complexity issues
;-)

@jsmeix  
Your catch-all setting for `BTRFS_SETUP_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION` looks good
to me.

Now I see the issues you have ben facing with snapper. I've also looked
at
[`snapper/installation-helper.cc`](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper/blob/master/client/installation-helper.cc)
and noticed - apart from its lack of documentation - that its `main()`
function doesn't even consistently return an exit code. I hope that
these circumstances and different Btrfs setups will not lead to too much
bloat and/or fragility in ReaR's Btrfs code. I still wonder what the
point is of letting `installation-helper` create a snapshot on an empty
subvolume. Weren't that supposed to be done after the backup has been
restored? (And even then, that snapshot would never be the original
"pristine state" since a recovery does not have access to the original
Btrfs snapshot's contents.)

Finally, an idea for a future release:

Right now the new implementation does not require any change to existing
layout analysis code (the stuff in
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/230_filesystem_layout.sh`). Once
we're confident to settle everything, that code could eventually shrink
to the point of just putting out one line per mounted subvolume like

    btrfssubvolume $device $subvolume_mountpoint $mount_options $btrfs_subvolume_path $is_default $uses_copy_on_write

where

-   `is_default` specifies whether the subvolume is the default
    subvolume (`Y`) or not (`N`),
-   `uses_copy_on_write` specifies whether the subvolume uses CoW (`Y`,
    the default) or not (`N`, set via `chattr +C`).

Doing so could further simplify the code and make `disklayout.conf` more
concise.
