During "rear recover" there can be several user dialogs  
(in particular when MIGRATION\_MODE is 'true').

When one accidentally hits ENTER more than once in one dialog  
the first one is consumed from stdin to proceed that one dialog  
but the other ENTER(s) stay in stdin so a subsequent dialog  
has already ENTER in stdin which makes the subsequent dialog  
proceed unintendedly automatically without an explicit ENTER  
from the user for this current dialog.

My offhanded idea is to let the UserInput function  
in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
drain stdin either at its beginning when it is called  
or at its end yet before it returns to its caller.  
Because the UserInput function has several `return` calls  
I would prefer the first method (drain stdin at its beginning).

It must be the first method  
(drain stdin at UserInput function beginning)  
because the user may unintendedly type something  
after a UserInput function had finished  
so this new typed thing will appear in stdin  
when the next UserInput function is called.

It must not be done when ReaR is not run interactively  
e.g. when ReaR is run with redirected stdin from a pipe,  
cf. "It should be possible to run ReaR unattended" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

So drain stdin at UserInput function beginning  
must be only done when `tty -s` results zero exit code, cf.  
[https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html\_node/tty-invocation.html\#tty-invocation](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tty-invocation.html#tty-invocation)

Testing backward compatibility of

    read -s -t0.1 -n 10000 drain_stdin

On SLES10 SP4:

    # read -s -t0.1 -n 10000 drain_stdin
    -bash: read: 0.1: invalid timeout specification

    # bash --version
    GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release (x86_64-suse-linux)

    # read -s -t1 -n 10000 drain_stdin
    [works]

On SLES11 SP4:

    # read -s -t0.1 -n 10000 drain_stdin
    -bash: read: 0.1: invalid timeout specification

    # bash --version
    GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-suse-linux-gnu)

    # read -s -t1 -n 10000 drain_stdin
    [works]

On SLES12 SP5:

    # read -s -t0.1 -n 10000 drain_stdin
    [works]

    # bash --version
    GNU bash, version 4.3.48(1)-release (x86_64-suse-linux-gnu)

So it seems that read timeout can be a fractional number  
requires bash 4.x but in general ReaR should still work  
with bash 3.x so I will use

    read -s -t1 -n 10000 drain_stdin

which causes a one second delay at the beginning  
of each UserInput function call when ReaR is run  
interactively.

I think I cannot mitigate the one second delay e.g.  
by calling `read -s -t1 -n 10000 drain_stdin`  
after the UserInput function has shown its request output  
message (because the user needs some time to read it anyway)  
where it asks for user input because at this point in time  
the UserInput function must accept user input and not  
discard any (because the user may expect that request  
for user input and hit the ENTER key to proceed immediately  
after the UserInput function has shown its request output  
message).

I tested it and for me the one second delay  
is hardly noticeable in interactive mode  
so I think it is acceptable.

Do we still need to support bash 3, in light of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820\#issuecomment-1162919836](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2820#issuecomment-1162919836)
? Or is it for easier backporting of the change to ReaR versions that
you want to support SLES11 ?

As long as we ReaR upstream maintainers did not  
all together decide to drop support for bash 3.x  
I will keep support for bash 3.x  
as good as possible with reasonable effort.

Over time more and more bash 4.x only code will creap in  
because we cannot verify all contributions (including  
our own contributions) regarding bash 3.x compatibility  
so over time we will reach a state where ReaR  
does no longer work in practice with bash 3.x.

Should I open a new RFC issue to officially  
declare bash 3.x support as deprecated or unmaintained  
or to even officially drop bash 3.x support in ReaR?

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2868](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2868)
merged  
this issue should be (hopefully) sufficiently solved.
