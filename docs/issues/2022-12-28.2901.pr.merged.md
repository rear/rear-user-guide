-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Manually, on multiple KVM hosts running Bareos 22 and Bareos 21
    release.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Bareos 22 introduced breaking change in how the CLI tools (such as
    bconsole) parse the arguments. This pull request fixes the issue
    when calling the `bconsole -xc` command.

Before bconsole configuration export command is called, the script will
check the bconsole version and will use the appropriate argument format
later on.

If bconsole is called with incorrect argument format, the utility will
terminate with 113 exit code, and `rear mkrescue` will fail as well.
