[\#2496 Issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2496) `closed`: It's pretty important to note that OUTPUT=ISO with file:// will wipe everything on that device

#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Fill in the following items before submitting a new issue  
(quick response is not guaranteed with free support):

-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):

Relax-and-Recover 2.5 / Git

-   OS version ("cat /etc/os-release" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/rear/os.conf"):

OS\_VENDOR=Ubuntu  
OS\_VERSION=20.04

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"):

OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///media/garth/Elements/rear/mouse/

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR):

PC.

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

Intel 64.

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

UEFI

-   Storage (local disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

Local disk - USB interface. Portable backup device.

-   Storage layout ("lsblk -ipo
    NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT" or "lsblk" as
    makeshift):

I don't think this is relevant to the issue.

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Plugged a Western Digital Elements portable hard drive into my system.
Configured rear to output an ISO to it, into a subdirectory, specially
for the purpose. Ran rear mkrescue. rear deleted all the directories and
files on the device when it output, leaving only the rear subdirectory.

This is not ideal.

A very prominent note that this combination will delete everything on
the disk would be a good idea.

-   Workaround, if any:

Nope. Some years of backups are gone.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

To paste verbatim text like command output or file content,  
include it between a leading and a closing line of three backticks like

    ```
    verbatim content

I'm wrong: this is either a rights problem across multiple computers, or
a feature of WD Elements. Nothing to see here; nothing was deleted. I
just couldn't see it. Nothing to do with rear at all.

Apologies for the incorrect report.

@JeffVeit  
FYI:

When you intend to use a separated disk only for ReaR via the `USB`
config variables  
cf. the `OUTPUT=USB` section in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L776](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L776)  
then the ReaR documentation tells about using the `rear format`
workflow  
once as precondition setup step to prepare the whole disk for ReaR,
cf.  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started)

The `rear format` workflow will destroy all previous data on the disk.  
But in this case there is a user dialog that tells about it and asks  
for confirmation (unless you had specified the `-y/--yes` option), cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200\_check\_usb\_layout.sh\#L64](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/format/USB/default/200_check_usb_layout.sh#L64)  
and

    # usr/sbin/rear format -- --help
    Use 'rear format [ -- OPTIONS ] DEVICE' like 'rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdX'
    Valid format workflow options are: -e/--efi -f/--force -y/--yes
