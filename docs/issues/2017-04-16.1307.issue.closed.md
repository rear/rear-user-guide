I would guess that

`0`.

Isn't [line

an issue?

`if (( available_space < 0 )) ; then`

Shouldn't that `available_space` *var* not be prefixed with a `$`?

Bash 4.4.12 seems not be able to handle these large numbers:

@ProBackup-nl According `bc` it should be:

    $ echo  20971520000*30971520000|bc
    649519851110400000000

@jsmeix @gozora If bash results are not correct, perhaps we should make
a function which is using **bc** instead?

I have a dimm feeling that bash mathematic expansion does not work with
decimal numbers.  
looks we will indeed need bc to deal with this... Will check that later
today.

I didn't check all the details but when the issue is that in bash

<pre>
(( ( a / b ) * c ))
</pre>

evaluates to 0 when b &gt; a as in

<pre>
# echo $(( ( 2 / 3 ) * 4 ))
0
</pre>

then it should help to do the multiplication before the division

<pre>
# echo $(( ( 2 * 4 ) / 3 ))
2
</pre>

@gozora  
bash does not support decimal numbers like 0.666666 ( = 2 / 3).  
bash only supports integers so that 2 / 3 evaluates to 0 in bash:

<pre>
# echo $(( 2 / 3 ))
0
</pre>

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1307\#issuecomment-294369824](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1307#issuecomment-294369824)  
what the maximum numbers are that bash arithmetic can hande cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1269)  
where it seems bash arithmetic works up to 2^63 - 1  
i.e. up to 9223372036854775807  
but on my SLES11 32-bit system  
and on my SLES12 64-bit system I also get

I got confused what the 20971520000 \* 30971520000 means.  
I think when the issue is to get the right result for  
( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) \* 124961546240  
then the multiplication should be  
20971520000 \* 124961546240  
which of course fails even worse in bash.

Meanwhile I also think we must use 'bc -l'  
basically everywhere in partitioning code  
because bash arithmetic "just fails".

Note that plain 'bc' also does only integer calculations:

<pre>
# echo '( 2 / 3 ) * 4' | bc
0

# echo '( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) * 124961546240' | bc
0
</pre>

in contrast to 'bc -l' that results what we need:

<pre>
# echo '( 2 / 3 ) * 4' | bc -l
2.66666666666666666664

# echo '( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) * 124961546240' | bc -l
84708206507.59219088829208903680
</pre>

To get only the final result as integer from 'bc -l' we can use

<pre>
# echo ' r = ( 2 / 3 ) * 4 ; scale=0 ; r / 1 ' | bc -l
2

# echo -e 'r = ( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) * 124961546240 ; scale = 0 ; r / 1 ' | bc -l
84708206507
</pre>

a bit complicated and ugly but it seems to work.

This is exactly it, and it is not ugly, I'd call it clever!

As this is primary your idea, would you like to implement it, or should
I?

Just for fun of it, I've try to run before listed code on my Arch, and

@ProBackup-nl  
can you comment about whether or not 'bc'  
is usually available on Arch Linux  
and if not what we could do here?

I would think ReaR should switch to 'bc'  
for all partitioning calculations and error out  
if 'bc' is not available.

I think all partitioning calculations should be done  
with bytes 'B' as unit  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1270](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1270)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1273](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1273)

Only the final result may - if needed - be rounded  
to whatever MiB unit that is reasonable for a real disk.  
Usually only in disk migration mode partitioning values  
should be re-calculated and finally rounded to a MiB unit.

By default this MiB unit should be 8 MiB nowadays  
cf.

> If not what we could do here?

Revert back to the `awk` solution, and try to fix `awk` for the failing
cases.

ReaR cannot fix awk (or any tool that is calls).  
I would rather "fix Arch Linux" when it comes without 'bc'.

👍 for fixing Arch. Doesn't Arch also have some kind of dependency
mechanism which we can use to pull in required software?

Typically **users** will use the package management to install ReaR,
developers should install the dependencies manually.

So, let's add `bc` to `REQUIRED_PROGS` and also add it to the package
dependencies.

Hopefully I find some time during May  
to use 'bc' for the calculations in the partitioning code  
but no promises...

@gozora  
if you like to do it, I would very much appreciate it.

@jsmeix I certainly can take a look on this.  
Just to my understanding, we want to replace ALL calculations through
whole ReaR code, right?

IMHO we should take this in steps and start from cleaning up the
partitioning calculations, after all there we have the current pains.
Maybe here it is worthwhile to render a `bc` script that does all the
calculations in one go instead of calling `bc` many times.

I wouldn't go so far as to replace all trivial calculations with `bc`.

@gozora  
my understanding is that we need to replace  
all calculations with possibly big numbers  
through whole ReaR code.

But I also fully agree with @schlomo  
to do first things first so that as a first step we should  
only replace the partitioning calculations and later  
when that "just works perfectly fine" we can replace  
also other calculations as needed.

Ideally there should be a new generic function calculate()  
in global-functions.sh so that we have this one function  
where we could fix things if something doesn't work.

Something (not thoroughly tested) like:

<pre>
function calculate()
{   # Use 'bc' for calculations because other tools
    # fail in various unexpected ways for big numbers,
    # e.g. see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1307
    echo " result = $@ ; scale=0 ; result / 1 " | bc -l
}
</pre>

According to a very first quick test (on my SLES11 system)  
it seems to work for me:

<pre>
# function calculate() { echo " result = $@ ; scale=0 ; result / 1 " | bc -l ; }

# foo=20971520000

# bar=30937186304

# baz=124961546240

# set -x

# res=$( calculate "( $foo / $bar ) * $baz" )
++ calculate '( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) * 124961546240'
++ echo ' result = ( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) * 124961546240 ; scale=0 ; result / 1 '
++ bc -l
+ res=84708206507

OK, so for the start I'll implement idea of @jsmeix with `calculate`
function in *100\_include\_partition\_code.sh* and
*400\_autoresize\_disks.sh* and run couple of tests.  
Once it works we can spread it wherever necessary.

BTW, you can use Bash here strings instead of pipes to [speed up
stuff](https://askubuntu.com/a/229451/146779):

    $ function calculate() { bc -ql <<<"result=$@ ; scale=0 ; result / 1 "; }
    $ foo=20971520000 bar=30937186304 baz=124961546240
    $ set -x
    $ res=$( calculate "( $foo / $bar ) * $baz" )
    ++ calculate '( 20971520000 / 30937186304 ) * 124961546240'
    ++ bc -ql
    + res=84708206507
    $ set +x ; echo $res
    + set +x
    84708206507

As this `calculate` function actually rounds the result we might call it
appropriately `calculate_round` or so. And we should beware of rounding
issues...

@schlomo  
thanks for the interesting information!

It speeds up - but not much - about 14% on my SLES11 system:

<pre>
# foo=20971520000
# bar=30937186304
# baz=124961546240

# function calculate() { bc -ql <<<"result=$@ ; scale=0 ; result / 1 "; }

# time for i in $( seq 1000 ) ; do res=$( calculate "( $foo / $bar ) * $baz" ) ; done
real    0m4.366s
user    0m0.208s
sys     0m0.372s

# function calculate() { echo " result = $@ ; scale=0 ; result / 1 " | bc -l ; }

# time for i in $( seq 1000 ) ; do res=$( calculate "( $foo / $bar ) * $baz" ) ; done
real    0m5.000s
user    0m0.152s

IMHO 14% is really impressive, didn't think that the pipe was that
expensive.

Yes, the relative speedup is impressive.  
My comment was not clear.  
I meant the absolute gain in seconds.  
On my old slow 32-bit i386 SLES11 computer  
I got less than one second for a thousand calculations  
which is less than a millisecond for a single calculation.  
With usually about tens of calculations in the partitioning code  
the overall gain is not so much.  
On the other hand using bash here strings instead of pipes  
costs us nothing so we can "just use them".  
On big iron with thousands of disks (like IBM System z)  
it may actually help.

@ProBackup-nl  
note that since

the 'bc' tool is mandatory to use ReaR because now 'bc' is

An addednum only FYI:

I got an unexpected

<pre>
Partition primary on /dev/sda: size reduced to fit on disk.
</pre>

message plus different partitioning (by one MiB)  
for "rear recover" on a disk with exact same size  
and swap was not at all migrated.

I think this shows that disk migration mode  
is not yet working really well but hopefully  
it works somewhat o.k. for now.

Details:

I did "rear mkbackup" on a system (virtual KVM/QEMU machine)  
with two exactly 20 GiB disks (/dev/sda and /dev/sdb)  
with same partitioning on each one.

Only /dev/sda is mounted but swap is used on /dev/sdb1

I did "rear recover" on a new system (same kind of virtual machine)  
with one exactly 20 GiB disk (/dev/sda)  
and got (excerpts):

The recreated system works well  
but I got a bit different partitioning (by one MiB)  
regardless that the disk has exactly same size:

<pre>

This shows that swap was not at all migrated  
which is probably a missing enhancement.

But I think it is a bug that there is not any LogPrint message  
so that the original swap on /dev/sdb1 seems to have been  
silently ignored.
