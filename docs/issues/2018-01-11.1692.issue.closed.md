Relax-and-Recover 2.3 / 2017-12-20  
Got it from  
sh -c "echo 'deb
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu\_14.04/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/xUbuntu_14.04/)
/' &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rear.list" & apt-get install rear  
Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS  
config :

    OS_VENDOR=Ubuntu
    OS_VERSION=14.04
    BACKUP=BAREOS
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BAREOS_CLIENT="vm544617-fd"
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://"some ip here"/bareos

*\* Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?* Not sure, vm on hyper-v,
should be BIOS as Ubuntu 14 does not support Gen2 VM under Hyper-v.

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    "rear recover" stuck at "Waiting for job to start" forever because
    of bareos-fd start failure. In my case Bareos-fd configuration
    "myself.conf" points to plugin directory "Plugin Directory =
    /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins". As there were no such directory in
    RESCUE environment, bareos-fd did not start. Bareos director had
    errors:  
    `Fatal error: bsock_tcp.c:134 Unable to connect to Client: vm544617-fd`  
    It is common for bareos config to define plugin directory. I use
    default bpipe plugin to get mysql backup.

-   Work-around, if any:  
    Comment "Plugin Directory = /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins" either on
    original host before mkrescue or in RESCUE environment and run
    bareos-fd manually.  
    *nano /etc/bareos/bareos.d/client/myself.conf*

@StarT3 Could you show us what the content is of your `myself.conf` and
what does that plugin directory contain? Would it be sufficient to add
it into the `COPY_AS_IS` array?

@StarT3

some general info FYI:

By default the ReaR recovery system is minimal which means  
that things which are not mandatory might be not automatically  
included in the ReaR recovery system.

You can specify anything what you need in addition  
to what is automatically included in the ReaR recovery  
system via the config variables

COPY\_AS\_IS  
REQUIRED\_PROGS  
LIBS  
MODULES  
MODULES\_LOAD  
FIRMWARE\_FILES

In your particular case it may work to specify  
in your /etc/rear/local.conf something like

COPY\_AS\_IS=( "${COPY\_AS\_IS\[@\]}" /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins )

Furthermore if you need special commands to be run in the  
ReaR recovery system (e.g. launching a special service)  
you can specify that via config variables like

PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT  
NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS

In your particular case it may also work to automate  
commenting "Plugin Directory = /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins"  
in your Bareos-fd configuration myself.conf via an  
appropriate command (e.g. a 'sed' command)  
that gets run as PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT.

For more info about each of the various config variables  
see usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

If things like commenting "Plugin Directory"  
or having /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins in the  
recovery system are mandatory for Bareos  
such things could be added to the ReaR scripts  
to enhance the default Bareos support in ReaR.

But I am not a Bareos user so that I cannot reproduce anything  
or even fix anything that is specific for Bareos.

In general regarding third-party backup tools and ReaR see  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore" at

Thank you for support.  
Here is full content of /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf

    Client {
      Name = vm544617-fd
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20
      Heartbeat Interval = 60

      # remove comment from "Plugin Directory" to load plugins from specified directory.
      # if "Plugin Names" is defined, only the specified plugins will be loaded,
      # otherwise all storage plugins (*-fd.so) from the "Plugin Directory".
      #
      Plugin Directory = /usr/lib/bareos/plugins
      # Plugin Names = ""

      # if compatible is set to yes, we are compatible with bacula
      # if set to no, new bareos features are enabled which is the default
      # compatible = yes
    }

I believe such config is common for small web servers with light mysql
databases.  
COPY\_AS\_IS is not really necessary, bpipe plugin used to
backup/restore databases typically is in separate job and should be run
after whole server restored and running (mysql software should be
running at that time).

PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT should do the trick. It should comment line in
myself.config, and start bareos-fd. Currently testing:  
`PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=("sed -e '/Plugin Directory = / s/^#*/#/' -i /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf" && "bareos-fd")`  
Not sure if it would work, testing.

@gdha  
is there something you like to fix or enhance in ReaR  
because currently it is a "minor bug" for BACKUP=BAREOS  
or is it only a "support question" that was "fixed/solved/done" ?

@StarT3 What does the plugin directory exactly contain? Is it critical
for BAREOS or can it be left out? Or was that plugin directory empty?

In my case i use plugin called
[bpipe](http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.html#QQ2-1-561),
it is installed by default with Bareos. Main purpose - consistent backup
of databases.

I think this particular plugin is not needed for the REAR recovery phase
because bpipe connects to existing (working) SQL service. It should be
used on the next stage, when we have recovered, up and running server,
and we need to recover (or update) production databases. There are a lot
of other plugins (for example Percona, python based plugins and so on),
and we cannot provide everything for every of them. But it would be nice
if REAR could take care at least of Plugin directory string in config.
Less headache for users, i've spent several hours to understand what is
wrong with my recovery.  
By default `Plugin Directory = /usr/lib/bareos/plugins` string is
commented in /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf. So most users
do not use plugins. We could:

1.  Parse /etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf and include all
    plugin directories we found using `COPY_AS_IS`
2.  Just create empty folder /usr/lib/bareos/plugins in rear environment
    (default folder for plugins, could be empty). It would resolve the
    error.
3.  Comment `Plugin Directory = /usr/lib/bareos/plugins` string with
    PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT.
4.  Do nothing. If anyone as dumb as myself would encounter such error,
    googling should lead to that GitHub thread and it would take minutes
    to resolve it manually.  
    I'm not sure if it is support question or minor bug or feature
    request.

@StarT3 @jsmeix We can add a **rescue** script to add those directories
(`/usr/lib/bareos/plugins` or `/usr/lib64/bareos/plugins`) when found,
no?  
E.g. `prep/BAREOS/570_check_bareos_plugin_dir.sh` script (still to be
written)?

I think adaptions and enhancements for third-party backup tool support
in ReaR  
is best implemented by those who make a particular third-party backup
tool  
or at least by those who use a particular third-party backup tool.

@aussendorf  
could you have a look here and could you do a pull request  
if there is a need for adaptions and enhancements  
to get support for Bareos plugins in ReaR?

@gdha  
in general I do not use any of the third-party backup tools  
so that in general I can neither reproduce any issue nor fix  
or enhance things that are related to third-party backup tools.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1708](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1708)
merged  
this issue should be at least avoided or even fixed.

Now the the Bareos plugin directory gets included in the ReaR recovery
system  
which makes the Bareos stuff in the recovery system more consistent  
in a generically working way which is preferred over possibly
complicated  
automated changing Bareos config files in the recovery system,  
cf. "Maintain backward compatibility" at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
that reads (excerpt)

<pre>
Preferably use simple generic functionality
that works on any Linux system.
Better very simple code than
oversophisticated (possibly fragile) constructs.
