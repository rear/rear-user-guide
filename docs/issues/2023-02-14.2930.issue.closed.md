It can lead to various rather unexpected behaviour  
when an array variable is not set as an array  
but usually as a string instead.

For example:  
In bash assinging a string to an array  
assingns the first array element to that string:

    #  arr=()

    # declare -p arr
    declare -a arr=()

    # arr=''

    # declare -p arr
    declare -a arr=([0]="")

But an array with an empty first element is something different  
than an empty array which can make big differences in how  
things behave, see for example  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911)  
therein in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911\#issuecomment-1387056556](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2911#issuecomment-1387056556)  
and subsequent comments.

From the bash manpage section "Arrays":

    Referencing an array variable without a subscript
    is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0

To avoid that users set config array variables  
as something that is not an array we should check  
after sourcing the config files that the array variables  
that are set in default.conf are still arrays.

See

I played around with this and found out that the problem is slightly
different than what we thought:

Overriding an array variable with a single value actually only changes
the first member of the array!

This demo within `rear shell` shows this clearly:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101384/218885185-c0803af9-1256-48f6-b7ca-125641c7fe05.png)

So in the original example this was a problem because the first member
of `COPY_AS_IS` happens to be the ReaR files themselves, which led to
the observed error.

To be honest, as much es it pains me, I currently have no idea how to
detect this type of misconfiguration properly.

Even comparing the array length is probably a wrong check and it also
won't catch cases of accidentially overwriting the first array member.

Maybe a totally silly idea: check for every array variable from
`default.conf` if it appears in `/etc/rear/*.conf` *without* a `(` in
the same line. I can still think about ways to misconfigure ReaR that
this check won't catch, but maybe it will help against this very typical
user configuration error?

What do you think? Too crazy or worth implementing?

Yes,  
setting an array variable without a subscript  
changes (only) the first member of the array  
as "man bash" tells.

My above example was only meant as an example how  
things could even fail when "all looks just empty"  
(because not all is really empty in this example)  
cf. "Beware of the emptiness" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Basically all we do in ReaR (including all checks)  
must follow the general rule to

    provide final power to the user

ReaR must never "patronize/infantilize" the user  
because Free Software Freedom Rights are sacrosanct  
where in this case it is mostly about "freedom 0" in  
[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\#four-freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#four-freedoms)

In general software that patronizes/infantilizes  
its users treat its users as if they were idiots.

For checks in ReaR it means they inform the user  
to help them to avoid accidental mistakes  
(like confusing arrays with strings).

But checks in ReaR are normally not meant to enforce  
what the user can do, so when a user specified e.g.

    COPY_AS_IS=( /some/directory )

then ReaR must obey (because the user has final power)  
and (try to) do what is requested by the user.  
E.g. assume the user has carefully setup /some/directory  
as he needs it so `COPY_AS_IS=( /some/directory )`  
is exactly what he deliberately wants ReaR to do.

When ReaR cannot do what the user requested,  
it must error out with a meaningful error message,  
cf. "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Yes, the check only confirms that the syntax is correct, meaning that
the user knew about the fact that this variable is an array and treats
it as such.

It is not yet completed, see

Please have another look.

Ah - I didn't understand where I should have a look but now I found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/46d4dd3fe03595cc7b969db66d6ab1a881fcb6eb)

Now it looks good to me (from plain looking at the code).

A side note:  
While I tried to reverse engineer

    declare -p | sed -n -E -e '/^declare -a/s/declare [-arxlu]+ ([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)=.*/\1/p'

I did the following as currently logged in normal user:

    $ declare -p | grep '^declare -a'
    declare -a BASH_ARGC=()
    declare -a BASH_ARGV=()
    declare -a BASH_COMPLETION_VERSINFO=([0]="2" [1]="7")
    declare -a BASH_LINENO=()
    declare -a BASH_SOURCE=()
    declare -ar BASH_VERSINFO=([0]="4" [1]="4" [2]="23" [3]="1" [4]="release" [5]="x86_64-suse-linux-gnu")
    declare -a DIRSTACK=()
    declare -a FUNCNAME
    declare -a GROUPS=()
    declare -a PIPESTATUS=([0]="0" [1]="0")

    $ declare -p | sed -n -E -e '/^declare -a/s/declare [-arxlu]+ ([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)=.*/\1/p'
    BASH_ARGC
    BASH_ARGV
    BASH_COMPLETION_VERSINFO
    BASH_LINENO
    BASH_SOURCE
    BASH_VERSINFO
    DIRSTACK
    GROUPS
    PIPESTATUS

so the unassigned array FUNCNAME gets skipped.

Is it intentional to skip unassigned arrays?  
Is perhaps

    sed -n -E -e '/^declare -a/s/declare [-arxlu]+ ([A-Za-z0-9_-]+).*/\1/p'

better (i.e. without the '=')?

Wow, thanks for taking a deep look at this.

My original thinking was: If it hasn't been assigned then there is no
potential for a wrong assignment, therefore it is enough to look at the
arrays with content.

It is fully sufficient in practice to only check assigned arrays.  
I think we will never have `declare -a CONF_VAR` in default.conf.  
I only noticed it by chance so I reported my finding.
