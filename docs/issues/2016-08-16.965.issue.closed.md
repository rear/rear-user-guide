-   Brief description of the issue dhcp configuration with wicked
-   Work-around, if any

@jsmeix this is more a question for you rather that issue.  
You've mentioned to use dhcp for rear testing. In SLES2 SP1 I have
**wicked** running for network management, but rear have hard coded
binaries to look for (wicked is not part of them).  
from *21\_include\_dhclient.sh*:

    for x in "${DHCLIENT_BIN##*/}" \
            "${DHCLIENT6_BIN##*/}" \
            dhcpcd dhclient \
            dhcp6c dhclient6 ;
    do
    ...

As you can see here even if dhcp is running on SLES12 SP1, it can't work
"out of the box" in rear recover.

Can you please share with me how do you have your environment set ?

It looks like it might appear to work on SLES12 SP1 however IP set is
definitely not assigned by DHCP.

On my system process responsible for DHCP configuration is this one:  
`/usr/lib/wicked/bin/wickedd-dhcp4 --systemd --foreground`

following code in *21\_include\_dhclient.sh* is responsible to set
whether DHCP will or will not be in use:

       dhcp_interfaces_active() {
       local my_dhclients
       my_dhclients=${dhclients}
       my_dhclients=${dhclients// /|}
       ps -e | grep -qEs "[ /]($my_dhclients)"
       if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            # if we find a dhcp client being active we automatically
            # include DHCP CLIENT support in Relax-and-Recover
            Log "Running DHCP client found, enabling USE_DHCLIENT"
            USE_DHCLIENT=y
       fi

In other words USE\_DHCP will be set to 'y' only if one of following
daemons is running on OS: *dhcpcd dhclient dhcp6c dhclient6 dhclient
dhcp6c dhclient6* this condition is not met (at least) on my SLES12 SP1,
for this reason rear recover will handle network setup as if it would be
a static one.

In order to confirm this, can you please boot your recovery medium an
check if you have lines similar to these in your
**/etc/rear/recover.conf**?

USE\_DHCLIENT=y  
DHCLIENT\_BIN=dhclient

Thx

V.

@gozora  
probably no real surprise: currently I know nothing at all  
about SUSE's wicked (and I was grateful for that up to now ;-)  
I ask for patience until I got
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/963](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/963)
done.

On my original system (now SLES12-SP2-rc1):

<pre>
USE_DHCLIENT="yes"
</pre>

In the recovery system:

<pre>
RESCUE d245:~ # grep -i dhc /etc/rear/rescue.conf
# The following 3 lines were added through 21_include_dhclient.sh
USE_DHCLIENT=yes
DHCLIENT_BIN=dhclient
DHCLIENT6_BIN=dhclient6
RESCUE d245:~ # 
</pre>

@gozora  
do you know that on the recovery system boot screen  
where you select what to boot, you can press the 'tab' key  
to get the kernel command line for the currently selected entry  
and when you append ' debug' to the kernel command line  
the system-setup scripts of the recovery system  
are run with 'set -x' and need an 'enter' keypress before  
each one starts so that you can more easily debug what  
exactly the recovery system-setup scripts do, cf.  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup

Sure no rush here ...

with `USE_DHCLIENT="yes"` it works for me fine as well, and brought some
light to understanding this whole setup.

Thanks for that debug hint, it is definitely useful, btw you can use it
same way on UEFI based systems, only difference is that you need to
press 'e' while in grub2 menu ;-)
