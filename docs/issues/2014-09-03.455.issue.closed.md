I experienced a bug in the generation of the disk layout file. My tests
run on a system with four  
disks building two Raid-1 logical drives. As far as I understand the
array configuration part in the  
recovery step, there should be two "logicaldrive"-Lines in
disklayout.conf. Apparently mine has  
only one entry:

logicaldrive /dev/sdb 0|B|2 raid=1 drives=1I:1:1,1I:1:2,1I:1:3,1I:1:4,
spares= sectors=32 stripesize=256

But it should be like that:

logicaldrive /dev/sda 0|A|1 raid=1 drives=1I:1:1,1I:1:2, spares=
sectors=32 stripesize=256  
logicaldrive /dev/sdb 0|B|2 raid=1 drives=1I:1:3,1I:1:4, spares=
sectors=32 stripesize=256

I had a look at 27\_hpraid.layout.sh. The faulty part seems to be the
while-loop starting at line 54.

Regards,  
Wolfgang

Hi Wolfgang - understood. Could you the `hpraid-config.tmp` file so it
is easier for me to follow?

@wzwei sorry too busy with other projects (earning money gets priority
as with free as beer I cannot make a living :)  
Please have a look into the script
`/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/27_hpraid_layout.sh` which is
doing the work in your case. In case you find a bug do not hesitate to
propose a pull request.

Same here. Erning money is sometimes very important ;-)

I will have look. Let's see what I can do.

I found the issue. The script generates two listings: one for the
logical drives and one for the  
physical drives. On a system with more than one logical drives you loose
the connection of logical  
and physical drives! See the example output from my earlier post.

In my opinion the correct way would be to run "$HPSSACLI ctrl all show
config". This command is  
mentioned in the script as "the order logicaldrive and array could be
wrong". My tests on various  
Smart Array Controlles (P400, P410, P420) with different drive
configurations showed no problems.

So I would go back to the older version of the script with the command
above.

Investigated on the history of 27\_hpraid\_layout.sh . Issue \#208
introduced the current behavior:

About a year ago hpacucli introduced a different order of arrays and
logical drives. I would say  
this was a bug in hpacucli! Current versions of hpacucli (9.40.12.0) all
show the correct order.

Therefore I ask to change the code back to the way it worked before
\#208.

If there is a known broken version of hpacucli then IMHO we should
maybe  
add code to recognize that version and warn the user or even abort
ReaR.  
Especially if we know that this version leads to recovery problems.

@pavoldomin your input is certainly welcome as SME.

The release notes of hpacucli show nothing about fixed bugs. Maybe
@pavoldomin can check his setup with a current version of hpacucli.

Another note: It seems that HP supports both hpacucli and hpssacli! I am
able to install both tools  
from the same source
([http://downloads.linux.hp.com/SDR/repo/spp/RedHatEnterpriseServer/](http://downloads.linux.hp.com/SDR/repo/spp/RedHatEnterpriseServer/)).
But  
hpssacli delivers a bit more information than hpacucli. Nothing to worry
now.

Hi,

I agree with @wzwei it was hpacucli bug and I agree with @schlomo, the
code should parse the output correctly regardless the hpacucli version.
Did a small survey here; seems that only hpacucli version *9.30.15.0*
suffers by the bug. Older as well as newer versions print the ctrl
config correctly.

Simple condition like:

       if //"command" is hpacucli// && hpacucli version | grep -q '9.30.15'; then //current parsing code//
       else //old parsing code//

should do it. I can pull a patch myself, but not soon, October does not
look realistic :(

@wzwei: hpacucli is obsolete, replaced by hpssacli in the Sept. 2013 HP
SPP.
