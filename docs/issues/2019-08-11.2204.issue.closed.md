Here is the log file from `rear -vD recover` with RearR 2.5

[rear-localhost.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3490325/rear-localhost.log)

This time I noticed a couple of message about UserInput. I'm not sure
what they mean:  
![rear\_UserInput](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9773655/62838313-574f6900-bc48-11e9-82eb-eddc886edf14.png)  
Additional notes:

-   Is it normal to be asked for a login? When ReaR finishes booting, it
    stops at the line in the screenshot with "\[OK\] Reached target
    Multi-User." Then if I press enter I see "localhost login:", which
    accepts any input (notice I typed "blah"). Is this expected
    behavior? It has been consistent between ReaR 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5.

-   To get `rear mkrescue` to succeed in creating an ISO, as stated in
    [another
    issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1996#issuecomment-446389799),
    I must always remove "multiboot" from I believe line 49 of
    `/usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh` for ReaR versions 2.2, 2.4,
    and 2.5, and also "linuxefi" for ReaR 2.2 and 2.4, but not 2.5.

@adatum  
Your problem is on line 3750 of your *rear-localhost.log*.  
Executed code from
[160\_include\_luks\_code.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh#L57),
in your particular case:
`cryptsetup luksFormat --batch-mode --cipher - --key-size --hash --uuid 974b19f8-021a-46b6-a089-a46e06e6e746 --iter-time 2000 --use-random /dev/sda3`
does not have any "safety net", meaning if it fails you will get exactly
this behavior (prompt for password will be ignored)

Your command
`cryptsetup luksFormat --batch-mode --cipher - --key-size --hash --uuid 974b19f8-021a-46b6-a089-a46e06e6e746 --iter-time 2000 --use-random /dev/sda3`
failed most probably due: `--hash: invalid numeric value`. Why you don't
get <s>correct</s> hash from *disklayout.conf*, I really don't know.

According change
[history](https://github.com/rear/rear/commits/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160_include_luks_code.sh)
of *160\_include\_luks\_code.sh*, @OliverO2 was the last one doing
changes in this file so he might be the most suitable one to help you

Thanks for noticing that @gozora If there's anything you'd like me to
try, let me know. Since the system being backed up and recovered is just
a test VM, I can try anything even if it's destructive.

Where is a good place to ask questions about ReaR that aren't
necessarily issues? Besides the two "additional notes" above, I have a
few other questions about ReaR's behavior.

Good evening @adatum, having been notified of this issue I took a short
look. As @gozora noted correctly there is a missing `hash` parameter
value. The root cause thus seems to be that the hash value is not
properly detected by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ef074a6041ebb640b258dd36e4f8dbf3bf0e72fe/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/260\_crypt\_layout.sh\#L41](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ef074a6041ebb640b258dd36e4f8dbf3bf0e72fe/usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/260_crypt_layout.sh#L41)

That code exists since its initial implementation on 2011, so its not
something I was directly involved in. But maybe you could shed some
light on it by running this command on the original system:

    sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda3

The output is expected to look similar to this, in particular the line
starting with `Hash spec:`:

Thank you for the quick reply @OliverO2. Here is the luksDump. The hash
spec is `sha256` but notice that this is using LUKS version 2, which is
now the default on recent Fedora releases. Could that have anything to
do with the problem?

Yes, it seems like LUKS version 2 requires its own port within ReaR: The
output format of `cryptsetup luksDump` differs significantly between the
two versions, and that might be just the tip of the iceberg. One would
have to analyze the implications of the version changes step by step to
make ReaR save and reproduce a LUKS 2 setup correctly.

Maybe you have the option of just staying with LUKS version 1 for now
until version 2 is more established and someone would come up with a
port for ReaR.

Thanks for confirming.

This complicates the situation. Of two systems I want to use with ReaR,
one is using LUKS2.

LUKS2 has been supported on Fedora since 29, and is the [default since
Fedora
30](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SwitchCryptsetupDefaultToLUKS2).

LUKS allows converting between versions 1 and 2 under certain
conditions:  
[https://www.saout.de/pipermail/dm-crypt/2017-December/005771.html](https://www.saout.de/pipermail/dm-crypt/2017-December/005771.html)

    * In-place conversion form LUKS1

      To allow easy testing and transition to the new LUKS2 format, there is a new
      convert command that allows in-place conversion from the LUKS1 format and,
      if there are no incompatible options, also conversion back from LUKS2
      to LUKS1 format.

      Note this command can be used only on some LUKS1 devices (some device header
      sizes are not supported).
      This command is dangerous, never run it without header backup!
      If something fails in the middle of conversion (IO error), the header
      is destroyed. (Note that conversion requires move of keyslot data area to
      a different offset.)

      To convert header in-place to LUKS2 format, use
      $ cryptsetup convert <device> --type luks2

      To convert it back to LUKS1 format, use
      $ cryptsetup convert <device> --type luks1

      You can verify LUKS version with luksDump command.
      $ cryptsetup luksDump <device>

      Note that some LUKS2 features will make header incompatible with LUKS1 and
      conversion will be rejected (for example using new Argon2 PBKDF or integrity
      extensions). Some minor attributes can be lost in conversion.

Unfortunately that last point combined with Fedora's defaults prevents
converting back to LUKS1. Here is the output from my conversion attempt
on the VM with the luksDump from above:

    $ sudo cryptsetup convert /dev/sda3 --type luks1

    WARNING!
    ========
    This operation will convert /dev/sda3 to LUKS1 format.


    Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
    Cannot convert to LUKS1 format - keyslot 0 is not LUKS1 compatible.

I think in general missing support for a newer and incompatible
version  
of some software cannot be a bug in ReaR but is an enhancement.

In the meantime, a workaround is to convert LUKS2 to LUKS1, which is by
no means guaranteed to succeed, as "it depends" on many factors such as
what features of LUKS2 are being used.

However this worked for me:

-   Boot from an environment other than the LUKS2 volume that is to be
    converted
-   Do `cryptsetup luksConvertKey --pbkdf=pbkdf2 [/device/with/luks2]`
    if for example `argon2i` is used (default on Fedora), which LUKS1
    does not support.
-   Do `cryptsetup convert [/device/with/luks2] --type luks1`

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2381](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2381)  
we detect at least when gathering crypt information  
was not successful because LUKS 2 is used  
instead of let the code blindly proceed resulting  
wrong (incomplete) entries in disklayout.conf  
that let later (when it is too late) "rear recover" fail.

The whole LUKS code needs to be overhauled to be more fail safe.  
Currently it blindly proceeds basically everywhere, e.g. also  
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/160\_include\_luks\_code.sh  
blindly adds `cryptsetup_options` independent of whether or not  
the resulting cryptsetup command is at least syntactically correct.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)  
the `LUKS Devices` syntax description in disklayout.conf  
indicates that most parameters are optional but it seems this is not the
case.

Thanks @gdha I assumed as much, but as it had been open for almost a
year I wondered why the bot closed now....updated 12 days ago....

Anyway, I have not been using rear as all my machines are luks2, just
using alternatives :)

All the best.

@mannp What alternatives have you found?

One way is to convert LUKS2 to LUKS1

I find it unfortunate to close valid issues simply because they haven't
been addressed in X days.

Hi @adatum, not wanting to take anything away from ReaR, as I think it
is a great idea

I use timeshift \[https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift\] which is not
perhaps a direct comparison, but is does support LUKS2 and has bailed me
out on one occasion. Using it with arch it takes care of snapshots in
between pacman updates.

That said I did subscribe to this thread as I would have liked another
backup of my backup and I do use borg backup
\[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg\] but only for user files, not bare
metal restores.

That's where ReaR would be an great fit being able to use borg.

Hope that helps :)

@kalos  
please report your case as a new issue via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/new)  
and provide the information we need as asked for there.  
In particular I cannot guess what you had specified in  
your etc/rear/local.conf to exclude the not needed thing  
and how `lsblk` looks like on your particular system.  
Additionally provide your `var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`  
and `var/lib/rear/layout/disktodo.conf` files.
