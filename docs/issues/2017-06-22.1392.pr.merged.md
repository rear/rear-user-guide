-   use git infos (rev count, hash, branch) in development version
-   put resulting dist files in dist/
-   not patch the working copy (removed rewrite/restore)
-   use debuild to build debian package

Contributes to \#1362

This is work in progress and for sure needs more attention for the OBS
parts, @gdha can you have a look and tell me what you think? Next would
be to enable building packages from a zip clone without git.

@gdha I fixed the remaining issues I had and now this is ready for you
to look.

What exactly do you need for OBS? I had to remove building a Debian
source package for now (couldn't figure out how to tell it which tar.gz
to use) but I can try to put it pack in if you need that for OBS.

Another thought about OBS: I would love to somewhat detach the OBS
builds from our other builds, ideally we should be able to feed a dist
tar.gz into OBS.

Another thought about the debian changes file: We can use `gbp dch` to
auto-create the [changes file from the git
log](https://github.com/schlomo/kiosk-browser/blob/master/Makefile).
OTOH if this changes file is only used for dev builds then we can also
do away with it completely.

In general I wonder which "official" build for a distro actually depends
on what we do in the ReaR source tree.

@schlomo works well, but I do not like the wording **.dirty** - I would
rather see **.unstable** - any objections to change that? For the rest
I'm fine for the check-in into our master tree.

@schlomo I like the following output of the command:

    git log --format="* %cd %aN%n- (%h) %s%d%n" --date=local | sed -r 's/[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+ //' 

What do you think?

I personally like the word dirty because it makes it very clear that
this is not good for anything serious. Unstable could be also read as
unstable release, similar to Debian unstable. So how about one of these:
.changed, .modified, .unclear, .notcommitted, ...? Any of these are fine
with me.

About the log, do you mean for filling the change log automatically?
Then maybe like this:

    $ git log --format="* %cd %aN%n- (%h) %s%d%n" --no-merges --date=short  | head

    - (cd00e46d) Makefile: remove . before * as suggested by @schlomo Concerns issue #1389 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)

    * 2017-06-22 Gratien D'haese
    - (b958cde4) The 'make rpm' now relies on 'make srpm' which creates the src.rpm package first. This src.rpm package can then be easily copied to another computer to rebuild a rpm package from it without needed the sources itself (or git checkout). Concerns issue #1389 - verification still required on OBS to see the nightly builds are performed as usual

    - (5150dd2a) Minor correction of conditional missed by previous commit.

I did not manage to get it to properly show multi-line comments that
have bullets. `--no-merges` saves about 2000 lines of probably useless
information and `--date=short` saves us the `sed` :-)

@schlomo Ok I'm fine with the word `.changed` - does not have a negative
sound like *dirty* (just a personal preference that is).

Indeed a kind of automatic changelog could be created for perhaps
OFFICIAL=1 (official releases only)? I was just a thought as I came
across a nice example of this feature.

OK, let's go for `.changed`. Will you merge this PR? Also, what is the
change in the man page in your last commit?

@schlomo change in man page was probably a rebuild only as I did not
modify the source file (rear.8.adoc)

I see. Can you update the Makefile to not touch the source work dir at
all? Now that we have `build/<name>-<version>` we should IMHO do all the
patching and building in there.
