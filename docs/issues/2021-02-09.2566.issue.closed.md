@dcz01  
I do not really understand your issue description  
and I am not a TSM user (I use no third party backup tools)  
but from what I read in your desctiption (excerpts):

    I don't know why the encryption password isn't saved normally
    in the TSM keystore like always, so i have to enter it manually
    during the restore. In the restore process the TSM restore hang
    because of that input of the user
    ...
    Workaround, if any:
    Change redirect stdout from logfile to user display.

I assume the actual issue is that  
"TSM restore fails because of impossible user input  
when stdout and stderr are redirected to the log"

If my assumtion is right what would need to be done is  
to not redirect stdout and stderr to the log only for the particular  
TSM restore command(s) where user input can happen,  
cf. "What to do with stdin, stdout, and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

As far as I see (without actually using TSM) during 'rear recover'  
the following TSM specific scripts are run:

    verify/TSM/default/389_check_TSM_connection.sh
    verify/TSM/default/390_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh
    verify/TSM/default/400_verify_tsm.sh
    restore/TSM/default/400_restore_with_tsm.sh

which should be checked how TSM commands are called therein.

In particular restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
contains (long line shown wrapped here):

        LC_ALL=$LANG_RECOVER \
     dsmc restore "$filespace" "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$filespace" \
     -subdir=yes -replace=all -tapeprompt=no \
     -errorlogname=\"$backup_restore_log_file\" "${TSM_DSMC_RESTORE_OPTIONS[@]}" \
     0<&6 1>>"$backup_restore_log_file" 2>&1

where stdout and stderr are redirected to $backup\_restore\_log\_file

@dcz01  
perhaps it helps  
when you replace in that particular command the current redirections

    ... 0<&6 1>>"$backup_restore_log_file" 2>&1

with the one from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

    ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8

The drawback is that then all `dsmc restore` output appears on the
terminal  
but at least as a test whether or not then `dsmc restore` user input is
possible  
you should try out how that behaves in your particular case.

@dcz01  
is my guess right that what I see in the TSM...restore.log files

    ANS8013I Invalid encryption key password

    --- User Action is Required ---
    File: /mnt/local/... requires an encryption key.

    Select an appropriate action
      1. Prompt for encrypt key password
      2. Skip this object from decryption
      3. Skip all objects that are encrypted
      A. Abort this operation

is the TSM user input prompt that you don't see on the terminal?

FYI:  
Because of the `0<&6` redirection stdin should be still your keyboard  
so you could still blindly type in the needed input when TSM needs it  
(provided you could imagine the TSM user input prompts).

@jsmeix Sure, your assuming is right. The only problem here is that the
user input from TSM client isn't shown on terminal.  
Perhaps it is possible to use the `tee` tool to redirect the output to
log and on the terminal?  
And if the whole output from the restore with TSM shouldn't be shown on
the terminal and log, the option `-quiet` can be used with the `dsmc`
program.

@dcz01  
modify your ReaR scripts as you need it for your particular case  
and then show your exact changes to us here at ReaR upstream  
preferably as a GitHub pull request but plain `diff -u` output would be
also ok  
so that we could see what actually made things work for your specific
case.

I cannot do anything for the TSM code in ReaR on my own  
because - as I wrote (see above) - I do not use TSM.

Of course `tee` can be used (because ReaR is normal bash scripting).  
For an example see
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500\_make\_backup.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/500_make_backup.sh)

which contain explanatory comments that contain a link to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382)  
and therein in the comments there is the actual explanation of code like

    # Get stdin from where it was when 'rear' was launched = fd6 (usually the user's keyboard) and
    # append stdout where it was when 'rear' was launched = fd7 (usually the user's terminal) and
    # append stdout also to the log file that is used while 'rear' runs = $RUNTIME_LOGFILE and
    # append stderr where it was when 'rear' was launched = fd8 (usually the user's terminal) and
    # append stderr also to the log file that is used while 'rear' runs= $RUNTIME_LOGFILE
    ... 0<&6 1>> >( tee -a "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" 1>&7 ) 2>> >( tee -a "$RUNTIME_LOGFILE" 1>&8 )

See  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r418018571](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r418018571)  
that reads

    Attention:
    I think when using process substitution we must ensure
    to append to the filename that is the result of the process substitution
    because when we do not append we overwrite existing things in that file.
    So I think we must append via '2>> >( COMMAND )'
    instead of plain writing via '2> >( COMMAND )'
    for example

    0<&6 1>&7 2>> >( tee >( cat 1>&2 ) 1>&8 )
    0<&6 1>&7 2>> >( tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE 1>&8 )

    or for both stdout and stderr

    0<&6 1>> >( tee >( cat 1>&2 ) 1>&7 ) 2>> >( tee >( cat 1>&2 ) 1>&8 )
    0<&6 1>> >( tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE 1>&7 ) 2>> >( tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE 1>&8 )

    cf. the "Start logging" section in usr/sbin/rear
    https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/sbin/rear#L404

and the subsequent  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382\#discussion\_r419378558](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2382#discussion_r419378558)  
that reads

    Meanwhile I think when using process substitution '>( COMMAND )'
    we could use both '2>> >( COMMAND )' and '2> >( COMMAND )'
    because '>( COMMAND )' evaluates to a file name where to the
    current bash writes and where from COMMAND gets its stdin.
    Usually that intermediate file is a named pipe (FIFO).
    I think it does not matter if the current bash writes or appends to
    that intermediate file because the current bash is a single process
    so that both methods result that all is written sequentially and
    nothing is overwritten by another process (i.e. the current bash is
    the only writer to that intermediate file).
    But what matters is that COMMAND appends to the ReaR log file
    because when using process substitution COMMAND is run
    asynchronously as another process beside the current bash.
    Because the current bash has stdout redirected to the log file
    now the process substitution '2> >( COMMAND )' also writes
    asynchronously to the ReaR log file at the same time while
    the current bash stdout appends to the ReaR log file.

    With COMMAND = 'tee -a $RUNTIME_LOGFILE'
    I am sure it appends to the ReaR log file.

    In contrast with COMMAND = 'tee >( cat 1>&2 )'
    I am not sure if that actually appends to the ReaR log file.
    I think it could actually append to the ReaR log file if the
    result of the inner process substitution 'cat 1>&2' is
    that the cat stdout file descriptor is a copy of the
    current bash's stderr file descriptor which is
    redirected to append to the log file so that
    also cat actually appends to the log file.
    I think the 'tee >( ... )' plain stdout writing (no append)
    does not matter as described above because tee is a single
    process that writes into a FIFO wherefrom cat gets its stdin.
    What matters is whether or not cat stdout plain writes
    or actually appends to the ReaR log file.

    What I do not know is what excatly it means when a file descriptor
    is duplicated as in '1>&2' i.e. what excatly dup does.
    Usual documentation often talks about 'copy' of file descriptors
    but what I would like to know is what in the kernel's file access
    structures gets copied so that it exists as two separated things
    in particular when the current file position / file offset value gets
    copied when several process are accessing one same file, cf.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5256599/what-are-file-descriptors-explained-in-simple-terms

Because appending is right in any case for logging and termial output  
I prefer to explicitly append to be on the safe side  
instead of blindly relying on obscure things.

@jsmeix Now i found the problem and an bug of the TSM client
software...  
The problems is that some files are encrypted with an other key than
others and because of that TSM prompts for the password.  
In the log file i found that information where the saved key is deleted
because of an other entered key and then it must be entered another
time:

    tail -f /var/lib/rear/restore/TSM.\:.774.restore.log

For the prompt of the password i changed this line in
`restore/TSM/default/400_restore_with_tsm.sh`:

@dcz01  
thank you for your feedback.  
Now I can better understand the whole issue.

As time permits (but no promises) I may have a look at  
restore/TSM/default/400\_restore\_with\_tsm.sh  
how it could be improved to better work in cases  
when `dsmc restore` needs input from the user.  
There is a dilemma between "polluting" the user's terminal  
with tons of `dsmc restore` output in normal operation  
versus show `dsmc restore` output on the user's terminal  
when `dsmc restore` needs input from the user.  
If `dsmc restore` output in normal operation goes to stdout  
but the `dsmc restore` user input prompts appear on stderr  
(as the bash builtin `read` does it with its `-p prompt_text` output)  
we could have stdout only in the log  
and stderr on the terminal plus in the log via `tee`.

Have a relaxed and recovering weekend!
