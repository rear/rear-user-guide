@jsmeix  
Due to comment:

I though the convention here, is to make comments that fit within 80
characters. That is why I didn't left align them. Should the 80
character rule(r) comment be kept or removed?

I think that comment is more a hint that a strict rule  
because ist string length is 60 characters.  
Some characters are needed for the bash prompt  
in the recovery system but I think the current is still o.k.  
And even if it exceeds what fits on a line on a small terminal  
it is only a cosmetic issue.
