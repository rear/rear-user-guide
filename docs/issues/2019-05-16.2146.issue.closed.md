Just started looking at the skel dir and figuring out what it does.

I noticed that under skel/Fedora it has a 16 & 17 dir  
or OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR\_VERSION  
for rhel,cent,fedora & scientific OS\_MASTER\_VENDOR is set to Fedora.  
the 16 and 17 probably refer to fedora 16 & 17 which are out of support

right now rhel and centos are at ver 8, at some point (in quite a while)
they will reach 16 and having the 16, 17 dir may cause and issue.

Should skel/fedora\[16|17\] be removed?

@mutable-dan I created these many years ago and will have a look at them
to see whether we still need those somehow, will come back later on this
topic
