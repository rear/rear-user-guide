Hi.  
Trying to create the ISO file with the "rear -v mkrescue" command.  
The goal is just to create ISO file;  
then we will create the bootable USB stick with this ISO.  
The data backup and recover will be done with Rubrik instead of rear.  
However, the process keep reporting the error below and mkrescue is not
able to generate the ISO file:

    No partition label type for 'disk /dev/sdaa' (may cause 'rear recover' failure)
    Unsupported partition table '' (must be one of 'msdos' 'gpt' 'gpt_sync_mbr' 'dasd')**

The "disk /dev/sdaa" is one of the SAN storage  
connected through FC on this physical server;  
this physical server has multiple SAN storage connected through FC.

Checked the "/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf" file,  
and it shows rest of the SAN storage were excluded  
(guess this is excluded by default with the AUTOEXCLUDE parameter),  
except /dev/sdaa

How can we configure the mkrescue process to exclude /dev/sdaa  
so it can generate the ISO file we need?  
Thank you.

-   Workaround, if any:

AUTOEXCLUDE\_PATH refers to path of the mointpoint for the device, not
the device itself. So adding /dev/sdaa to this option wont solve your
issue. If the system uses multipath, output of multipath -ll probably
helps and rear log with debug option to get detailed debug output.

Hi.  
Thanks for the response.  
Looks like the multipath package wasn't installed on this Linux machine;
the multipath access to the SAN storage might have been provided by the
SAN client agent installed on this machine.  
In this case, is there other option that I can try to exclude this
specific disk from the mkrescue process?

This is the debug log I've generated:

Thanks.
