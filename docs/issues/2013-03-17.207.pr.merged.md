Commit1:  
CIFS: Fix cred option not detected + remove checking for cred options
co...mpletely so that users are not stuck with the guest mount option
when they want to use other then the cred cifs mount option. Only use
guest option by default when no other BACKUP\_OPTIONS are given.

For security reasons I did not want to store my credentials in plaintext
in the backup. So I wanted to give the cifs option "user" so that mount
(and rear) will interactively asks my password. This was not possible
with the current code. Additionally I found that when even giving the
"cred" option to cifs, this was not detected by the current code. In
other words it will still use the fallback "guest" option, even when
cred option is set by the user in BACKUP\_OPTIONS. Thanks

UPDATE:  
Commit2:  
cryptsetup functionality was broken. Fixed and tested backup AND restore
on a Fedora 17

1.  luks UUID starting with a number was not correctly saved in the
    layout file. First number was missing
2.  At restore time, the saved luks UUID was ignored when recreating the
    device which resulted in a failed boot on the restored machine
    (Dracut/initramfs which gets the command line options from grub2 was
    looking for the wrong luks UUID)
