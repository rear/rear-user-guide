@JohannesRoehlNovaStor  
in general regarding third-party backup tools and ReaR:  
We at ReaR upstream usually do not have those third-party backup tools  
(in particular not when a third-party backup tool is proprietary
software)  
so in case of issues with third-party backup tools and ReaR  
we can usually do nothing.
