for mount point saving, "look ma: without grep and awk".

Especially the excluded\_fs\_types list might need some additional
tuning.

Currently (i.e. until ReaR 2.3 is released)  
I have no time to review and/or test it  
but for ReaR 2.4 I will have a look.

@ProBackup-nl  
many thanks in advance for cleaning up  
such awkward code in ReaR!

@gdha  
I think the current code is ugly but works (at least there are no
reported issues)  
while the proposed changes can currently not work (because $STAT is
nowhere set).

I moved it to ReaR 2.5 - let's see if I find time for it...

@jsmeix This PR is more than 1 year old - what shall we do with it
(close it)?

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1637\#issuecomment-389874139](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1637#issuecomment-389874139)  
I close it as "won't fix" because in the foreseeable future I will
have  
no time to fix this pull request so that it works.
