Net certain if this affects only md-&gt;sd restores or sd-&gt;sd as well

disklabels are collected in
layout/prepare/GNU/Linux/13\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh but isn't
subsequently being used during restore-time filesystem creation. This
affects grub.conf and fstab, which can describe partitions as labels but
not as UUIDs (CentOS5). Rear does collect and restore UUIDs from
disklayout.conf:

fs /dev/sda1 /boot ext2 uuid=996f046e-7da7-4c7e-8c70-1c1cdfc16037 label=
blocksize=1024 reserved\_blocks=5% max\_mounts=27 check\_interval=180d
bytes\_per\_inode=4092 options=rw

> blkid /dev/sda1  
> /dev/sda1: LABEL="/boot" UUID="996f046e-7da7-4c7e-8c70-1c1cdfc16037"
> TYPE="ext2"

The disklabel was hand-applied using tune2fs

Ah, i see that a label can be added in the 'fs' lines of
disklayout.conf. this is not wildly intuitive, but once known, works
fine.

Shouldn't the label be set correctly in the disklayout.conf file
automatically to begin with ? So I am reopening because I don't
understand...

Sorry - in my haste, i should have fessed-up that this was in a
mdraid-&gt;sda recovery scenario, so of course ReaR (currently) has no
idea what to do with mostly anything from the source disklayout map, but
i think there's another open issue for discussion of that.

cheers

@jhoekx Your opinion is valued here ;-) Not sure if the current code can
handle manual modifications to labels and uuids in grub.conf and fstab,
or whether other known (related) issues should be considered for the
issue-tracker.

I don't think we handle modifications to labels/uuids. It's also hard to
implement, so out of scope for now.

To @dagwieers and @jhoekx : what we want to achieve with keeping this
issue open? If it is out of scope shouldn't we add it into our release
notes?

@gdha @schlomo By keeping this open it remains more visible for users,
and we can re-assess the need for implementing this. If we close these
issues, we risk never looking at them again and it makes it harder to
find them in a growing set of closed issues.

So the way I have managed this up to now is for issues that lack
feedback and are clearly support issues, I leave them tagged as
`support` `feedback` but I may close them asking to reopen and provide
more information if the issue still exists. Especially if we think this
has been fixed in a newer release. If issues have no feedback after 4
weeks, they get closed like this.

But improvements that have no-one assigned (so no-one currently is
interested to fix it) stay open, but may get moved to 'Rear future'
milestone. We never discussed this, it's just something I have been
doing. I am open to discuss other approaches though.

And yes, items like these should get mentioned in the documentation.
Maybe not as much in the release-notes because it's not something
specific to some release. It probably depends on the probability of
users running into this. If the probability is high, I rather see this
fixed instead of mentioned in the release notes ;-)

fills up the queue and nothings has been done - so better close it for
now
