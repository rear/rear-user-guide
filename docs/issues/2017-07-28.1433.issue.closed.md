While working on a git branch for implementing UserInput  
in layout/prepare/default/300\_map\_disks.sh  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1431](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1431)  
I noticed in the recovery system:

<pre>
RESCUE e205:~ # rear recover
...
Device sda has size 22548578304, 21474836480 expected
Switching to manual disk layout configuration.
Original disk /dev/sda does not exist in the target system.
Choose an appropriate replacement for /dev/sda
1) /dev/sda
2) /dev/sdb
3) Do not map /dev/sda
4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
(default 1 timeout 300 seconds)

Welcome to Relax-and-Recover. Run "rear recover" to restore your system !

rear> rear recover
ERROR: You cannot run rear from within the Relax-and-Recover shell !
rear>
</pre>

The reason is /etc/motd in the recovery system  
that results the misleading message for rear\_shell.

I think the easiest way is to remove /etc/motd  
from the recovery system when running "rear recover"  
because I think that /etc/motd message is only needed  
in the recovery system until the user launched "rear recover".  
Alternatively when running "rear recover" the /etc/motd  
content could be replaced by something better.

The `/etc/motd` is also shown from the logins so I prefer to keep it.
Can we find a way to better isolate `rear_shell` from the system?

A bit "hackish" but simple workaround could be  
to move /etc/motd away in the rear\_shell function  
and restore it afterwards.  
Next week I will play around and see...

Hmmm...  
while "rear recover" is running a /etc/motd message

<pre>
Run "rear recover" to restore your system !
</pre>

never ever makes sense so while "rear recover" is running  
that message should really not be in /etc/motd.

That is right. I think the message is printed in '/etc/profile' which
would be an easy place to fix (check if running inside rear and don't
print).

But yes, feel free to change the implementation. Main goal is to give
users a message after they log in, both locally and remote via SSH.

Probably a simple static

<pre>
Welcome to Relax-and-Recover.
</pre>

message could be sufficient in all cases?

Perhaps plus hostname and IP address like

<pre>
Welcome to Relax-and-Recover on $HOSTAME (192.168.100.1)
</pre>

(if that is possible).

Perhaps it is even better when users who may have accidentally  
logged in at a ReaR recovery system and don't know what that  
thingy is about shouldn't get told to blindly run "rear recover"?

I disagree. I think that systems should always tell you the next obvious
thing to do, so I would like to keep the hint about how to start the
actual recovery. I am sure that this saves us a lot of GitHub issues :-)

I also disagree.

I think that

<pre>
Run "rear recover" to restore your system !
</pre>

only makes sense as long as 'rear recover' was not started.

Assume one logs in from remote onto a ReaR recovery system  
where 'rear recover' is currently running, then a plain

<pre>
Welcome to Relax-and-Recover.
</pre>

should be right.

Also as soon as 'rear recover' was run once (even when it was  
aborted somewhere in the middle) the message

<pre>
Run "rear recover" to restore your system !
</pre>

is basically always wrong.

Either 'rear recover' had finished and another run could  
damage the already restored system  
or  
'rear recover' had failed or was aborted and then  
only the user who had run it before can know what to do  
but others should never blindly just run 'rear recover' again.

Therefore from my current point of view it is best when  
at the beginning of 'rear recover' /etc/motd gets replaced  
by something like the simple

<pre>
Welcome to Relax-and-Recover.
</pre>

For me
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1436](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1436)  
seems to work o.k.but I cannot imagine all possible use-cases.

FWIW:  
The rear\_shell function in lib/linux-functions.sh calls

<pre>
... bash --noprofile ...
</pre>

but for me /etc/profile in the recovery system is read  
regardless of the '--noprofile' option and in contrast to  
what "man bash" reads (or as far as I can understand that).

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1436](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1436)
merged  
this issue should be sufficiently avoided  
regardless that
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1436](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1436)  
is probably not yet a final proper solution, cf.
