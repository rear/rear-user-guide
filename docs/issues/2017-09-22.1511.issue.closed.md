#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660803?v=4" width="50">[OliverO2](https://github.com/OliverO2) opened issue at [2017-09-22 19:10](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1511):

Relax-and-Recover 2.2 (ReaR) copies SSH private user keys from
`/root/.ssh` to the rescue medium. These keys authenticate SSH access to
accounts on networked hosts without requiring a login password.

On the original system, the private keys are only accessible with root
user privileges. They can be encrypted with a passphrase, but often are
not to allow outgoing SSH connections for unattended backup operations.

The ReaR rescue medium, which may be a DVD or a USB stick, grants
complete unauthenticated access to all files, including copied private
key files. Unless changed by some action outside of ReaR, these private
keys remain valid for the original system, during recovery and on the
restored system.

#### Attack Vector

An attacker with physical access to the rescue medium can steal the
private user keys for the root account.

If the attacker obtains network access, he can then access other
accounts on the network authorizing the compromised root account via
their `authorized_keys` files.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by encrypting the root user's private
keys if the passphrase and the encryption method used can withstand an
offline attack.

#### Consequences

A successful attack allows an attacker to gain privileges on network
hosts and read and alter sensitive information.

We (i.e the ReaR upstream authors and maintainers)  
need to get this security issue fixed before the ReaR 2.3 release.

Regarding  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513\#issue-260096327](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1513#issue-260096327)

<pre>
This change improves the security of ReaR
but constitutes a breaking in change.
I find improving the security a good reason
for breaking changes, we just have to
explain it in the release notes.
</pre>

I cannot agree more.

In general regarding security issues:  
I think when there is a real security issue for ReaR  
it means the issue must be by default exploitable.  
A possible security issue that requires that the user has  
explicity specified something insecure is not a real  
security issue for ReaR because ReaR is a full  
(bare-metal) system installer where the user can  
and must be able do anything as he needs.  
When there is a real security issue for ReaR, then  
any fix will be a backward incompatible change  
because we must change the by default insecure  
behaviour into a secure one.

@gozora @schlomo @jsmeix As Vlad mentioned ISO's should be kept safe all
the time. That brings back memories from the past - see
[http://mkcdrec.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mkcdrec/mkcdrec/mediacheck/README](http://mkcdrec.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mkcdrec/mkcdrec/mediacheck/README)
- an ISO **mediacheck** - will not guarantee nobody can tamper with the
ISO image, but it will give you at least a stamp of the time it was
created (nothing more nothing less).

I asked the rear-users mailing list:

I see two aspects here:

1.  Secure recovery (media integrity). This could be addressed by
    digitally signing rescue media during creation and offering the user
    to verify the signature when attempting recovery.
2.  Protection against credentials theft.

@gozora @gdha When you advocate keeping rescue media safe at all times:

How would you protect against credentials theft with rescue media in
less-guarded environments like home offices or branch offices? Think
about burglary or less security-aware office people having access to
such media.

How would you protect against credentials theft in data centers where
personnel lacking top-level security clearance would be involved in
media handling? (On the original system you'd need root privileges
before using the private keys.)

I'm somehow confused, on one hand you are using unencrypted keys to
access servers and one the other hand advocating for high security.  
IMHO security must start from bottom and be kept on all levels, starting
with physical access through people and ending on SW layer. What you are
trying is just to somehow patch weak spots ..  
Sad true is that systems will never be 100% secure.

To answer your question

You could try this (or similar):

Sorry for the confusion. What's wrong with using unencrypted keys stored
on a secure (encrypted) medium?

Are you not worried that once one system get compromised, attacker will
gain access to all other servers as well?

Absolutely. It all depends on the entire network being securely set up.
I am aware of that and always try to find a reasonable trade-off between
security and usability.

After all, the most secure system is the one that cannot be used at all.

And one extra note: Access is always granted with the least privilege
required.

Now I'm confused again :-(

Ah now I got your point (sometimes I quite slow).  
But sometimes even having minimal access rights is enough to get root
privileges ;-)

While I think there are reasons anyway not to store secrets (like
ssh-keys) in the rescue image even if stored confidentially there are
usage scenarios where you'll have to store the image on untrusted
storage: e.g. a host in a data center with no direct hardware access.
The only way to restore is to provide the iso file in some way as a
rescue system with the tools the data center provides. Some have these
features: instead of a general rescue image you can provide a custom iso
on some file server - maybe your backup server.

But what about the secret of the backup storage? Correct me - but per
default also the passphrases of the various backup systems are stored to
rear image per default if configured.

We avoid this while not using rear for common daily backups - but for
rescue system only. So we do not store the passphrase for the backup (in
our case: borg) inside the rear config but provide them manually during
rescue image creation.

I'm not a long time user of rear so maybe I just missed the possibility
to configure the behavior already. If not it would be nice to decide
with some options if passphrases should be stored in rescue image or
not.
