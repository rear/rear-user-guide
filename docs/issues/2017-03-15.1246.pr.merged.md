This is only a proposal how I think the test for  
the /boot/efi directory might be simplified.  
Currently I do not understand the logic, cf  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6c477d4e99edeb21a1a8c7649c24b2a56de535a7\#commitcomment-21329841](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/6c477d4e99edeb21a1a8c7649c24b2a56de535a7#commitcomment-21329841)  
and therefore I ask for a careful review here.

Because of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1246\#pullrequestreview-27284096](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1246#pullrequestreview-27284096)  
I would like to do "first things first" and  
merge this small cleanup change now and  
do the "grand /boot/efi cleanup" separatedly later.
