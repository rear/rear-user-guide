[\#2717 PR](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2717) `closed`: Add a prerelabel with setfiles before the first reboot, because autorelabel is not always reliable

Starting in RHEL8.4, the selinux policy does not allow systemd to access
unlabeled files anymore, thus if the restored filesystem has not the
correct labels (for example /etc/localtime), systemd will not be able to
boot and relabel will fail and system will not boot.

Hello @bwelterl , thanks for the patch. Would it make sense to run
setfiles in the `/mnt/local` chroot? This way you would not need to add
`PROGS+=( setfiles )`. I believe that it is common to run such
post-restore fixups in the chroot.

Hello,  
I was thinking about this.  
I will test it, it will be easier and no need to add modification in the
backup phase.

Thanks

Thanks @pcahyna  
I changed the code to execute in the chroot. It seems to work well.  
Thanks

So, while your change makes sense for TSM, I suspect that it is only
papering over a deeper problem for RSYNC. I will look at solving the
problem in more generic ways for RSYNC.  
In the meantime, can you please try the `getfattr` test above for the
restored systems, especially with TSM, as I don't have access to TSM? I
would like to know whether the TSM problems are limited to SELinux
attributes.

I know nothing about SELinux so I may misunderstand things

`diff -w` shows no differences in that code.

At least for me with BACKUP=NETFS both  
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/500\_selinux\_autorelabel.sh  
and  
usr/share/rear/restore/default/500\_selinux\_autorelabel.sh  
are run

    # usr/sbin/rear -s recover | grep selinux

    Source restore/default/500_selinux_autorelabel.sh
    Source restore/NETFS/Linux-i386/510_selinux_fixfiles_exclude_dirs.sh

so I wonder it it wouldn't be simpler to have that code only in  
usr/share/rear/restore/default/500\_selinux\_autorelabel.sh  
(perhaps with some additional conditions to run it there)?

Hello,

Yes, I added it in both files because I was looking for the .autorelabel
file, where this should be executed.  
But I did'nt dig to see why it's in both places. Of course, it will be
better to have only one.

Thanks

@jsmeix I believe that the whole SELinux handling needs some overhaul (I
saw some oddities when working on the rsync cleanup, but I had no time
to dig deeper).  
@bwelterl why is it needed at all for BACKUP=NETFS? I thought that you
are concerned about BACKUP=TSM and BACKUP=RSYNC.  
I suspect that for tar and rsync the whole relabeling stuff might be
unneeded nowadays and it should be kept only for methods like TSM.

@pcahyna  
regarding what you wrote above in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2717\#issuecomment-976603335](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2717#issuecomment-976603335)

    I suspect that for tar and rsync the whole relabeling stuff might be
    unneeded nowadays and it should be kept only for methods like TSM

I wonder if such "relabeling stuff" should depend on the backup method  
because I think this would be RFC 1925 item 6a  
"It is always possible to add another level of indirection."  
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925)

When the condition that is tested to find out whether or not "relabeling
stuff"  
needs to be done is the backup method then not the actual condition is
tested  
but some indirect condition that may mostly work but will sometimes
fail, e.g.  
think about BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE where the user uses TSM  
(for whatever reason he wants to restore manually).

So I think there should be a generic script that is always run after the
backup was restored  
that tests an actual condition to find out whether or not "relabeling
stuff" needs to be done.

Such an actual test could be something like the above in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2717\#issuecomment-976382378](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2717#issuecomment-976382378)  
mentioned `getfattr` test for the restored usr/bin/ping  
i.e. /mnt/local/usr/bin/ping or via chroot inside the restored system.

To be more fail save and not depend on particular restored files of the
system  
(the user may have removed extended attributes from his /usr/bin/ping)  
ReaR may create its own file with extended attributes in an appropriate
directory  
(i.e. a directory that is likely included in the backup so ReaR's file
gets restored,  
my first offhanded idea is CONFIG\_DIR="$REAR\_DIR\_PREFIX/etc/rear")  
and test that one (if that file is not restored do some reasonable
fallback).

Hello,

The output after the after the restore with TSM is the expected one:

    # getfattr -d -m- /usr/bin/ping
    getfattr: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names

    # file: usr/bin/ping
    security.capability=0sAAAAAgAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
    security.selinux="system_u:object_r:ping_exec_t:s0"

But this is for a file, where the selinux xattr are not affected with
TSM. It's only links that lose the xattrs.  
I'm not aware of a link with extended attributes.  
Do you have one from the system ?  
Tx
