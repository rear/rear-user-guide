-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

When running rear -v mkbackup, at the point "Creating tar archive
'/tmp..."  
I would bee Archived and a counter showing how much has been archived.  
From my output above, this Archiving status never shows in terminal
and  
the backup.tar output file is 0 Bytes, and I don't see any obvious error
files in the log.

Also in the log file I see that `BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY=`  
which is baffling since my other Rear test, the password is never
present in the log.

the way I installed rear was:  
yum install rear

-   Workaround, if any:

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"

I think I may have inadvertently solved this by running yum update, but
I had to run yum remove rear, then yum install rear and now its backing
up.

I will report back if the log file has the password.

@chumunga  
how exactly is the log entry with `BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY=...` ?  
My offhanded guess is that it looks like

    + source /root/rear.github.master/etc/rear/local.conf
    ...
    ++ BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY=my_secret_key

i.e. with leading '+' but never without leading '+'  
which means you only get it in debugscript mode with `-D`  
(see "man rear" what debugscript mode does)  
and then it works as designed.

But - what is worse - the BACKUP\_PROG\_CRYPT\_KEY value
`my_secret_key`  
gets explicitly logged to the separated backup.log file (when not in
debugscript mode)  
for example in
usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
by this code

        Log ...
            ... $BACKUP_PROG_DECRYPT_OPTIONS $BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY ...

This are the files that contain `BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY`

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'BACKUP_PROG_CRYPT_KEY'
    usr/share/rear/build/default/960_remove_encryption_keys.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/NETFS/default/400_restore_backup.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/405_recreate_users_and_groups.sh
    usr/share/rear/restore/YUM/default/410_restore_backup.sh
    usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/500_make_backup.sh
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/600_check_encryption_key.sh

I will check them all...

@chumunga  
thank you very much for your careful inspection of what is in the log.  
It is a critical security issue when secrets appear in a log file  
(unless `rear` is run in debugscript mode).

Ahh sorry your right I did use the -D since I was testing/debugging.

Also I resolved the issue of the backup file zero byte issue. I believe
my mistake was that I ran  
\#yum install rear syslinux genisoimage cifs-utils
grub2-efi-x64-modules  
First, then ran yum update (there was a lot to update) and this is when
I had the issue.

However, I then decided to run Yum remove rear, then followed by yum
install rear and this resolved the issue for me.
