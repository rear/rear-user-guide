-   How was this pull request tested?  
    On my openSUSE Leap 15.0 (SLES12-like) system

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Basically I reverted the main part of  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985/commits/8b39c585c502be19d41b64d9530f661fcc6bf6c2](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985/commits/8b39c585c502be19d41b64d9530f661fcc6bf6c2)  
    i.e. we do no longer call `file` to verify if the KERNEL\_FILE  
    variable actually contains a 'kernel' file so that now e.g.

<pre>
KERNEL_FILE="/etc/os-release"
</pre>

"just works" again (ReaR obeys user's commandments) as it did in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985\#discussion\_r237451729](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1985#discussion_r237451729)  
see there for the reasoning why.

By the way I simplified the code: Less `if` conditions actually
needed.  
My personal preference is to avoid nested code when possible
