### ReaR version

rear-2.6-25.el9.x86\_64

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

Greetings,

I used DELL iDRAC media redirection to boot a rear rescue image created
with `OUTPUT=ISO`. The grub menu comes up but both the "no secure" and
"secure" boot options state "could not find /isolinux/kernel". That's
strange, because I mounted the image to linux and see that path. Must be
some grub thing that I don't understand. I did try putting prefix
`(cd0)` in the grub path to the kernel image, to no avail. This node is
EFI.

Regards,  
Brian

> DELL iDRAC media redirection

Just a guess: is the redirected medium really `(cd0)` ? Maybe `(cd0)` is
the physical DVD drive (if you have any) and the redirected (virtual)
medium is `(cd1)` or something else?

Please, when in GRUB, try going to the command line and execute
`echo ${root} ${prefix}` and show the output.
