@OliverO2  
if you like I can merge it as is right now.

I tried to proof-read the whole
doc/user-guide/13-tcg-opal-support.adoc  
but I cannot because I do not have the needed general understanding  
about this area so I would need too much time unitl I could proof-read
it.  
On a quick first glance I am somewhat confused by the various wordings  
for example "SED" versus "Opal disk" (are both same or different
things?)  
so at least for me its hard to understand how all those things belong to
each other.  
I understand that it is about to boot from an encrypted disk (something
like LUKS)  
but I fail to imagine the bigger overall picture so I fail to understand
the details.  
I think generic information about Opal 2-compliant self-encrypting disk
(SED)  
is not needed in ReaR's documenation but a link to such generic
information  
at the beginning of ReaR's documenation could help a lot. Of course I
could  
use Google and find out things on my own but there are other things
with  
higher priority that I have to do first (and likely there will always be
some  
other thing with higher priority that I have to do first).

@OliverO2  
can I merge it or do you like to do more improvements?

I agree, proof-reading it all without ever touching the stuff is a bit
tedious. Feedback so far suggests that the overall TCG Opal 2 guide
works. The new "Quick Start" section just eases the initial setup.

The section "TCG Opal 2-compliant Self-Encrypting Disks" (which existed
before) explains the concepts. So everything should be in there.
Regarding the difference between "SED" and "Opal disk", the first
sentence of that section is:

> An Opal 2-compliant self-encrypting disk (SED) encrypts disk contents
> in hardware.

The term "SED" refers to any kind of self-encrypting disk. A "TCG Opal
2-compliant disk" or short "Opal disk" is a variant of an SED which
implements the Opal 2 standard. There are/were other SED variants on the
market using proprietary protocols.

In general, these disks all provide full disk encryption in hardware,
similar to what LUKS does in software. The main differences are
performance, boot protection and trust. LUKS may show degraded
performance with specific access patterns. LUKS also requires a
non-encrypted boot partition on most installations which is not
tamper-resistant. SEDs operate at full drive/interface performance
without buffering issues. They provide a special read-only boot
partition (the PBA), which is tamper-proof. The SED's encryption
mechanism is closed source, so there are trust issues. Some early models
had implementation deficiencies.

So yes, it can be merged now!

@OliverO2  
thank you for your continuous improvements of the Opal disk support in
ReaR  
in particular even improvements of documentation and not only plain
code!

And thank you for your explanation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2512\#issuecomment-723968521](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2512#issuecomment-723968521)

@OliverO2  
I could not resist to add the basics of your explanation in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2512\#issuecomment-723968521](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2512#issuecomment-723968521)

If you are against it I would remove it.

@jsmeix That's OK. Thanks for reviewing and merging!
