I have a few machines where sda and the first few disks are GPT
formatted then the OS disks are something like sdh and sdi etc and these
use GRUB2 installed in a BIOS partition to boot. Because of this, rear
incorrectly chooses to use EFI as the bootloader for backup and restore
purposes which will cause the USB rear disk to fail to boot.

I cannot find any documentation on how to manually define the bootloader
type to use so I had to read the source code. The user has to create a
file `/etc/sysconfig/bootloader` containing:

    LOADER_TYPE="grub2"

To force rear to use BIOS grub recovery.

I think this is a very important point to note and so I think this
should be covered in the README / Quickstart guide but I wanted to
discuss it here first because maybe we should expose this as a command
line option or make it possible to specify this in the main rear config
file because I think /etc/sysconfig/bootloader is specific to Suse
Linux. The /etc/sysconfig dir doesn't exist at all by default under
Ubuntu so its a bit messy having to create that dir/file for this one
setting.

Looking into this a bit more, I think I should actually be using

    LOADER_TYPE="GRUB"

Because that is the string I see if I check the output of a command
like:

    dd if=/dev/sdh bs=512 count=4 | strings > boottest

These machines are definitely using grub2 as their bootloader but they
return GRUB so why is there also a `grub2` bootloader setting? Does it
make any difference? Should I recreate my backups using
`LOADER_TYPE="GRUB"`? I would've thought GRUB would've been used for
GRUB 1.x?

Hello, I am curious about what is happening with firmware detection. It
seems that you are saying that ReaR detects it should use an EFI
bootloader, because it sees that the first disks have an EFI partition
label. Are you sure about that? IIRC ReaR detects EFI according to the
content of `/sys/firmware`, but maybe I have misunderstood.

The script that checks for EFI vs BIOS is
rear/layout/save/default/445\_guess\_bootloader.sh

It takes a dd sample of the first 4 blocks of all your disks (starting
with /dev/hd\* and /dev/sd\*) then greps the strings output of those
boot blocks for GRUB/GRUB2 etc UNLESS you have a
`/etc/sysconfig/bootloader` file present to override the auto detection.
So it seems that for most people whatever partitioning you have on
/dev/sda dictates what rear will presume to be your firmware type.

Thank you for the pointer! According to the code, you should be able to
set the bootloader manually using the `BOOTLOADER` configuration
variable (it is even documented for this purpose in
`/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`).

Why is this the case? Does having a GPT on `/dev/sda` imply that
`rear/layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh` detects GRUB2-EFI ?
Also, according to your original description, it seems that your problem
is that the USB rescue disk fails to boot (" which will cause the USB
rear disk to fail to boot"). If so, I don't see how a misdetection in
`rear/layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh` can lead to this
problem, because the result of this detection is apparently not being
used in the decision what bootloader to install on the rescue disk
(another variable is used for that purpose: `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER`,
which is determined in a different way in
`usr/share/rear/prep/default/320_include_uefi_env.sh` ). Can you please
describe in detail what problem exactly are you having and what are you
doing to create the rescue disk? Also, what ReaR version are you using?

These questions are because I've not tried using rear to do a restore on
any of these machines yet and so I'm concerned that if I don't get the
various UEFI settings correct then it will fail to re-install the
bootloader (GRUB), won't boot the USB recovery or maybe the restore will
fail completely? There is probably a way I can do a no-op restore that
tells me what it would do when restoring without actually doing a
restore right?

You're right, I was unaware that BOOTLOADER could already be set in the
main rear config. I presume I should configure that to "GRUB"? I presume
"grub2" is used in older versions of grub2 or in a non-Ubuntu OS.

I find it strange that the BOOTLOADER setting has no effect on
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER`. This implies that LOADER could be set to GRUB
(BIOS) yet `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` could be true?

My UEFI server that I'm trying to back up with GRUB isn't using secure
boot. I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 and using the rear package from the 20.04
repos. The USB disks are 1 TB and so don't need to use UEFI to access
space above 2 TB.

Can you please describe what issue are you having, or is this report
purely a result of code analysis? Or, do you see anything in the ReaR
log that makes you think the rescue image or backup is somehow wrong? If
so, please include the relevant log snippet.

Concerning

> There is probably a way I can do a no-op restore

not sure about that, but you can definitely boot the rescue USB without
performing a restore to check whether it is at least bootable, and you
can try a restore to clean disks (disconnect the current disks, and
connect clean disks of the same size and perform a real restore to
them). Alternatively, you can restore to a new machine (preferably as
identical as possible to the machine that you are backing up).

I've already explained the root cause of my doubt and the reason I
opened this ticket. I have a few machines that are UEFI capable but I
have set them up to use BIOS boot because their OS disks are using mdadm
software RAID which works best with BIOS GRUB booting. However, when I
run rear with its default config it detects the bootloader as being EFI
instead of GRUB. This makes me think it might not backup, restore or
fail to both correctly.

So what difference does EFI vs GRUB make to rear? It must make a
difference somewhere or else why are there scripts to detect it? Or am I
worrying about nothing because it doesn't matter and rear can
successfully restore a EFI image to a BIOS machine (I doubt it)?

Should rear be able to successfully restore my software RAID10 config?
To do that rear would need to know to re-install GRUB on the relevant
disks.

Its a shame there is no dummy restore option because I don't have a
spare set of disks to do a pretend restore with so I'd like to be
reassured I have used the right settings.

@danboid  
you must try out and verify for each one of your machines  
that "rear recover" actually works for you.  
See in particular the section  
"Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Regarding bootloader and ReaR:

There are two related but separated bootloader parts in ReaR:

A)  
The bootloader that is used on the ReaR rescue/recovery system

B)  
The bootloader that is used on the original system where "rear
mkrescue/mkbackup" is run and that needs to be reinstalled during "rear
recover" on the recreated target system on replacement hardware

Unfortunately the various bootloader and EFI related  
user config variables that are described in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
do not clearly distinguish between the two cases  
so things get rather tricky if bootloader specific  
settings are needed for special cases.

You have said:

but you have not said how do you know what ReaR chooses. I suppose you
found out reading a log or in the program output, so please add the part
of log file or output that makes you think so (the log preferably
created using the -D option).

Am I correct in assuming then that rear cannot restore a mdraid (RAID
10) config?

Your assumption is generally not correct, I have tested that config
recently (not for the boot disk though).

EDIT: I have not tested either a configuration like yours where "the OS
disks are something like sdh and sdi etc" so it may well behave
incorrectly, but is is not like RAID10 is unsupported in general.

I run

    rear mkbackup

And that prints something like

    Using guessed bootloader EFI for 'rear recover' (found in first bytes on $disk_device with GPT BIOS boot partiion)

For example, sda-sdg are a ZFS pool then disks sdh-sdk are mdraid array.
Does rear remember which disks it should be restoring to or will it
prompt me when I run the recover? Will it then re-install GRUB on each
one of the disks in the mdraid array after restoring?

This message comes from
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/445_guess_bootloader.sh`, which sets
the bootloader to be reinstalled (case B), not the bootloader on the USB
rescue disk.

Yes, thats what I thought it was and it rear doesn't detect it correctly
so I expect it would fail to restore correctly too.

If the disks have the same names and same sizes, it should remember them
(I believe it still prompts you to confirm disk mapping). But it needs
to be tested for your specific case.

It reinstalls GRUB on the MBR of disks that contain the /boot partition,
not sure about the details though.

For mdraid arrays, GRUB needs to installed on each disk within the
array. I might have to do that bit myself if rear doesn't do it for me.

I think that `BOOTLOADER` is meant for case B and
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` is meant for case A. But
`usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh` is using
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER`, despite being intended to handle case B. Even
more confusingly, a comment in the script says "The solution is to
specify the BOOTLOADER config variable", but the script does not use
that variable.

ReaR has a dependency resolution for storage components, so it installs
GRUB to every device that `/boot` resides on (including devices that are
RAID components) - so this should work.

That's good news about the GRUB installation.

OK so my conclusion here is that rears detection of the host system
firmware isn't very reliable so we should add a bit about the need to
configure the BOOTLOADER variable to the README and not have this hidden
away for those who read the config file in full to discover.

I suppose my config is a niche case where the first disk doesn't reflect
your firmware but I think this will still be common enough a issue to
make mention of it in the README.

Something like

"Users booting using BIOS but who don't have their OS disk as their
first disk will need to set the BOOTLOADER variable to configure your
choice of bootloader correctly. rears choice of bootloader is otherwise
auto detected by the layout of the first disk it sees."

    For mdraid arrays, GRUB needs to installed on each disk within the array

I assume you actually mean nowadays GRUB2 and not GRUB legacy.

In theory this should work via the code in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh

In practice it did sometimes not work automatically for my RAID1 tests  
(I guess in particular when I experimented with recreating  
on a bit different disks - but I don't remember the details).

But it always worked for me by setting GRUB2\_INSTALL\_DEVICES  
to what I need (see its description in default.conf)

    usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh
    ...
    a comment in the script says
    "The solution is to specify the BOOTLOADER config variable",
    but the script does not use that variable.

Each end evey time when I have to deal with our bootloader  
related config variables I get confused and then  
each end evey time I have to dig in our code  
to get some vague idea how all that might be meant to work.

In this case

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear -type f | xargs grep 'BOOTLOADER' | egrep -v '_BOOTLOADER|NOBOOTLOADER'

shows that other `finalize/Linux-i386/6*_install_*.sh`  
scripts check the BOOTLOADER variable, in particular  
finalize/Linux-i386/630\_install\_grub.sh does

    test "GRUB" = "$BOOTLOADER" || return 0

so it seems finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
does not check BOOTLOADER because it is used as fallback  
to install the nowadays most often used bootloader  
unless the BOOTLOADER variable tells otherwise.

So I think  
"The solution is to specify the BOOTLOADER config variable"  
means:  
To avoid that whatever automatisms in ReaR  
may set a wrong BOOTLOADER value  
the solution is to specify the BOOTLOADER config variable  
to the actually right bootloader.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/33c6cc6f6ff1f8608f7227f70da2a2f2b6b532e3](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/33c6cc6f6ff1f8608f7227f70da2a2f2b6b532e3)  
I explain in finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
that this script is also used as fallback to install  
the nowadays most often used bootloader GRUB2  
unless the BOOTLOADER variable tells to install another bootloader  
(other bootloader install scripts check the BOOTLOADER variable).

Hopefully my assumption from my above  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2817\#issuecomment-1148488339](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2817#issuecomment-1148488339)  
is right so this really is how that code is actually meant.

that was my understanding as well: the script does depend on
`BOOTLOADER` indirectly (via `NOBOOTLOADER`), because other scripts
check `BOOTLOADER` and then set `NOBOOTLOADER`.

@jsmeix

It seems that because of my slightly unusual disk config, I have to
configure BOOTLOADER. Can you confirm setting `BOOTLOADER` to `GRUB`
does the same as `grub2`? Do you know why we have multiple variables for
GRUB? Does rear even support GRUB 1.x, 0.99 or whatever the legacy GRUB
version was? Not that I need to use that, but its part of my question
about manually setting BOOTLOADER. I also ask because on my grub2 using
machines they report as being `GRUB` according to strings.

EDIT

When I say 'they report as' I mean when I manually run the command that
rear uses in its scripts, not what rear decides it is.
