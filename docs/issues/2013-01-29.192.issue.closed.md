Hello,

my config sets OUTPUT=PXE and BACKUP=DP.  
PXE files (kernel, initrd, menu, message, MAC links) are placed to
/var/lib/rear/output, but not to a location defined by OUTPUT\_URL.

I guess the problem is with the
`output/ISO/Linux-i386/90_transfer_image.sh` script where the
OUTPUT\_URL is used to transfer the image (that's good), but we seem to
assume that the destination path exists (if we use BACKUP=NETFS scheme
then it is normally the case), but in case we use another BACKUP scheme
such as RBME or DP (or another external backup program) then we might
run into problems such as following error (non-fatal for rear?) saying
`cp: cannot create regular file /tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/hostname: not a directory`

This is indeed the case if BACKUP=DP, OUTPUT=ISO and there is no
${NETFS\_PREFIX} directory under OUTPUT\_URL ( part of log file:
[https://gist.github.com/adbaca2ba03c4f9ae85e](https://gist.github.com/adbaca2ba03c4f9ae85e)
)

However, with the BACKUP=DP, OUTPUT=PXE, no routine tries to copy PXE
files to OUTPUT\_URL at all.

With BACKUP=NETFS, OUTPUT\_URL is honored with OUTPUT=PXE as well as
OUTPUT=ISO, controlled by output/NETFS/default/20\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh
and output/NETFS/default/95\_copy\_result\_files.sh

It would be more consistent, if OUTPUT\_URL is honored same way,
regardless the BACKUP method used.

This seem to me now more enhancement request, than bug :)

Another possibility is to extend PXE\_TFTP\_PATH and PXE\_CONFIG\_PATH
to support url: I opened another issue \#193

In order to be more constructive, i tried to patch the rear in order to
separate backup url and output url handling, for your consideration.

I introduced OUTPUT\_PREFIX variable and cloned output\_path function to
backup\_path function.  
I removed output handling functions from NETFS output stage and moved to
default output stage.

Tested yet only with rear mkbackup, rear recover testing in progress.

Of course, the change is not only cosmetic and patch may break something
i have not considered; please just throw it away, if its non-sense ;)

@pavoldomin very interesting patch. Idea is good, but not sure if it is
bulletproof?? The `OUTPUT_PREFIX` variable is a good idea. Perhaps, we
should align this towards an `BACKUP_PREFIX` variable too? In general we
can just copy `NETFS_PREFIX` to `BACKUP_PREFIX`, but I think it is
better we make parallel ways (which are quite similar in naming
convention).  
Are you sure you didn't mix up `bpath` with `opath` in all cases? Please
do enough tests to be sure the paths can be different in all aspects.
Great job - I wish we got more of these inputs.  
When you proof that it works all the way why don't you make a "pull
request" for it?

Sorry for my slow latency; I have successfully tested on some setups
(ISO output and NETFS & DP backup, old DL proliant with the OS on cciss
logical drives). We still need to test on another configurations.

Few more thoughts (I am not able to test these targets, so I'm not
providing patch)

-   Perhaps it would make sense removing also output scripts for RSYNC?

        --- a/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/20_make_prefix_dir.sh
        +++ /dev/null

    and

        --- a/usr/share/rear/output/RSYNC/default/90_copy_result_files.sh
        +++ /dev/null

-   Not quite sure, but i believe also part of
    `output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/90_copy_ramdisk.sh` may now be cut below
    `RESULT_FILES=` block.

-   implement `OUTPUT_PREFIX` also for
    `fish|ftp|ftps|hftp|http|https|sftp|rsync` (it would however break
    target path for existing configurations)

-   `NETFS_PREFIX` &lt;=&gt; `BACKUP_PREFIX` and implement also for
    `fish|ftp|ftps|hftp|http|https|sftp|rsync`

-   But - as it can change behavior of existing configurations
    (`${RESULT_FILES[@]}` might be uploaded to different place) - it
    requires a discussion.

I will check the RSYNC workflow...  
@dagwieers can you comment on the `OUTPUT_PREFIX` for
`fish|ftp|ftps|hftp|http|https|sftp|rsync` ?  
@jhoekx can you comment on
`output/RAMDISK/Linux-i386/90_copy_ramdisk.sh` ?

Indeed serious testing is still required.

Hi,

I have now tested this commit in the complete disaster recovery
scenarios, at various combinations of `BACKUP=DP`, `BACKUP=NETFS`, and
`OUTPUT=ISO`, `OUTPUT=PXE`, on couple of our enterprise linux setups,
SAN or cciss/hpsa logical drive booting. Works just fine. Also fiddled
with the `KEEP_OLD_NETFS_COPY/KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY` options.

Also managed to try `BACKUP=RSYNC` with the `BACKUP_URL=ssh://...`, no
problem. I just could not get working `OUTPUT_URL=rsync://...` - because
I got no rsync server running on other site - and it cannot be told to
use ssh connection at the moment.  
*Update*: just realized that this is already fixed by

We detected minor bug introduced with the patch.  
If `OUTPUT_URL` is the same as `BACKUP_URL` and in the same time we
enable `KEEP_OLD_NETFS_COPY`, than resulting output files (pxe or iso
image) are moved to `.old` backup dir. I believe this happens in both
`mkbackup` and `mkbackuponly` modes.

This is because of the flaw

    Using log file: /var/log/rear/rear-srv.log
    Simulation mode activated, Relax-and-Recover base directory: /usr/share/rear
    …
    Source output/default/15_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh
    …
    Source output/default/95_copy_result_files.sh
    …
    Source backup/NETFS/default/15_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh
    …
    Source backup/NETFS/default/50_make_backup.sh
    …

i.e. the prefix dir is copied in the backup phase, after the output
result files are stored there in output phase.  
The solution I can think of, would be either to place both
`15_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh` scripts before backup and output are
sourced, or call `cp -a` instead of `mv` inside.

What do you think?

@pavoldomin I think as we have 2 variables now `KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY`
and `NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY` we can close this issue?

In my opinion it's safe to close this issue. If needed it can be
re-opened
