@exfarmer  
I am not at all an NFS expert so I cannot provide  
authoritative information in this area.

I think in general ReaR should also work with NFS V4  
because otherwise I would expect many issues from users  
who use BACKUP=NETFS without BACKUP\_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"

From my (limited) experience with NFS issues in ReaR  
I think when ReaR had issues with NFS the root cause  
was in most cases something outside of ReaR  
like improper NFS setup on the NFS server or  
improper NFS things on the client where ReaR runs.

In conf/default.conf I found

    # BACKUP=RBME
    ##
    # This mode allows restoring a RBME backup from NFS shares.
    # As NFSv4 is not fully supported with ReaR (yet) it is safer to
    # use BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock" in the local.conf file.
    # Note: You may have to open appropriate TCP/UDP ports on the NFS server (iptables).

According to `git log --follow -p usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf`  
this is from @gdha more than 10 years ago in 2012  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7033653993fb08aa938a09b6395f02ded2821778](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/7033653993fb08aa938a09b6395f02ded2821778)

I don't know if this comment is still relevant nowadays.

By searching for 'nfs' in doc/rear-release-notes.txt  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt\#L3492](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt#L3492)  
I found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/754](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/754)  
which leads to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fdcaf7ad58a181b7dd1e535e78acf94addf62062](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fdcaf7ad58a181b7dd1e535e78acf94addf62062)

So NFS version 4 specific things are (mostly) implemented in  
prep/NETFS/default/100\_check\_nfs\_version.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/100\_check\_nfs\_version.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/NETFS/default/100_check_nfs_version.sh)  
which is run during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
and in  
verify/NETFS/default/050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050\_start\_required\_nfs\_daemons.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/verify/NETFS/default/050_start_required_nfs_daemons.sh)  
which is run during "rear recover".

@exfarmer Yes, we use ReaR in combination with NFS version 4.0 all the
time.  
If the NFS server has to pass many hops make sure that the MTU values
are the same everywhere, as otherwise, too many packet drops may be
possible.  
We are also switching from gzip to zstd as compression algorithm as it
much faster and it provides lossless compression that is splittable
(gzip is not splittable).

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3053](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3053)  
I propose to update the RBME description in default.conf
