Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?

`UEFI`

Brief description of the issue:
-------------------------------

My server recently crashed and the main filesystem now has some errors.
I want to recover from a backup I made some days ago, but I cannot boot
into the Relax-and-Recover entry from the UEFI screen anymore after this
crash (GRUB2 also doesn't show the entry anymore) so something messed up
rear's bootfiles or the partition itself. When I manually select the
UEFI entry "Relax-and-Recover", I get an empty GRUB prompt.

First, I thought with a `rear mkrescue` the ISO would be recreated and
it would boot then. But it did not work. It still doesn't boot.

The filesystem error occured in the \[/\] partition. The
\[/mnt/mainstorage0\] and \[/mnt/backupstorage0\] which are both
separate disks are still okay. \[/mnt/tmp\] is an empty ReaR USB
stick.  
\[/mnt/backupstorage0\] is where my backup archive and also the ReaR ISO
is stored.

Work-around, if any:
--------------------

I tried to load the system with an USB stick but I don't know how to
recover my system from there. A simple "rear recover" doesn't work. My
backup files are on the \[/mnt/backupstorage0\] disk, which are not
mounted anyway in this ReaR environment. How can I tell the
`rear recover` program which backup it should use? And how does it know
which disk it has to recover? `man rear` and `rear --help` don't mention
anything about such options.

@AmonBune I'm still a bit confused about your setup :-).  
You've stated that you use *OUTPUT=ISO* which creates ISO boot file, but
then you've mentioned following as well:

> I tried to load the system with an USB stick but I don't know how to

Should I understand it like you currently have ISO (which is not
booting) as well as USB stick which is booting fine, form which are you
just not able to recover?

This is implication of using *file://*, before running `rear recover`
you need to mount your backup source manually, something like:

    mkdir /mnt/backupstorage0
    # /dev/sdf1 is just a blind guess, you need to find right disk by your self ;-)
    mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/backupstorage0 

    rear recover

Yes, this is correct, I have the non-bootable ISO and a bootable USB
stick.

How does ReaR know which disk is the target disk? Does it store the
unique ID of the hard disk or how does it do that? I will try your
solution later and report back to you.

Okay, your solution would probably work, but ReaR searches the backup
archive at a wrong location. It looks like a random folder, like so:
`/tmp/rear.GasN2HK2jS/rear-backups/Cloudsdale/`. The random part also
changes everytime I run the `rear recover` command. Really annoying
since I cannot mount something to a location I don't know. How can I
change this? I used the options that are commented out in the config for
USB creation.

I don't think this is valid behavior, backup should be loaded from
location specified in
`BACKUP_URL="file:///mnt/backupstorage0/rear-backups"`, but it is some
time since I've used `file://` ...  
I'll try to setup ReaR in same way as yours and let you know ...

Can you confirm that */etc/rear/local.conf* in your ReaR recovery system
(after it boots from USB) looks exactly same as you posted in issue
template?

So, I've created rear backup (`rear mkbackup`) with config as follows:

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=ISO

    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/rear
    OUTPUT_URL=nfs://backup.virtual.sk/mnt/rear/iso

Then

-   I've booted ISO
-   manually mounted /mnt/rear
-   run `rear recover` which outputted to log

After this system booted just fine ...

I'll do one more test where I create ReaR rescue system on USB ...

I created the USB with the following configuration:

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_UEFI_PART_SIZE=400

When booting from this stick and running `rear recover` I get above
posted issue with the weird folder name.

I did some testing too. I booted with the USB stick. Then I changed the
`/etc/rear/local.conf` to:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_TYPE=incremental
    GRUB_RESCUE=1
    BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/backupstorage0/rear-backups

I had to mount the backupstorage to some `/mnt/tmp` and then execute
`ln -s /mnt/tmp/rear-backups/Cloudsdale/backup.tar.gz /mnt/backupstorage0/rear-backups/rear/Cloudsdale/20171207.2150/backup.tar.gz`

After that I can execute `rear recover` but it says that it can't
recover the system layout on `/dev/sdf`. I have no idea now what I
should do. `/dev/sdf1` is my backupstorage0, which should be the only
thing that DOESN'T get recreated on recovery. I get a selection from 1-6
and I selected \[6-Abort Relax-and-Recover\]. I fear for my backup
archive to get corrupted.

Okay, my backup drive is now corrupted thanks to the whole process.
Seems like I have to setup the server again, sigh.

I don't get why ReaR tries to recover the backup drive itself. Did I
forget to set a specific "exclude this-and-this folder" option in the
local.config or is there something else I missed?

I'm sorry to hear that :-(, I'm afraid that you've become victim of
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)
.  
I don't know how far ReaR went when formatting your USB, but you can try
[ddrescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/) to recover you backup
...

I will try to extract all the configuration with ddrescue but it is not
such a big deal since I have all my important data somewhere else and I
wanted to migrate to something like FreeNAS anyway. It's just time
consuming to setup a new OS.

Thanks anyway for your support and I hope I never have to run
`rear recover` ever again.

Well, what I learn from this: Make a backup of the backup and disconnect
it on a restore process. It's good that I have copied all important data
to a separate disk before. Only some configuration files etc. are gone
now which is not a crisis. I will certainly look into that suse article
you posted @jsmeix, thanks.

@AmonBune The lesson that should be learned is "*test on sandbox systems
which are not important when something goes wrong*" and even more
important "**test, test and test it again**" before going to production.

@gdha Good point, I actually did test it in the beginning and I also
recovered successfully a few times but since the ReaR installation on
the backup disk gave itself the final shot, emergency measurements had
to be found. And they failed. Or I failed. Anyway, I have a new system
now, so everything's fine... for now...

Some final notes:

Since ReaR 2.3 we have an improved autodetection during 'rear recover'  
when disks on the replacement hardware seem to not match  
compared to what there was on the original system so that ReaR is now  
more fail-safe against recreating on a possibly wrong disk, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1271)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1593)

But that alone is not yet fully sufficient because there is still  
a generic problem when a ReaR recovery disk is used, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1854)
