Hello @rear/contributors  
`/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/270_fc_transport_info.sh` collects a
**recovery/fc\_transport.info** file based on content of
`/sys/class/fc_transport`.

Do you know why this is needed? Is that useful to the system
administrator upon recovery?

@rmetrich  
my preferred first step of forensics that I usually do  
(e.g. when there are no explanatory comments in the code)  
is

    git log -p --follow usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/270_fc_transport_info.sh 

which shows that it was made by @gdha via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f593fa8a33d6638d9fd2b4fcdd175805203edc4a](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f593fa8a33d6638d9fd2b4fcdd175805203edc4a)

But there is also no further info in that commit  
so that I "just assign" your question directly to @gdha ;-)

Didn't want to fingerpoint him :-)

It has been a privilege and a pleasure for me to do you a favour :-)

@rmetrich @jsmeix If you find it un-useful be my guest to remove it.

Asking because we have a customer having issues with the
`find /sys/class/fc_transport` command taking several hours!

Oh boy - the info is not worth waiting for - we can live without it...

Perhaps we should also ask @schabrolles about his opinion  
because I think he has a lot experience with SAN storage?

@schabrolles did you ever used the output produces by scrip
`/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/270_fc_transport_info.sh`? If not, any
objections we remove it?

Script will return immediately - so this issue can be closed

Because since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d642fa1c9c26361f130d3f18e40dc425efe6e2f0](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/d642fa1c9c26361f130d3f18e40dc425efe6e2f0)  
we still have rescue/GNU/Linux/270\_fc\_transport\_info.sh  
which is now basically dead code  
I like to re-open this issue and assign it to  
@schabrolles  
so that he can check if rescue/GNU/Linux/270\_fc\_transport\_info.sh  
could be completely removed.

I don't remember having to use this script or the file generated by it
`$VAR_DIR/recovery/fc_transport.info`  
I don't see any other script from git that would need it either...
