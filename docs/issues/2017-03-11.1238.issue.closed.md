-   rear version : 2.00 git
-   OS version (lsb\_release -a):  
    LSB Version: 1.4  
    Distributor ID: Arch  
    Description: Arch Linux  
    Release: rolling  
    Codename: n/a
-   UEFI boot
-   Brief description of the issue: No execution of
    230\_run\_efibootmgr.sh upon `rear mkrescue` for GNU/Linux.

What could be the reason(s) to **not** move `230_run_efibootmgr.sh` from
folder `Linux-i386` to folder `default`?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reasons to do move this run\_efibootmgr script:

-   This script itself starts with a
    `is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER || return` check.
-   There might not be UEFI support on the PPC platform, but there are a
    lot more environments with UEFI boot then just `Linux-i386`.

@ProBackup-nl  
in general see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1214\#issuecomment-286056772](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1214#issuecomment-286056772)

<pre>
Caution with moving a script to 'default' because then
this script is sourced in any case.
I would recommend to better set one of those zillions
of variables right for Arch Linux so that
finalize/Linux-i386/230_run_efibootmgr.sh
gets sourced.

How to set those variables right for Arch Linux see
the SetOSVendorAndVersion function in
lib/config-functions.sh
</pre>

Regarding other environments with UEFI boot than Linux-i386:

I am not at all a UEFI boot expert but I assume that the  
current scripts only work for 'Linux-i386' like environments.  
I assume that UEFI scripts for other environments  
are not like 'Linux-i386' so that then UEFI scripts for  
other environments should be in separated directories  
that match the other environments.

@gozora @gdha  
what is your opinion here?

There is little/no purpose for moving a finalize script, to make it run
in the `mkrescue` process because the *finalize* phase is intended for
the `recover` instead of `mkrescue` process.
