-   How was this pull request tested?

Before:

    # time usr/sbin/rear help
    ...
    Use 'rear -v help' for more advanced commands.
    [here nothing happens for 3 seconds]

    real    0m3.690s
    user    0m0.629s
    sys     0m0.254s

With the change of this pull request:

    # time usr/sbin/rear help
    ...
    Use 'rear -v help' for more advanced commands.

    real    0m0.686s
    user    0m0.644s
    sys     0m0.234s

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In the DoExitTasks function skip 'sleep 3'  
when all went well and DoExitTasks is called at normal exit  
to avoid needless 3 seconds delay of normal end of program.
