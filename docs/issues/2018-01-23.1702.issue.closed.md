As @jsmeix correctly pointed out in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1698\#issuecomment-359745613](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1698#issuecomment-359745613)

When looking at the code in  
restore/BORG/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
I noticed that it errors out when the Borg backup restore  
finished with a non-zero exit code.  
I think this might be too hard here.

Reasoning:

I think during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" it is good  
to be strict and error out in case of failures because  
when "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" errors out the user  
can fix the reason in his original system until  
"rear mkrescue/mkbackup" runs cleanly.

In contrast during "rear recover" I think it could be often better  
to continue even if something finished with a non-zero exit code  
because when "rear recover" errors out it is basically a dead end  
for the user.

For example when "rear recover" errors out when Borg backup restore  
finished with a non-zero exit code there might be nothing what the  
user could do to fix the reason in the recovery system (except  
changing the code in restore/BORG/default/400\_restore\_backup.sh  
to no longer error out). Perhaps there was only a minor issue why  
Borg backup restore finished with a non-zero exit code  
that could be also fixed later in the recreated system?

Accordingly I think it could be often better when during "rear
recover"  
something finished with a non-zero exit code to show a user dialog  
via the UserInput function where the user can decide whether or not  
he wants to continue regardless of that particular failure so that  
the user has a better chance to get at least a somewhat usable  
recreated system (in contrast to get no recreated system at all).
