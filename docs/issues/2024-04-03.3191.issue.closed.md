This is related to the changes in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3157](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3157)

On my openSUSE Leap 15.5 x86\_64 UEFI system  
with current GitHub master code with  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3db2724c7860e38fad96ba4d35c8b174616c1496](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/3db2724c7860e38fad96ba4d35c8b174616c1496)  
that makes "rear mkrescue" fail with

    ++ test
    ++ LogPrintError 'grub2-mkstandalone may fail to make a bootable EFI image of GRUB2 (no /usr/*/grub*/i386-efi/moddep.lst file)'
    ...
    ++ grub2-mkstandalone -v '--modules=cryptodisk ext2 fat gcry_rijndael gcry_sha256 luks part_gpt part_msdos' -O i386-efi -o /var/tmp/rear.t0eFjv7bA3CjENy/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi /boot/
    grub/grub.cfg=/var/tmp/rear.t0eFjv7bA3CjENy/tmp/mnt/EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg
    grub2-mkstandalone: error: /usr/share/grub2/i386-efi/modinfo.sh doesn't exist. Please specify --target or --directory.

because I have

    # uname -m
    x86_64

    # find /usr -type f | grep 'moddep.lst'
    /usr/share/grub2/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst
    /usr/share/grub2/i386-pc/moddep.lst

    # find /usr -type f | grep 'modinfo.sh'
    /usr/share/grub2/x86_64-efi/modinfo.sh
    /usr/share/grub2/i386-pc/modinfo.sh

so I need `GRUB2_IMAGE_FORMAT=x86_64-efi` in  
usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh

@pcahyna  
for now this is just a quick issue report  
so that it is not forgotten.  
I will have a closer look tomorrow.

At first glance in  
usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/330_set_efi_arch.sh)  
it looks like a typo

       (i686|i586|i386)
            ...
            GRUB2_IMAGE_FORMAT=x86_64-efi
       (x86_64)
            ...
            GRUB2_IMAGE_FORMAT=i386-efi

to set GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT  
to `x86_64...` in case of `i686|i586|i386`  
and to `i386...` in case of `x86_64`.

@pcahyna  
is this a typo or even intentional?

@jsmeix Oops, I must have swapped the two! Really sorry. It is curious
how even a simplest change can break things.

I am confused when looking at  
usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh  
because it sets the GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT variable  
only to `grub-mkstandalone --format` values  
for EFI ('x86\_64-efi' and 'i386-efi')  
regardless that prep/Linux-i386/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh  
is run for EFI and BIOS systems.

So on a BIOS system GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT  
is set to a value for EFI systems  
which is a contradiction.

The prep/Linux-\*/330\_set\_efi\_arch.sh scripts tell \[sic!\]

    # Se the variables even if USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER empty or no explicit 'true' value

so that is intentional but it does not tell why.

As far as I see it works currently only because  
the generic GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT variable  
is only used in case of EFI

    # find usr/sbin/rear usr/share/rear/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'GRUB2_IMAGE_FORMAT'

    usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-i386/330_set_efi_arch.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-arm/330_set_efi_arch.sh
    usr/share/rear/prep/Linux-ia64/330_set_efi_arch.sh
    usr/share/rear/lib/uefi-functions.sh
    usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/270_create_grub2_efi_bootloader.sh

but things will fail if GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT  
will be also used for BIOS systems in the future.

@pcahyna  
could you explain the intent behind why on a BIOS system  
GRUB2\_IMAGE\_FORMAT is set to a value for EFI systems?

This issue does not depend on openSUSE Leap 15.5  
but (probably) happens on all x86\_64 UEFI systems.

The intent of the variable is to hold the image format for EFI GRUB on
the platform, so the variable is simply misnamed. I should have called
it `GRUB2_EFI_IMAGE_FORMAT`.

My bad, I should have indicated why and I don't even recall exactly, but
I believe it has referred to the EFI\_ARCH\* variables and not to
`GRUB2_IMAGE_FORMAT` originally. I think I did not want to audit all
uses of EFI\_ARCH\* whether they are protected by a test of for
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` (we don't want to refer to an undefined variable
and to prevent it the easiest way is to define it always). Actually I
see at least some use of EFI\_ARCH\* that is not conditional on
`USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER`:
usr/share/rear/output/RAWDISK/Linux-i386/{270\_create\_grub2\_efi\_bootloader.sh,260\_create\_syslinux\_efi\_bootloader.sh},
so setting the variable always is the right thing already.

Another variable will have to be introduced then. You may wonder why not
to have just one variable that holds the correct image format for the
given situation, regardless of whether it is UEFI or BIOS. I believe it
is better to keep it separated for the case when we need to handle a
hybrid boot setup. I think we are already creating bootable media with
ESP even on BIOS systems and we may be able to create hybrid boot media
in the future (maybe we are already able to do that in some situations).
We are also already capable of restoring hybrid bootloader setups.
