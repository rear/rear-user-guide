-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

We are taking only system/rootvg backup from source and trying to
restore on another lpar for restoration testing. During the restoration
we are changing IP of the target system after booting from ISO file
created by rear backup of source through HMC and then map the disk only
for system vg.

Since, we have to just restore the system vg/rootvg only, so we have
assigned the same size disk to destination VG and rest disks required
for datavg are not assigned.

To achieve this we have done some configuration in the source system
/etc/rear/local.conf file for excluding the mapping of disk other than
system VG.

While restoring the disk mapping is getting failed and thus results in
restoration failure.

Few more things regarding the environment.  
The systems are same hardware but different lpar on IBM Power server  
Nfs is used for taking backup and restoration of data  
Booting lpar in SMS mode through iso file created by the rear backup of
source system and then assigning different IP  
After assigning new IP, we are using rear -d D restore command  
PFA are files of source configuration, rear local.conf file and rear
backup log; along with the destination steps followed and logs.

-   Workaround, if any:

we need full debug logs i.e. with the `-D` option.

    ...
    2019-12-05 06:55:18.796366577 The disk layout recreation script failed

but I cannot imagine what the actual root cause behind is.

Could it be that you did something in the running ReaR recovery system  
before you started "rear recover" and what you did results that the  
target system storage components logical volume system/root  
and/or dev/mapper/36005076305ffd1f40000000000000001  
are actually in use (e.g. is something perhaps even mounted)?

For example after a previous (possibly failed) run of "rear recover"  
some target system filesystems could be mounted under `/mnt/local`  
so you need to umount whatever is mounted below `/mnt/local`  
before you could re-run "rear recover".

In your ...hmciecchdb02s-target.log I see lots of lines  
about `btrfsmountedsubvol` which indicate you use SLES12  
with its (rather complicated) default btrfs structure  
but I don't see in your etc/rear/local.conf the matching  
entries for the SLES12 default btrfs structure,  
cf. the SLE12\*btrfs example config files in ReaR  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples](https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples)

So when you use SLES12 with its default btrfs structure  
you need first and foremost a matching etc/rear/local.conf  
see also our SLE12-HA documentation Administration Guide  
the section about "Disaster Recovery with Relax-and-Recover (Rear)"  
[https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP4/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html](https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP4/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-rear.html)  
that reads (excerpt)

    Limitations with Btrfs
    ...
    Your SLE12 System Needs Matching Rear Configuration

    The setup in SLE12 GA, SLE12 SP1, and SLE12 SP2
    have several incompatible Btrfs default structures.
    As such, it is crucial to use a matching Rear
    configuration file. See the example files
    /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12*-btrfs-example.conf. 

Provided your etc/rear/local.conf is right for your SLES12 system  
and "rear recover" still fails in your case, we need for further  
analysis full debug logs i.e. with the `-D` option:  
`rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup` and `rear -D recover`  
for the latter cf. "Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

Furthermore (also see that section) we would like to get  
in particular your `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`  
and your `/var/lib/rear/layout/diskrestore.sh` files.

Additionally to get an easier overview about your storage layout  
please provide on your original system the output of the command

    lsblk -ipo NAME,KNAME,PKNAME,TRAN,TYPE,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT

Hi Johannes

Please find the attached

which is still insufficient for SLE12 with btrfs.

For SLE12 SP2 and later with btrfs start with the template in  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf)  
and adapt is as needed to make your specific /etc/rear/local.conf file  
provided you had initially installed your system as SLE12 SP2 or later.

If you had initially installed your system as SLE12 SP1 with btrfs  
you would have to make your specific /etc/rear/local.conf file based
on  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf)

If you had initially installed your system as SLE12 GA (SP0) with
btrfs  
you would have to make your specific /etc/rear/local.conf file based
on  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf)

For the reason behind why different SLE12 service packs need  
different /etc/rear/local.conf files depending on what SLE12 service
pack  
was initially installed (i.e. depending on what SLE12 service pack did
the  
disk layout and btrfs structure setup) see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368\#issuecomment-302410707](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1368#issuecomment-302410707)

Regarding

    Error: Partition(s) 2 on /dev/mapper/36005076305ffd1f40000000000000001
    have been written, but we have been unable to inform the kernel of the change,
    probably because it/they are in use

the reason could be that you use perhaps an already used disk  
where old partitioning and LVM meta-data is still on the disk, cf.  
"Prepare replacement hardware for disaster recovery" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
that reads in particular (excerpt)

    When your replacement storage is not pristine new storage
    (i.e. when it had been ever used before), you must completely
    zero out your replacement storage.
    Otherwise when you try to reinstall your system ... on a disk
    that had been used before, various kind of unexpected
    weird issues could get in your way because of whatever
    kind of remainder data on an already used disk
    (for example remainders of RAID
    or partition-table signatures and other kind of
    "magic strings" like LVM metadata and whatever else).
