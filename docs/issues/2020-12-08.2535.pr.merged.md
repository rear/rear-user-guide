##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#2152

-   How was this pull request tested? Not yet tested - waiting on Bacula
    user to do that for us

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: The
    Enterprise Bacula uses different locations for keeping the
    configuration files than the community version of Bacula, hence, the
    enhancement to detect the correct location via preparation flow.

I noticed many `StopIfError` calls in the code.

I recommend to never use `StopIfError`, see the explanation about  
"Using the ...IfError functions can result unexpected behaviour in
certain cases"  
in usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/\_input-output-functions.sh\#L704](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/_input-output-functions.sh#L704)

Better use

    ERROR_CONDITION && Error "..."

or

    SUCCESS_CONDITION || Error "..."

as needed.

The `...IfError` functions are only there for backward compatibility in
old code.

@jsmeix Thank you for your endless patience and clear view on good
practice of the bash language. I asked the 2 Bacula users for their
advice on the *ping* matter - we will see what comes back...

To my mind using ping is worse than checking if the service is really
accessible. So I'd have listened to @jsmeix

@VN1977  
since IPv6 'ping' has become even worser than worse ;-)  
One must try both IPv4 and IPv6 and guess what it could mean if one
fails :-(

@VN1977 Ok, how can we test if the BACULA\_DIRECTOR is responding if we
don't use ping? I need your advise here.

@gdha  
I think we can use something like this

> nc -vz BACULA\_DIRECTOR 9101 2&gt;&1 | grep -i connected | wc -l

But not every system has netcat installed. You can add it to
dependencies.

I know nothing at all how Bacula works but I think the final testing
in  
prep/BACULA/default/500\_check\_BACULA\_bconsole\_results.sh

    # We want these two lines to show that we can connect to the director
    # and that the director can connect to the file daemon on this system.
    # "Connecting to Director 'director_name-fd:9101'"
    # "Connecting to Client 'bacula_client_name-fd at FQDN:9102"
    BACULA_CLIENT=$(grep $(hostname -s) $BACULA_CONF_DIR/bacula-fd.conf | grep "\-fd" | awk '{print $3}' | sed -e "s/-fd//g")
    [ "${BACULA_CLIENT}" ] || Error "Client $(hostname -s) not defined in $BACULA_CONF_DIR/bacula-fd.conf"

    BACULA_RESULT=( $(echo -e " status client=${BACULA_CLIENT}-fd" | bconsole | grep Connect) )

    director=${BACULA_RESULT[3]}
    client=${BACULA_RESULT[9]}

    [ "$director" ] || Error "Bacula director not reachable."

    [ "$client" ] || Error "Bacula client status unknown on director."

looks as if it tests both the Bacula director (implicitly) and the
Bacula client.  
This was the reason why I was wondering what that 'ping' test is
actually good for  
when also the Bacula director gets implicitly tested by the final
testing.

@jsmeix this is two steps check. Firstly we check if director accesible
at network level then connect to it and look for config of designated
client.  
If step \#1 failed we excplicitily understand what caused it and we
don't need to connect with bconsole.

Where did this get sidetracked about ping testing ?  
The original issue I opened a year and a half ago is about how the
Enterprise Bacula client is in a different location than the open source
client.

Hi,  
we had a huge holiday.... so sorry for the delay.  
I don't really know how to compile the new version to check quickly.
Could you please help?

The script says `bacula-fd` is missing (or it couldn't find it in the
default PATH). Could you verify this? And, while you're busy check also
if `bconsole` responds correctly.

My bacula config files are placed at /opt/bacula/etc so script can not
find them.What concerns bconsole the config file also placed there.I
thought that you made changes to scripts for supporting non-default
config files.--

@VN1977 Yes, of course it is the purpose to test this PR - first
`git clone https://github.com/rear/rear/tree/issue2152-prep-bacula` and
then use this newly branch to test out if the PR would make sense or
not. Therefore, go into this branch and copy your `/etc/rear/local.conf`
to this branch `your_cloned_rear_path/etc/rear/` and also start rear
from within this cloned PR (use relative path to rear script:
`your_cloned_rear_path/usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue`
