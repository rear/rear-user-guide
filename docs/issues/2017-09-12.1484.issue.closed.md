The current \_input-output-functions.sh is a mix-up of  
function definitions plus initialization code like  
exit tasks setup and preparation for redirections.

The initialization code should be moved  
into a proper 'init' stage, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1251](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1251)

The function definitions are a mix-up of  
plain message output functions and user input functions  
plus exit task functions and error/bug abort functions.

The exit task functions and error/bug abort functions  
should be moved into separated ...-functions.sh scripts.

The plain message output functions are very many  
(probably too many) for various very specific kind  
of message output each one with or without logging.

The plain message output functions should be simplified  
into only a few ones usually always with logging because  
usually there should be the full information in the log file, cf.

(an exception could be output of secrets like passwords  
or things like that).

I won't do that.  
I have no time for cleanup without an actual benefit for the user.  
I might do it when the current mess actually hurts us, cf.
