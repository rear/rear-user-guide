### ReaR version

2.6

### Describe the ReaR bug in detail

/dev/sda is my 8 GB USB stick, formatted as FAT32:

    lsblk:
    sda                   8:0    1   7,3G  0 disk 
    └─sda1                8:1    1   7,3G  0 part 
    nvme0n1             259:0    0   1,8T  0 disk 
    └─nvme0n1p1         259:1    0   1,8T  0 part 
      ├─mint--vg-root   253:0    0   1,8T  0 lvm  /
      └─mint--vg-swap_1 253:1    0  15,9G  0 lvm  [SWAP]

ReaR local.conf contains:  
OUTPUT=USB  
USB\_DEVICE=/dev/sda1 (also tried with /dev/sda)

rear -D mkrescue throws:

Dear gdha,  
I noticed that I did not comment following lines in my local.conf:

ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN="/usr/bin/mkisofs"  
ISO\_NAME="rear-rescue"  
ISO\_ISOLINUX=auto  
ISO\_DIR="/mnt/NAS/ReaR/iso"

The errors in my earlier message may therefore not be relevant.

I did a new start, omitting the ISO stuff:

I must be possible to backup to a NFS share on my NAS and create a
bootable USB stick which then can do a restore from the NAS. The
information in <https://relax-and-recover.org/usage/#recovery_from_usb>
suggests this line:
**BACKUP\_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"**.  
However, I can hardly backup 2 TB to a 8GB USB stick, the idea is to
save to the NAS.

Thanks for your help!  
Best regards  
Frank

@nomiSFI in your local.conf file remove all STATIC\_\* lines are these
will *not* be used by ReaR!  
Use the following example instead:

    NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 192.168.100.2/24 dev eth0' 'ip link set dev eth0 up' 'ip route add default via 192.168.100.1' 'return' )

Furthermore, the line `USB_DEVICE=/dev/sda` is *not* correct as it
should be `USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000` if you formatted the
USB device via `rear format /dev/sda`

@nomiSFI  
regarding "backup 2 TB":

Don't do that with ReaR.

Regarding ReaR versus "big data" backup see my  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3451#issuecomment-2841051182>  
which is in general about

    separating disaster recovery of the basic operating system
    from restore of the big data

So I recommend to use OUTPUT=USB with a (removable) disk  
for ReaR and its backup of only the basic operating system  
and save your "big data" to your NAS in a separated  
procedure which is independent of ReaR.

Of course you are free to do a "backup 2 TB" with  
ReaR and OUTPUT=USB on a sufficiently big (removable)  
external disk that is connected e.g. via fast USB3  
which could be even faster than NAS network access  
(depending on your USB and network hardware).

In general you may also have a look at the section  
"Relax-and-Recover versus backup and restore"  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#Relax-and-Recover_versus_backup_and_restore>

Dear Johannes,  
thanks for your reply!  
I still cannot restore from my rear formatted 250GB SSD 850 EVO USB
drive :-(  
Here's my local.conf:

    OUTPUT=USB
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.100.5/mnt/DataStore/Backups

And here the error after a successful boot:  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eedeb841-66a3-4def-8042-b3df73efe1b5)

What needs to be done to get the neccessary files into the

@nomiSFI  
your `COPY_AS_IS=( ... )` kills it all.  
See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
for ReaR 2.6 online starting at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1340>  
how to correctly add things to arrays like COPY\_AS\_IS  
which are predefined in default.conf as

    COPY_AS_IS=( $SHARE_DIR $VAR_DIR )

Your `COPY_AS_IS=( ... )` overwrites that with only your values  
so you get in your ReaR recovery system only what you specified  
via your `COPY_AS_IS=( ... )` without all the ReaR stuff  
in ReaR's $SHARE\_DIR and $VAR\_DIR.  
I.e. in your local.conf use

    COPY_AS_IS+=( your additional things )

Same for BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE.  
When you like to specify additional things to exclude use

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( your additional things )

When you want to overwrite ReaR automtisms for BACKUP\_PROG\_EXCLUDE  
and only want to exclude what you explicity specified then use

    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( only your things )

By the way:  
I wonder what that line

    Boudreaux.old': Device or resource busy

is in your local.conf in your  
<https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3470#issuecomment-2897579989>  
Is that line perhaps a copy&paste typo  
or does that line really exist in your local.conf?

Now I am able to boot the recovery media without a problem.  
However, when trying to recover my system I could nor do so, due to a
missing boot loader:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fb2742b-46f4-4e30-b2f6-4dfdf3d29157)

I have: grub-install (GRUB) 2.06-2ubuntu7.2, Legacy BIOS boot and boot
disk layout:

    nvme0n1
    │                                                                             
    └─nvme0n1p1
         LVM2_m LVM2        aQsufx-QP1n-fPdy-lmNE-TlmD-TbCS-Frw8GS                
      ├─mint--vg-root
      │  ext4   1.0         43203ead-891a-4fc7-9d19-5138c6ce5537    893,5G    47% /
      └─mint--vg-swap_1
         swap   1           7eecfb22-1cfe-4a7b-8e5f-d0b31912a8e2                  [SWAP]

I am trying to convert the information in
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh to my
local.conf (below) but seem not to be able to do so.

    OUTPUT=USB
    OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    USB_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://192.168.100.5/mnt/DataStore/Backups
    USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=yes
    KERNEL_CMDLINE="modprobe.blacklist=nvidia,nvidia_uvm,nvidia_modeset,nvidia_drm nomodeset vga=normal"
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_OPTIONS=( -I "zstd -3 -c" )
    BACKUP_PROG_COMPRESS_SUFFIX=".zst"
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/tmp/*' '/dev/shm/*' '/home/*' '/media/*' '/mnt/*' '/usr/ollama/*' '/opt/iventoy/*' '*.iso' "$VAR_DIR/output/*" )

Once agian, thanks much. Your help is really appreciated!

Bes regards  
Frank

@nomiSFI  
when

    chroot /mnt/local bash --login

fails after "rear recover", things don't look good  
because at /mnt/local the recreated system is mounted  
where in particular your backup should have been restored  
so there should be a binary 'bash' below /mnt/local  
normally this would be /mnt/local/bin/bash

PATH does matter:  
For ReaR 2.6 inside the ReaR recovery system

    PATH=/bin

<https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/profile#L6>  
so inside the recreated system the binary 'bash'  
must be /bin/bash so that it can be found by

    chroot /mnt/local bash --login

i.e. from inside a ReaR 2.6 recovery system  
the 'bash' must be /mnt/local/bin/bash

So you should first and foremost verify that

-   your backup is sufficiently complete (contains all needed files)
-   your backup was properly restored during "rear recover"
-   you have a /mnt/local/bin/bash after "rear recover"

Regarding the bootloader installation:  
What did "rear recover" show you about the bootloader installation  
in the recreated system?  
During "rear recover" the bootloader installation happens  
after the backup was restored.

@nomiSFI

is there a special reason why you use a rather old ReaR version?  
ReaR 2.6 is from June 2020 i.e. almost 5 years old.  
Our current release is version 2.9 (from January 2025).

FYI some generic boilerplate info:

In general I recommend to try out our latest GitHub master code  
because the GitHub master code is the only place where we (i.e.  
the ReaR upstream authors and maintainers) can fix things and  
if there are issues it helps when you use exactly the code  
where we could fix things.

See the "QUICK START GUIDE" and "INSTALLATION" parts on  
<https://github.com/rear/rear>

Additionally / alternatively see the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery>  
how you can try out our current ReaR GitHub master code  
without conflicts with your already installed ReaR version.

In general we at ReaR upstream do not support older ReaR versions.  
We at ReaR upstream do not plain reject issues with older ReaR
versions  
(e.g. we may answer easy to solve questions also for older ReaR
versions)  
but we do not spend much time on issues with older ReaR versions
because  
we do not (and cannot) fix issues in released ReaR versions.  
Issues in released ReaR versions are not fixed by us (by ReaR
upstream).  
Issues in released ReaR versions that got fixed in current ReaR
upstream  
GitHub master code might be fixed (if the fix can be backported with  
reasonable effort) by the Linux distributor wherefrom you got ReaR.

In particular regarding Ubuntu / Debian  
and Linux distributions which are based on them:

I am neither a Ubuntu user nor a Debian user nor a Linux Mint user.  
Currently we at ReaR upstream do not have an active  
maintainer for Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint.  
So ReaR support for Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint  
can be only as good as voluntary contributors  
who use those Linux distributions contribute  
which is much appreciated!

In particular regarding Ubuntu:  
It seems Canonical is not sufficiently interested in ReaR  
in contrast to Red Hat and SUSE who pay developers  
(like me from SUSE and e.g. @pcahyna and @lzaoral from Red Hat)  
to contribute to upstream ReaR because Red Hat and SUSE  
support ReaR in their enterprise Linux distributions.
