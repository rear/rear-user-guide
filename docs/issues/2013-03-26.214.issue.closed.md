Cannot create a bootable UEFI ISO image on openSUSE 12.3 (and previous
versions I guess) due to the fact that the -efi-boot option is missing
in genisoimage executable.  
Logged a bugzilla request at openSUSE:

    genisoimage is unmaintained, use mkisofs and check the -eltorito-platform option

The `mkisofs` (version 2.01, or genisoimage 1.1.11) command part of the
cdrkit-cdrtools-compat-1.1.11-10.1.1.x86\_64 (OpenSuse) RPM is not EFI
aware. Too bad.

What the author suggests is to replace it with his sources (and
recompile it), and use syntax like:

    mkisofs -o "efi.iso" \
      -R -J -A "comment" \
      -hide-rr-moved \
      -v -d -N \
      -eltorito-catalog "[BOOT]/boot.catalog" \
      -eltorito-platform x86 -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
      -eltorito-boot "isolinux/isolinux.bin" \
      -eltorito-alt-boot -eltorito-platform efi -no-emul-boot  \
      -eltorito-boot "$ESPIMG"
      ...

Not gonna do that as we cannot force the end-users to do such actions -
we will mark it in our release notes as not (yet) supported on OpenSuse
12.x

Can't we fall back to xorriso as an alternative ? Not sure what the
state of EFI support is in xorriso, but xorriso for years has seen very
active development.

From the bugzilla report (see above):

--- Comment \#13 from Jörg Schiling
<joerg.schilling@fokus.fraunhofer.de> 2014-02-04 15:55:33 UTC ---  
Just a note:

-eltorito-platform is not compatible to the patch avilable from RedHat  
for an outdated mkisofs version that is distributed  
under the name "genisoimage". It is howerver  
compatible to the rest of mkisofs previous concepts.

As far as I understand, the RedHat option modified the main Eltorito
entry  
and is used instead of the normal boot option, but this is in conflict  
with the Eltorito boot concept.

The option -eltorito-platform allows to start a new entry in a
Eltorito  
multi boot environment, making this entry of type "efi". The option  
-eltorito-platform takes no parameter. After you specify it, you
continue  
with the standard Eltorito boot options.

The shell script mentioned in this bug calls "mkisofs" under this name  
but expects behavior that is only available from a patched
genisoimage.  
To fix the problem, you need to do more than just to replace option
names.

@gdha  
I tried using rear on an IBM server x3650M4 with UEFI runnig SLES11SP3
and elilo as bootloader. But it failed creating the boot ISO.  
To me it looks like I ran into issue \#214. What option do I have to get
rear running?  
I assume PXE boot and USB is possible. ISO doesn't work with SLES
version of genisoimage/mkisofs. Am I right?  
I still would like to use the ISO options. You mentioned compiling
mkisofs with your sources could solve the problem. Is possible to get
them? Or is it possible to use the Fedora/Ubuntu binary on
SLES/OpenSUSE?  
Kind regards, Otmar

@omeier You could download the latest sources from Jörg Schiling and use
his mkisofs executable. Copy it over from another distro will probably
not work.  
Of course, you can still use OUTPUT=USB (or PXE) instead of OUTPUT=ISO
which does not require mkisofs. However, I never tested PXE or USB with
an UEFI capable system. You can test it out and you know it soon
enough...

Thank you once again for your quick response. Soon time will come for
some tests ;)

SLES12 contains
`SLES12-12-0 | genisoimage    | 1.1.11-19.12     | x86_64` and `mkisofs`
does not have the `-eltorito-platform` option on-board.  
BTW, bug report
[https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=811636](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=811636)
has been closed as the upstream `mkisofs` project of J. Schilling
supports UEFI with the `-eltorito-platform` option.

Hi,

I face the same on SLES11SP3

    # rpm -qf $(which mkisofs)
    cdrkit-cdrtools-compat-1.1.8-3.32.3
    # rpm -qf $(which genisoimage)
    genisoimage-1.1.8-3.32.3
    # ll /usr/bin/genisoimage /usr/bin/mkisofs
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 597048 Feb  4  2012 /usr/bin/genisoimage
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     11 May 26 14:53 /usr/bin/mkisofs -> genisoimage

Do I understand this correctly, the only solution would be to replace
the SLES shipped mkisofs by the upstream mkisofs from J. Schilling to
make this work? Or would there be some other workaround to recover the
UEFI booting machine possible?

@pavoldomin I'm afraid so. I understood that `genisoimage` is becoming
obsolete, or at least un-maintained... I would be much easier if
`mkisofs` would be a separate package, not?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576908?v=4" width="50">[pavoldomin](https://github.com/pavoldomin) commented at [2014-11-20 09:35](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/214#issuecomment-63782319):

Let me report about our tests here: we tried the approach described
above (compiled mkisofs from J. Schilling). We were able to create
rescue ISO now, with the following change in
`output/ISO/Linux-i386/82_create_iso_image.sh` (I used Johannes Meixner
ReaR fork with SuSE btrfs support, as mentioned in \#497 ):

     #EFIBOOT="-eltorito-alt-boot -e boot/efiboot.img -no-emul-boot"
     EFIBOOT="-eltorito-platform efi -eltorito-boot boot/efiboot.img -no-emul-boot"

However I was not able to boot that ISO in UEFI mode anyway.
Non-the-less, with the little manual work, we recovered system easily:

1.  one-time booted ISO in BIOS mode
2.  rear recover
3.  manually loaded UEFI in chroot (elilo is used on our system)
4.  rebooted system now from EFI (manually from EFI shell)
5.  restored the bootloader with yast (or efibootmgr).

My question is: would it possible to disable ReaR UEFI code in mkrescue
in terms of config file (such that `USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER` is not set)?
I do not want to use upstream mkisofs, as it does not seem to work
anyway. But without it I cannot create ISO at all, when I'm booted in
EFI mode. Aim is to do all ReaR recovery in BIOS mode and switch back to
EFI from the recovered system itself.

not (yet) supported.

@pavoldomin To come back to your test with a self-compiled mkisofs (EFI
compliant) which did not work. This was not the fault of the mkisofs
executable, but it was due to script
/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/25\_populate\_efibootimg.sh which
relies on *grub2-efi* package and SLES is using *elilo*. Perhaps, being
positive if mkisofs becomes EFI compliant on SuSe then we better split
the populate script up in two (grub-efi and elilo).

@pavoldomin Just inspected the openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86\_64.iso EFI content
- it seems SuSe is using `prefix=($root)/boot/x86_64/grub2-efi` to boot
an ISO image. `elilo` is just used to boot the HD.  
ok, then the `grub2-efi` package becomes mandatory on SuSe architecture
as well. Good to know. Suddenly, it becomes clear and easier to fix. A
patched `mkisofs` would be nice if SuSe could deliver this a standard
package instead of `genisoimage` (or give us the option to install
this). It seems to be available in Opensuse-Factory 13.2

Indeed, so with the recent **ReaR** and *mkisofs* from J. Schilling we
should be able to recover UEFI booting (and btrfs-based) SLES12 systems.
We will definitely test this in some not so distant future. Our current
approach is temporary legacy bios boot of the recovery image, or - when
possible - just disable UEFI completely

I've tried to make UEFI ISO on openSuse 13.2 with the rear from the
Archiving repository
([http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/openSUSE\_13.2/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/openSUSE_13.2/)
- reported version of rear is 1.17.1???) with the patch as stated by
@pavoldomin on output/ISO/Linux-i386/82\_create\_iso\_image.sh file.

I could create an ISO, but it can't be booted from (grub rescue console
appears and I couldn't do anything with it - unknown filesystem on (cd0)
=&gt; insmod iso9660 doesn't work as the most of the grub2 commands).

@kostgr If you have a support contract with SLES - why don't you request
a solution? It takes much too long and they do not listen to me...

@gdha Unfortunately I have no support contact with SLES - only login for
openSuse. And the issue seems to be related to the grub installation on
the disk image. I'm not so experienced with grub to check, whether it is
the grub installatoin or iso image issue.
