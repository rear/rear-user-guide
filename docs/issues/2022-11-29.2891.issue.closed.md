-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I am attempting to create a backup recovery image of a RedHat (RHEL)
machine.  
I am attempting to create a Relax and Recovery (ReaR) image to restore
the machine.  
I would like to fully automate the restoration process as much as
possible  
by simply booting from REAR rescue image with little user
intervention.  
After creating an image, we attempted to manually add the "unattended"
parameter  
in the kernel while booting the system from REAR rescue image.  
This works but does not fully automate (e.g., no manual typing is
required to recover the image) the restoration process.

In the kernel:

    grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="unattended"
    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

Does anyone know if this can be done?  
Ideally, we are looking for consultation as soon as possible.  
Thank you.

-   Workaround, if any: none

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files): none

For me this (`unattended`) works. What is the thing that does not get
automated this way?

Note that prompts that require manual input time out and select the
default option if you ignore them long enough. You can shorten the
timeout by setting the `USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT` variable. There are also
`USER_INPUT_`*user\_input\_ID* variables for fine-grained
customizations. See the description of the variables in
/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf .

We have to manually enter the kernel command line to enter the
unattended option. Is it possible to update the grub menu/boot sequence
with this unattended option.

To clarify, we attempted to update the grub menu with the following
options, but it did not work:  
grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="unattended"  
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

I have not tried to use the USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT variable.

the /etc/rear/local.conf is set with the following settings:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso:///BACKUP/
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4400
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=("${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/media' '/var/tmp' '/var/crash' '/RHEL_8.6' '/mnt')

@keredf  
see KERNEL\_CMDLINE in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf  
e.g. for ReaR 2.6 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L81](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L81)  
and see "RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"  
in "man rear" e.g. for ReaR 2.6 online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
so something like

    KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" unattended"

in /etc/rear/local.conf should do it.

setting KERNEL\_CMDLINE="unattended" & USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT=1 in
/etc/rear/local.conf did work.

Is it possible to remove options we from the grub menu? Is it possible
to set decrease the time out in the grub menu from 5s to 1s/0s?

In Grub menu, options are:  
Relax-and-Recover (no Secure Boot)  
Relax-and-Recover (Secure Boot)  
Boot original system  
Reboot

Also, after the "‘rear recover’ finished successfully" line, the machine
waits 30 seconds before rebooting. Is it possible to decrease the time
to 1s/0s?

Thank you so much!

The 30 seconds waiting  
after "‘rear recover’ finished successfully"  
is hardcoded in  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup

    if unattended_recovery ; then
        choices=( "View Relax-and-Recover log file(s)"
                  "Go to Relax-and-Recover shell"
                )
        echo -e "\nLaunching 'rear recover' automatically in unattended mode\n"
        # The recover workflow is always verbose (see usr/sbin/rear):
        if rear $rear_debug_options recover ; then
            echo -e "\n'rear recover' finished successfully\n"
            echo -e "\nRebooting in 30 seconds (Ctrl-C to interrupt)\n"
            sleep 30
            reboot

so you have to change that script as you need it.

@keredf  
I cannot imagine how you boot your ReaR recovery system  
(i.e. what the bootloader setup of your ReaR recovery system is).

The string "Boot original system" only appears in  
usr/share/rear/output/default/940\_grub2\_rescue.sh  
but this is only run when `GRUB_RESCUE` is explicitly  
set to a true value which you don't have  
according to your /etc/rear/local.conf in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2891\#issuecomment-1332028592](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2891#issuecomment-1332028592)

As far as I know normally  
with `OUTPUT=ISO` and BIOS  
SYSLINUX is used as bootloader for the ReaR recovery system  
via the make\_syslinux\_config function call in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/300\_create\_isolinux.sh)  
and  
with `OUTPUT=ISO` and UEFI  
GRUB2 is used as bootloader for the ReaR recovery system  
via the create\_grub2\_cfg function call in  
usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/250\_populate\_efibootimg.sh

Our ReaR recovery system bootloader setup  
are long grown rather complicated pieces of code  
that behave different depending on what there is  
on the original system.

As far as I see on first glance the  
ReaR recovery system bootloader timeout values  
are hardcoded at the various places of our  
ReaR recovery system bootloader setup code.

@jsmeix  
I was able to set sleep to 0 in
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup. That worked great.

It is strange that I am seeing the "Boot original system" option in the
Grub menu.

There is another timeout I would like to decrease. During the recovery
process, there is another 30 second timeout:  
"Disk Configuration looks identical  
Proceed with ‘recover’ (yes) otherwise manual disk layout configuration
is enforced  
(Default ‘yes’ timeout 30 seconds)"

I looked for this string in some of the files/scripts but I can't find
it. Do you know which file I can change this timeout?

I really appreciate your help! Thank you.

@keredf  
that it is strange for you seeing "Boot original system" in the Grub
menu  
helped me to see why you see it but I couldn't find it in the code.  
I had searched the current master code (basically the ReaR 2.7 code)  
where I myself had changed

    - menuentry "Boot original system" {
    + menuentry "Boot next EFI" --id=chainloader {

in the create\_grub2\_cfg function in lib/bootloader-functions.sh via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/25f86d4f9cb320db637e65550830cb19a7fd2b02](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/25f86d4f9cb320db637e65550830cb19a7fd2b02)  
and
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662)  
which contains in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662\#issuecomment-888470901](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2662#issuecomment-888470901)  
so in ReaR 2.7 we have a new config variable GRUB2\_TIMEOUT  
that should (hopefully) do what you need.

For a test you can try out ReaR 2.7  
or our current ReaR upstream GitHub master code  
without conflicts with your normally installed ReaR version.  
See the section  
"Testing current ReaR upstream GitHub master code" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
A 'git clone' of our upstream GitHub master code repository  
contains all our released ReaR versions as commits  
so you can 'git checkout' all released ReaR versions  
e.g.:

    ReaR 2.7 release

    ReaR 2.6 release

The code for "Disk configuration looks identical" is in  
usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh  
online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250\_compare\_disks.sh\#L135](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/250_compare_disks.sh#L135)

So either you change the default `local timeout=30` in that code  
or you specify the USER\_INPUT\_TIMEOUT variable  
which you already set to `1` according to your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2891\#issuecomment-1332801879](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2891#issuecomment-1332801879)

Currently I cannot explain why you get 30 seconds timeout regardless of

    test "$timeout" -gt "$USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT" && timeout="$USER_INPUT_TIMEOUT"

in the code.

Alternatively specify an automated input for the UserInput() call  
with its matching user\_input\_ID value
DISK\_LAYOUT\_PROCEED\_RECOVERY  
so in this case you may specify in your etc/rear/local.conf

    USER_INPUT_DISK_LAYOUT_PROCEED_RECOVERY="yes"

see the section  
"Relax-and-Recover UserInput function default behaviour"  
in default.conf e.g. online for ReaR 2.6 in particular at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L280](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.6/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L280)
