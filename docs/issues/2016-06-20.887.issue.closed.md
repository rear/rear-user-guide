-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V): 1.18
-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a): n/a
-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf): n/a
-   Brief description of the issue: issue \#874 (2&gt;&8 or &gt;&8
    usage)
-   Work-around, if any:

We are not using the progress-bar code for years anymore (the `>&8`
redirection), so the question was asked, why not get rid of it and
capture the code in the logging (or not)?

I could do it together with

Only FYI regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/874\#issuecomment-227135652](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/874#issuecomment-227135652)
(excerpt):

<pre>
The progress bar mechanism would swallow all data.
</pre>

I assume that with a "tee" method as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885\#issuecomment-226787322](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885#issuecomment-226787322)  
it is in general possible to avoid to "swallow all" messages.

With such a "tee" method it should be in general possible  
to have all messages at various places at the same time,  
e.g. on the terminal puls in the log plus for a progres bar.

I need to fix all the old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8'  
as precondition for

This is no longer a precondition  
for
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/885)  
but can be done any time later as needed,  
for for an explanation why see

Actually with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1391)
merged  
this specific issue here is fixed because via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4f4efb37db4c4ee7d1b05f247101c1680e1f8c31](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/4f4efb37db4c4ee7d1b05f247101c1680e1f8c31)  
I replaced all old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8' with '&gt;/dev/null'  
so that there is no longer any old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8'.

Regarding how to fix the old deprecated usage of '&gt;&8' properly  
I submitted the general issue
