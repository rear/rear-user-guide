-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

-   REAR does create the bootable usb but appears to have most of all
    required info but on the USB for same laptop, the usb does not show
    up in the bootable devices listed. after multiple attempts and even
    creating ISO's, balenaEtcher stated the the ISO does not have the
    partition information. So while I am trying to write directly to the
    USB, what is missing that it is not a bootable USB when used on the
    same laptop.

-   I was required by REAR to format the USB with sudo rear format --
    --efi /dev/sda

-   I was required by rear to make sure that bareos-dir was running

-   I was required to create a XPS15 named fileset in bareos
    configuration (bareos was installed as the default setup with no
    modification)

-   This is a dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04 system

-   have tried on both scandisk (32 GB) and pny (64GB) USBs

-   Workaround, if any:

-   none found

I found some issues but still not showing up on XPS15 9550 boot menu.  
First, I uninstalled the rear (was installed by apt install rear)  
I then followed website instruction for git clone and followon
instructions  
Still had to format usb with -- --efi  
the software created a usb on /dev/sdg  
I can boot this usb on a Dell XPS15 9500 computer (it shows up as an efi
drive)  
But the Dell XPS15 9550 (older computer) using latest bios 1.14.0 still
the USB does not show up on the boot screen.  
BIOS is set for not secure booting with ACHI. (although I have tried
secure boot as well)  
the 9550 sees live upbuntu usb just fine. so very confused on this
problem.

Any suggestion on how to get the USB to show up on my XPS15-9550?

Update  
I can now discover the USB on the xps15-9550. I had to delete all
predefined options for booting in the bios menu and it then discovered
the scandisk usb. I then restored the options I had deleted. the
scandisk was still showing on rebooting.  
Now when booting to the scandisk with the rear info, it starts by
loading ramdisk but the second line says cannot allocate initrd.  
Any Ideas on what I should do to fix that problem.  
TIA

final problem was that I needed the better compression level offered by
"REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION=lzma".  
The only test left is to actually do rear recover.
