-   How was this pull request tested?

Right now only a preliminary proposal  
that is not yet at all tested by me.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

In prep/default/400\_save\_directories.sh  
also exclude mountpoints that are below mountpoints of "type autofs".  
Such mountpoints are below an ancestor mountpoint that is owned/created
by the automounter.  
It is possible to create a sub-mountpoint below an automounted
mountpoint  
but the fact that the sub-mountpoint is not local means it should be
excluded  
(i.e. there is no need to recreate the non-local sub-mountpoint
directory).  
Furthermore automounted NFS filesystems can cause this script to hang up
if NFS server fails  
because the below 'stat' command may then wait indefinitely for the NFS
server to respond.

The current code should exclude all mountpoints  
that are below mountpoints of "type autofs".

I wonder if that is right.

Couldn't be accidentally mountpoints excluded that should not be
excluded?

Interestingly `grep -vE " something ($this|$that) "`  
does not show nothing when `$this` or `$that` is empty  
(then it shows all lines even those that do not contain `something`)  
in contrast to `grep -vE "$this|$that"`  
so the code could be simplified.

This PR was tested and  
it is right to exclude all mountpoints below mountpoints of "type
autofs".
