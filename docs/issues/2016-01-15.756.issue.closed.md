After system backup completed, is there any effective way (ie: checking
$?, enabling some rear's option, checking log files) to verify the
backup operation as successful or failure?

@yin747 there will always be a line added to the syslog or messages
file. Of course, the rear.log is also an excellent place to look in. You
can even mail the rear.log automatically it if you define RESULT\_MAILTO
and RESULT\_MAILSUBJECT in `/etc/rear/local.conf`
