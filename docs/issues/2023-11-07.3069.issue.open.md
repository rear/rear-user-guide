-   Description of the issue:

I ( @jsmeix ) would like to report an issue with BACKUP=NSR  
that a SUSE customer reported to us.

Regarding BACKUP=NSR:  
In general there is nothing what I could do  
in case of issues with third-party backup tools  
because I do not have such software  
so I can neither test nor reproduce anything.

A SUSE customer is using ReaR version 2.7

The customer got the following issue:

With BACKUP=NSR "rear checklayout" always results exit code 1  
even if nothing of the disk layout has changed.  
So "rear checklayout" would create a new ISO every day  
even if this is not necessary.

The customer found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
that tells (excerpts):

    So IMHO removing the line
    NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    from the script 650_check_iso_recoverable.sh in the existing code
    will not harm the execution of the NSR workflow

and

    Log "NSRSERVER ($NSRSERVER) was defined in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf"

The customer does not want to set a fixed NSRSERVER in local.conf  
because NSRSERVER is dynamically determined via "rear mkrescue"  
and stored in /var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr\_server,  
see rear/rescue/NSR/default/460\_save\_nsr\_server\_name.sh

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
there were 2 proposed workarounds:

    Proposed workaround(s):
    In 650_check_iso_recoverable.sh comment in the line as follows
    #NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    or
    use the more sofisticated code snippet taken from 400_verify_nsr.sh instead:
    [...]

    if [[ ! -z "$NSRSERVER" ]]; then
        Log "NSRSERVER ($NSRSERVER) was defined in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf"
    elif [[ -f $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server ]]; then
        NSRSERVER=$( cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
    else
        Error "Could not retrieve the EMC NetWorker Server name. Define NSRSERVER in $CONFIG_DIR/local.conf file"
    fi

    [...]

The first workaround was implemented but it causes that now  
with BACKUP=NSR "rear checklayout" always results exit code 1  
even if nothing of the disk layout has changed.

The customer tried the second workaround which works as expected.  
In particular with the second workaround it works again as before  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)

Furthermore the customer just linked it

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default # ls -l
    total 4
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 ... 400_verify_nsr.sh -> ../../../../verify/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ... 650_check_iso_recoverable.sh

which also works for the customer  
so this could be a third possible workaround.

So the questions are:

Is the customer right, that the second workaround should be used?  
If yes, could ReaR be fixed this way?  
Or would the second workaround cause other unwanted side effects?  
Or could the third possible workaround be the best solution?

The customer would prefer the third possible workaround  
provided this does not cause unwanted side effects.

-   Workaround:

Create  
`usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh`  
as relative symlink that points to  
`../../../../verify/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh`

@hpannenb @gdha @viper1986  
could you please have a look here.

In particular I would be interested to know if reverting the fix  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af)  
for the issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
and instead creating

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh

as relative symlink that points to

    ../../../../verify/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh

would also still fix  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
plus make "rear checklayout" again result exit code 1  
only when the disk layout has changed.

Hmm - wait! - perhaps I misunderstand things:

Perhaps the third possible workaround is  
to leave the fix  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af)  
for  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
as is  
and only add

    usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh

as relative symlink that points to

    ../../../../verify/NSR/default/400_verify_nsr.sh

to have  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)  
still fixed  
plus make "rear checklayout" again result exit code 1

@jsmeix I guess to verify potential fixes and to evaluate the right
approach somebody will need to run some tests on a system with NSR
installed.

If a personal and direct interaction with this SUSE customer is possible
to do so, then please reach out to @gdha or me as this might yield the
fastest results.

Do I understand correctly that upstream ReaR already behaves well and
you are now looking for a potential back-port for SUSE?

@schlomo  
current upstream ReaR does not behave well  
because it contains the change  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/420c177d446abec8a64b9683c1a3a3088eae11af)  
of  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162)

ReaR from before that change behaved well for what  
our customer needs but that does not behave well  
for what @viper1986 needs according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162\#issue-460949301](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162#issue-460949301)

Our customer has already a workaround for his needs in place.

This issue is about to get a proper ReaR upstream fix  
that makes things behave well for both use cases,  
the one our customer has and the one @viper1986 has.

In  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162\#issuecomment-541343374](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2162#issuecomment-541343374)  
@hpannenb proposed two "workarounds"  
where the first one was implemented  
which causes the issue for our customer  
but for the more sophisticated second one  
our customer reported that this works for him.

So it seems the more sophisticated second one  
makes things behave well for both use cases,  
the one our customer has and the one @viper1986 has.

Accordingy I will implement that second workaround now  
as a GitHub pull request to somehow move this issue forward...

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3077](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3077)

The suggestion from the discussion in \#3077 is to actually remove the
check for NSR backups from the `checklayout` workflow and instead adding
support for easily running custom code as part of the `checklayout`
workflow.

Specifically this would also mean removing the complete
`650_check_iso_recoverable.sh`  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/01f503ed05beef78d8397719b9dce25fcdb211c6/usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650\_check\_iso\_recoverable.sh\#L1-L18](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/01f503ed05beef78d8397719b9dce25fcdb211c6/usr/share/rear/layout/save/NSR/default/650_check_iso_recoverable.sh#L1-L18)

Any thoughts on implementing that? Wouldn't that actually solve the
customer problem, too?

I know that this essentially reverts \#653 and might force users like
@tomglx to adjust the way how they use ReaR. However I hope that this is
acceptable if it will prevent troubles for other NSR users.

BTW, looking at the non-default code paths in `layout/save` it seems
like only NSR has that type of additional backup monitoring
functionality:
