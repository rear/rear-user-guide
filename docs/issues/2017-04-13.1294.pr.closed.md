(2) Also trying to fix:

(3) Inserting FIXME for the potential redundant /boot/\[eE\]\[fF\]\[iI\]
check.

@gdha  
can you have a look at the code below

<pre>
# next step, is case-sensitive checking /boot for case-insensitive /efi directory (we need it)
# FIXME: I <2010@probackup.nl> wonder whether it is necessary to have this check here because
# an identical check is already there in 310_include_uefi_tools.sh 
# and the next step "check filesystem partition type (vfat?)" has near identical logic.
</pre>

because according to  
"git log -p --follow
usr/share/rear/prep/default/320\_include\_uefi\_env.sh"  
that test was initially from you.

@jsmeix @ProBackup-nl @gozora
`usr/share/rear/prep/default/320_include_uefi_env.sh` needs a serious
facelift - will have a look at it during this week if time permits
