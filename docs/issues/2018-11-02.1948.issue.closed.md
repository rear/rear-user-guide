For a special use case it would help if we can set the
`TSM_RESTORE_PIT_DATE` and `TSM_RESTORE_PIT_TIME` variables in
configuration (or set something else instead) so that I don't have to
enter this information on each recovery.

Context is doing a mass recovery from a specific point in time backup.

Currently those variables are actually ignored by
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/aa7b1979c347a3800959d757f7ce485fc10bd788/usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/aa7b1979c347a3800959d757f7ce485fc10bd788/usr/share/rear/verify/TSM/default/390_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh)

**Solution idea**

Remove those variables from `default.conf` as they are actually internal
to this script. Instead, switch the user input in the TSM scripts to use
the new `UserInput` function written by @jsmeix so that then the user
can pre-fill that with the desired answer.

@schlomo Perhaps not a bad idea to write a note in the `default.conf`
file that these 2 variables are not removed as such, but taken in
account by the `390_request_point_in_time_restore_parameters.sh` script?
So that user know about it?

Yes, I would do that if those variables would have worked. Since they
never worked I think removing them is fine as it won't break anybody's
stuff.

I converted them to lower case in the code and `unset` them at the end
to make it clear that these variables are, in fact, internal.

So, unless it is specifically important to you, I'd prefer to leave them
out. I think as we convert more and more `read` calls to `UserInput`
people will learn to use this new mechanism.

@schlomo I'm not a TSM user, so for me it is OK. Trimming the
`default.conf` file is not a bad idea. For a novice user it can be
overwhelming IMHO.

IMHO we should only have variables in the `default.conf` that are meant
for the user to change. By that logic those variables don't belong
there.

Once upon a time we said that `default.conf` should initialize *every*
variable, but this example shows that it is better if it contains only
variables meant for users but not internal variables.

In current ReaR master code  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)  
reads

<pre>
# Here we define and describe all configuration variables and set them to a default.
</pre>

so that 'default.conf' is meant to initialize only all those variables  
that are meant for users to be changed (if needed).

Accordingly it is right to remove variables from default.conf  
that are not meant as configuration variables for users, cf.  
all those non-config variables that are set in usr/sbin/rear

@schlomo  
your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f5558efbf5407437bc3c6e671146faefa9992ee4](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/f5558efbf5407437bc3c6e671146faefa9992ee4)  
looks good to me from plain looking at the code  
(I cannot test proprietary backup tools).

The only tiny inconsistency is the date format that the code does

<pre>
tsm_restore_pit_date=$( date -d "$answer" +%Y.%m.%d 2>/dev/null ) ...
</pre>

versus what date format is told the user in the LogPrint message

<pre>
LogPrint " ... ${tsm_restore_pit_date} ${tsm_restore_pit_time} (MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss)"
</pre>

because (as far as I understand the copd from plain looking at it)  
${tsm\_restore\_pit\_date} is e.g. '2018.11.08' and not '11/08/2018',
cf.

FYI  
some explanations about my ideas behind my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1951](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1951)

I thought TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_DATE and TSM\_RESTORE\_PIT\_TIME  
are meant as user config variables (because they are in default.conf)  
but implementing the code for that had been somehow forgotten.

Because 390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
runs during "rear recover" I found it a bit too hard to error out  
only because the user may have by accident a typo in his input  
so that I tried to implement an endless loop until input was valid.  
But because 390\_request\_point\_in\_time\_restore\_parameters.sh  
runs early during "rear recover" (the verify stage runs at the
beginning  
in particular before the disklayout gets recreated) I think it does  
not hurt in practice to error out at that early stage of "rear recover".
