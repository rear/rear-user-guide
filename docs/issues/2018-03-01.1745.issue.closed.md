-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot? BIOS

-   Brief description of the issue:  
    I'm using rear to backup a Citrix XenServer 6.5 VM and recover it
    onto a newly built Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 platform. I'm taking
    advantage of the "unattended" option so I can automate the migration
    of a large number of VMs from the one platform to another. I get the
    error: 'Disk /dev/xvda is not a block device.' and rear instructs me
    to report this as a bug to this forum.  
    [rear-testvm2.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/1769242/rear-testvm2.log)

-   Work-around, if any: Use automatic recover and use
    USER\_INPUT\_LAYOUT*CONFIRM* settings

@bspfau What did you modify in the layout configuration?

Thanks for the reply -- I didn't modify anything in the layout  
configuration because I wanted the rear recover operation to just go
with  
the defaults.

@bspfau Perhaps try recover with debugging options -d -D so we can see
more precisely where it fails?

I think "using rear to backup a Citrix XenServer 6.5 VM and  
recover it onto a newly built Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 platform"  
is a system migration and anything can happen in such cases.

I assume "a newly built Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 platform"  
is not compatible with "a Citrix XenServer 6.5 VM",  
cf. "Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@bspfau  
in case of a system migration you usually need at least  
to adapt your disk layout configuration file (disklayout.conf)  
to make it match what there actually is on your new "hardware"  
where "hardware" also means a virtual machine.  
This is what those various user dialogs request you to do  
when MIGRATION\_MODE is true.

In case of a system migration onto really different "hardware"  
you usually have to addtionally adapt various other things to make  
the ReaR recovery system boot and work as you need it on your  
new "hardware" e.g. kernel modules adaptions, networking setup  
adaptions, bootloader installation adaptions, whatever else...

Thanks gdha and Johannes for both the replies. I'm following your  
suggestions and running the debug recover right now. I'll examine it
first  
and then incorporate Johannes' suggestion about adapting the disk
layout  
conf files. When I get further I'll post my findings here before
asking  
for more direction. Thanks!

@bspfau  
when you work with a self-adapted disklayout.conf  
I would like to really recommend to use a current  
ReaR upstream GitHub master code as follows:

Basically "git clone" it into a separated directory and then  
configure and run ReaR from within that directory like:

<pre>
# git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

# mv rear rear.github.master

# cd rear.github.master

# vi etc/rear/local.conf

# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
</pre>

Note the relative paths "etc/rear/" and "usr/sbin/".

Reason:  
The current ReaR upstream GitHub master code contains a  
major rework and changed default behaviour how ReaR behaves  
in migration mode when partitions can or must be resized  
to fit on replacement disks with different size, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1731)
and its related issues  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102)
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1718)

Without that new code you may get unexpected partitioning results  
that do not match what you had specified in your disklayout.conf, cf.

Great info--I'll do that. Thanks, Johannes!

@bspfau  
I guess you may also need my "very latest greatest changes" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1758)  
see my comments therein for a possible reason why.

Because "no news are good news" I assume this issue  
does no longer happen with current ReaR GitHub master code  
(otherwise this issue can be reopened).  
If other different issues appear please report each of them  
as a new and separated issue here.
