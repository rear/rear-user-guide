##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

\#1622 and \#1623

-   How was this pull request tested?

Created CentOS 6 (init-based) and CentOS 7 (systemd-based) VMs in
Virtualbox and tested rescue ISOs for all 4 TIMESYNC options on both
systems.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Added chrony support so that newer systems that ship with chrony vs ntp,
like RHEL/CentOS 7, are able to sync system time during rescue/restore.

430\_prepare\_timesync.sh will also not update ROOTFS\_DIR/etc/inittab
if the system is systemd-based.

While I was here, I updated the options for rdate to include -l (use
syslog) and -p (print remote system time) so that rdate output is as
close to the other 3 TIMESYNC options.
