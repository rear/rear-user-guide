### Platform

*No response*

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Request to add a GUI-based or guided configuration helper to
Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) to simplify setup, configuration, and
monitoring for administrators.

A guided tool would reduce human error in configuration , streamline
setup, and improve usability.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Request to add a GUI-based or guided configuration helper to
Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) to simplify setup, configuration, and
monitoring for administrators.

# Proposed Solution:

Develop a lightweight GUI or guided tool to:

-   Configure key ReaR settings (bootloader, backup method, storage,
    network, output location) and other additional option available in
    default.conf
-   Run ReaR operations (mkrescue, mkbackup, recover) from the same
    interface.
-   Provide status and monitoring information for backups and rescues.
-   Ensure minimal dependencies to support restricted or minimal OS
    environments.
