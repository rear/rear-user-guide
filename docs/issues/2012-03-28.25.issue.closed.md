Bug reported by irvined at
SF\#[3263766](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3263766&group_id=171835&atid=859452)

Original report
---------------

This is for version 1.10.0 running on Ubuntu 10.04 64 bit Linux
\#55-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 10 23:57:16 UTC 2011 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

`sudo rear mkbackup` gives:

    Relax & Recover Version 1.10.0 / 2011-02-20
    The preparation phase OK
    ERROR: Could not guess physical device for '/dev/mapper/s11--vm--app--22-root' [251:0] in '/sys/block/dm-0/dev'.
    This is probably a bug in your kernel or in Relax & Recover, so please file a bug report about this.

This is running on a VMware virtual machine with disks provided by IBM
XIV SAN

Aditional notes
---------------

I have tried the latest svn code an mkbackup now works for me.

When I try to boot from the generated .iso file I get a error while
loading shared libraries: libpthread.so.0 wrong ELF class ELFCLASS32e
Then kernel panic

Looking at the library files in the /tmp/rear.xxxx/rootfs/lib directory

    libpthread.so.0: symbolic link to `libpthread-2.11.1.so'
    libpthread-2.11.1.so: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped

Whereas in the running filesystem

    /lib/libpthread-2.11.1.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, not stripped

Does this mean that the .iso has been created using the 32bit library
instead of the 64 bit?

Comment by schlomoschapiro
--------------------------

we have seen similar reports from 64bit systems where /lib contained
64bit stuff and /lib32 contained 32bit stuff. But so far I have heard
about that only in the context of Debian, not Ubuntu.

I would advice that you find out how your system handles 64bit and 32bit
libraries and see if ReaR understands that and puts them in the correct
place, see also the use of LIBS and LIBS64 in ReaR.

Without a test system to take a look at I won't be able to help you
beyond such general advice.

Sorry,  
Schlomo

Please test a recent (or master branch) for this issue and provide
feedback relating to this bug as it is believed to have been fixed in
the latest version.

I am closing this bug now, but do reopen this bug if it has not been
fixed by recent improvements to the code.
