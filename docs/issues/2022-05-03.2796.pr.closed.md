@pcahyna  
this pull request is only meant as a proposal  
so you could have a look  
how things might be done according to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795\#issuecomment-1116010676](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795#issuecomment-1116010676)

Currently it is totally untested code so there could be stupid bugs.  
It is only meant to show some basic ideas.

I wonder why there is no symlink handling for what CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES
evaluates to.

I think that whole stuff needs to be overhauled and cleanly  
(i.e. more simple and straightforward) implemented like:

1.  Evaluate CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES and FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS  
    to a local array of plain files and symlinks.

2.  Do symlink handling for the plain files and symlinks in that aray.

3.  Run "md5sum" for the results.

Do we need any symlink checks for `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES`? Those files are
specified explicitly, so shouldn't we respect what was put there and
avoid any post-processing (except expanding directories)?

I think we need symlink checks also for CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES  
because the user may have specified directories which  
contain symlinks with targets in /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ /run/

If a user really wants to check things in /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ /run/  
I think he could specify the targets in /proc/ /sys/ /dev/ /run/

For me `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ... '/dev/lp0' '/proc/cmdline' )`

With `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES=( ... '/dev/sda8' )`  
I get a longer delay during "rear savelayout"  
because it computes the md5sum for /dev/sda8  
but during "rear -D checklayout" I get on the terminal

    Skip /dev/sda8 in CHECK_CONFIG_FILES (no regular file matches)

so I think we should exclude non regular files hardcoded in general  
at least for now because I assume md5sum comparison  
does not make sense in such cases.  
If a user reports a special case where that is really needed  
we could adapt and enhance things accordingly.

because the patterns in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES must contain bash globbing
characters  
like a \[\] around the first letter to ensure that 'shopt -s nullglob'
removes this file from the listing.

I will fix that right now because it is a bug in any case.

    I don't think that any modification of

    (except for replacing the diff -u by a better comparison like cmp
     and using sort to avoid false warnings when the set of files is unchanged,
     but the order is changed) is needed.
    layout/save/default/600_snapshot_files.sh
    appends to the variable CHECK_CONFIG_FILES,
    so layout/compare/default/510_compare_files.sh will inherit it
    ( layout/save is executed before layout/compare ).

I don't think `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` is expected to contain any patterns
that the shell would expand or remove. I believe that when adding to the
variable, one may use shell patterns if one needs to ensure that
nonexistent files are not added, and perhaps one should do it (I don't
see why it is necessary though, the original code skips nonexistent
files silently, so it is not a bug to specify a nonexistent file), but
the variable itself should not contain shell patterns (the pattern
should get expanded already when adding to the variable, not when
expanding the variable itself).

@jsmeix thanks for the investigation of the details of file checking
here - I am not sure what should be the strategy with respect to \#2795.
On one hand, I am afraid that the original issue is snowballing into
something much bigger. We have a real-world complaint about the lack of
checking after restore, but no-one has complained about the lack of
symlink handling in `checklayout` and even the wrong use of `diff -u`
does not seem to have negative consequences in practice. For this
reason, I would like to merge \#2795 soon and worry about the other
stuff later. OTOH, the discussion may make \#2795 entirely obsolete,
because we may find that we need an entirely different strategy.

That patterns get expanded before adding to CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES

No,
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)
is not obsolete.  
The strategy you developed there looks exactly right and I like it.

All I intended with this pull request here is a proposal how  
layout/save/default/600\_snapshot\_files.sh  
in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)  
might be improved regarding what it results in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES.

My idea is that basically CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES should contain  
what `files_for_md5sum` contains in 510\_compare\_files.sh  
in this proposal here.

Then 510\_compare\_files.sh could just run md5sum  
for the elements "as is" in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES  
without any further evaluation or checks because  
all that was already done in 600\_snapshot\_files.sh

In general I consider it as good coding style  
to not add nonexistent things to a variable.

To some extent this belongs to  
"Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
because it avoids possible errors in subsequent code  
when variables do not contain nonsense values  
than to just rely on that all subsequent code  
(including all future added or changed subsequent code)  
will be sufficiently robust against nonsense values.  
Of course all code should be sufficiently robust  
but my point is to not just rely on that.

Furthermore when variables do not contain nonsense values  
it makes debugging easier because nonsense values may  
lead to false assumptions about the cause of an issue.

While it is "nice" to not supply nonexistent filenames to other parts of
the code, the code is designed to cope with that, so I would not worry
too much about it.  
I have thought more about the issue and came to the conclusion that
`CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` needs to contain all the file names that one has
specified, even if they do not exist. Remember that we need to
eventually fix the current gap in \#2795 :
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795\#issuecomment-1116010676](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795#issuecomment-1116010676)
"When CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES and FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS evaluate to
different files this is a change that must be detected.". Presumably, we
are going to do it by recording the full content of `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES`
during `layout/save` (including nonexistent files) and checking this
list during `finalize` at the end of recovery.  
If nonexistent files are simply omitted from `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` during
`layout/save`, how will we detect that they have appeared at `finalize`
time? We can regenerate the content of `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` again at
`finalize` time (that's how I will solve the issue for
`FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS` - see "You are right that if I move to
something else than md5sum -c in finalize, the same code needs to be run
there (finalize/default/060\_compare\_files.sh) to regenerate
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES" in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795\#issuecomment-1117093699](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795#issuecomment-1117093699)
) but to cover all the places where `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` is appended to
in `layout/save`, one would need to rerun them or reimplement in
`finalize`. This means running all the
`layout/save/default/4*_check_*.sh` again during `finalize` to recreate
an equivalent `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES`, and I am not sure if the scripts are
ready for that.  
(The problem already exists due to the presence of wildcards in some of
the `layout/save/default/4*_check_*.sh` scripts, sigh.)

The `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( ... )` in some 'layout/save' scripts  
is a general problem because it modifies a user config variable  
which means what there is specified for CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES  
in 'default.conf' and 'local.conf' is not authoritative for what  
is acually used later.  
So in workflows that run 'layout/save' we use a different  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES (different than what the user specified)  
compared to workflows that do not run 'layout/save'.

My basic idea is to fully re-evaluate during "rear recover"  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES and FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS  
and regenerate md5sums and then compare the md5sum results.

After you merged
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)  
I will have a look how it behaves with it and then I will  
think about how to completely clean up the current  
md5sum comparison mess.

I think correct md5sum comparison is crucial for users  
because users should be able to rely on our  
md5sum comparison to behave consistently.

Issues like  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2785)  
is really bad user experience because it shows we do not

ReaR can detect when restored basic system files  
do not match the recreated system.  
It only needs to do it correctly.

I think with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)  
all needed code will be basically there.  
It only needs to be run in a more consistent way.

FYI  
what workflows run 'layout/save' (in current master code):  
The workflows are from what "rear -v help" shows  
('-v' is needed to let it show really all workflows).

    # workflows="checklayout dump finalizeonly format layoutonly mkbackup mkbackuponly mkopalpba mkrescue mountonly opaladmin recover restoreonly savelayout shell udev validate"

    # for w in $workflows ; do usr/sbin/rear -s $w | grep -q 'layout/save/' && echo $w ; done
    checklayout
    mkbackup
    mkbackuponly
    mkrescue
    savelayout

That's one way to do it for sure, but I am afraid that doing a full
re-evaluation will be difficult. So my proposal is to short-circuit it
by saving the full `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` list (except the addition
resulting from FILES\_TO\_PATCH\_PATTERNS, but including files that did
not exist at the time) into layout and then use it during finalize. But
for this, the list must be static (no wildcard expansions, since they
can result into less than what will be there during finalize).

.. because that essentially means running the whole `layout/save` stage
before `finalize`, in the mounted restored system, and I suspect there
will be problems with that.

I won't run the whole layout/save stage before finalize.

I will try to solve the problem with  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES+=( ... ) in some 'layout/save' scripts  
differently.

My immediate idea is to have all CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES+=( ... )  
that exists in scripts directly in default.conf because it does not
matter  
to specify more in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES than what actually exists  
in particular not when bash globbing patterns are used to ignore  
nonexistent things via 'shopt -s nullglob'.

This does not affect the user who can specify mandatory things  
for his specific CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES in local.conf  
without bash globbing patterns.

I do not understand what is wrong with bash globbing patterns in  
CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES because files that do not exists  
cannot be used for md5sum so files that do not exists  
should be skipped in any case from the md5sum call to avoid  
`md5sum: ...: No such file or directory` stderr messages.

I wonder what the difference is between skipping nonexistsnt files  
implicitly via globbing patterns with 'shopt -s nullglob'  
versus skipping them by some explicit test in the code.

I think the difference is that skipping via globbing happens silently  
while skipping by explicit test in the code could show messages  
to the user when something that is specified is not there.

This depends on the intended way of solving this mess.  
The solution that I had in mind was this pseudocode:

1.  assemble `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` during `layout/save`
2.  save it somewhere under layout
3.  calculate md5sums
4.  in `finalize` load `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES` saved in 2.
5.  calculate md5sums
6.  compare md5sums calculated in 3. and 5.

In this scheme, it matters a lot whether you skip nonexistent files
during step 1. (presumably using glob patterns and nullglob) vs. in step
3. immediately before calculating hashes (presumably using an explicit
test), because it affects what gets saved in step 2.

If you choose another approach, then it does not matter. Your approach
"to have all `CHECK_CONFIG_FILES+=( ... )` that exists in scripts
directly in default.conf" will be correct, I am just afraid it might be
a bit restrictive (there are conditionals in
`layout/save/default/4*_check_*.sh`).

Please just merge
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)  
so we have a good starting point for further development  
(which can be also tested by users how far that works for them)  
then let's see how far I can get from there.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2022-05-05 10:12](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796#issuecomment-1118387393):

As far as I see on first glance the conditionals in  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh and  
layout/save/default/450\_check\_network\_files.sh  
are not really mutually exclusive so having all of them  
in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES via globbing patterns  
should "just ignore" what was done before with conditionals.

By the way:  
Globbing patterns do help when used well:  
Currently at SUSE we have /boot/grub2/grub.cfg  
(at least on my openSUSE Leap 15.3 system)  
but nothing in 450\_check\_bootloader\_files.sh matches  
while `/[b]oot/*/grub*.cfg` would have matched.

So only the conditionals in  
layout/save/default/400\_check\_backup\_special\_files.sh  
are left.  
Offhandedly one may think even such special things could be  
"simply added with appropriate globbing patters".  
But when someone has TSM and/or FDR/Upstream installed  
but does not use BACKUP=TSM or BACKUP=FDRUPSTREAM  
for ReaR, then he would get things for TSM and/or FDR/Upstream  
in CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES that is not wanted to be checked  
when actually another backup method is used for ReaR.  
I guess I can move 400\_check\_backup\_special\_files.sh  
to a stage that is run in any case - e.g. the `init` stage  
that is run in any case directly by usr/sbin/rear  
via `SourceStage "init"`  
because the `init` stage looks right to do such special  
config variable adjustments.

I think that moving the conditionals that are really needed to `init`
would work, yes. Preferably they should not depend on the content of the
system, but only on other configuration variables (like `BACKUP`).
