-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

Fix the current regression since  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3434](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3434)  
that using the POSIX compliant '.' is forbidden.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3434\#issuecomment-2742598092](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3434#issuecomment-2742598092)  
reads (excerpts):

    Because '.' is the POSIX standard command
    POSIX compliant third party software rightfully uses '.'
    so ReaR must not enforce an environment where '.' is
    forbidden in general.
    ...
    The right solution is a '.' wrapper function which enforces
    that '.' is not used in a ReaR script or in a ReaR config file
    but which allows '.' in any non-ReaR files.

    What ReaR still can enforce is an environment
    where all what is executed via 'source' or '.'
    is checked to be trustworthy, i.e. for each
    file that is executed via 'source' or '.'
    its owner must be one of the TRUSTED_OWNERS and
    it must be located below one of the TRUSTED_PATHS.

-   How was this pull request tested?

"rear mkrescue" plus "rear mkbackuponly" on a SLES15-SP6 VM  
and then on another VM "rear recover" worked for me  
with OUTPUT=ISO and BACKUP=NETFS

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

Added a '.' wrapper function which enforces  
that '.' is not used in a ReaR script or in a ReaR config file  
(via a new global array REAR\_SOURCE\_PATHS)  
but which allows '.' in any non-ReaR files.

That '.' wrapper function calls the 'source' wrapper  
to enforce that for all what is executed via 'source' or '.'  
its owner must be one of the TRUSTED\_OWNERS and  
it must be located below one of the TRUSTED\_PATHS.

The new global array REAR\_SOURCE\_PATHS  
is not documented in default.conf  
because it is at least currently  
not meant as a user config variable.

Nevertheless to provide final power to the user  
the use can set REAR\_SOURCE\_PATHS as he likes,  
in particular with empty REAR\_SOURCE\_PATHS=()  
the '.' wrapper function does no longer enforce  
that '.' is not used in a ReaR script or in a ReaR config file.

I have thought of a different approach:  
introduce another helper (let's call it `SourceExternal`) that would be
used by ReaR code whenever it sources external code (outside ReaR). This
helper would remove the `.` wrapper (and restore it back after sourcing
completes). This would of course require us to find and replace all uses
of `source` for external code, but it would have the advantage of being
more explicit what the sourcing is for (eventually we would have mostly
`SourceExternal` and `Source` in our code and almost no plain `source`
left).

@pcahyna  
sigh - I already explained it several times:

It cannot work to use whatever differently named function  
to generically gain control over usage of 'source' and '.'  
in whatever obscure code places which are in practice  
outside of our control (e.g. lenghty contributions  
to support a new backup method and things like that  
where a proper review is impossible in practice - too easily  
a single dot within some weird code could be overlooked)  
exactly because we cannot reliably find all code places  
where external code could be sourced via 'source' or '.'  
(or 'eval' - but this is another separated topic).

I already had to try myself to  
"find all code places where external code is sourced"  
both for 'source' and '.' where I experienced myself  
it is an annoying discouraging and disappointing task  
(in particular because one never knows when it is done  
i.e. that one has really found all cases where external  
code is sourced) and this task would have to be done  
again and again ad nauseam to continuously ensure that  
ReaR does not by accident source unwanted stuff,  
cf.

By the way:  
We have still those open / unfinished issues  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3321](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3321)

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3291](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3291)  
from my manual attempts where I tried to find  
all code places where external code might be sourced.

@jsmeix thanks for the explanation. I see now that

(emphasis mine) is the key problem, i.e. code that is part of our code
base so in principle it is under our control, but in practice we can not
commit ourselves to audit it all.

Another idea, similar but without needing a review of all places where
`source` is used - would it make sense to detect inside `source` whether
the sourced script is inside ReaR sources and if not, disable the `.`
wrapper for the duration of the sourced file (and then reenable it)? The
detection would be done in a similar way to what your currently have in
the `.` wrapper. This would effectively move the complication from the
`.` wrapper to the `source` wrapper.

This is merely an idea for discussion, I don't know myself which option
is better. It just seems to me that running external code with one
wrapper less might be preferable.

To generically gain control over usage of 'source' and '.'  
we need wrappers for both anyway and all the time.

I think if we implement to disable the '.' wrapper  
under whatever conditions, those conditions could  
have security holes which might be exploited  
so a plain dot '.' could be the bash builtin  
without TRUSTED\_OWNERS / TRUSTED\_PATHS protection  
(I assume we can detect when 'builtin .' is used).  
In contrast if we keep the '.' wrapper all the time  
we do not need to worry about how to 100% correctly  
disable and re-enable it.

My current implementation is my first attempt  
to implement the desired functionality so that  
it works sufficiently well for now.  
I cannot predict the future so I cannot know  
what changes will be needed in practice over time.  
Things will of course get adapted and enhanced  
in the future as needed.  
Because all that are internal things in ReaR  
(except names and meaning of user config variables)  
we can change internal things in ReaR as we like.

As there are no hard objections  
I "just merged it" right now because  
this week and perhaps also next week  
(currently I cannot tell how long it takes)  
I cannot work on ReaR because I have to fix  
several security bugs in other software...
