Hi,

we've already discussed this on the mailing list. There should a
possibility to define a NSRPOOLNAME variable for overriding the pool
name. When mminfo does not return any results the default pool is used.
When using the default pool und there is no device in it the backup
fails with this message:

    98519:save: Unable to setup direct save with server mknw01.marcelk.brs.local: no matching devices for save of client `mkrear.marcelk.brs.local'; check storage nodes, devices or pools.
    90018:save: Cannot open a save session with NetWorker server 'mknw01.marcelk.brs.local': no matching devices for save of client `mkrear.marcelk.brs.local'; check storage nodes, devices or pools

And if I have some backups of one client in more than one pool, with the
mminfo query only the oldest backup is used - maybe this pool does not
exists any more.

Kind regards  
Marcel

Please try the fix from the issue\_640 branch:

    git clone git@github.com:rear/rear.git
    git checkout issue_640
    make rpm

(or deb as you need).

Hi Schlomo,

thank you, worked!

I discovered one strange thing with this branch:

-   At the end of the script no pool is printed and this worked with my
    old version:

    pool retent name

Shall I create a new issue for that?

Kind regards  
Marcel

@keilma let's keep everything related to my changes here. Can you please
be more specific? Is this an error or a cosmetic thing? Can you please
try to look into the scripts I changed and see if you can find the
cause? Thanks a lot!

@schlomo I think it's a NetWorker problem and not a problem with the
current branch. Lets take a look at a normal mminfo query:

\[root@mkrear ~\]\# mminfo -s mknw01 -a -q client=mkrear -r pool,name  
pool name  
dd160\_ALL **/var/lib/rear/**  
...

In the script you use this grep command:

++ grep -E
'/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html/mkrear.marcelk.brs.local.html|/var/lib/rear/output/rear-mkrear.iso'

I think that don't match when the name/save set is /var/lib/rear/,
correct?  
You haven't modified the save command, so I will dig a bit deeper
tomorrow why the save set is named /var/lib/rear.

An idea could be to use the -N switch of save to give the save set a
good name:

       -N name
              The symbolic name of this save set.  By default, the most common prefix of the path arguments is used as the save set name. If the -N option is used when saving any
              of the SYSTEM save sets (SYSTEM STATE, SYSTEM FILES, and SYSTEM DB), the path must also be specified and must match the name value assigned with the -N option.

Marcel

@schlomo the problem is giving "save" more than one file to save:

\[root@mkrear ~\]\# save -s mknw01 -e day -b dd160\_ALL
**/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html/mkrear.marcelk.brs.local.html**  
\[root@mkrear testfolder\]\# mminfo -s mknw01 -q client=mkrear -r
savetime,name  
mknw01.DD.003 mkrear.marcelk.brs.local 08/20/2015 852 KB manual
**/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html/mkrear.marcelk.brs.local.html**

\[root@mkrear ~\]\# save -s mknw01 -e day -b dd160\_ALL
**/var/lib/rear/output/rear-mkrear.iso**  
\[root@mkrear testfolder\]\# mminfo -s mknw01 -q client=mkrear -r
savetime,name  
08/20/2015 **/var/lib/rear/output/rear-mkrear.iso**

\[root@mkrear ~\]\# save -s mknw01 -e day -b dd160\_ALL
**/var/lib/rear/output/rear-mkrear.iso
/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html/mkrear.marcelk.brs.local.html**  
\[root@mkrear testfolder\]\# mminfo -s mknw01 -q client=mkrear -r
savetime,name  
08/20/2015 **/var/lib/rear/**

\[root@mkrear ~\]\# save **-N ReaR\_Files** -s mknw01 -e day -b
dd160\_ALL **/var/lib/rear/output/rear-mkrear.iso
/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html/mkrear.marcelk.brs.local.html**  
\[root@mkrear testfolder\]\# mminfo -s mknw01 -q client=mkrear -r
savetime,name  
08/20/2015 **ReaR\_Files**

With the correct names this is the output and the end of rear is:

pool retent name

dd160\_ALL 08/21/15 /var/lib/rear/output/rear-mkrear.iso  
dd160\_ALL 08/21/15
/var/lib/rear/recovery/cfg2html/mkrear.marcelk.brs.local.html

Forgot in my previous post: I'm using "USE\_CFG2HTML=y"

@keilma so you are telling me that BACKUP=NSR and USE\_CFG2HTML=y are
not compatible? If so then please open a new issue for that.

I am basically waiting for your final feedback if I should merge this
branch upstream or if you want more changes/fixes.

@schlomo no, they are compatible, but your grep command does not work
because the save set ("name") is getting a other name when save is used
with two files. I will open a new issue for that.

You can merge this branch, it worked and is a nice enhancement.

This change only fixes part of the problem. Sometimes the used mminfo
just doesn't give use the right  
pool. I'm administering a slightly bigger networker scenario and that
just doesn't cut it. There can be  
multiple pools used by a client. Like a pool for database backups, one
for clones of backups and so on. So one at least must have the option to
oversteer the result of the mminfo command, not a fallback. I'm in need
for a NSR\_POOL\_NAME option that does exactly that.  
I've also refined the mminfo command for the location where the root
filesystem was last saved and I've tried to exclude nearline volumes
focusing the search on the primary save pool.  
Here is my Version of a patch

     NSRSERVER=$(cat $VAR_DIR/recovery/nsr_server )
     CLIENTNAME=$(hostname)
    -POOLNAME="$( mminfo -s $NSRSERVER -a -q "client=$CLIENTNAME" -r "pool" | head -1 )"
    +if [[ -z "$NSR_POOL_NAME" ]]
    +then
    +       POOLNAME="$( mminfo -ot -s $NSRSERVER -a -q "client=$CLIENTNAME,name=/" -r "avail,pool" | \
    +                       awk '$1 ~ "n" { print $2; exit; }' )"
    +else
    +       POOLNAME="$NSR_POOL_NAME"
    +fi
     [[ -z "$POOLNAME" ]] && POOLNAME="Default"
    -[[ -z "$RETENTION_TIME" ]] && RETENTION_TIME="1 day"
    +[[ -z "$NSR_RETENTION_TIME" ]] && NSR_RETENTION_TIME="1 day"

     Log "Saving files '${NSR_RESULT_FILES[@]}' with save"
    -save -s $NSRSERVER -c $CLIENTNAME -b "$POOLNAME" -y "$RETENTION_TIME" "${NSR_RESULT_FILES[@]}" 1>&8
    +save -s $NSRSERVER -c $CLIENTNAME -b "$POOLNAME" -y "$NSR_RETENTION_TIME" "${NSR_RESULT_FILES[@]}" 1>&8
     StopIfError "Could not save result files with save"

@tomglx Code in script `output/NSR/default/95_nsr_save_result_files.sh`
has been adjusted (8ea497d). Could you verify it is ok? thx Gratien
