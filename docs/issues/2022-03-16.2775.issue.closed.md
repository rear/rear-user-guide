-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    `rear mkbackup` runs for a couple of minutes, then aborts.
    `systemctl status rear.service` shows the following:

<!-- -->

    Mar 09 14:45:22 rem systemd[1]: rear.service: Consumed 2min 35.624s CPU time.

This isn't the primary issue, but I will note that according to the
[Borg
docs](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html?highlight=exit%20code#return-codes),
return code 1 indicates that Borg successfully completed, but with
warning(s) â€” not that it failed. I have verified that Borg *does*
successfully create the backup archive. ReaR should probably pass along
the warning and keep going in this case, not abort with an error message
claiming that Borg failed.

`borg.log` contents:

    2022-03-09 14:44:08,213 INFO Creating archive at "ssh://borg-rem@neo:22/~/borg::rear_235"

It looks like when ReaR calls Borg to do the backup, it's including
things under `/mnt`, which (to the best of my understanding) should all
be excluded automatically.

And here's the `rear.log`:

I see in this log that the step
`Including backup/BORG/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh` does
get called, but of course the temp area gets removed at the end of the
run, so I can't check the contents of `backup-include.txt`.

-   Workaround, if any:

I haven't found any successful workaround yet. I have tried adding the
following lines to `local.conf`:

-   `EXCLUDE_BACKUP=( '/mnt' )`
-   `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( ${AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH[@]}" /mnt )`

But `rear mkbackup` still fails with the same log output shown above.

I didn't have a closer look but on first glance (excerpts from above)

    rear mkbackup runs for a couple of minutes, then aborts.
    systemctl status rear.service shows the following:
    ...
    Mar 09 14:45:22 rem systemd[1]: rear.service: Deactivated successfully.
    Mar 09 14:45:22 rem systemd[1]: rear.service: Consumed 2min 35.624s CPU time.

indicates this issue could be similar as what I described in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/840)

I know nothing at all about a `rear.service` for systemd.  
As far as I can see there is no `rear.service` in our sources.  
But I am not a systemd expert so I may miss something.

@scruloose Borg is responsible for the backup not ReaR, therefore,
excluding paths from the backup falls under Borgs' configuration
settings. ReaR tasks during recovery is creating the empty filesystems
and trigger borg to start the restore of the files.  
Furthermore, I guess the rear.service is a kind of cron written in
systemd?

Thanks for taking a look!

I'm pretty confident that what's going on here is unrelated to that
issue...

-   udev is not involved at all. I wrote the `rear.service` systemd unit
    myself, and it's activated by a timer, not a udev event.
-   The systemd service type is "simple", which neither monitors the
    status of the command it launches nor enforces any limit on how long
    it may run.
-   I use the same `rear.service` unit on several client systems, all
    using Borg for the backup component, and I've seen it run for many
    hours and succeed.
-   `borg.log` clearly indicates that Borg is throwing warnings when it
    tries to back up various mounts located under `/mnt`, which it
    shouldn't be trying to back up in the first place.
-   `rear.log` shows that ReaR is (wrongly) interpreting Borg's exit
    status of 1 as a failure and thus aborting the `mkbackup` workflow.
    There is no indication that ReaR is being interrupted.

So I'm fairly sure the actual problem is that the `rear mkbackup`
workflow is failing to exclude `/mnt/*` in its call to Borg, even though
it should be excluded by default. I don't know how to determine whether
the failure of the include/exclude logic stems from a bug in ReaR or a
mistake in my configuration.

@gozora Hi Vlad - you are our Borg specialist - could you have a look
and comment on this issue please?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3537536?v=4" width="50">[scruloose](https://github.com/scruloose) commented at [2022-03-17 14:49](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2775#issuecomment-1070973427):

@gdha But Borg is taking all of its instructions *from ReaR*. There is
no Borg configuration, beyond the env-vars and command-line that it
receives from ReaR.

The step
`Including backup/BORG/default/400_create_include_exclude_files.sh`
creates a temp file called `backup-include.txt` which is then read by
`backup/BORG/default/500_make_backup.sh` at the step commented as
"Create Borg friendly include list."

Presumably some combination of ReaR's various `EXCLUDE` and
`AUTOEXCLUDE` options determines what goes into that file and thus what
inclusions and exclusions ReaR passes when calling Borg... Right?

Yes, my setup is indeed "a kind of cron written in systemd". A timer
unit triggers the service unit, which executes `rear mkbackup`. I chose
`Type=simple` for that service unit specifically because it's the "fire
and forget" type: systemd considers the command successful as soon as
it's forked off, and pays no attention to how long the process runs or
what its exit status is. I'm happy to paste in those unit files, if
anyone thinks they're likely to be relevant.

I am not a Borg backup user so I cannot actually help with  
Borg backup specific issues (if this one is a Borg backup specific
issue).

Because  
usr/share/rear/backup/BORG/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
is a symbolic link to  
usr/share/rear/backup/NETFS/default/400\_create\_include\_exclude\_files.sh  
it seems in particular BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE could be  
also supported for BACKUP=BORG.

See usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf how BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE  
is meant to work which is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L1309](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L1309)

I don't know if BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE actually works with BACKUP=BORG.  
I had BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE only tested with 'tar' for BACKUP=NETFS.  
If the ReaR default behaviour does not backup what I specifically need  
I find it easier to specify exactly what I need in
BACKUP\_PROG\_INCLUDE  
plus BACKUP\_ONLY\_INCLUDE="yes" to switch off ReaR's automatisms.

I cannot imagine why things under /mnt are not automatically  
excluded via our default

    AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH=( /media /run /mnt /tmp )

in this particular case here.

In general without a full debugscripts log file (i.e. "rear -D
mkbackup")  
it is impossible to tell what actually happens in this particular case
here.  
See our issue template  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)  
which reads (excerpt)

    Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover" debug log files)

Hello guys,

I'm sorry, but I've never used `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` neither with or without
Borg so I have no clue of its implications.  
When talking about include/exclude of files, BORG should use same config
variables and processes as NETFS.

I'm sorry I can't help here more but I really lack spare time nowadays .

@gdha sorry for 18 days delay, but I've probably overlook you mentioning
me.

V.

@gozora  
no need to be sorry.  
You already contributed so much to ReaR so feel free to focus on  
and hopefully also enjoy what has topmost priority for you now!
