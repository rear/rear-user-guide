Hello,

After restore made from rear I cannot boot server beceause it jumps into
dracut shell with messages:  
dracut-initqueue\[287\]: Warning: Not all disks have been found.  
dracut-initqueue\[287\]: Warning: You might want to regenerate your
initramfs.

I tried solution proposed by RH to activate vg : lvm vgchange -ay
rootvg  
But none of lvm commands is available.  
please help.
