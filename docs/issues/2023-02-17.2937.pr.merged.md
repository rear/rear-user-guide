Thanks a lot @jsmeix for your review, I still have to go over the code
and will take all of your remarks into consideration.

@schlomo  
I had only a quick look over the code and  
added offhanded comments without much thinking  
where I spotted something.

Now it's weekend time for me.

I wish you all a relaxed and recovering weekend!

Just an observation:

I think that most of the developers who worked on this code before
didn't realise that during rescue system startup we also read the ReaR
configuration in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ea900c4ec9589c7acb3d90c01f75ad7781fbdd8c/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup\#L69-L77](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/ea900c4ec9589c7acb3d90c01f75ad7781fbdd8c/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup#L69-L77)

which makes it super simple to tweak the rescue startup for specific
configurations, e.g. mounting a `tmpfs` for backup software that wants
to confirm some free disk space.

Also, I think modifying the PATH should be done on a system level and
not per-ReaR-run level.

I'll see what can be done with that.

In general regarding new so called "boolean" config variables  
i.e. config variables where any non-empty value means 'true', cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L31](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L31)

In this case here it is USE\_RAMDISK:

I suggest to avoid new so called "boolean" config variables  
because such config variables evaluate to 'true' if set to 'false',  
e.g. in this case

    USE_RAMDISK="no"

will  
"Configuring Rescue system with default ramdisk size"  
in the current  
rescue/GNU/Linux/295\_configure\_ramdisk\_rootfs.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2937/files/8d873cdca24d87e65c085dedfe9c1a8c2cdb4f04..77567f37567b947ab1797018868d934799b20c45\#diff-c7ff10e36d2be7dc506e70939111fc5ff53cdcd4f4bf978ff6aeab5430c32eeb](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2937/files/8d873cdca24d87e65c085dedfe9c1a8c2cdb4f04..77567f37567b947ab1797018868d934799b20c45#diff-c7ff10e36d2be7dc506e70939111fc5ff53cdcd4f4bf978ff6aeab5430c32eeb)

For new config variables I recommend explicit coding  
by using our is\_true and is\_false functions, see  
lib/global-functions.sh how to use them  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh\#L95](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh#L95)

Then default.conf could be like

    ##
    # USE_RAMDISK
    #
    # Configure rescue system to create and pivot to a ramdisk instead of initramfs.
    #
    # This is required by some backup software that wants to check for actually available disk space.
    # Examples are: GALAXY11
    #
    # Set to 'true' (or any value that is recognized as 'yes' by the is_true function)
    # to use a ramdisk with default size (usually 50% of physical RAM, see 'size' in "man tmpfs").
    # Set to a number to use a ramdisk with available free disk space in MiB.
    # This will probably crash if you don't have enough physical memory
    # for the ReaR recovery system (minimum about 250 MiB up to more than 1 GiB)
    # plus the specified available free disk space, see KEEP_BUILD_DIR how to check
    # the ReaR recovery system content in $TMPDIR/rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/rootfs/
    USE_RAMDISK="no"

and  
rescue/GNU/Linux/295\_configure\_ramdisk\_rootfs.sh  
could be like

    # Prepare rescue system to switch_root to a ramdisk:

    is_false "$USE_RAMDISK" && return

    if is_positive_integer "$USE_RAMDISK" ; then
        DebugPrint "Configuring Rescue system with ramdisk and free disk space of $USE_RAMDISK MiB"
        echo $USE_RAMDISK >$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/ramdisk-free-space
    else
        is_true "$USE_RAMDISK" || return 0
        DebugPrint "Configuring Rescue system with default ramdisk size (usually 50% of physical RAM)"
    fi

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=(switch_root du)
    KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" rdinit=/etc/scripts/ramdisk-rootfs"

I also exchanged by the way "MB" by "MiB"  
according to what "man tmpfs" tells about 'size'.

FYI  
regarding usual ReaR recovery system size values, see

@schlomo  
thank you for the USE\_RAMDISK functionality!

I did not know that initramfs behaves fundamentally different  
compared to hwo a normal "disk thingy" behaves.

I am reading now things like  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10603104/the-difference-between-initrd-and-initramfs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10603104/the-difference-between-initrd-and-initramfs)

Ugh!  
Why has all that computing stuff become so complicated :-(  
I want my home computer back - the one from 40 years ago ;-)

@jsmeix I had similar thoughts and was also considering introducing 2
variables:

1.  `USE_RAMDISK` as true boolean
2.  `RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE` for the free space

Or maybe we should use a numeric value and only use a
`RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE` which defaults to 0 to indicate not to do
anything and can be set to a number to indicate that we need a ramdisk
with X MiB free space.

I'm also really not sure where in the long `default.conf` to add this
new variable, any suggestions about the name or place are most welcome.

Regarding the place in default.conf  
I think before or after the REAR\_INITRD\_COMPRESSION part  
looks reasonable because ramdisk is related to initrd.

Regarding two variables for "one thing":

I introduced several variables with "ternary semantics", cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L35](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/rear-2.7/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L35)  
and personally I have only good experience with it.

It makes all simpler in practice because  
there is only one thing to deal with  
so the code is simpler (at least this is how I experienced it)  
and it is simpler for the user to specify what he wants.

From a theoretical point of view "ternary semantics"  
mixes boolean type with data (integer/string/array) type  
but because there is no real boolean type in bash  
this does not matter - as long as the boolean values  
'True T true t Yes Y yes y 1' and 'False F false f No N no n 0'  
cannot appear as data values so one can reliably distinguish  
the three cases with 'is\_true', 'is-false', and "something else".

E.g. if USE\_RAMDISK would be the size in GiB then

    USE_RAMDISK=1

to specify 1 GiB ramdisk size (or free space)  
could conflict with `is_true "$USE_RAMDISK"`.

Spontaneously I like  
"only use a RESCUE\_RAMDISK\_FREE\_SPACE which defaults to 0"  
most.

In particular because the variable name tells what it does  
and even `is_false "$RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE"` can be used  
as a generic test when the user does not want a ramdisk  
i.e. the user can also specify `RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE="no"`  
when he does not want a ramdisk so the code could be like

    # Prepare rescue system to switch_root to a ramdisk:

    is_false "$RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE" && return

    is_positive_integer "$RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE" || Error "RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE='$RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE' is not a positive integer"

    DebugPrint "Configuring Rescue system with ramdisk and free disk space of $RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE MiB"
    echo $RESCUE_RAMDISK_FREE_SPACE >$ROOTFS_DIR/etc/ramdisk-free-space

    REQUIRED_PROGS+=(switch_root du)
    KERNEL_CMDLINE+=" rdinit=/etc/scripts/ramdisk-rootfs"

Sounds good, however I'd like to keep the size in MiB and not GiB

@schlomo  
I think you misunderstood.  
The size should be in MiB because if it was in GiB then  
a conflict could appear what the value '1' means.  
In this particular case it would be even OK if  
the value '1' would mean both 'true' and '1 GiB'  
but at least this would look "hairy".

Furthermore any non-integer numbers call for problems  
and strings are the worst of all (because all what  
hardware can actually do is computing integers).

@schlomo  
I like your last ramdisk implementation via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2937/files/549cb99adb2566725310fbcfab6ec74c061fbde1..15b763af73e7ade480c6e226062bdb59efad0e01](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2937/files/549cb99adb2566725310fbcfab6ec74c061fbde1..15b763af73e7ade480c6e226062bdb59efad0e01)  
very much because it keeps the simple boolean  
USE\_RAMDISK="yes" vs. USE\_RAMDISK="no" functionality  
where USE\_RAMDISK="yes" creates a ramdisk with default size  
which helps the user if he cannot decide what the right size is  
and 50% of of physical RAM by default looks reasonable  
on nowadays systems with usually 4 GiB RAM and more because  
for me only 2 GiB RAM "just work" on my VMs for testing ReaR  
but normally I use a small ReaR recovery system of about 200 MiB, cf.

@rear/contributors can you imagine any reason why we shouldn't be able
to remove support for older CommVault versions?

According to
[https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductEOLMessages](https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductEOLMessages)
currently only GALAXY11 is actually supported by CommVault and users
with a legacy CommVault version probably also use a legacy Linux distro
and can also keep using their legacy ReaR version  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101384/220553111-36be61da-17e5-4638-b704-8d785f957156.png)

Personally, I really would like to reduce the amount of **untestable**
and **unmaintainable** code in ReaR

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4" width="50">[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix) commented at [2023-02-22 10:25](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2937#issuecomment-1439773886):

OK - let's be venturous here  
and disable support for older CommVault versions.

Note the different wording "remove" vs. "disable".

With "disable" I mean something like a new  
usr/share/rear/init/default/500\_disable\_deprecated.sh  
script that errors out for deprecated functionality  
so users can if needed modify that script  
to still use deprecated functionality  
until we actually remove the code.

For example  
(only an offhanded quick initial attempt):

    # Error out for deprecated functionality.
    # If really needed users may skip this:
    #return 0 

    local deprecated_error=''

    # As of this writing on Wed Feb 22 2023 according to
    # https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductEOLMessages
    # currently only GALAXY11 is actually supported by CommVault:
    for deprecated_backup_galaxy in GALAXY GALAXY7 GALAXY10 ; do
        if test "$BACKUP" = $deprecated_backup_galaxy ; then
            LogPrintError "BACKUP=$deprecated_backup_galaxy is deprecated functionality"
            deprecated_error="yes"
        fi
    done

    is_true $deprecated_error || return 0
    Error "Deprecated functionality is no longer supported"

Instead of using a local deprecated\_error variable  
we may introduce a new DEPRECATED\_ERROR user confing variable  
but then users may too easily set it to "no" without telling us  
that they really need this or that deprecated functionality?

I'm actually against this approach @jsmeix because it won't remove the
code from ReaR and that is my objective here: Getting rid of untested
and unmaintainable code.

What is bad with pointing users of old CommVault to either use old ReaR
or sponsor/contribute proper support in new ReaR? After all, it won't be
difficult to bring the scripts back from an older version, if needed. Or
somebody could extract them into an add-on that can be installed on top
of ReaR (ReaR was always meant to be extensible via dropping more files
into it), which would allow the truly interested parties to maintain
legacy CommVault support outside of our upstream development.

I'm really talking about upstream ReaR here, whatever we do won't affect
anybody with ReaR 2.7 installed.
