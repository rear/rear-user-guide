-   Type: **New Feature** + **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#1926

-   How was this pull request tested?

Unit testing using `tests/setup1` and `tests/setup2` testbeds

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

This PR has 2 parts:

-   a fix for **Bonding**: when LACP is used, Bond should not be
    simplified
-   the code for *non-simplified* **Teaming**

Additionally, I simplified/hardened the `tests/setup1` and
`tests/setup2` testbeds.

@gdha @gozora @schabrolles  
I dared to set you as reviewers here because  
my networking knowledge is insufficient to review it.

Unfortunately I have zero experience with advanced networking topics, so
I need to pass on even trying to review something like this ...

BTW today I've discovered
[OpenVSwitch](http://www.openvswitch.org/features/) which can be
<s>somehow</s> hooked into Virbualbox or Qemu, and might be useful for
testing of more complex network scenarios in ReaR. I'll definitely give
it a try in near future.

@gozora This is what I'm using to test bonding and stuff like that.  
But it doesn't work with LACP, you need some real switch.

@rmetrich good to know is actually is working!

> But it doesn't work with LACP, you need some real switch.

OpenVSwitch features page says it can deal with LACP (IEEE
802.1AX-2008), is that some different kind of LACP ?

yes it can deal with it, when openvswitch is connnected to a real switch
behind.

@gdha @gozora @schabrolles  
my approval alone is insufficient to merge it  
because my networking knowledge is insufficient  
to properly review what the changes actually do.

@gozora @schabrolles  
if there are no objections I will merge it today afternoon.

@jsmeix OK for me ;-)
