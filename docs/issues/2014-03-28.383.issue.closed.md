function cleanup\_build\_area\_and\_end\_program() in
framework-functions.sh contains following line:

                rm -Rf $BUILD_DIR/outputfs

When using NFS target, BUILD\_DIR is the same as BACKUP\_URL. It
happened that BUILD\_DIR was still mounted when this command was run,
resulting in loss of all files there. I'm unable to reproduce it right
now but it certainly happened several times. I was also having trouble
with poor NFS server response time at the same time, maybe this caused
some unusual code path to be run. Not sure why but it can cause cause
unwanted deletes, Maybe BUILD\_DIR should point to temporary location,
not to backup destination.

The `BUILD_DIR` is defined in
`./rear:BUILD_DIR="$(mktemp -d -t rear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)"`

    ++ [[ -d /tmp/rear.qP5aLwuy8VgZeMv/outputfs/fedora20 ]]
    ++ rmdir -v /tmp/rear.qP5aLwuy8VgZeMv/outputfs
    rmdir: removing directory, '/tmp/rear.qP5aLwuy8VgZeMv/outputfs'

According an earlier mail from you:

    OUTPUT_URL=file:///backup/
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://nfs.host.uu/some/dir

The `OUTPUT_URL` was not going to NFS, but a local file system. However,
if I understood it well `/backup` is a NFS mounted file system. What you
should do is or unset `OUTPUT_URL` or define a proper nfs mount point

removed OUTPUT\_URL parameter and I'm doing backup to mounted NFS share
(BACKUP\_URL=file:///...). It works too, but I need to mount correct NFS
directory manually before recover. That's all.
