-   rear version (/usr/sbin/rear -V):

Relax-and-Recover 1.17.2 / Git

-   OS version (cat /etc/rear/os.conf or lsb\_release -a):

Oracle Linux Server release 7.3

-   rear configuration files (cat /etc/rear/site.conf or cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf):

OUTPUT=ISO  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL="nfs://server/rear/"  
NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY=1  
ONLY\_INCLUDE\_VG=( vg00 )

-   Are you using legacy BIOS or UEFI boot?

UEFI

-   Brief description of the issue:

We are testing rear recovery on new HP Synergy compute nodes. They are
setup using UEFI. The process to make the recovery is fine. When booting
from the ISO, we get the following output.

**Failed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - Not Found  
Failed to load image \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi: Not Found  
start\_image() returned Not Found**

This makes sense since the iso image does not contain that file. It does
contain BOOTx64.efi. I have not tried a newer version on rear as I want
to stick with the one that comes with the distro. I have oracle support,
so I should be able to take any info and supply it to them. They could
then update the package.

I have noticed that when I run mkbackup with verbosity, I see this in
the output.

Using UEFI Boot Loader for Linux (USING\_UEFI\_BOOTLOADER=1)

So I can only assume it is not necessary in the local.conf file.

-   Work-around, if any:

Hello @cocampbe,

There have been lots of changes in ReaRs UEFI code since 1.17.2 so I
don't even dare to guess what can be wrong in your case.  
My best advice to you would be to update to version 2.1 or if you are
using secure boot to HEAD of ReaRs master branch.

V.

@gozora

I was going to try that, but since I have oracle support, I figured I
would stay with the version they supply with the distro. I will open a
case with them. It was worth a shot.

Maybe something that might help you.  
When booting, try to escape to EFI shell, cd to directory EFI/BOOT on
your ISO and launch BOOTX64.efi manually.

@gozora

I did try that. It prodices this output when executed:

**Failed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - Not Found  
Failed to load image \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi: Not Found  
start\_image() returned Not Found**

I am not very familiar with UEFI from this perspective. I ran the
mkresuce with debugging. I noticed that shim.efi was copied to
BOOTX64.efi. That seemed strange to me, but when you don't know what
your looking for it's all pretty strange. ;)

@gozora

I am going to go ahead and try the latest rear. There are a few things
that do not seem correct. I noticed that the grub.cfg that is generated
is not using linuxefi, nor initrdefi. That does not look correct.

I just made a build of the latest git. It failed creating the backup.
Which is fine at this point. I did notice that the verbosity is much
better in the latest release. I was able to see the efi file that was
going to be copied, and it wasn't the shim.efi. I beleive the correct
file is /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi. I am going to edit the file
/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/25\_populate\_efibootimg.sh and
see what happens now.

If you don't mind, I would like to use this issue to keep track of my
progress. Maybe it will help someone else. If not, please let me know. I
will close the issue and track it under my repo.

@carragom take a look on
[defaul.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf)
and search for UEFI\_BOOTLOADER. If you set this variable to whatever
\*.efi booloader you are using, it should disable guess work ReaR is
doing to find right files to copy.

Ah, that makes sense. I will do that. Thanks.

@gozora

That resolved my issue. Now I just don't understand the menu entries for
"secure boot" vs "no secure boot". The "secure boot" entry uses linuxefi
and initrdefi, but the "no secure boot entry" uses just linux and
initrd. I don't think that matters, why should both be using the \*efi
commands.

Thanks for your assistance.

That menu entries exists for compatibily reasons.  
You would not believe how variable can UEFI boot be.  
To put it simple, if one of the entries doesnt work you can try anther
one ;-).
