1.  was the USB disk formatted with `rear format /dev/sda` ?
2.  Does user `root` has write permissions on the NFS mounted
    filesystem? Test it out manually.

Re-tested,

1.  rear format /dev/sda
2.  root is allow to create directory and files on NFS export.

Rescue and Backup works if OUTPUT=ISO.

Maybe ? should be how to create a bootable USB from the ISO image on
the  
NFS Storage point?

thank You,

Thank you for your help. I was able to create a bootable USB from the
ISO  
image. This  
method works better for our environment.

dd if=backup.iso of=/dev/sdb
