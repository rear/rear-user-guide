##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **High**

-   How was this pull request tested?

Tested on x86\_64 with xorrisofs (no change) and mkisofs:

-   no change when backup is not embedded
-   **udf** included + mkisofs option when backup is embedded

<!-- -->

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

When using **BACKUP\_URL=iso:///backup** and ISO generator is
**mkisofs** or **genisoimage**, include the **udf** module and enable
creating an hybrid **iso9660/udf** DVD.  
This is necessary if the backup archive is &gt;= 4GiB, otherwise the
following error occurs:

    File ./backup/backup.tar.gz is larger than 4GiB-1.
    -allow-limited-size was not specified. There is no way do represent this file size. Aborting.

*xorrisoifs* doesn't require this.

@jsmeix Indeed, the issue will be solve with this PR.

@rmetrich  
thank you for this enhancement!

From my point of view it is no bug because it errors out  
i.e. the missing functionality is not silently ignored  
and the user need to find out later the hardw ay that  
his ISO is actually useless.

I think your point in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1992\#issue-235722758](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1992#issue-235722758)  
`no change when backup is not embedded`  
is not correct according to how I understand your code in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/728f04cec0767e9f948c14ba8c0cf5a650f452d4/usr/share/rear/prep/ISO/GNU/Linux/320\_verify\_mkisofs.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/728f04cec0767e9f948c14ba8c0cf5a650f452d4/usr/share/rear/prep/ISO/GNU/Linux/320_verify_mkisofs.sh)

<pre>
# We also include 'udf' module which is required if backup archive is >= 4GiB
# and mkisofs/genisoimage is used.
if $ISO_MKISOFS_BIN --help 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -qw -- -allow-limited-size ; then
    MODULES+=( udf )
    ISO_MKISOFS_OPTS+=" -allow-limited-size"
fi
</pre>

because that adds the `udf` kernel module always when the  
ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN help output contains `-allow-limited-size`  
which is perfectly o.k. for me, cf.

It's only when sourced by "ISO" method

I meant in case of OUTPUT=ISO the `udf` kernel module is always added  
when the ISO\_MKISOFS\_BIN help output contains `-allow-limited-size`  
i.e. also when the ISO is less than 4 GiB - but that is perfectly o.k.

@rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it tomorrow.

oh yes, but there is no way to know if mkisofs would fail and rescue iso
has already be prepared at the time of the backup creation.  
So ISO =&gt; udf

@rmetrich  
only a side note regarding having the needed things in the recovery
system  
to use ISOs from within the recovery system see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1202)  
for an example how I was hit by missing "usually expected stuff"  
in the currently rather minimal recovery system.

See also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1860](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1860)  
how the recovery system can become a dead end for the user  
when not all kernel modules had been included.

Perhaps for ReaR 3.0 we should set in default.conf

MODULES=( 'all_modules' )
