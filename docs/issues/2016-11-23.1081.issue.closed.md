With something like ISO\_MAX\_SIZE=1000  
during "rear recover" fails because in  
restore/NETFS/default/40\_restore\_backup.sh

<pre>
  label=$(blkid /dev/${dev} | awk 'BEGIN{FS="[=\"]"} {print $3}')
  if [[ $label = $vol_name ]]; then
</pre>

does not work - at least it does not work on SLE12.

The following simpler code does work (at least for me):

<pre>
  if blkid /dev/${dev} | grep -q "$vol_name" ; then
</pre>

I guess the output format of 'blkid' has recently changed  
(on SLE12 /usr/sbin/blkid belongs to the util-linux-2.28-40 RPM)  
or the output format of 'blkid' is different on SLE12  
compared to other Linux distributions.

I assume my simpler code will work generically  
on all Linux distributions.

With a sufficiently meaningful/unique ISO\_VOLID  
(default.conf has ISO\_VOLID="RELAXRECOVER")  
vol\_name becomes values like  
RELAXRECOVER\_01 RELAXRECOVER\_02 ...  
for which my simple "grep $vol\_name" test should be  
sufficiently fail-safe (i.e. no accidental false-positive match).

In the rear recovery system based on SLE12  
with some mounted CDs (actually virtual CDs  
on a KVM/QEMU virtual machine i.e. using ISOs)  
I get this results:

<pre>
RESCUE d25:~ # blkid
/dev/sr0: UUID="2016-11-23-15-12-54-00" LABEL="RELAXRECOVER" TYPE="iso9660"
/dev/sr1: UUID="2016-11-23-15-12-52-00" LABEL="RELAXRECOVER_03" TYPE="iso9660"
/dev/sr2: UUID="2016-11-23-15-12-49-00" LABEL="RELAXRECOVER_02" TYPE="iso9660"

RESCUE d25:~ # for dev in sr0 sr1 sr2 ; do blkid /dev/${dev} | awk 'BEGIN{FS="[=\"]"} {print $3}' ; done
2016-11-23-15-12-54-00

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1081](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1081)  
merged, I consider the issue to be fixed  
(i.e. I do not expect regressions on non-SLE12 systems  
because I assume my simplified blkid test also works  
on non-SLE12 systems).

Puuhh!  
I feared my simple "grep $vol\_name" test  
is not sufficiently fail-safe because a plain  
"grep RELAXRECOVER" would also match  
for RELAXRECOVER\_01 RELAXRECOVER\_02 ...  
but fortunately the blikid test does not happen  
for the initial ISO that is labeled plain RELAXRECOVER.  
The blikid test does only happen for the additional ISOs  
that are labeled RELAXRECOVER\_01 RELAXRECOVER\_02 ...  
cf. this excerpt from my "rear -d -D recover" log  
in the recovered system:

<pre>
e205:~ # grep 'grep -q RELAXRECOVER' /var/log/rear/recover/rear-d25.log | sort -u
++ grep -q RELAXRECOVER_01
++ grep -q RELAXRECOVER_02
++ grep -q RELAXRECOVER_03
</pre>
