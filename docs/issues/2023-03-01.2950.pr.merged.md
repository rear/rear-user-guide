Tooling to quickly run commands or ReaR via Docker in all "officially
supported" Linux distros and fixes for package dependencies

@rear/contributors happy to hear your thoughts on how to make
`tools/run-in-docker` even more useful for you.

Quick intro:

1.  run `tools/run-in-docker -- --patch` to prepare the Docker images
    for ReaR
2.  run `tools/run-in-docker --` to check Bash version
3.  run `tools/run-in-docker -- usr/sbin/rear dump` to check ReaR on all
    distros

Use `run-in-docker -a amd64 --` to choose architecture different from
your host (e.g. for working on M1 Mac)

Use `run-in-docker suse --` to limit to matching subset of Docker images
- or specify completely different Docker image

WIP, currently works for Ubuntu, Debian and SUSE

@jsmeix I couldn't find a working Docker image of SLES12 with repos that
work for software installation so I used Leap 42 that seems to be
similar (e.g. using `asciidoc` instead of `asciidoctor`)

@schlomo  
regarding a SLES12 Docker image with repos for software installation:

It was a rather long time ago (I guess about two years ago)  
when I had worked a bit with Docker only to try out something.  
At that time I used only SLE15 and openSUSE Leap 15.1 and 15.2.  
Because all those stuff is currently continuously developing  
I cannot provide you right now what works for SLE12.  
I will try to play around with it as time permits.  
Feel free to skip SLE12 - at least for now.

Perhaps SUSE's "Container Guide" may help you:  
[https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/pdf/SLES-container\_color\_en.pdf\#book-sles-docker](https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/pdf/SLES-container_color_en.pdf#book-sles-docker)

@jsmeix do you think that Leap 42 is sufficiently similar to SLES12 to
allow using it for testing, or is it too far away and there is no value
in testing something on Leap 42?

The problem seems to be the lack of publicly available SLES12 repos

I can use a public accessible SLE12-SP5 image repository  
but there are no RPM package repopsitories defined in it  
and what is installed by default is too minimal:

    # docker run -it --name testing registry.suse.com/suse/sles12sp5:latest /bin/bash

Now I found my (SUSE internal) documentation from the time  
when I had worked a bit with Docker to try out something.  
It contains (excerpt):

    I did this very first proof of concept test on Leap 15.2
    because for SLE15 there are no public accessible
    online software repositories which would make it
    needlessly hard ...
    ... a ... Docker container is run that is based
    on a Leap 15.2 base container image
    ...
    The following Dockerfile
    ...
    FROM registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/leap
    MAINTAINER jsmeix
    ADD etc/zypp/* /etc/zypp/
    RUN zypper -v refs && zypper -v refresh
    # in particular with online repositories it seems reasonable
    # to first update the basic system to an up-to-date state
    # before installing newer packages into it:
    RUN zypper -v --non-interactive up
    # netcat and less are nice to have when running bash inside the container:
    RUN zypper -v --non-interactive in netcat less
    ...

I also got stuck at the same problem  
which I avoided by using Leap.

So I suggest to use Leap instead of SLE  
to avoid issues with SLE restrictions  
e.g. like

    # docker run -it --name testing2 registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/leap:latest /bin/bash
    ...

    22f4fd0505a6:/ # zypper lr -E
    Repository priorities are without effect.
    All enabled repositories share the same priority.

    repo-oss              | Main Repository
    repo-sle-update       | Update repository with updates from SUSE Linux Enterprise 15
    repo-update           | Main Update Repository
    repo-update-non-oss   | Update Repository (Non-Oss)

    22f4fd0505a6:/ # zypper refs && zypper -v refresh
    ...

    22f4fd0505a6:/ # zypper --non-interactive up
    ...

    22f4fd0505a6:/ # type -a bc
    bash: type: bc: not found

    ...

    22f4fd0505a6:/ # type -a bc
    bc is /usr/bin/bc

Regarding SLE12 vs. Leap 42:

Because Leap 42.1 is based on SLE12-SP1  
it is perfectly OK to use Leap &gt;= 42.1  
as a substitute for SLE12.

On  
[https://registry.opensuse.org/cgi-bin/cooverview](https://registry.opensuse.org/cgi-bin/cooverview)  
I found only 42 and 42.3 (under "leap")

I get:

@rear/contributors I'd like to merge this branch within the next couple
of days. Currently Debian doesn't work because of some strange problem
with their repos, but I consider this a minor problem as long as Ubuntu
does work.

I heavily reworked the `Makefile` here to support building without
writing so much to the source tree and to base all the distro builds off
the generated `dist` archive.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2950/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2950/files)  
shows several "No newline at end of file" marks.  
I didn't check if this is actually true or only false alarm.

I only found one worth fixing and fixed that in \#2965.

FYI, I use `pcregrep -LMr '\n\Z' .` to find problematic files.
