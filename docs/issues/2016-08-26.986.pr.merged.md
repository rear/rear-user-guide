@stermeau  
could you please provide sufficiently explanatory comments  
directly in the code so that others who may at any time later  
have to maintain that code can understand why that code is  
as it is, cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

FYI:  
Fortunately for me personally it is no issue how code  
for third-party backup tools is because I do not have  
such tools so that I will never ever personally care about  
that code (cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/823)).  
But probably other users who use such tools may appreciate it  
when they can maintain the existing code properly if needed.

@jsmeix I have added some comments. Is it what you had in mind?

@stermeau  
many thanks for your added comments in the code.  
At least for me it makes the code much easier to understand!
