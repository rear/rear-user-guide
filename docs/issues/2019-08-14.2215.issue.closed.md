-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Currently, temporarily mounted external USB drives and HDDs will be
detected as changes by checklayout, and incorporated into the disk
layout made by mkrescue. Apparently this is by design according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2207](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2207).

This is a problem because the recovery media created will be
unpredictable and depend on what temporary devices may be present at the
moment mkrescue is run. Their inclusion in mkrescue's disk layout will
be an unpleasant surprise at recovery and far from "relaxing."

Is it currently possible to exclude such devices that are not part of
the permanent system? For example, something like Borg's
`--one-file-system` or ReaR's `EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS` for backups?

@adatum  
I have no idea how to reliably and in a fail-safe way distinguish in
an  
automated way what is temporarily mounted from what is permanantly  
mounted and how to distinguish an external disk from a built-in disk.

I don't know what "temporarily mounted" should mean from a  
computer's internal point of view (in contrast to the user who knows
it).

I know about server hardware that has a USB disk built in on the
motherboard  
(which can even get into one's way when that device suddenly becomes
/dev/sda  
and you cannot just unplug that unwanted device because it is built-in).

Because I am currently and for some more weeks not in the office  
I cannot try out and test how current ReaR actually behaves but  
what you describe has never been an issue before (as far as I can  
remember) so that I think how current ReaR behaves is o.k. for  
how it was and is used by our current users.

As far as I see from plain looking at the code in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/checklayout-workflow.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/lib/checklayout-workflow.sh)  
and in particular in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500\_compare\_layout.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/compare/default/500_compare_layout.sh)  
what happens is that a new temporary disklayout.conf file is created  
where its active (i.e. non-commented) entries are compared with  
those of the last stored "official" disklayout.conf file.

So all the usual ways how to exclude disk layout components  
should work to avoid that unwanted mounted stuff gets included  
in disklayout.conf.

See in particular the section "Including/Excluding components" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

@jsmeix

Thank you so much for taking the time to write such detailed
explanations.

I can appreciate that it is difficult, maybe even impossible, to tell
programmatically what the user considers temporary or undesirable for
inclusion in the disklayout.conf.

Thanks for the links. The section on "Manual Excludes" is almost
perfectly what I was asking about, specifically something like:

`EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" "fs:/run/media" )`

The problem is that it seems to exclude only exact paths (eg.
`fs:/run/media/[USER]/[DISK_LABEL]`), and not everything inside
`/run/media`. It also does not expand globs like `fs:/run/media/*`.

Maybe I'm missing something?

Offhandedly I think something like wildcards to exclude things  
is currently not supported by ReaR.

But all config files (in particular etc/rear/local.conf) are sourced by
the  
usr/sbin/rear main script which means the config files are read and  
executed as all the other ReaR scripts so that you can do any bash  
programming you like also in ReaR config files.  
In particular you could do whathever works for your particular use
case  
to determine automatically the currently right values for what you
need  
to exclude.  
Simply put: Replace the hardcoded
'fs:/run/media/some\_user/some\_disk\_label'  
value with code that autodetects it at runtime.

Thanks for the reminder. That the config files are sourced as bash
scripts gives a lot of flexibility.

I am quite wary of adding my own code due to code
quality/maintainability and possible side effects. Nevertheless, this
seems to give me the behavior I want:

    EXCLUDE_RECREATE=( "${EXCLUDE_RECREATE[@]}" $( EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS="/run/media|/mnt"; if [ -n "$EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS" ]; then grep -Eo "(^|\s)($EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS)\S*" /proc/mounts | sed -r 's/\s(.*)/ fs:\1 /' | tr -d '\n'; fi ) )

Breaking it down:

-   `EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS`

    -   Seems to be a unique variable name (searched the GitHub repo for
        this string).
    -   The base mount points to exclude must all be included in one set
        of quotes, with no spaces, and separated by `|`.
    -   Right now I made everything inline, but for clarity this
        variable should probably be placed outside on a line of its own.

-   `if [ -n "$EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS" ]`

    -   Run the logic only if the exclusion string is not empty.

-   `grep -Eo "(^|\s)($EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS)\S*" /proc/mounts`

    -   Look at `/proc/mounts` for the definitive list of mounts.
    -   Use extended regular expressions `-E` to support parentheses.
    -   `-o`: output only the matched portion of the string instead of
        the entire line.
    -   `($EXCLUDE_RECREATE_MOUNTPOINTS)\S*`: match from the mount
        prefix until a whitespace character to capture all full paths.
    -   `(^|\s)`: start matching from whitespace as our starting
        delimiter (to make sure the exclusion prefix is the base and not
        a subdirectory, i.e. avoid capturing `/somedirectory/prefix`),
        or start of the line (to catch potential matches at the very
        beginning of the line/file without preceding whitespace).

-   `sed -r 's/\s(.*)/ fs:\1 /'`

    -   Use `sed` to add the surrounding text necessary for
        `EXCLUDE_RECREATE`
    -   `\s(.*)`: capture everything except the initial whitespace.
        Could this be a problem if the match was at the start of the
        line with no preceding whitespace? This is unlikely for this
        purpose since the desired match is always on the second column
        of `/proc/mounts`, but it would be nice to have robust logic
        nonetheless.
    -   `/ fs:\1 /`: prepend `fs:` and add a space before and after the
        mount point. Not sure if quotes are also needed, but it seems to
        work as is.

-   `tr -d '\n'`: delete newlines to have everything on one line to be
    included in the `EXCLUDE_RECREATE` array.

Any comments about potential issues or corrections are appreciated.

As discovered in \#2229, the `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH` variable addresses the
request in this issue. It excludes not just exact paths but everything
below the specified paths as well.

However, wildcards still seem not to be supported. The solution in the
previous post does exclude partial matches for directories. i.e.
specifying `/dir` will exclude `/dir1`, `/dir2`, etc.

@adatum  
thanks to mention `AUTOEXCLUDE_PATH`.  
Right now I did
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2239](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2239)

In general see also  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229\#issuecomment-531264805](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2229#issuecomment-531264805)

Currently - as far as I see - there is no simple clear and consistently
working way  
how the user could specify what disk layout components he wants to get
recreated  
and what mountpoints or directories he wants to get included in the
backup, cf.

I think with
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2239](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2239)
merged  
this issue is fixed to some acceptable extent so that I can close this
issue  
and we still have

open  
for the more general case.
