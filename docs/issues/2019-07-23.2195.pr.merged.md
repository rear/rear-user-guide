As it is, rear does not detect the kernel on ppc64el as it looks for  
something like vmlinuz whether vmlinux is used on that arch.

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): No issue opened, just I just fixed
    it

-   How was this pull request tested? I tested it on a Debian VM with
    rear mkbackup and recover afterwards.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request: I added case
    for the specific ppc64el kernel naming in /boot

Note : Debian/Ubuntu/Opensuse use vmlinux and fedora uses vmlinuz

@frediz and @schabrolles  
could you explain to me what the difference is between  
ppc65le which I know as PPC 64-bit little endian and  
ppc64el which I do not know and cannot find at  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ppc64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ppc64)

@frediz  
I think this pull request is not actually specific for an architecture  
but it seems it is a generic enhancement to also autodetect an
uncompressed kernel?

@jsmeix ... there is no difference. Both of them are pointing to the
same **PowerPC 64bit Little Endian** architecture....  
debian and ubuntu call it **ppc64el** instead og **ppc64le** ... it
seems to be because of a "bad" geek joke ... "le" translated in Little
Endian =&gt; "el" .... (don't know if it is true... but it really
generates a lot of mess)
