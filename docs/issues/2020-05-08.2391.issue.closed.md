The code for "Installing GRUB2 as recovery system UEFI bootloader"  
should be cleaned up and improved to be more fail-safe and to  
provide final power to ther user (i.e. less hardcoded values).

-   Firmware: UEFI

-   Description of the issue:

See
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388)

    "rear mkrecue" does not error out when
    required GRUB2 modules are missing

therein see in particular

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388\#issuecomment-625167827](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388#issuecomment-625167827)  
that reads (excerpt):

    In general we must much better care about
    possible errors in ReaR and error out early
    with a reasonable error message for the user
    during "rear mkbackup/mkrescue" when things
    cannot work later than to blindly proceed and
    let the user find out later when it is too late
    that things fail when booting the recovery system
    or during "rear recover".

    So for each GRUB2 module that will be
    enforced loaded we must first and foremost
    at least check during "rear mkrescue"
    that the GRUB2 module is actually there
    and made available for the GRUB2 bootloader
    on the ReaR recovery system.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388\#issuecomment-625180406](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2388#issuecomment-625180406)

    Our usual sufficiently clean way in ReaR would be
    to have the list of enforced loaded GRUB2 modules
    in a user config variable which we have already
    as GRUB2_MODULES_LOAD.

    So instead of hardcoded values in the scripts
    we have to set the default list of enforced loaded
    GRUB2 modules in default.conf so the user
    knows about it and can adapt it if needed.

    We have way too many hardcoded values
    in our scripts that lead to a
    "works magically right in most cases"
    behaviour which leads to weird errors
    that our users do not understand which
    further leads to issue reports here
    that are hard to debug for us
