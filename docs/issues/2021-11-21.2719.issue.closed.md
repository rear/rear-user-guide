    # This file etc/rear/local.conf is intended for the user's
    # manual configuration of Relax-and-Recover (ReaR).
    # For configuration through packages and other automated means
    # we recommend a separated file named site.conf next to this file
    # and leave local.conf as is (ReaR upstream will never ship a site.conf).
    # The default OUTPUT=ISO creates the ReaR rescue medium as ISO image.
    # You need to specify your particular backup and restore method for your data
    # as the default BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE does not really do that (see "man rear").
    # Configuration variables are documented in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf
    # and the examples in /usr/share/rear/conf/examples/ can be used as templates.
    # ReaR reads the configuration files via the bash builtin command 'source'
    # so bash syntax like VARIABLE="value" (no spaces at '=') is mandatory.
    # Because 'source' executes the content as bash scripts you can run commands
    # within your configuration files, in particular commands to set different
    # configuration values depending on certain conditions as you need like
    # CONDITION_COMMAND && VARIABLE="special_value" || VARIABLE="usual_value"
    # but that means CONDITION_COMMAND gets always executed when 'rear' is run
    # so ensure nothing can go wrong if you run commands in configuration files.

> rear-localhost.iso: does not contain a recognized partition table

Why should the ISO contain a partition table? I believe that only on
PowerPC the CD-ROMs are partitioned.

@bobOnGitHub What would You like to achieve with Your mentioned ReaR
config? What is the struggle You determine? It would be great You
provide some more details on this issue.

Ok,

In recent years any bootable image tagged as iso I've downloaded
contained partitions and could simply be  
dd'd to a usb stick - no flapping around with bootable-usb-maker tools,
endless commandline typing or burning cds/dvds.

    Rocky-8.5-x86_64-dvd1.iso1 : start=           0, size=    20930560, type=0, bootable
    Rocky-8.5-x86_64-dvd1.iso2 : start=       23944, size=       19616, type=ef

In fact, it is so long since I burned an iso image to a physical cd/dvd
that I had forgotten all about traditional iso formats and growisofs.
Who does that any more ? There is no reason to: keep an image like the
ones above with/in the backup 'till you need it, extract it when/if you
do, dd it to a usb stick or copy it to your vm storage and away you go.
I don't believe I've bought DVD RWs in over 10 years.

In any case thanks for the heads up @pcahyna - that explains that
problem and I can report the iso image does work when growisofs'd to a
physical disk or loaded into a vm as a cdrom... though I haven't managed
to recreate my disk/system yet.

I will close the issue - it was a user misunderstanding. You might want
to ammend the documentation to point out the ISO is not dd-able to a usb
as people might expect today - admittedly few Linux admins are likely to
get caught out there but desktop end-users trying to escape Windows
probably will.

Thanks @hpannenb, as you can see this particular issue is resolved/was a
misunderstanding on my part. I'm not sure at this point ReaR is right
for me - I'm still looking at it though I may have a simpler and more
sustainable/maintainable solution for my own particular circumstances.

Thanks for the explanation. There is a separate `OUTPUT=RAWDISK` method
that produces disk images to dd to USB flash drives and other disk-like
devices, although I have never used it. There is also `OUTPUT=USB`,
which saves the backup to a mounted USB drive and thus avoids producing
an image file.  
As you can see, it is not a real bug, but to unify RAWDISK and ISO
methods in order to produce images that can be used both for regular
disks and DVDs is a valid feature to ask for (although I admit it would
not be on top of my personal priority list right now).

Cheers, I did try to dd the USB output to a usb stick which didn't work
either - I can't recall exactly what I did but it wasn't to a mounted
drive so that explains that (and in retrospect I should have picked that
up from the man pages). Useful to know.

As to the RAWDISK option, it didn't work for me but could be any number
of reasons.

I tried :

    [root@localhost rear]# cat local.conf
    OUTPUT=RAWDISK
    BACKUP=REQUESTRESTORE
    OUTPUT_URL=file:///var/lib/rear/output/

with ` rear -v mkrescue`

note if you do not specify the OUTPUT\_URL it does not default as per
the man pages. What  
happens (using -v) is that you are told about the file but not where it
is. Checking the logs you find it was written  
to a temp dir ... where it no longer exists. In any case there is no
feedback to the user that anything is amiss other than the absence of
the expected file so you might want to look at that.

Anyway, having specified the OUTPUT\_URL and then followed the
subsequent README advice to the letter and rebooting the PC, selecting
the USB device (a usb stick) I got a "Selected boot device failed. Press
any key to reboot the sytem" message. Who knows / might have been a
fluke bad write etc. but it dawned on me about then how the ISO option
was supposed to work and I went back to check that and got something
running to see how the next stages worked..

(Also the resulting RAWDISK USB is labelled with a space in the name
"RESCUE SYS" which is not ideal.)

Using the ISO/DVD option:  
note that when it came to setting up LUKS it asked for a passphrase and
then appeared to hang - I killed it on a vm but later just happened to
leave it run on the PC thinking it'd still be blinking when I got back
(from getting a coffee) but it had finally moved on and was asking for
the passphrase again - don't think it was my disks as the vm and bare
metal were different disks and all the s.m.a.r.t. info says they're
good. It did set up the disk layout, though as I say, I haven't got a
system recreated yet - I won't bore you with the details at this point /
too many variables there to be useful or worth thinking about.

Anyway, I'm "researching" at the moment so I'm off on another tangent
now as rsync looks a better option overall than Duplicity - which is
what I was looking at.

It seems in some cases it even works to some limited extent  
to dump the OUTPUT=ISO image onto a (USB) disk, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2712](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2712)  
that reads (excerpts)

    OUTPUT=ISO
    ...
    PC ... x86_64 ... UEFI
    ...
    * Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):
      ISO image is created. I write it a USB stick with dd if=<image_file> of=/dev/sdb
      ...
      The image gets written to the USB drive and the USB drive is bootable,
      but it just boots to a prompt. I can login as root without a password and then
      manually start a restore but I've always seen a menu come up that shows
      the backups and the option for automated (well sort of) restore.

@bobOnGitHub Using ReaR's "default" configuration please bare in mind it
just creates a bootable rescue image (only) from the existing system. So
to recover a system entirely You need to configure a backup method (e.g.
NETFS) as well.

Unfortunately there is no default configuration described yet but please
consider taking a look at
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc)
.

I remember using ReaR for the first time was not really
"out-of-the-box"-ish.

From the config I am sometimes using:

    export TMPDIR="/var/tmp/"

    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=iso://backup

    OUTPUT=ISO
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    ISO_MAX_SIZE=4500

This will create a ISO file(s) (max. 4.5 GB) including the
(tar-ed)backup of the entire system including the bootable recovery
environment. The resulting file(s) can be found under
`/var/lib/rear/output/`.

ReaR never was and is not "out-of-the-box"-ish and it is not meant to be
so  
in foreseeable future with the manpower we currently have at ReaR
upstream and  
according to what those who pay for ReaR (enterprise users) would like
to pay for.

@bobOnGitHub Valid point and not complicated to implement according
[https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid)
and updating the script
`usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/820_create_iso_image.sh` - please
help us with improving our product by proving a pull request (PR). Of
course, make sure it works on all supported Linux Operating Systems.
Thanks
