======================================================================================================

As discussed in rear-users at:
[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg\_id=28515321](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=28515321)

it would be nice if the network configuration can be instructed at
boot-time.

Options could be to:

-   skip network configuration
-   use DHCP
-   use the original configuration.

There's also the possibility:

-   to force network configurations on different hardware (addresses)
-   to detect if any of the given network configurations in fact work on
    a certain interface (e.g. do an arping to the gateway)
-   to expect the same hardware to be available

As much as possible should work out of the box...

Is there any boot command line syntax we should mimic? E.g. from
anaconda or other OS installers?

The "dhcp" and "noip" are already in-place. Partial the code for this is
already written and lives at  
/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/20-check-boot-options.sh

However, the script to actually activate the device with this IP address
has not yet be written.  
Currently, debugging Fedora 17 lvm locking issues ...

The TODO file contained the following related information:

Wait for feedback
-----------------

-   Write network migration code for all other distributions
    -   some work has been done in the meantime, but not sure if it is  
        sufficient enough to cover all
    -   waiting on customer feedback
-   Support dhcp for network migration
    -   has been added in 1.9.0
    -   waiting on customer feedback

Implementation needs to address **bonding (LACP)** and **vlan tagging**
support !

Obviously if it detects known MAC addresses it can assume that it is a
restore to the same system and can continue with configuring the network
setup exactly as it was. But in case this is not the case, there are a
few things it could do (which we can do identically for VLAN tagging).
After configuring an interface it could test whether the configuration
in fact works (e.g. arping the gateway) if that does not work we have to
ask the user to what interface to map.

Obviously with LACP this is not going to be easy, since doing a
bruteforce on every combination of interfaces might be problematic (but
we could opt to only test/run with a single interface for LACP. But
during recovery we don't need HA.

What is needed is similar to what we implemented for the storage layout,
i.e. writing out an abstraction of the configuration that is active on
the system and then restoring the configuration from that abstract
network configuration file. And that network configuration file should
have dependencies between "interfaces" as well as support for bonding
(LACP or other), VLAN tagging and possible other stuff...

VLAN tagging has been added in the meantime. The abstraction layer of
network interfaces: I'm not convinced it is worth the time spending on
it as from experience moving to another HW type will cause many issues
anyway...  
Changing milestone move from 1.17 to future...

will close this one and if required (on demand) a new issue can be
openend
