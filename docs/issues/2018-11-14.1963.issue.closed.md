-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"):  
    Current GitHub master code

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

Excerpt from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892\#issuecomment-438585716](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/892#issuecomment-438585716)

We need to improve that specific scripts which result  
that specific programs will be called in the recovery system  
must add those programs to REQUIRED\_PROGS.

For example I have an ext4 root filesystem and did

<pre>
# mv /usr/sbin/mkfs /usr/sbin/mkfs.away
# mv /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4 /usr/sbin/mkfs.ext4.away
</pre>

But "rear -D mkrescue" did not error out (nor show any kind of
message)  
regardless that without mkfs and/or mkfs.ext4 in the recovery system  
the ext4 root filesystem cannot be recreated:

<pre>
# find /tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs | grep mkfs

/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.ext2
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.jfs
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.ext3
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.reiserfs
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.vfat
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.btrfs
/tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/bin/mkfs.xfs

# grep ext4 /tmp/rear.2VRqe2odrvdlsPY/rootfs/.../disklayout.conf

fs /dev/sda2 / ext4 uuid=aed8d81b-29bf-405e-9049-29a6c0e702d3 ...
</pre>

Ironically several useless mkfs.\* tools are in the recovery system
here  
except those that are actually required (mkfs and perhaps also
mkfs.ext4).

-   Workaround, if any:

Usually things work by chance because those tools are in PROGS  
and normally exist on the original system so that they get copied  
into the recovery system but there is nothing in ReaR to ensure that.

Accordingly the usual "workaround" is to have a system where  
"all the usual stuff" is installed.

But on a "production" system (server or desktop does not matter  
with "production" I mean a system that is in a "ready to use" state)  
there is no need to have low-level tools like mkfs\* installed.

Strictly speaking tools like parted and mkfs\* are only needed  
within the installation system that installs the target system  
but when the installation was completed no such tools are  
needed on the "ready to use" (target) system.

It is a different issue that ReaR cannot be used on systems  
where tools like parted and mkfs\* are not installed,  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/755)

This issue here is that ReaR does not error out when it is used  
on systems where mandatory tools for recreation are not installed.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1964](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1964)
merged  
this issue should be at least initially sufficiently fixed.

The current main intent is to let "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" error out  
when a specific required program to recreate the disk layout  
is not included in the recovery system.

To let "rear mkrescue/mkbackup" error out in such cases it should be  
(hopefully) reasonably sufficient to only specify primarily needed  
programs to recreate the disk layout but not whatever other files  
like config files or helper scripts and so on because the assumption
is  
that when a primarily needed program is installed on the original
system  
all its associated stuff is also installed (e.g. via RPM package
dependencies).  
I.e. the assumption is the installation of the original system is
consistent  
(ReaR won't work when the original system is already broken).

Details:

The following specific required programs are added to REQUIRED\_PROGS  
depending on the actually used component keywords in disklayout.conf
cf.  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rear/rear/master/doc/user-guide/06-layout-configuration.adoc)

The component keywords disk or part  
require parted and partprobe  
(via 200\_partition\_layout.sh)

The component keyword raid  
requires mdadm  
(via 210\_raid\_layout.sh)

The component keywords lvmdev or lvmgrp or lvmvol  
require lvm  
(via 220\_lvm\_layout.sh)

The component keyword fs  
requires mkfs  
and additionally depending on the used filesystem  
mkfs.ext2 mkfs.ext3 mkfs.ext4 plus mke2fs and tune2fs or tune4fs  
mkfs.vfat  
mkfs.xfs plus xfs\_admin  
mkfs.reiserfs plus reiserfstune  
mkfs.btrfs plus btrfs  
(via 230\_filesystem\_layout.sh)

The component keyword swap  
requires mkswap  
(via 240\_swaps\_layout.sh)

The component keyword drbd  
requires drbdadm  
(via 250\_drbd\_layout.sh)

The component keyword crypt  
requires cryptsetup  
(via 260\_crypt\_layout.sh)

The component keywords logicaldrive or smartarray  
require hpacucli or hpssacli or ssacli  
(via 270\_hpraid\_layout.sh)

The component keyword multipath  
requires multipath  
(via 280\_multipath\_layout.sh)
