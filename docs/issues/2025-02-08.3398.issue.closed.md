### Requesting support or just a question

question

### Platform

Linux x64

### Output

### Additional information

I am new to rear ,  
I would like to backup my entire linux mint system to a 12TB external
drive so I can reinstall the system or install the system on a new
computer, and just log in and go.

The 12TB external drive has a lot of data already on it that I want to
keep.  
I read comments on some sites that my external drive will be formatted
and I will lose my data,  
while other sites say I can choose to write an ISO to a Directory on my
external disk without my losing existing data.

I thought a config containing the below would work, but am afraid to try
it unless someone at rear can assure me the program will not delete my
existing files..or format my disk .... etc..

I created the config below from my understanding of the information I
have read.. should it work ??

Do I need to add anything else to it ??

OUTPUT=ISO  
OUTPUT\_URL=file:///mnt/12TB\_ext/rear/output/  
BACKUP=NETFS  
BACKUP\_URL=file:///mnt/12TB\_ext/rear/iso/

Thank you,  
Anne

ReaR is a disaster recovery tool that  
complements backup and restore of files  
but ReaR is neither a backup software  
nor a backup management software  
and it is not meant to be one.

ReaR is a system administrator tool and framework  
to create a bootable disaster recovery system image  
for bare metal disaster recovery with data backup  
restore on physical or virtual replacement hardware.

For bare metal disaster recovery the ReaR recovery system  
is booted on pristine replacement hardware.  
On replacement hardware first the storage setup/layout is  
recreated (disk partitioning, filesystems, mount points),  
then a backup restore program is called to restore the  
data (system files) into the recreated storage, and  
finally a boot loader is installed.

To use ReaR from an external disk, the ReaR recovery system  
must be bootable from that disk which means that disk must  
be prepared to be UEFI or BIOS bootable which means  
appropriate partitions for booting must be set up  
which means one has to format that disk appropriately.

In theory it could be possible to prepare an already used disk  
so that it is usable for ReaR but I think in practice this  
needs unreasonable trial-and-error efforts compared to using  
"rear format" from scratch with a pristine empty disk.

See our "QUICK START GUIDE" at  
<https://github.com/rear/rear>  
and also on  
<https://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/getting-started>  
for an initial simple way how to do that with OUTPUT=USB.

I recommend to use "rear mkbackup" only with a dedicated  
disk for ReaR. This is what basically all others do so this  
is proven to work reasonably well "out there in the wild".  
If you use a disk where already valuable other data is stored  
(e.g. a disk where already a previous backup is stored)  
something might go terribly wrong when writing a subsequent  
backup there (e.g. via "rear mkbackup") so in the end  
all might be lost on that disk.  
To be reasonably on the safe side you should use at least  
two separated disks for ReaR and use them alternating.

With OUTPUT=ISO you would get a UEFI or BIOS bootable  
ISO image but then you somehow need to dump ("burn") that  
on a disk-like thingy (usually a real or virtual CD/DVD medium)  
to actually boot from the ISO which means the whole medium  
gets overwritten from its very beginning with the ISO image  
so also in this case all existing data on that medium  
will usually be lost.

Regarding re-installing the system on a new computer:

Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed for that.  
When the new computer is not fully compatible it is not  
a re-installation but a migration onto different hardware.  
See the section  
"Fully compatible replacement hardware is needed" in  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery>

In general migrating a system onto different hardware  
(where "hardware" could be also a virtual machine)  
does not "just work", cf. "Inappropriate expectations" at  
<https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery>

In sufficiently simple cases it may "just work" but in general  
do not expect too much built-in intelligence from a program  
(written in plain bash which is not a programming language  
that is primarily meant for artificial intelligence ;-)  
to automatically do the annoying legwork for you.

In general ReaR is first and foremost meant to recreate  
a system as much as possible exactly as it was before.

Additionally ReaR supports to migrate a system  
but here "supports" means that ReaR provides a lot  
that should help you to get such a task done  
but it does not mean that it would "just work" without  
possibly laborious manual settings and adaptions  
with trial and error legwork until you made things work  
for you in your particular case.

I never responded because I was never given an email about your answer.
I DID get the email about closing.... I then came here and read the
information you very quickly posted, thank you for that, but, I never
got the message.... HOWEVER, I want to thank you for the information
that was posted.....
