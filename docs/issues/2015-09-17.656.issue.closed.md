Hi Everyone,

Does anyone know if the hardware HP StorageWorks CN1100E Dual Port
Converged Network Adapter  
is supported in Rear. After booting rear ISO I get the error

SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device  
SIOCGIFMTU: No such device  
SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device  
SIOCGIFMTU: No such device

Then when I ifconfig -a to start building the network to rear -v recover
I see incorrect MAC addresses (from the source server) and not the local
server I'm restoring the image on

The ReaR rescue image should support all the hardware that the original
system supports.

So, does your original system support your network card? Or are you
trying to move to new hardware? In that case you will have to install
the neccessary driver on the original system and recreate the ReaR
rescue image.

Hi schlomo - Thanks for your reply - I managed to get the system up
using the rear iso and completed a rear -v recover. The issue I'm having
now , after I reboot , is that it see's all the old MAC addesses on the
ethernet cards from the source server . When I change to the new MAC
addresses , the OS complains and the interfaces go down , it seems it's
still getting network configurations from the old/source server during
reboot . Have you seen something like this before ?

You will need to provide much more detail for me to say anything. In
general, ReaR patches the udev rules for the network cards and the
network configuration files with the new MAC address. If there is more
than one NIC in your system then ReaR should also ask you which new MAC
to use for which old one. Did this happen?

No - but I think the issue is what you mentioned in the first reply - we
are moving to new hardware so the source/original server probably
doesn't have the drivers for the newer emulex cards

@wiggett I close this issue now since we cannot help you to install the
driver in your source server :-)

If you need more help with this case, just reopen it agains.
