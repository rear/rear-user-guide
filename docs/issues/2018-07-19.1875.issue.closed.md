@langerkunal, could you please tell me exactly how you install "rear".  
I would like to test the same procedure as you on my system to try to
replicate your issue and understand what happens here (as I don't have
any problem on my side with either SLES12sp3 and Ubuntu.)

@langerkunal  
some blind shots in the dark:

What results on your system things like

Could you provide us a complete debug log

@langerkunal  
I think I have something:

In your rear-TestUbuntu.log there are many successful
`mkdir -v -p /tmp/rear.XXX/...` calls  
which shows that root can create local sub-directories inside your /tmp/
directory.

But what fails is
`mkdir -p -v -m0750 /tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/TestUbuntu`  
and in contrast to the other successful `mkdir -v -p /tmp/rear.XXX/...`
calls  
this one does not create a local sub-directory inside your /tmp/
directory  
because at `/tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs` the remote NFS share is mounted  
so that the `/tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/TestUbuntu` sub-directory has to
be  
created on the remote NFS server there in its exported directory and  
with probability one (cf.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost\_surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely)
)  
that fails because you are not root on your remote NFS server,  
more precisely on your remote NFS server you are not a user  
with sufficient permissions to create that directory there.

Excerpts from your rear-TestUbuntu.log that show what I mean:

<pre>

</pre>

The solution is to configure your NFS server appropriately  
so that it allows to create that directory.  
I.e. when you work as root on a NFS client machine  
the NFS server must allow that user to create sub-directories  
on the NFS server below its `.../nimfs/Linux_OS_Backups/` directory.

Cf. the section  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
therein item (1) that has a few hints how one could set up the NFS
server.  
Of course that section is not meant as explanatory description about NFS
server setup.

FYI:

For me things "just work" with that /etc/exports  
on my NFS server (which is openSUSE Leap 42.3):

<pre>
/nfs    *(rw,root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
</pre>

and with that I use in etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://NFS.server.IP.address/nfs
</pre>

The exported '/nfs' directory on my NFS server has those permissions

<pre>
# ls -ld /nfs
drwxrwxrwx ... root root ... /nfs
</pre>

so that with `root_squash` the user:group `nobody:nogroup`  
can create/write files and sub-directories there and  
access files in those sub-directories.

I reproduced it:

With default directory permissions on my NFS server

<pre>
drwxr-xr-x ... root root ... /nfs
</pre>

`rear mkbackup` fails in the same way for me.  
In contrast with sufficiently permissive permissions (as above) it
works.

After giving right permissions on NFS server I was able to successfully
create the backup. Thanks for the help.

thanks for the prompt feedback.

I consider this issue sufficiently analyzed and solved.

@jsmeix perhaps we could add some extra text when writing fails on the
NFS server? Such as "make sure root has write permissions on NFS server
(no\_root\_squash)"

@gdha  
I also had this idea but I think it gets a bit complicated to be
implemented  
because at the place where `mkdir /tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/HOSTNAME`
fails  
it is not clear where that `/tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/HOSTNAME` directory  
actually is (i.e. if it is a local directory or on a remote machine and
in the  
latter case whia what kind of remote connection - NFS is only one
case)  
because mounting the remote NFS share at /tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/  
happens in output/default/100\_mount\_output\_path.sh  
via the `mount_url` function in lib/global-functions.sh  
while 'mkdir /tmp/rear.XXX/outputfs/HOSTNAME\`  
happens in output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh

Perhaps the `mount_url` function is the right central place  
where such tests could be generically added and where a failure of such
a test  
could be even reported with a meaningful error message that depends on
the  
`url_scheme` value so that for each different url\_scheme an appropriate
test  
plus message could be shown.

But it seems the url\_scheme `nfs` is just the `(*)` default case in
`mount_url`  
so that currently there won't be a NFS specific test plus message.

@gdha  
I think it gets overcomplicated to implement such tests in `mount_url`  
because then the tests would need to depend on the workflow:  
For mkrescue, mkbackup, and mkbackuponly write (and read?) permissions
are needed  
while in contrast recover and restoreonly need (only?) read permissions.

@jsmeix good catch !!!!!  
Maybe a simple "touch file" test to validate it is writable could be
enough.

@schabrolles  
I think if we test we should better just try the real thing  
and currently in output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh  
it tries already the real thing via

<pre>
mkdir -p $v -m0750 "${opath}" >&2
StopIfError "Could not mkdir '${opath}'"
</pre>

but that does not make it obvious what the root cause is  
neither for the user nor for us without analyzing the ReaR log.

Accordingly I think what would really help is a more meaningful
message  
but currently I don't see how to implement that with reasonable effort  
because that code is used in too many different cases.

For example how it looks on the terminal  
when I reproduce it how it fails on my system:

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -D mkrescue
...
ERROR: Could not mkdir '/tmp/rear.2uvvEzDMiEq8JGa/outputfs/f144'
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-f144.log for details
</pre>

where the original `mkdir` error message

<pre>
mkdir: cannot create directory '/tmp/rear.2uvvEzDMiEq8JGa/outputfs/f144': Permission denied
</pre>

is hidden from the user in the log file.

If the user could see the original `mkdir` error message on his
terminal  
he would get a hint that points to the root cause `Permission denied`  
but currently I have no good idea how to show the original error
message  
on the terminal only in case of an error.

As a quick test hwo to do that I changed the code in
output/default/200\_make\_prefix\_dir.sh to

<pre>
# create $OUTPUT_PREFIX sub-directory under the mounted network filesystem share
mkdir -p $v -m0750 "$opath" >&2 && return 0

LogPrintError "Could not mkdir '$opath' - some last log file lines:"
# skip 'set -x' lines (i.e. lines that start with one or more '+' characters) and
# skip lines of the 'Log' function (i.e. lines that have a timestamp that contains 'date +%Y-%m-%d')
# so that normally only the normal stdout and stderr messages of the called programs are shown here:
LogUserOutput "$( grep -E -v "^\+|$( date +%Y-%m-%d )" $RUNTIME_LOGFILE | tail -n 10 | sed -e 's/^/  /' )"
Error "Failed to create $OUTPUT_PREFIX under the mounted network filesystem share"
</pre>

Now things look more meaningful to me on the terminal:

<pre>
Could not mkdir '/tmp/rear.1N5Gvjc6ewWUARM/outputfs/f144' - some last log file lines:
  ~/rear.github.master
  mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.1N5Gvjc6ewWUARM/outputfs'

  mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.1N5Gvjc6ewWUARM/tmp/boot'

ERROR: Failed to create f144 under the mounted network filesystem share
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear.github.master/var/log/rear/rear-f144.log for details
</pre>

But it also shows how complicated it could become to implement  
meaningful error output for each particular case in practice...

I will have to meditate on it...

Perhaps the `Error` function could be the right place where  
such more meaningful error output on the user's terminal  
could be implemented in a generic way...

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1877)
merged  
the Error function shows now some of the last log messages  
since the last actual script got sourced that contain in particular  
the normal stdout and stderr messages of the last called programs  
to make the root cause of an error more obvious to the user  
without the need to analyze the log file in any case.
