#### Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Issue Template

Relax-and-Recover: Version 2.6

RHEL 7.9

local.conf:

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT_URL=null
    BACKUP_URL="iso:///backup/"

-   Hardware vendor/product (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or VM (KVM
    guest or PowerVM LPAR):  
    Oracle Virtual Box 6.1

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):  
    Host is Dell Latitude

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I am creating a backup of a machine where the interface names are
configured using the ifcfg-X files which have the old interfaces renamed
using the DEVICE= parameter. (I.E. DEVICE=Internet which renames the
interface name to Internet). I have software running on the build that
look for the interface name so I want the name to remain consistent even
on different hardware.

When I try to recover the image on the new machine that has different
MAC addresses for the network interfaces I get the standard prompt
telling me that the old interface cannot be found and gives me the
option to replace it with one of the newer ones. Instead of completely
replacing the interface which changes the name of the file adds the new
mac and adds the new device(interface) name I need it to only replace
the MAC address in the file and not the file name or device name. I
tried altering the local.conf, altering the kernel cmdline, and changing
some of the parameters in the 55-migrate-network-devices.sh but I am
unable to figure out how to keep the device name from changing after
rear recover is run.

I essentially want to take (Old machine - Old MAC Address / Old
Interface Name) and end up with  
(New machine - New MAC Address / Old Interface Name).

Is there any way to do this?

@rmetrich  
if time permits could you perhaps have a look here?  
My networking knowledge is basically limited  
to let DHCP automatically do "the right thing" ;-)

@DrayInsane  
as a generic method you could after "rear recover" finished  
in the still running ReaR recovery system manually change  
the (config) files of the recreated system as you like.  
The recreated filesystems with the restored files  
are mounted below /mnt/local in the ReaR recovery system.

@DrayInsane  
now I see you mentioned 55-migrate-network-devices.sh which is  
skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh  
so it seems you do not want to adapt some restored config files  
to make the recreated system boot with proper networking setup  
but you want to adapt the networking setup of the ReaR recovery system?

If yes, see "RESCUE IMAGE KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"  
in "man rear" e.g. for current master code it is online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear.8.adoc)  
and "NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS" in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf which is currently online at  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L3108](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L3108)

Thanks I'll take a look into it and see if I can figure something out.
Is there any way I can get rear to kick off a custom script before the
reboot of the system? I could then create the script to rename the
interface files back to how we need them to be and everything could be
done before booting into the system after recovery.

See POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT in  
usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf

See  
usr/share/rear/wrapup/default/500\_post\_recovery\_script.sh  
how POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT is called.

For an example of a POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT see  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf

Instead of doing all as a single command in  
POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT it should be usually easier  
to make a separated script and include it  
into the ReaR recovery system via

    COPY_AS_IS+=( /path/to/script.sh )

and call that script via POST\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT,  
see the COPY\_AS\_IS description in default.conf.

Because the default

    COPY_AS_IS=( $SHARE_DIR $VAR_DIR )

and because SHARE\_DIR is usr/share/rear  
you could place your script in usr/share/rear  
so it gets automatically included in the  
ReaR recovery system.
