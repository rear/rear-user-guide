-   Type: **Documentation**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?

I tested what I described in  
doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc  
in the sections

    Relax-and-Recover Setup for Multiple Backups

and

    How to recover with multiple backups in 'auto_recover'/'automatic' or 'unattended' mode

and for me it "just worked".

-   Description of the changes in this pull request:

In doc/user-guide/11-multiple-backups.adoc  
describe how to recover in unattended mode  
with multiple backups by using  
the RECOVERY\_COMMANDS array.
