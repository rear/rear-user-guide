The newer TSM clienst (6.1, 6.2) dynamicly loads some crypto libraries
that can't detected by ldd. The error message:  
ANS1464S Cannot load ICC encryption library.  
This library should be included with the TSM client. I will boot my test
system and investigate which files need to be included.

The directories /usr/local/ibm/gsk8 and/or gsk8\_64 are needed to run
newer TSM clients. I suggest to include /usr/local/ibm/gsk8\* in
COPY\_AS\_IS\_TSM in /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf.
