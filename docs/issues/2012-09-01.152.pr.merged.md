This looks correct to me.

@jhoekx Interested in your expert opinion.

It's indeed the issue, but the fix here will not work because the
realpath function does not exist :-) I think @thumm wrote it but forgot
to add it to the pull request.

`$(get_device_name $(get_sysfs_name $device))` should also do the trick
and otherwise we should make that work instead of adding a new function
for this.

Also, and this is nitpicking, but I prefer descriptive commit messages,
like 'Translate by-uuid names of devices for filesystems. This fixes
\#151.'

Ok, sorry, `realpath` is a utility. Dag, can you check if it's available
in RHEL4, I don't have one nearby.

Hmmm, I know os.path.realpath() in python though.

But realpath is not even a utility in RHEL6 :-/ It's probably not wise
to add this as another dependency. Why not just use `readlink -f` like
we've done before ?

realpath isn't a bash function but a command line utility.

If the result of the mentioned bash expression is a absolute path name
for the by-uuid-symbolic-link it's definitly a better solution because
it avoids an additional installation dependency (package realpath must
not be installed). I'll test it the next days when I'm back from
business trip.

Just for kicks I packaged realpath for RHEL, and the description of the
package says it is basically the same as `readlink -f` :-)

I just checked, the `get_sysfs_path` function only work on devices, not
partitions. So use `readlink -f`.

@thumm Do you like to fix it yourself and request a new pull ? Or shall
I add the fix in your name ?

Here is the update which uses readlink instead of realpath. I've tested
it on Debian.
