-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Backing up and recreating a system with two VGs, one contains thin
    pools, the other does not.

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Fix a problem introduced in commits
    b184194f37dd22a7e55655ff388579297239e73c and
    311bfb3da1d5e47a2ff144123a2457e634f67893 (PR \#1806) that shows up
    when there are multiple VGs to restore.  
    Using variables `create_thin_volumes_only` and
    `create_logical_volumes` to propagate infromation from VG creation
    to LV creation does not work well in the case of multiple VGs,
    because the variables are global and if there are multiple VGs,
    their values will leak from one VG to another. The generated
    diskrestore.sh script does not guarantee that the LVs of a given VG
    are created immediately after their VG and before creating another
    VG. Currently, the script first creates all VGs and then all LVs, so
    all the LVs in all VGs will see the value of
    `create_logical_volumes` and `create_thin_volumes_only` from the
    last VG, not from their own. This matters when different VGs behave
    differently (typically if one has a thin pool and the other does
    not).  
    Fix by replacing the scalar values by arrays of VG names. If a given
    VG is in the array, it is the equivalent of the former scalar value
    being 1 for the given VG, if it is not in the array, it is an
    equivalent of a former value of 0.  
    For the `create_volume_group` variable the change is not needed, but
    do it nevertheless for symmetry with other variables.
