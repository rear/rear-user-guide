Actually it creates the file but immediately deletes it. Need help to
get this resolved.

-   Work-around, if any: N/A

@langerkunal  
what you think is an error in the log file is not an error, that  
`StopIfError 'Could not mkdir '\''/tmp/rear.z7aay5CVizxI5te/outputfs'\'''`  
is only bash `set -x` output where the `StopIfError` function is
called  
but that function tests the exit code of the last comand
`((  0 != 0  ))`  
and everything is o.k. - in particular because the last command  
`mkdir -p -v /tmp/rear.z7aay5CVizxI5te/outputfs`  
logs its success
`mkdir: created directory '/tmp/rear.z7aay5CVizxI5te/outputfs'`.

The actual error in your log file is later - inspect your log file near
its end  
where it errors out and then go up to the command that actually failed  
(this could be a lot of lines because the error out procedure results  
many lines in the log file after the actual error happened).

I can reproduce your issue when I use an invalid OUTPUT\_URL as you
do.  
I used

<pre>
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
BACKUP_OPTIONS="nfsvers=3,nolock"
BACKUP_URL=nfs://10.160.4.244/nfs
OUTPUT_URL=10.160.4.244/nfs
</pre>

and got (excerpts):

<pre>
# usr/sbin/rear -D mkbackup
...
Created initrd.cgz with gzip default compression (61377717 bytes) in 8 seconds
ERROR: Mount command 'mount -v -t 10.160.4.244/nfs -o rw,noatime 10.160.4.244:/nfs /tmp/rear.FIGGFraatqWevy5/outputfs' failed.
Aborting due to an error, check /root/rear.github.jsmeix/var/log/rear/rear-f144.log for details
...
</pre>

When OUTPUT\_URL should point to the same thing as BACKUP\_URL  
you do not need to specify OUTPUT\_URL see `man rear` that reads

<pre>
If you do not specify OUTPUT_URL variable then by default
it will be aligned to what was defined by variable BACKUP_URL.
And, the rescue image will then be copied to the same location
as your backup of the system disk(s).
</pre>

When you use a SUSE system have a look at the template config files

<pre>
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-ext3-example.conf
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-btrfs-example.conf
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP1-btrfs-example.conf
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE12-SP2-btrfs-example.conf
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf
</pre>

and start with one of them and adapt and enhance it  
(possibly with excerpts from other template config files)  
according to what you need.

In general I would recommend to have a look at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
for example therein the section about  
"First steps with Relax-and-Recover"

When I am trying to create directory under /tmp/rear.XXXXXXXX namely
outputfs and outputfs/DHS4DPRIM (which is my hostname) through command
line it worked fine

@langerkunal, could you test again without `TMPDIR=/mnt2` ?

Already tried without TMPDIR as well. But same error coming.

@langerkunal  
when a program that runs as root (here `usr/sbin/rear`) gets
`Permission denied`  
the root cause is likely not in that program but outside and probably it
is  
some additional security stuff like the Linux kernel security modules  
AppArmor or SELinux that prohibit even root to do what root can normally
do.  
On the other hand I cannot explain why `usr/sbin/rear` cannot do
something as root  
when the same works as root on the command line.

For me things "just work" on SLES12 so that there is very likely no
gereral problem in ReaR  
but I think there is something special on your system why things do not
work there.

Any update on the solution or workaround for this?

@langerkunal, I tried but cannot replicate the issue on my Power System
LPAR with SLES12sp3.  
It working well on my side. I agree with @jsmeix, I think there is
something "special" on your system that prevents rear to create
directories and files under /tmp.

@langerkunal  
what do you expect from us?  
We cannot imagine what happens on your particular system.  
Our systems work for us.  
So you would need to dig into your system and provide info to us  
so that we could understand what is differnet on your system  
compared to our systems.

@schabrolles The problem here is that command line to create directory
under /tmp works perfectly fine but when I execute REaR it throws error.
I will try again on new SLES system and update if it works or throws
error again

@langerkunal, yes please... trying with a fresh SLES12 is the best
option to move forward and understand what happened on your system.

@langerkunal  
thanks for your new separated issue  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1875](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1875)  
so that we can continue there.

Because the initial issue here (that was the invalid OUTPUT\_URL)  
is solved I close this issue here.

SUSE linux issue still persists on freshly installed system

@langerkunal  
the crucial point is that the `mkdir as root gets Permission denied`
issue  
happens both on SUSE and on Ubuntu which indicates the root cause  
is not Linux distribution specific but some more general cause  
(regardless that currently I have no good idea what it could be).
