not sure why it's showing commits from pull 2142, were some commits
already accepted upstream? this pull request is a fork of my master.

**one change made to line 80 of 990\_verify\_rootfs**

    if test "$BACKUP" = "FDRUPSTREAM" ; then
        # Use a FDRUPSTREAM-specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH to find FDR libraries
        # see https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1533

@mutable-dan  
thank you for the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH fix for BACKUP = FDRUPSTREAM!

I did the actually intended change in this pull request directly via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/cb698ffe3bd641ff7cdd67482e482f6fff4f6810](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/cb698ffe3bd641ff7cdd67482e482f6fff4f6810)

I cannot merge this pull request because it contains lots of changes  
from the totally unrelated
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2142)

@mutable-dan  
to avoid that differnt issues get mixed up in pull requests  
you may have a look at the "Contributing" section in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development/](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)  
how to keep separated things separated in git.  
Therein follow in nparticular the `this article` link that points to  
[https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/](https://2buntu.com/articles/1459/keeping-your-forked-repo-synced-with-the-upstream-source/)  
which is in my opinion the best description how to work  
with git and GitHub (at least thgis is how I finally managed  
to work continuously and cleanly with git and GitHub).

A note FYI:

I think

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:opt/fdrupstream/bin

won't work because `opt/fdrupstream/bin` is a relative directory.  
I think `/opt/fdrupstream/bin` is actually intended.  
Because in default.conf there is

    FDRUPSTREAM_INSTALL_PATH="/opt/fdrupstream"

I used in my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/cb698ffe3bd641ff7cdd67482e482f6fff4f6810](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/cb698ffe3bd641ff7cdd67482e482f6fff4f6810)

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$FDRUPSTREAM_INSTALL_PATH/bin

while ago. after the s390, we will fix our trunk
