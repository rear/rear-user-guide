@franciscohosting  
I am not a CentOS user so that I cannot reproduce such issues.

Therefore some generic questions and information:

Does it perhaps work with a "normal" CentOS installation?

I ask because "rear recover" installs GRUB2 by 'chroot' into  
the restored system and run 'gub-install' therein, cf.  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh)

But perhaps a CentOS minimal installation is so minimal  
that one cannot successfully re-install GRUB2 therein?

Perhaps it helps to explicitly specify the `BOOTLOADER`, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2608](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2608)

To analyze your issue we really need both your  
"rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup" and your  
"rear -D recover" debug log files, cf.  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

First of all thanks for your quick answer!  
Then in a fresh Centos 7 minimal installation with all upgraded, bareos
configured and rear installed, I get the following warnings:

    Broken symlink '/etc/grub2.cfg' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target
    Broken symlink '/usr/lib/modules/3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64/build' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target
    Broken symlink '/usr/lib/modules/3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64/source' in recovery system because 'readlink' cannot determine its link target\
    ERROR: grub2-mkimage would not make bootable EFI image of GRUB2 (no /usr/lib/grub*/x86_64-efi/moddep.lst file)

So I configured rear to work bareos and did: yum install
grub2-efi-x64-modules (rebooted and deleted the old kernel)  
and as u suggested added BOOTLOADER="GRUB2-EFI" to site.conf  
that made the warning of Broken symlink
'/usr/lib/modules/3.10.0-1062.el7.x86\_64/source' disappear  
then:  
`rear -D mkrescue `  
gave me this log file:  
[rear-labobject2.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3838140/rear-labobject2.log)  
then booting from the live cd, doing the full restore and finally
doing:  
`rear -D recover`

I am not at all an expert in UEFI booting  
but think I may have found something:

I think in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3838158/rear-labobject2Recover.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3838158/rear-labobject2Recover.log)  
an interesting part is

    + source /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh
    ++ is_true 1
    ++ case "$1" in

    ++ return 1
    ++ test -f /mnt/local//boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi
    ++ return 0
    + source_return_code=0

which shows that  
both /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
and /usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
do basically nothing so that in the end no bootloader is installed.

/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh  
does nothing because it returns early at

    # For UEFI systems with grub2 we should use efibootmgr instead,
    # cf. finalize/Linux-i386/670_run_efibootmgr.sh
    is_true $USING_UEFI_BOOTLOADER && return

But the subsequent  
/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
that should set up the bootloader "For UEFI systems with grub2"  
also returns early at

    # When UEFI_BOOTLOADER is not a regular file in the restored target system
    # (cf. how esp_mountpoint is set below) it means BIOS is used
    # (cf. rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh)
    # which includes that also an empty UEFI_BOOTLOADER means using BIOS
    # because when UEFI_BOOTLOADER is empty the test below evaluates to
    #   test -f /mnt/local/
    # which also returns false because /mnt/local/ is a directory
    # (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2051/files#r258826856):
    test -f "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" || return 0

So I think it may help when you also set UEFI\_BOOTLOADER  
to the right value for your particular system, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L2675](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L2675)

Regarding UEFI\_BOOTLOADER there is in your  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3838140/rear-labobject2.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3838140/rear-labobject2.log)

    + source /usr/share/rear/rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh
    ...
    ++ Print 'Trying to find a '\''well known file'\'' to be used as UEFI bootloader...'
    +++ find /boot/efi -name 'grub*.efi'
    +++ tail -1
    ++ UEFI_BOOTLOADER=/boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi
    ++ test -f /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi
    ++ continue
    ++ LogPrint 'Using '\''/boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi'\'' as UEFI bootloader file'

So it seems on your original system there is a file

    /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi

which is no longer there on your recreated system  
after your backup was restored into `/mnt/local/` as

    /mnt/local//boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi

In general I suggest to inspect all those bootloader related  
config variables in default.conf - perhaps further manual  
settings are needed for a CentOS 7 minimal installation?

@gozora  
could you please have a look here as time permits.

I think we have one more issue in
finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
which looks to me at least as an inconsistency in its following code
parts:

    # When UEFI_BOOTLOADER is not a regular file in the restored target system
    # (cf. how esp_mountpoint is set below) it means BIOS is used
    # (cf. rescue/default/850_save_sysfs_uefi_vars.sh)
    # which includes that also an empty UEFI_BOOTLOADER means using BIOS
    # because when UEFI_BOOTLOADER is empty the test below evaluates to
    #   test -f /mnt/local/
    # which also returns false because /mnt/local/ is a directory
    # (cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2051/files#r258826856):
    test -f "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" || return 0

where we test for `$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER`  
according to
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2051/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2051/files)  
and its final implemenmtation  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1bba7ff1b832849108ac6a92d313739235727821](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/1bba7ff1b832849108ac6a92d313739235727821)  
BUT  
later the code is

    BootLoader=$( echo $UEFI_BOOTLOADER | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g' )
    LogPrint "Creating  EFI Boot Manager entry '$OS_VENDOR $OS_VERSION' for '$BootLoader' (UEFI_BOOTLOADER='$UEFI_BOOTLOADER')"
    Log efibootmgr --create --gpt --disk ${Disk} --part ${ParNr} --write-signature --label \"${OS_VENDOR} ${OS_VERSION}\" --loader \"\\${BootLoader}\"
    if efibootmgr --create --gpt --disk ${Disk} --part ${ParNr} --write-signature --label "${OS_VENDOR} ${OS_VERSION}" --loader "\\${BootLoader}" ; then
        # ok, boot loader has been set-up - tell rear we are done using following var.
        NOBOOTLOADER=''
        return
    fi

where efibootmgr is called with `--loader $BootLoader`  
but here BootLoader is set by using plain `$UEFI_BOOTLOADER`  
instead of `$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER`

So from my point of view  
either  
the current test is wrong and then  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2051](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2051)
was also wrong  
or  
`BootLoader` should be set by using `$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER`

I think how BootLoader is currently set via

    BootLoader=$( echo $UEFI_BOOTLOADER | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g' )

looks terribly fragile because the result depends in a hardcoded way  
how many `/` characters there are - for example as in

    # echo '/mnt/local//boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi' | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g'
    \boot\efi\EFI\centos\grubx64.efi

    # echo '/mnt/local/boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi' | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g'
    boot\efi\EFI\centos\grubx64.efi

    # echo '/boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi' | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g'
    EFI\boot\bootx64.efi

    # echo 'boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi' | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g'
    boot\bootx64.efi

and no comment that tells the reason behind  
the hardcoded cut after 3 '/' characters.

@gdha  
do you perhaps know about the reason behind the

    ... | cut -d"/" -f4- | ...

part?

I found a mistake in my backup, I wasn't backing up /boot/efi because it
was in fat16 and I was using a LinuxAll File system, I'm not sure if you
know about the file-sets in bareos, but here is my updated file-set:

I don't know if its important, but I created the bootable usb doing:

@franciscohosting  
in your new `rear -D recover` log file  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3841985/rear-labobject2.log](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3841985/rear-labobject2.log)

    EFI variables are not supported on this system.

so the `efibootmgr` call fails with

    EFI variables are not supported on this system.

but I am not a sufficient UEFI expert to know what that actually means.

What I found by Googling for

    efibootmgr "EFI variables are not supported on this system"

is  
[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/91620/efi-variables-are-not-supported-on-this-system](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/91620/efi-variables-are-not-supported-on-this-system)  
and  
[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=223874](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=223874)  
that both talk about the `efivars` kernel module.

As far as I understand it the kernel that is used when `efibootmgr` is
run  
is the kernel of the ReaR recovery system so I think that kernel has  
no `efivars` kernel module loaded.

To get it loaded run

    modprobe efivars

directly after you logged in as root in the ReaR recovery system  
(i.e. before you run `rear -D recover`).

For example on my currently used openSUSE Leap 15.0 UEFI system  
I have the `efivars` kernel module loaded

    # lsmod | grep -i efi
    efivarfs               16384  1

Because since ReaR 2.5. there is by default `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )`,
cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md](https://github.com/rear/rear.github.com/blob/master/documentation/release-notes-2-5.md)  
you should have all kernel modules available in the  
ReaR recovery system so that `modprobe efivars` therein  
should work.

In general regarding issues with third party backup tools:  
Usually there is nothing at all what we at ReaR upstream  
could do in case of issues with third-party backup tools  
because usually we neither have nor use such software  
so that we can neither test nor reproduce anything.  
Therefore in case of issues with third party backup tools  
you shoud also ask for help and support where  
you got your particular third party backup tool.

Actually non of above is true ;-)

`test -f "$TARGET_FS_ROOT/$UEFI_BOOTLOADER" || return 0` is executed in
finalize stage after restore is over. As the description of \#2051 says
(allow me narcissistically quote my self):

`efibootmgr --create ... --loader "\\${BootLoader}"` on the other hand
creates UEFI boot entry (similar to entry in *grub.cfg*) where we can't
prefix *$TARGET\_FS\_ROOT* because such path simply doesn't exist when
system is restored and rebooted.

So from my point of view, current ReaR code is totally fine.

in Centos 7 running normally, the following commands give no output:

    # modprobe efivars
    # smod | grep -i efi

but if I do:

    # mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
    mount: efivarfs is already mounted or /sys/firmware/efi/efivars busy
           efivarfs is already mounted on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

In rear doing the first two commands don't give an output too, but
`mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /mnt/local/sys/firmware/efi/efivars`
gives:  
`mount: unknown filesystem type 'efivarfs'`

@franciscohosting I don't see this as a problem,  
If you have *efivarfs* mounted and don't see any module loaded, it is
most probably direct part of your kernel.

This however does not explain your message
`EFI variables are not supported on this system.` in ReaR recovery
system.

Are you restoring your original system to same HW or to new one ?  
Are you 100% sure that your destination HW is UEFI compatible at the
time of restore ?

I did it! It seems that the bios forced legacy when booting with the usb

@gozora  
thank you so much for your help and your explanation  
how things are meant to work!

I will add explanatory comments to the `efibootmgr` call in  
usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
because that part was obscure to me (as a non UEFI expert).

I still have a question because we still have a possibly severe  
issue in the code that belongs to the `efibootmgr` call, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2275\#issuecomment-553440847](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2275#issuecomment-553440847)

    BootLoader=$( echo $UEFI_BOOTLOADER | cut -d"/" -f4- | sed -e 's;/;\\;g' )
    ...
    ... efibootmgr ... --loader "\\${BootLoader}" ...

where that `cut -d"/" -f4-` cuts away the fist hardcoded two or three  
directories (depending on whether or not there is a leading `/`)  
so that all depends on that there are always two or three leading  
directories (and that there is or is not a leading `/`) that need  
to be cut away to get the right value for `--loader`.

My question is:  
What is the generically right value for the `efibootmgr  --loader`
option?

My `man efibootmgr` does not tell anything useful about what the  
right value for `--loader` is.

What I need to learn is:  
When some leading directories need to be cut away from the  
path to the efibootmgr loader file in the currently running system  
what trailing part of the system's efibootmgr loader file path is
right  
so that things work for the UEFI firmware during booting?

@franciscohosting  
thank you for your prompt feedback what made things working for you.

I think I vaguely remember that a colleague had told me  
it depends on the boot medium whether or not the firmware  
goes into UEFI mode or falls back to BIOS mode.

I think he told me to install a Linux system where  
UEFI should be used to boot the installed Linux system  
the installation system boot medium must let the firmware  
boot in UEFI mode - otherwise (i.e. when the firmware boots  
the installation system in BIOS mode) the installed system  
can use only BIOS mode to set up its bootloader.

Because the ReaR recovery system is a Linux installation system,  
cf. "Disaster recovery means installation (reinstalling from scratch)"  
and "How disaster recovery with ReaR basically works" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
you need to boot the ReaR recovery system in UEFI mode  
to be able to reinstall your Linux system with ReaR  
when UEFI should be used to boot the reinstalled system.

Regarding how to create a UEFI bootable ReaR recovery system on USB  
see the `USB_*` variables in default.conf in particular
USB\_UEFI\_PART\_SIZE  
and you need to prepare your USB device with "rear format" where you  
need to explicitly specify the '--efi' option like

    rear -v format -- --efi /dev/sdX

Note the mandatory `--` before the format workflow specific options,
cf.

Ok, so I checked again default.conf, and it shows a way of creating raw
bootable images, that can be easily used with usb sticks:  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L792](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L792)  
I updated my site.conf to:

if binary `grub-mkimage` exists, but it should be `grub2-mkimage`,

@franciscohosting  
we appreciate all contributions that improve ReaR  
in particular GitHub pull requests.

Regarding how to make a GitHub pull request  
you may have a look at the section "Contributing" in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/development](http://relax-and-recover.org/development)  
and the section "How to contribute to Relax-and-Recover" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

In this particular case regarding GRUB2 program names  
like `grub-something` versus `grub2-something`:

Both kind of names exist "out there in the wild"  
so special code is needed so that ReaR works everywhere,  
cf. the section "Maintain backward compatibility" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)

Fortunately in other scripts this issue is already solved  
so that you can reuse the matching code e.g. from  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660\_install\_grub2.sh\#L57](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh#L57)  
where in particular a variable `grub_name` is set to `grub2` or `grub`  
depending if `boot/grub2` or `boot/grub` exists - it even shows an
error  
if neither exist, cf. "Try hard to care about possible errors" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
so that later GRUB2 programs can be called as `$grub_name-...`

Hello @jsmeix

I think that `cut -d"/" -f4-` is just some kind of leftover from good
old times, when it was expected that UEFI bootloader will be on fixed
location (/boot/efi/EFI/&lt;some\_directory&gt;/bootx64.efi). I agree
that it is not very safe, but it seems to cover most of the cases. There
might be several reasons why it was not reported so far.

-   many people still use UEFI in legacy mode just because this mode
    make more sense for them, or because of historical reasons.
-   If people use UEFI they don't mess with bootloader and keep it on
    default location (many distros use variant of location I've
    mentioned earlier.
-   if people use UEFI and recover server with ReaR they don't even need
    to notice that something went wrong with `efibootmgr` because boot
    entry is already there and system boots OK.
-   even if it might not appear at first glance, UEFI have some very
    reasonable defaults when looking for boot loader and many times it
    finds some working boot loader during its fallback trip ...

> What is the generically right value for the efibootmgr --loader
> option?

`--loader` value is working path to bootloader binary (e.g. bootx64.efi)
but this value relative to ESP.  
I'll take my home computer as an example:  
I have following entry in */etc/fstab*

    UUID=B4EF-728C  /boot/efi       vfat    umask=0077      0       1

and following UEFI entry:

    root@hugo:~# efibootmgr -v
    ...
    Boot0004* debian    HD(3,GPT,bcd3c68d-6b4b-4f50-af18-cbc7ca9d77e6,0x121800,0x32000)/File(\EFI\DEBIAN\GRUBX64.EFI)
    ...

Full path to boot loader when normally booted inside LInux looks
something like: */boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi*  
`\EFI\DEBIAN\GRUBX64.EFI` is `--loader` value. To construct this value,
you most probably need to take value of `$UEFI_BOOTLOADER` and remove
string representing ESP, from the beginning of the string (/boot/efi in
my case) and maybe flip forward slashes to back slashes (I think this
flipping slashes is not needed any more ...).  
UEFI doesn't know about other filesystems types that vfat, hence when in
UEFI all you can see is partition represented by *UUID=B4EF-728C* in
this example, hence from UEFI shell point of view your boot loader is
located under *\\EFI\\DEBIAN\\GRUBX64.EFI*.

Hope it helps!

V.

@gozora  
some spontaneous (perhaps crazy) offhanded ideas  
based on your above 'mount' and `efibootmgr -v` info.

FYI  
what I have on my openSUSE Leap 15.0 system

    /boot/efi/EFI/opensuse/shim.efi

My ideas:

1.)  
In finalize/Linux-i386/670\_run\_efibootmgr.sh  
we already determine the ESP mount point in $TARGET\_FS\_ROOT  
so I think this is the leading part that actually needs to be cut  
from the loader's full path name on the Linux system  
to get the loader's path name inside the ESP.

2.)  
Perhaps it works to run `efibootmgr -v` inside
`chroot $TARGET_FS_ROOT`  
(I don't know what environment `efibootmgr -v` needs to work
properly).  
If this works we could "grep" the loader's path name inside the ESP  
from the `efibootmgr -v` output.
