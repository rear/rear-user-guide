With these patches users can restore systems, which use the AvamarClient
package and a compatible server to backup the file sytem, with ReaR. Use
"BACKUP=AVA" in the local.conf or site.conf and follow the instructions.

@kai7p  
I know nothing at all about EMC Avamar and how it works  
so that I can only make a general comment:  
In restore/AVA/default/200\_prompt\_user\_to\_start\_restore.sh  
you call /opt/avamar/bin/avagent.bin  
If /opt/avamar/bin/avagent.bin is an interactive program,  
see "What to do with stdout and stderr" in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
basically any program that behaves interactive  
or could sometimes be interactive must be called as

<pre>
COMMAND ... 0<&6 1>&7 2>&8
</pre>

@kai7p Is this a partial PR? As the restore is a request to restore via
a WebGUI? Are there plans to foresee a full cycle of automatic restore
via `rear recover` ?

@gdha I don't think Avamar offers the required APIs to automate the
recovery
