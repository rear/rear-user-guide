For a first idea how to implement iSCSI support see below  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429\#issuecomment-646500447](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2429#issuecomment-646500447)

If that is not possible "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
should at least tell the user when an iSCSI device is used  
i.e. when that iSCSI device appears in disklayout.conf because then  
"rear recover" may not "just work" because iSCSI is not (yet) fully
supported  
but needs some manual setup, cf.

Because this issue is not about to add iSCSI support (which needs
sponsorship)  
but only to tell the user when an iSCSI device is in disklayout.conf  
I think I could implement relatively easily a test that checks  
if a device in disklayout.conf appears as `iscsi` TRAN in lsblk output  
and show a user information+confirmation dialog in that case,  
i.e. something similar as the 'BACKUP\_URL\_ISO\_PROCEED\_...'  
user information+confirmation dialog in  
prep/default/040\_check\_backup\_and\_output\_scheme.sh  
cf. the comment in that script  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/default/040\_check\_backup\_and\_output\_scheme.sh\#L12](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/prep/default/040_check_backup_and_output_scheme.sh#L12)

So I did some tests on same VM from
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2428](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2428).
But this time I've added iSCSI LUN /dev/sdd, so the final setup looks
something like this:

I've successfully restored structure and data to */bigdata* residing on
iSCSI LUN.  
Only modification comparing to non-iSCSI setup is to copy Iscsi daemon
configuration (/etc/iscsi) and LUN connection config files
(/var/lib/iscsi) + add iscsid and iscsiadm (open-iscsi administration
utility) into ReaR recovery system.

After boot into ReaR rescue system, one need to start iscsid, login to
iSCSI target and run `rear recover`.

Since this setup is quite straightforward and relatively easy, I'd keep
things as they currently are.  
Because only thing that ReaR needs to have full featured iSCSI support
is startup script for iSCSI daemon starting after network is setup
(*/etc/scripts/system-setup*), which is minor effort task ...

@gozora  
many thanks for your explanatory report about using ReaR with iSCSI!

It helps so much when someone who sits in front of such a "beast"  
provides a comprehensible report how ReaR behaves in this case,  
what exactly is needed to make it work, and how things look like.

@gozora Great - nice test. It only requires a prep script to make it
really supported ;-)

@gdha I was thinking about something like introduce some variables into
default.conf.

maybe:

    ISCSI_DAEMON="iscsid -f"
    ISCSI_LOGIN_COMMAND="iscsiadm -m node --loginall=automatic"

Which could be launched after successful network setup.  
Shouldn't be a big problem to get this done.

@gozora  
perhaps as a first test something like

    NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=(
    'ip addr add 192.168.56.200/24 dev enp0s8'
    'ip link set dev enp0s8 up'
    'sleep 1'
    'iscsid -f'
    'sleep 1'
    'iscsiadm -m node --loginall=automatic'
    'return'
    )

may do it in your particular case.  
Those `sleep 1` are meant to give things some time to startup
completely.

Damn! I've spent an hour yesterday figuring out how to inject code that
would execute after network is setup and couldn't make up anything.  
I'll certainly test it today afternoon.

Thanks!

@gozora  
there is also PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT that gets evaluated by  
usr/share/rear/setup/default/010\_pre\_recovery\_script.sh  
so that PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT is run each time "rear recover" is run  
which could make a difference when one re-runs "rear recover" if it
failed  
in contrast to NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
that are run only once during recovery system startup via  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh

Will try that out too.

Adding:

    NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'ip addr add 192.168.56.200/24 dev enp0s8'
    'ip link set dev enp0s8 up' 
    'sleep 1'

    'sleep 1'
    'iscsiadm -m node --loginall=automatic'
    'return' )

into *local.conf* works as charm.  
After ReaR recovery system boot, I have iSCSI LUN present without
further configuration.

    $ ssh restore

Since iSCSI can be configured using standard ReaR channels and one don't
need to do any additional hacking after ReaR recovery system boot. I'd
say that should not even warn user and let him just Relax-and-Recover
;-)

Do you think that iSCSI setup in ReaR is worth to document?

I replaced the word "warn" by "tell" in the title and in my above
entries.  
I was uncomfortable with the word "warn" when I used it because I agree
with  
[https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html](https://blog.schlomo.schapiro.org/2015/04/warning-is-waste-of-my-time.html)  
but I had no better idea what other word I could use here.

I think as long as "rear recover" does not "just work" with iSCSI  
ReaR should tell the user during "rear mkrescue/mkbackup"  
when an iSCSI device appears in disklayout.conf because then  
the user must manually setup some (simple) additional things.

@gozora  
perhaps we are lucky and there appears a ReaR user with iSCSI  
who is faster in implementing automagic iSCSI support in ReaR  
than we need do document how to setup things manually?  
;-)

From error-&gt;warnign-&gt;tell that is nice deescalation, but I like
the final version.  
Over the years here, I think there was no one with iSCSI, so doing
automatic iSCSI setup in ReaR look kind of waste of time especially if
you can do manual setup relatively easy.

What I have in mind with "automagic iSCSI support in ReaR" is that  
when an iSCSI device appears in disklayout.conf  
then

    COPY_AS_IS+=( "${ISCSI_COPY_AS_IS[@]}" )
    REQUIRED_PROGS+=( "${ISCSI_REQUIRED_PROGS[@]}" )

happens automatically with new config variables in default.conf

    ISCSI_COPY_AS_IS=( /etc/iscsi /var/lib/iscsi )
    ISCSI_REQUIRED_PROGS=( iscsid iscsiadm )

and  
there is a new recovery system startup script like  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/63-iscsi.sh  
(that runs after /etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
and etc/scripts/system-setup.d/62-routing.sh)  
which should start iscsid and login to iSCSI target  
by using new config variables in default.conf  
(default.conf is sourced by skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup)  
like

    ISCSI_DAEMON_COMMANDS=( 'sleep 1' 'iscsid -f' )
    ISCSI_LOGIN_COMMANDS=( 'sleep 1' 'iscsiadm -m node --loginall=automatic' )

so that the user has the final power to specify what he needs  
for his particular iSCSI system.

Because I read 'login' I assume some extra care is needed  
how ReaR deals with possibly confidential login data  
(are passwords used for login to iSCSI target?)  
to avoid that secrets are included in the recovery system  
(by default the recovery system must be free of secrets)  
and to check if perhaps an interactive login to iSCSI target works  
(can iscsiadm do an interactive login via user password prompt?)

@jsmeix agree on your implementation idea, I had similar idea too.

With the login you are right, I normally don't setup login passwords on
iSCSI LUNs but the option is there. I'm not sure now but it is possible
that things like Kerberos are even possible :-).  
Connection information at least on my Centos7 are stored in
*/var/lib/iscsi* (some versions ago it was */etc/iscsi* so yet another
random location fun to solve).

> can iscsiadm do an interactive login via user password prompt

Yes it can, but it is also designed to work right from the boot ...

As far as I see there is one part of the manual iSCSI setup  
that can get tricky for the user when he wants iSCSI setup  
happen automatically right in his recovery system so that  
only calling plain "rear recover" would be sufficient.

When the user has a more complicated networking setup  
where he needs to use ReaR's generated  
/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh  
then he cannot use NETWORKING\_PREPARATION\_COMMANDS  
to start iscsid and login to iSCSI target.  
Perhaps PRE\_RECOVERY\_SCRIPT can be used for that  
but that looks all more like a workaround than an intended way  
how such things should be done in ReaR.

After the ReaR 2.6 release was completely done  
(i.e. when we can do ReaR 2.7 development)  
I will implement some initial iSCSI support  
(i.e. hopefully I can start next week with that)  
so that you @gozora could test and play around with it.

@jsmeix you look to be interested in iSCSI topic ;-).  
Btw. iSCSI is cheap way how you can simulate complex disk layouts (which
are normally done over Fibre Channel). All you need to do is to preset
from iSCSI server LUN over multiple network interfaces and you can join
them using `multipathd` on client site and treat them like standard
disks...

@gozora  
I am afraid I am not so much interested in iSCSI  
as in not getting issues from certain kind of people about  
"unacceptable poor performance of ReaR on iSCSI systems"  
or how else those kind of people may describe it when something  
does not meet their "just works perfectly out of the box" expectations.

With such explicit `ISCSI_...` config variables iSCSI related things  
are made clear to the user (the user is excpected to read
default.conf)  
and the user gets a predefined way in ReaR how to deal with iSCSI  
that he can adapt and enhance as needed for his particular use case.
