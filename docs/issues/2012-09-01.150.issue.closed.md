Could you please test the snapshot release ? (Which is incidently also
called 1.13.0 with a git-timestamp)

Also, we would need more information in order to help you.

@jhoekx I think we need to make a small troubleshooting guide that
instructs people to try the most recent release from the master branch,
perform some tests and to send more detailed information (configuration,
version and logs).

Thanks for testing.

In order to debug Relax-and-Recover retains the temporary directory in
*/tmp/*, can you try to do a:
`chroot /tmp/rear.WTjmuRD2dQETSQc /bin/bash`

This is in fact what is probably failing. I hope the output of that
command to be useful.

PS You can upload log files through gist:

I did only test with 64 bit debian. Tested it again right now and that
works. I will install a 32 bit version.

@lgbff Thanks for the clarification !  
@jhoekx Thanks for the detective work (or lucky guess ? :-)

Ok, so Relax-and-Recover expects */tmp* to be `exec` mounted. How are we
going to handle this ?

-   Check */tmp* for `noexec`, halt and escalate problem ?
-   Do we use another location that is less likely to be `noexec` (e.g.
    /var/lib/rear) ?
-   Do we temporarily disable `noexec` by remounting and then go back to
    `exec` ?
-   Are there any other workarounds ? We do not actually need `exec`
    other than testing bash :-( The irony here is that it's not bash
    that is hurting us, but the test to see if it works correctly (which
    it probably will !)

Why not use /dev/shm?

/tmp is probably the worst possible location and pure "legacy"...

Or even better: Use /dev/shm by default and allow user to change the  
location.

Or, if /tmp is noexec mounted skip the test (saying testing is not
possible)?

@schlomo I don't like */dev/shm* for this, I fear a risk of trashing the
system because we pressure memory too high. (default is 50%of RAM)

@gdha That's probably the best suggestion. Just alert the condition, in
99% of the cases there is no issue and it is up to the user (in this
case) to ensure the recovery process works as expected. Maybe we can
combine this together with a check for other possible location (before
giving up, disabling the check and alerting the user).

I found this by thinking how you could get a permission denied error
when running bash after you've written it.

Well, `/tmp` is also a tmpfs these days on non-enterprise systems, so
memory pressure is not really an argument.

I think a combination of making TMP\_DIR configurable with a check and
warning if /tmp is mounted noexec would be the best solution for now.

I am closing this issue. Feel free to report if this feature can be
improved or fails to work in your case.

I am wondering about one thing with my implementation though. If
Relax-and-Recover is started in quiet mode (default) no warning messages
are shown. So in case you run rear via cron, it won't escalate this
warning. I can see cases where this is expected (i.e. the user tested it
himself thoroughly and wants to leave /tmp noexec) but also cases where
it is not (i.e. user is unaware due to this and might be at risk).

Not sure what is best, the logfile does have the warning so if the user
checked the logfile for warnings or errors, he should have known. But
you know how *ignorant* users can be ;-))

IMHO this should be a fatal error. Let the user give ReaR another work
dir  
where it can do the chroot test. IMHO this test is very important to
ensure  
that the resulting initrd has a chance to function.

Who knows. Maybe a users changes /tmp to noexec long time after setting
up  
ReaR?

@schlomo Maybe we can change it to a fatal error once we have issue
\#157 solved. I am open to that.

We are facing the same issue, because /tmp mouted with noexec
permissions:

    ERROR: Cannot test if the ReaR recovery system is usable because /tmp is mounted 'noexec'
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-serverxy.log for details

set the TMDIR variable to fix the issue:

    export TMPDIR='/var/tmp/' ; /usr/sbin/rear mkbackup
