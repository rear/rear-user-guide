##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Cleanup**

-   Impact: **Low**

-   Reference to related issue (URL): \#3349  
    PS: this PR replaces PR-3352

-   How was this pull request tested? manually

-   Description of the changes in this pull request: `grubby` and
    `grub2-editenv` were added by PR \#3349 into the
    `conf/GNU/Linux.conf` file in the `PROGS` section. However, it seems
    proper to move these 2 programs to the
    `prep/GNU/Linux/300_include_grub_tools.sh` script.

usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/300\_include\_grub\_tools.sh  
does not tell why it exists at all, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3352\#issuecomment-2514232463](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3352#issuecomment-2514232463)

I.e. what the reason is why GRUB tools are needed within  
the recovery system regardless that during "rear recover"  
GRUB is installed within the recreated target system  
via chroot into the recreated target system.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3352\#discussion\_r1867492931](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3352#discussion_r1867492931)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3352\#discussion\_r1867916286](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3352#discussion_r1867916286)  
the reason why  
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/300\_include\_grub\_tools.sh  
exists is not for "rear recover" but for a different use case  
which is using the ReaR recovery system to repair the system,  
in particular to repair GRUB on the original system  
(e.g. because the original system fails to boot).

So  
usr/share/rear/prep/GNU/Linux/300\_include\_grub\_tools.sh  
should be enhanced with an initial comment that  
explains why it it exists at all for example like

    # GRUB tools are not required inside the recovery system
    # for "rear recover" because during "rear recover"
    # GRUB is installed within the recreated target system
    # via chroot into the recreated target system.
    # Nevertheless GRUB tools are useful inside the
    # recovery system for a different use case which is
    # using the ReaR recovery system to repair the system,
    # in particular to repair GRUB on the original system
    # when the original system fails to boot.

Via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2478b4cf9100e77d28c414591e2ec6b330851b49](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/2478b4cf9100e77d28c414591e2ec6b330851b49)  
I explained in prep/GNU/Linux/300\_include\_grub\_tools.sh  
why it exists at all.

My above assumption that GRUB tools are not needed within  
the ReaR recovery system because during "rear recover"  
GRUB is installed within the recreated target system  
via chroot into the recreated target system  
is not true because

    # There is one exception for GRUB2: grub-probe or grub2-probe
    # This is required inside the recovery system because the function
    # is_grub2_installed is also called during "rear recover"
    # in finalize/Linux-i386/630_install_grub.sh
    # and finalize/Linux-i386/660_install_grub2.sh
    # And 'type -p grub-probe || type -p grub2-probe' is called during "rear recover"
    # in finalize/Linux-ppc64le/660_install_grub2.sh
    # and finalize/SUSE_LINUX/s390/660_install_grub2_and_zipl.sh
    # Other code places that call 'has_binary grub-probe' or 'has_binary grub2-probe'
    # are not run during "rear recover"
    # (at least as far as I <jsmeix@suse.de> found out up to now dated 05 Dec. 2024)
