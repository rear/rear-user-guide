-   How was this pull request tested?  
    In
    usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh  
    use an unbound variable for testing e.g. as follows

<pre>
set -e -u -o pipefail
echo "$DOESNOTEXIST"
</pre>

which lets that script abort.  
Without the fix it looks during "rear recover"

<pre>
RESCUE d57:~ # rear -D recover
...
Confirm or edit the disk mapping
1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
2) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
3) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
4) Abort 'rear recover'
(default '1' timeout 300 seconds)

UserInput: No real user input (empty or only spaces) - using default input
UserInput: Valid choice number result 'Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover''
User confirmed disk mapping
Exiting rear recover (PID 851) and its descendant processes
RESCUE d57:~ #

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    In the DoExitTasks() function first of all restore the ReaR default
    bash flags and options  
    because otherwise in case of a bash error exit when e.g. "set -e -u
    -o pipefail" was set  
    all the exit tasks related code would also run with "set -e -u -o
    pipefail" still set  
    which may abort exit tasks related code anywhere with a "sudden
    death" bash error exit  
    where in particular no longer the EXIT\_FAIL\_MESSAGE would be
    shown  
    so that for the user ReaR would "just somehow silently abort" in
    this case.
