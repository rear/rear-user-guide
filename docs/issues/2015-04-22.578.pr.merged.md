Hi,

this is the pull request for \#575 to delete $BUILD\_DIR/outputfs if it
is not mounted anymore.

I am curious how this can happen. If the filesystem is unmounted, there
should not be any file left under the mountpoint, unless
`$BUILD_DIR/outputfs` has not been a mountpoint at all and `.lockfile`
got created in the local filesystem, which would indicate a bug (if
`$BUILD_DIR/outputfs` is not a mounted filesystem and we put files under
it, the files will just get lost).

What is actually the purpose of `.lockfile`? The only use seems to be to
prevent double moves of the result directory if
`$OUTPUT_URL == $BACKUP_URL` and `NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY` and
`KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY` are used (and what will hapen if the former is
set and the latter is unset?).

@pcahyna  
I don't know what the actual purpose of `.lockfile` is.  
I would have to reverse engineer it by digging its actual usage in the
code.  
At first glance I found  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/250\_create\_lock.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/250_create_lock.sh)  
see the initial comment therein.  
I never used KEEP\_OLD\_OUTPUT\_COPY.  
I only tried out NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY at some longer time
ago  
cf. what I wrote about "Regarding NETFS\_KEEP\_OLD\_BACKUP\_COPY" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

@jsmeix I saw that comment and I don't understand it, because here
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7bcad6b517aad2fcaf42d2a12464b42b5508a856/usr/share/rear/output/default/150\_save\_copy\_of\_prefix\_dir.sh\#L15](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/7bcad6b517aad2fcaf42d2a12464b42b5508a856/usr/share/rear/output/default/150_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh#L15)
the lockfile gets just removed if it exists, so I don't see how can it
avoid anything.

I guess that this is the use case indeed to prevent overwriting of logs.
The `KEEP_OLD_OUTPUT_COPY` variable I never used (and to be honest did
not know it existed which proofs that even I is out-of-sync ;-) with all
the ReaR attributes). Sig...

In script
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/150\_save\_copy\_of\_prefix\_dir.sh](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/output/default/150_save_copy_of_prefix_dir.sh)
I think it would be wiser to remove the lines

    # an old lockfile from a previous run not cleaned up by output is possible
    [[ -f ${opath}/.lockfile ]] && rm -f ${opath}/.lockfile >&2

Or, at least comment it out.
