Current master code after ReaR 2.3.

When during "rear mkbackup" the 'tar' background process is already
running  
pressing \[Ctrl\]+\[C\] (i.e. sending SIGINT) only terminates the
foreground  
process (i.e. the bash script) but neither the 'tar' background
process  
nor the 'dd' background process:

The background 'tar' and 'dd' processes run until they finish  
and at the very end the mounted NFS share is still mounted:

<pre>
# mount | grep rear
10.160.4.244:/nfs on /tmp/rear.lswe2CuMGSACoyi/outputfs type nfs (rw,nfsvers=3,nolock,addr=10.160.4.244)
</pre>

I think pressing \[Ctrl\]+\[C\] during any "rear WORKFLOW"  
should also terminate all background processes  
and clean up e.g. umount ReaR specific things  
(i.e. ensure the EXIT\_TASKS can run successfully).

I think the current behaviour is at most a "minor bug".

Or is there a reason why the current behaviour  
is perhaps even intentional?

As a first idea I tried in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh adding

<pre>
 ... pkill -P $MASTER_PID ; wait ...
</pre>

before finally `kill $MASTER_PID` to the USR1 trap like

<pre>
builtin trap " ... pkill -P $MASTER_PID ; wait ; kill $MASTER_PID" USR1
</pre>

but that did not help.

I also tried in lib/\_input-output-functions.sh  
adding the same to the DoExitTasks() function like

<pre>
function DoExitTasks () {
    LogPrint "Running exit tasks"
    LogPrint "Terminating child processes"
    LogPrint "$( pgrep -a -P $MASTER_PID )"
    pkill -P $MASTER_PID
    LogPrint "Waiting for child processes to finish..."
    wait
    LogPrint "Child processes finished"
...
</pre>

but that also did not help.

Somehow that "kill all running jobs" in the DoExitTasks() function  
does not do what it should do...

Oddly enough, I'm not suffering by this. Recently I had to interrupt

left running.

Phew! The analysis took much longer than expected:

Also for me Ctrl+C usually works - but sometimes not.

Summary:

At least sometimes that "kill all running jobs" in the DoExitTasks()
function  
does not do what it should do because it does not terminate all child
processes  
because it fails to determine all child processses ('jobs -p' is
insufficient for that).

Usually 'jobs -p' reports only one child and that gets killed with a
brutal SIGKILL  
that leaves the poor child (and all its own grandchildren) no chance  
to do any own cleanup.

Therefore the "kill all running jobs" in the DoExitTasks() function  
needs to be enhanced to determine all child processes  
and to recursively terminate each of them more gracefully  
first by sending SIGTERM and waiting a bit for them to terminate  
and finally sending SIGKILL only to remaining child processes.

Details on my SLES12-SP2 system:

For analysis I enhanced lib/\_input-output-functions.sh

<pre>
function DoExitTasks () {
    Log "Running exit tasks."
    # terminate all running jobs
    JOBS=( $( jobs -p ) )
    # when "jobs -p" results nothing then JOBS is still an unbound variable so that
    # an empty default value is used to avoid 'set -eu' error exit if $JOBS is unset:
    if test -n ${JOBS:-""} ; then
        LogPrint "Terminating..."
        LogPrint "The following ReaR (background) jobs are active and get terminated:"
        LogPrint "Output of: jobs -p"
        LogPrint "$( jobs -p )"
        LogPrint "Output of: pstree -plau $MASTER_PID"
        LogPrint "$( pstree -plau $MASTER_PID )"
        LogPrint "Output of: pgrep -a -P $MASTER_PID"
        LogPrint "$( pgrep -a -P $MASTER_PID )"
        LogPrint "Output of: ps auxw | egrep 'rear|tar'"
        LogPrint "$( ps auxw | egrep 'rear|tar' )"
        LogPrint "Terminating jobs (PIDs ${JOBS[*]})"
        for job in "${JOBS[@]}" ; do
            LogPrint "Terminating job (PID $job)"
            kill $job 1>&2
        done
        sleep 1
    ...
</pre>

and backup/NETFS/default/500\_make\_backup.sh

<pre>
sleep 1 # Give the backup software a good chance to start working

echo "ps auxw | egrep 'rear|tar'" 1>&7
ps auxw | egrep -i1 'rear|tar' 1>&7
echo "pstree -plau $MASTER_PID" 1>&7
pstree -plau $MASTER_PID 1>&7
</pre>

then I did "rear mkbackup" with Ctrl+C during "archive operation"

<pre>

Note how directly after Ctrl+C the following sub-sub-processes are
already gone

<pre>
      `-tar,27366 --warning=no-xdev --sparse ...
          `-gzip,27371
</pre>

only the 'dd' is left (shown by `ps auxw | egrep 'rear|tar'`).

In some cases even the 'dd' was already gone directly after Ctrl+C for
me.

This seems to indicate that under normal circumstances  
the whole "kill all running jobs" in the DoExitTasks() function  
is probably not needed - plain Ctrl+C should automatically  
terminate all child processes.

In the end perhaps the root of all evil is only the SIGKILL  
in the "kill all running jobs" in the DoExitTasks() function  
that might disturb the normal Ctrl+C termination of all children.

According to my above analysis this issue is no longer a minor bug  
(it only happens not often in practice because users don't Ctrl+C
ReaR)  
because I think how the DoExitTasks() function currently tries  
to terminate descendant processes is descructive (i.e. just wrong).

Via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1720](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1720)  
I tried to implement clean termination of descendant processes  
in the DoExitTasks() function via a new descendants\_pids() function.

I found the basic idea (determine recursively children of children) in  
[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=88081](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=88081)

What is the expected behavior when a user presses Ctrl-C?

For me it would be to cleanly abort ReaR which means:

-   abort all background processes
-   umount everything we mounted
-   remove temporary files unless running in debug mode
-   in general, leave the system in a clean state as it was before
    running ReaR.

So yes, we should kill everything. Maybe [process
groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group) can help us to
catch all subprocesses by sending the TERM or KILL signal to the entire
group.

We should never "just kill" any process (i.e. send SIGKILL to it)  
unless SIGTERM was sent a bit of time (e.g. a second) before  
because SIGKILL is always descructive and no "rear WORKFLOW"  
should do anything that is possibly descructive in particular  
never ever when running in the living original system.

Process groups do not help, at least not with bash default behaviour.

It was my main finding that with bash default behaviour  
one gets sub-processes that are not in the same process group  
as their parent process.

On my SLES12-SP2 system:

<pre>
# type -a descendants_pids
descendants_pids is a function
descendants_pids () 
{ 
    local parent_pid=$1;
    kill -0 $parent_pid 2> /dev/null || return 0;
    local child_pid="";
    local children_pids=$( ps --ppid $parent_pid -o pid= );
    if test "$children_pids"; then
        for child_pid in $children_pids;
        do
            descendants_pids $child_pid;
        done;
    fi;
    kill -0 $parent_pid 2> /dev/null && echo $parent_pid || return 0
}

# { sleep 5 | grep foo | grep $( sleep 2 ; echo bar ) ; } & { sleep 7 | grep this | grep $( sleep 2 ; echo that ) ; } & echo ; sleep 1 ; pstree -plaug $$ ; descendants_pids $$ ; echo ; sleep 2 ; pstree -plaug $$ ; descendants_pids $$

FYI: The '-g' option is not supported by older 'pstree' like the
'pstree' on SLE11.

Sub-processes that get run via `command &` can get a different  
process group, cf. "man bash" (on my SLES12-SP2 system):

<pre>
To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control,
the operating system maintains the notion of a current terminal
process group ID. Members of this process group (processes
whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process
group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as SIGINT.
These processes are said to be in the foreground.
Background processes are those whose process group ID
differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to
keyboard-generated signals.
</pre>

To cleanly terminate all descendant processes in any case  
regardless how those processes have been launched  
one must recursively determine all child processes PIDs  
and send SIGTERM to each of them.
