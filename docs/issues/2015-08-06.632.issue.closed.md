Hi All,

We have few DL380G8 server shipped with P830i array controllers cards,
looks P830i array controllers are not yet supported by REAR.

Just want to confirm if fix/patch/update for the 800 series controller
is imminent.

Regards

Kush

@kushns did you run into troubles with rear? If yes, could you share
what went wrong?

Using rear for P2P migration from ProLiant DL580 G7 to DL380G8. So took
rear image from DL580 G7 server and trying to restore it to DL380G8.

Rear is not recognizing 830i card on DL380G8.

Which OS is installed on your DL580G7? Did you install any HP drivers?

If you install exactly the same on the DL380G8, does it recognize your
830i card? If yes, then we talk about a ReaR bug. If not, then your
source OS is the "problem". The fix would be to install the required
drivers there and then do the P2P migration.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5 is OS for DL580G7. HP PSP
tool is already installed on server.

looks its not recognising 830i card on DL380G8.

If HP does not support 830i for RHEL 5.5 then ReaR cannot do anything
about it. If yes, then ReaR should pick up the drivers. If ReaR does not
pick up the drivers then please provide more details here (e.g. debug
mode log file).

Hi,

I apologies for delay update.....

There is a cciss driver available which can be used to resolve the issue
but minimum requirement for cciss driver is RHEL 5.7 so unfortunately
will not work on RHEL5.5.

It worked for RHEL 5.9 after installing cciss drivers.

We are working with Vender to get the P830i card replaced with P420i
cards.

According to RHEL DL580 G8 is certified for RHEL5.9 onwards only .

Thanks for help......

Thanks

Kush
