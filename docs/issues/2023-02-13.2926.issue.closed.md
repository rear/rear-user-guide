Context: Recovery of 8GB disk on 7.5GB disk, triggering automatic
shrinking.

end of recovery output:

    Comparing disks
    Cannot check write protection by ID for /dev/sda (no ID found)
    Device sda has size 8053063680 bytes but 8589934592 bytes is expected (needs manual configuration)
    Switching to manual disk layout configuration (GiB sizes rounded down to integer)
    /dev/sda had size 8589934592 (8 GiB) but is now 8053063680 (7 GiB)
    Original disk /dev/sda does not exist (with same size) in the target system

    Confirm or edit the disk mapping
    1) Confirm disk mapping and continue 'rear recover'
    2) Confirm identical disk mapping and proceed without manual configuration
    3) Edit disk mapping (/var/lib/rear/layout/disk_mappings)
    4) Use Relax-and-Recover shell and return back to here
    5) Abort 'rear recover'

Looking at the root cause I find in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420\_autoresize\_last\_partitions.sh\#L73](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh#L73)
the following:

    # Avoid 'set -e -u' exit e.g. because of "AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS[@]: unbound variable"
    # note that assigning an empty array like AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS=() does not help
    # against array elements like AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS[0] are unbound variables:
    ${AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS:=}
    ${AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS:=}
    # Set fallbacks (same as default.conf) if mandatory numbers are not set (the user may set them empty):
    ${AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE:=2}
    ${AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE:=10}

    # Skip if not in migration mode:
    is_true "$MIGRATION_MODE" || return 0

that explains also the error message of `line 73: 10: command not found`
which refers to `${AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE:=10}` as
that resolves to just a line with `10` in it.

The change happened in DEc 2021 by @jsmeix in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd3a3bbf6b0ea7a57286b737159f310cd94414e8](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/fd3a3bbf6b0ea7a57286b737159f310cd94414e8)
and I'm wondering about these lines and they are supposed to do.

Maybe a simple `:` is missing in front of the lines, like this:

    # Avoid 'set -e -u' exit e.g. because of "AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS[@]: unbound variable"
    # note that assigning an empty array like AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS=() does not help
    # against array elements like AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS[0] are unbound variables:
    : ${AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS:=}
    : ${AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS:=}
    # Set fallbacks (same as default.conf) if mandatory numbers are not set (the user may set them empty):
    : ${AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE:=2}
    : ${AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE:=10}

    # Skip if not in migration mode:
    is_true "$MIGRATION_MODE" || return 0

Because that variables are set in default.conf  
those assingments normally do nothing - except  
evaluating to a nonsense command.

Sigh!  
I should have tried that more carefully on command line  
or have had a look how plain ':=' is done at other code places.

    # AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE=""

    # ${AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE:=2}
    bash: 2: command not found

    #  echo "'$AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE'"
    '2'

But the intended assignment works nevertheless.  
I think it works because when bash evaluates the command line  
it first sets the variable to the value and  
then it runs the resulting command which fails  
but the variable has the new value nevertheless.

Yes, that is why I suggested to use `: var=val` as a "no-operation"
command instead of `echo`. That way you'd see it in a debug log but not
in a normal log.

BTW, IMHO we should avoid having commands in our scripts that are
expected to fail as we otherwise will never gain the ability to enable
hard error control via `set -eu` or such. It is also super confusing to
find random strange output in the logs that is actually normal without
an indication that it is not a problem.

Of course I did not want to make a command that fails.  
I try hard to not let things fail, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)  
But I am a human - not a bot.
