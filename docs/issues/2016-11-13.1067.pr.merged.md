See \#1065.  
If Self-Describing Metadata (CRC) is enabled on boot filesystem, and
`xfs_admin` updates filesystem UUID, this sets incompatible flag (IF) to
prevent older kernels to mount this filesystem.  
Site effect of IF is that grub-install (resp. grub-probe) fails with
*unknown filesystem* message, which prevents ReaR to correctly install
boot loader.

@gozora  
I would keep it simpler and be more brutal - I meant straightforward
;-)  
Just actually run the better/newer command first and  
if that worked be happy but if it fails fall back to the old method.  
Cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065\#issuecomment-260299845](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1065#issuecomment-260299845)  
and see my  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894/files](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/894/files)  
implementation for (ext\*) filesystems.

Hello @jsmeix,  
This was first thing I've tryed (just to run command and collect return
value, if it fails run something different).  
I had to do something wrong though, because as soon as first command
failed ReaR aborted with message that error occured and I should review
disklayout.conf or diskrestore.sh (don't remember exact message but I
guess you know what I'm talking about).  
But maybe I just used wrong code (if I remember correctly, it was
something like):

    mkfs.xfs -m uuid=<uuid> ...
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        mkfs.xfs -f ..
        xfs_admin -U <uuid> ...
    fi

But I'll try style you've used in \#894 and see how it behaves.

Thanks

V.

@gozora  
regarding "as soon as first command failed ReaR aborted"  
have in mind that in 130\_include\_filesystem\_code.sh  
you generate code that is added (e.g. "echoed") into the  
diskrestore.sh script and (in contrast to the rest of ReaR)  
the diskrestore.sh script runs with

<pre>
set -e
set -x
</pre>

Hello @gdha, @jsmeix  
Hope that with commit bc09f447b18ede0218677d68dd7eb06c28152b13 is all ok
now.  
Must admit that I like "simpler and be more brutal" way much more ;-).

@gozora  
because you wrote "Hope that ... is all ok now."  
I ask if you had tested it and if it works for you?

:-)  
Yes, tested on Centos 7.2 (for Disabled CRC boot) and for Ubuntu Mate
16.4 (for CRC enabled boot).

Then I can "just merge" it.

@gozora  
as always:  
Many thanks for your continuous valuable contributions to ReaR!
