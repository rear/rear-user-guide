Any specification given in the local.conf file for OUTPUT\_URL won't
work for FTP due to a bug in
/usr/share/rear/output/ISO/Linux-i386/90\_transfer\_image.sh on line 23.

It reads:  
lftp -c "open $OUTPUT\_URL; mput $ISO\_DIR/$ISO\_PREFIX.iso"

but I believe should be:  
lftp -c "open $server; cd $path; mput $ISO\_DIR/$ISO\_PREFIX.iso"

I am not sure I understand. This was tested and worked, is it possible
this is related to an older version of lftp ?

The man-page clearly indicates a URL is allowed:

    open [-e cmd] [-u user[,pass]] [-p port] host|url

    Select an ftp server.

I am using lftp version 4.0.9 on Centos 6.4

To what was OUTPUT\_URL set exactly ?

OUTPUT\_URL="[ftp://eonnas1/Dev\_Pool/backup\_backup/bootable\_iso](ftp://eonnas1/Dev_Pool/backup_backup/bootable_iso)"

Incidently is would be nice if OUTPUT\_URL could be pointed to a CIFS
mount like BACKUP\_URL. Right now I have to write the ISO image file to
the share using FTP, but I use CIFS for the actual backup.

CIFS support would gladly be accepted :-)

The script `90_transfer_image.sh` has been removed a while ago. Script
`./default/95_copy_result_files.sh` took over the same functionality. So
far there were no complaints against the revised script - guess we can
close this issue? Any objections?

no comments received - so we assume it's OK to close this issue. Thx
