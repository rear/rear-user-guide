##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Bug Fix** / **Enhancement** (some `shellcheck` warnings may
    have led to a bug, fixing all warning might prevent future bugs
    which enhances this project)

-   Impact: **High**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):  
    \#1040

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    First I **added a GitHub Action for automatic testing in my fork**,
    branch:
    [https://github.com/thomasmerz/rear/tree/issue\_1040\_shellcheck](https://github.com/thomasmerz/rear/tree/issue_1040_shellcheck).  
    Then I made a new branch which was forked off from
    [https://github.com/thomasmerz/rear/tree/issue\_1040\_shellcheck](https://github.com/thomasmerz/rear/tree/issue_1040_shellcheck)
    and fixed one script by another script with having the GitHub Action
    been checking and validating my changes.  
    The final result can be seen
    [here](https://github.com/thomasmerz/rear/tree/issue_1040_shellchecked_version):

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    This PR has fixed all `shellcheck` severity levels of "error" and
    "warning", but not "info" and "style".

Please merge \#2754 before this issue.

I won't find noticeable time for this pull request until ReaR 2.7 was
released, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2751](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2751)  
so I set this pull request's milestone to ReaR v2.8 i.e. after ReaR 2.7
was released.

What's about this PR? Should we still leave it open or are you @jsmeix
@jamacku taking over this `shellcheck`?

@thomasmerz  
as far as I see  
the current main pull request regarding ShellCheck is  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847)  
where @jamacku explained in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847\#issuecomment-1350629324](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847#issuecomment-1350629324)  
the advantages of his approach  
so I think your approach in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2754](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2754)  
became meanwhile obsolete.

In contrast this pull request here is different.  
I would not merge it as is (see my comments above)  
but I would like to be able to have a closer look  
at each of the changes here because I assume it reveals  
this or that issue in ReaR that needs to be fixed.  
But I need some "spare time" to have a closer look  
so I would appreciate it if this pull request here  
is kept pending until I actually found time for it.

@jsmeix , does this PR still offer any value or should we close it due
to so many conflicts and because shellcheck issues are already being
fixed in other commits?

Let's close this one because  
things were implemented sufficiently well via  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2847)
and
