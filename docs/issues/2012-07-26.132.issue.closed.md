My backup service runs over a network that supports jumbo frames (MTU
9000). I had to manually configure this before doing a restore. Here's a
patch to capture the MTU within the network setup script, which worked
for me.

Can you submit this in a pull request so you will get proper credit?

One thing I would change is test for the existence of `$sysfspath/mtu`
instead of using `BugIfError`. It is not critical to have mtu
information for most users.

So, "pull request" being something to do with github? I'll have to work
out how to do this.

Agree with possible missing mtu file. If it DOES exist, but mtu is
empty, something is fishy, so I reckon I still PrintIfError in that
case. Something like this perhaps:

    if test -e $sysfspath/mtu ; then
        mtu="$(cat $sysfspath/mtu)"
        PrintIfError "could not read a MTU address from '$sysfspath/mtu'!"
        [[ "$mtu" ]] && echo "ip link set dev $dev mtu $mtu" >> $netscript
    fi
