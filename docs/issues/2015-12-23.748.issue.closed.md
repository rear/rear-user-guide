ipv6 is disabled on server but when we boot the server from ISO and  
choose Recover, there is ipv6 assigned to either eth0 and lo.

This cause problem recovering from EMC Legato Networker with ipv6 name
is not accessible.  
EMC legato Networker check if there is ipv6 assigned to interface, and
if there is , will look to find  
the server name based on ipv6 address defined in /etc/hosts and fails.

We had to delete the ipv6 address on both eth0 and loopback to be able
to communicate with EMC Networker server and recover.

There is an option of adding ipv6 to /etc/hosts, but even with that ,
autorecover from Legato would not work if ipv6 is enabled in rescue mode
while the original server has ipv6 disabled.

There should be an option to disable ipv6.

Thanks

Did you define `USE_DHCLIENT` somewhere in `local.conf` or `site.conf`?
As I see no active IPv6 on your current system (which what you said),
but when looking at the scripts produced by rear I see also **no** IPv6
definitions. It can only be introduced by dhcpd6 I guess?  
You can always force static IP addresses with the variable
`USE_STATIC_NETWORKING=1` if that would be required.

Already tired USE\_STATIC\_NETWORKING=1 in /etc/rear/local.conf  
and the result was the same, ipv6 is being set on eth0.

/etc/rear/local.conf does not have any USE\_DHCLIENT.

I can't find where ipv6 is being set in any of the scripts.  
The only place ipv6 address is being set is when we set dhcp ipv6 but  
dhcp is not installed on server

Correct me if I am wrong.

In line 64 of 21\_include\_dhclient.sh:  
64 \[ ! -z "$DHCLIENT6\_BIN" \] && USE\_DHCLIENT=y

This means if DHCLIENT6\_BIN is not empty set USE\_DHCLIENT to y which
seems to be correct  
but on my server, below lines always return y:

I even tried passing the ip and nm to kernel at boot time, but still

I agree, I don't see any command that set ipv6 in rootfs, but I think
some how USE\_DHCLIENT is being set and dhcpd6 is being called. is it
possible it is defined in kernel config file ?

@blaxxton to be 100% sure you could add `set -x` to the script
`./skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/58-start-dhclient.sh` and
rebuild the rescue image and boot from it. Then you should see what it
does... According to me the variable `USE_DHCLIENT` should **not** be
set and this script should be skipped for that reason.  
Otherwise, you could see what is running with `ps ax` on your rescue
system. Or, the `/var/log/messages` could give a hint of what happened.
It is a bit of mystery...

I don't think running set -x option to debug would help because you were
right, and there is no where in script that ipv6 being set using ip
command.

adding EXCLUDE\_MODULES=( ipv6 ) to /etc/rear/local.conf fixed my
problem and not seeing any ipv6 address assigned to either loopback or
eth0.

This is RedHat 6 and even after disabling ipv6 in
/etc/modprobe.d/ipv6.conf, I can see ipv6 modules in modprobe -l output.

According to RedHat Document:  
[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/72733](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/72733)

The root cause of the issue is the dracut-network plug-in but we don't
have such a plugin installed.  
resolution at RedHat level is rebuilding the initramfs file.  
The ipv6.conf file will be pulled into the initramfs file, and applied
at the initramfs stage.

I tried rebuilding the initramfs but still am able to see ipv6 modules
also not a very good idea to disable ipv6 module at system level.

somehow , your script create a initramfs that has ipv6 enabled based on
the server.

perhaps you could run once `rear -vd mkrescue` and check under
/tmp/rear/.XXXX/rootfs/etc directory the file `modules`. Is the ipv6
listed in there?

Only one entry in that file:  
cat modules  
vmxnet3

but there is ipv6 module in /var/lib/rear/recovery/initrd\_modules  
grep ipv6 /var/lib/rear/recovery/initrd\_modules

grep ipv6 var/lib/rear/recovery/initrd\_modules

ipv6 is being added to interfaces when kernel is being loaded.

IMHO we should actively suppress IPv6 as long as we don't handle it
properly (with a flag to suppress that mechanism). So far we had more
reports of "IPv6 broke my environment" than of "Please handle IPv6
properly".

I think it is a good idea to disable ipv6 since ipv4 is always
availablein all environments, even those that has set up ipv6 on their
networkbut ipv6 would cause problem for those that has not setup ipv6 in
thier environments and add extra steps to disable ipv6 to be able to
recover.  
I don't think there is any environment totally on ipv6 and no ipv4.  
If yes, then it is a good idea to have it in config file.

One more note:  
We don't want to disable ipv6 at kernel level or even we don't want to
disable loading ipv6since there might be some interdepency between
modules.  
So we decided to disable ipv6 only in /etc/sysctl.conf
and /etc/sysconfig/network.  
I checked the
script /usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/26\_collect\_initrd\_modules.sh
and all it does copying the current initrd and initrmfs along with
modules but these are still having ipv6 enabled.  
It is best to recreate the initramfs while disabling ipv6 and then copy
it over:dracut --omit-drivers ipv6 /tmp/initramfs-$(uname -r).img
$(uname -r)  
so if there is a directive in config file, initramfs will be recreated
and then copies overand if there is no directive initramfs directly
copies over with no change.

IMHO ReaR should faithfully copy what you did on your source system. If
you  
disabled IPv6 in sysctl.conf then we should just copy that.

A quick look reveals that sysctl is not handled by ReaR whatsoever.
Maybe  
we should just add a "copy all sysctl.conf stuff over and activate it
on  
boot" feature to solve your problem.

@blaxxton could you check the `/var/lib/rear/recovery/` directory to
find out if the necessary `nsr_*` files were properly created? The NSR
scripts were not modified in the last month, so I don't get it.

What I noticed, if\_inet6 is with size of 0 either with older version or
the current one.  
and ipv6 is in initrd\_modules on both old and new version.  
On new version I have some additional pv-uuid in diskbyid\_mappings  but
not sure if it is related.

The actual error is complaining about:  
no matching IP interface data domain devices for save of client
Client\_Name check storage nodes, devices or pools.

but old version can do the backup with no problem.  
What change you made in new version to fix the ipv6 ?  
Thanks

@blaxxton Did you still had an IPv6 address after you booted from the
rescue image?  
In rescue image you will find a new script
`/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/65-sysctl.sh` that read the
`/etc/sysctl*.conf` files.  
Furthermore, did you check the content of
`/var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr_server` and
`/var/lib/rear/recovery/nsr_paths`?

Still ipv6 there.

I think becuase 65-sysctl.sh only including /etc/sysctl.d/\*.conf and
missing including /etc/sysctl.conf.

run sysctl /etc/sysctl.conf and /etc/sysctl.d/\*.conf files
===========================================================

for file in /etc/sysctl.d/\*.conf ; do  
test -f "$file" && sysctl -e -p "$file" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1  
done  
test -f /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -e -p /etc/sysctl.conf &gt;/dev/null
2&gt;&1

nsr\_server and nsr\_paths seems to be ok and contain the server name
and file systems are being backed up.  
Thanks

@blaxxton did you re-run your tests with the latest modifications? In
rescue mode you could run `sysctl -a|grep ipv6` to verify the status of
IPv6.  
On the other hand, the link
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IPv6\#Disable\_IPv6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IPv6#Disable_IPv6)
contains some useful information of parameters that can be added to
`KERNEL_CMDLINE` (in `/etc/rear/local.conf`)

Ok, thanks, the scripts is fixed and now it can read /etc/sysctl.conf,
but still there is ipv6 address assigned after booting from ISO.

Booted from ISO and sysctl -a | grep -i ipv6 | grep disable shows that
ipv6 is enabled.  
65-sysctl.sh was not executable, so I did chmod 755 65-sysctl.sh and
then ran ./65-sysctl.sh  
now ipv6 is gone.

Some how 65-sysctl.sh script is not being executed at boot time.

Can you please check why this script is not being called or executed
when we boot from ISO ?

Thanks

Can we disable backing up the ISO file in NSR ?We run rear mkrescue to
create the ISO to boot from but at the end it backup the ISO file as
well.  
We already backing up the server every night, and finding the correct
default backup pool is not always accurateso why not disabling the
backup of ISO at the time of creation, and only save it locally in
disksince we are going to back it up at night.  
Can this be done ?  
The other question is:Consider we run daily rear mkrescue , and server
crashes today but we find out the best recover time is last week and
not today, how at recover time and after booting from ISO  I can specify
specific date to recover ?  
Thanks
