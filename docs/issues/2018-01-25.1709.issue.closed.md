In ReaR 2.3, the default of `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE` is determined by
checking for at least one of `/dev/ttyS[0-9]*` being operational
(`200_include_serial_console.sh`). This leads to an incomplete boot on a
rescue system if none of `/dev/ttyS[0-9]*` is connected to an actual
console.

I have seen the following behavior with rescue images generated on a
bare metal server with `ttyS[012]`:

#### Boot appears to hang (`/dev/ttyS0` operational on the recovery system but not connected to an actual console)

Only kernel messages were appearing on the virtual console device:

...and the system appeared to hang...

...while the important stuff was hidden from view (only showing up on
the serial port `/dev/ttyS0` which was not connected to an actual
console):

#### Boot is incomplete because `/etc/scripts/system-setup` fails (`/dev/ttyS0` is operational on the recovery system but not connected to an actual console)

    sysinit.service: Failed at step STDIN spawning /etc/scripts/system-setup: Inappropriate ioctl for device

In my view it would be safer to set `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE='n'` in
`default.conf`. Then, if serial console auto-detection was desired, it
would have to be stated explicitly (maybe even use an `auto` term for
that instead of the current empty setting). What do you think?

@didacog  
this issue is perhaps of interest for you  
because you implemented recently something  
related to serial console setup in the recovery system  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1649](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1649)

@gdha  
perhaps this issue is also of interest for you because of your

@OliverO2  
in general regarding debugging issues with the start up scripts  
that are run initially in the ReaR recovery system have a look at

@OliverO2 what OS versions are you using?  
We tested this with Centos/RHEL 7 and Debian/Ubuntu (systemd) booting
rescue with and without serial devices attached and/or in use, also with
Physical and Virtual systems, and booted as expected after the last
changes were applied.

@OliverO2  
in general we cannot "just change" a ReaR default behaviour  
because that would be perceived as a regression by this or that users  
who use ReaR under the assumption that the default behaviour  
is a reliable behaviour (i.e. the old problem when some default  
of whatever software is actually required by some users).

In particular if we set USE\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE='n' in default.conf  
it would be perceived as a regression by those users who currently use
ReaR  
under the assumption that ReaR "just reliably supports" their serial
console.

Ideally we could avoid this issue here by making the scripts  
and the systemd unit files that set up serial console in the  
recovery system behave more robust against possible failure.

Simply put:  
When only serial console setup fails in the recovery system  
this is no reason to let the whole recovery system setup fail.

@didacog I tested on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS server. The issues came up when
restoring a rescue system built on a production bare metal server
(Supermicro X10SLH-F mainboard with IPMI support). I've tried but was
unable to reproduce those on a minimal Ubuntu server running as a
VirtualBox guest.

@jsmeix I am aware that addressing this would be a backward-incompatible
change. Failing gracefully on startup would be an alternative but might
not be that easy to implement. Anyway, if this feature is kept as is,
hopefully users could at least consult this issue when they experience
seemingly hanging or incomplete boots of their rescue system.

@OliverO2 Do you experience this also with a recent Ubuntu version?

@gdha I haven't had the chance to test this as the (only) affected
system over here has not been migrated to a newer Ubuntu version yet.

@OliverO2 any idea if this issue is still relevant to keep it open?

@gdha I'll probably try this one again in April on Ubuntu 18.04. If I
get results, I'll post them here. If you wish, you can as well close it
for now, since it seems to depend on rare circumstances, so the issue is
mostly for documentation.

Last day of April, so here we go:

I have tested this again with a current rear snapshot (f3157906) on
Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS:

-   I have used the same bare metal server to create the rescue system
    on which the problem initially appeared.
-   I have started the rescue system on
    -   a bare metal restoration system as well as
    -   VirtualBox VMs with and without hardware serial ports
        configured.
-   Migration mode was always active with network interface questions
    being asked during startup.
-   `USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE` was always left at its default setting.

**The problem did not reappear in any scenario.**

So maybe it would be worth re-trying the other case (\#2102) with ReaR
2.5 once that version is released. If that one would be also resoved,
the issue has probably been fixed in the mean time.

This issue appear only with virsh console on kvm. Everytime in migration
mode.

In \#2102 you have stated the ReaR version to be 2.4.3. Have you ever
tried a current Git snapshot of ReaR?
