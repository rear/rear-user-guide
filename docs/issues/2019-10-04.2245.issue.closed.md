In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243\#issue-500576450](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2243#issue-500576450)  
I noticed

    AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n

and was wondering if that works or if AUTOEXCLUDE\_MULTIPATH  
is perhaps an old-style boolean variable, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf\#L27](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf#L27)

I found

    # find usr/share/rear | xargs grep 'AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH'

    usr/share/rear/lib/layout-functions.sh:    if [[ -n "$res" || "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH" =~ ^[yY1] ]]; then
    usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf:AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=y
    usr/share/rear/conf/examples/RHEL7-PPC64LE-Multipath-PXE-GRUB.conf:AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/335_remove_excluded_multipath_vgs.sh:# If AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n is used in combination with ONLY_INCLUDE_VG or
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/335_remove_excluded_multipath_vgs.sh:if is_true $AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH ; then
    usr/share/rear/layout/save/default/320_autoexclude.sh:if [[ "$AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH" =~ ^[yY1] ]] ; then

so that `AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n` should work but  
nowadays `is_true()` and `is_false()` should be used consistently.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2260](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2260)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.

But I could not test it because I do not use multipath.  
I would appreciate it if ReaR users who use multipath  
could test it as long as ReaR 2.6 is still under development  
and report if there are regressions so that I can fix them,  
preferably each one as a new and separated GitHub issue.
