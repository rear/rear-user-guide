-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    After successful rear recovery, can't boot the recovered image
    because the system can't locate the kernel. After further
    inspection, the following symbolic link (which is in the original
    image), is missing from the recovered image:

<!-- -->

    /boot/grub2/grubenv -> ../efi/EFI/redhat/grubenv

-   Workaround, if any:  
    After successful recovery, go to the recovered image (before final
    boot) and create the symbolic link manually.

@prolly-brent  
had it worked before with ReaR 2.4?

If yes, I think it is related to my changes in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843)  
therein in particular this commit  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/32098b9add5eec20b28df8e7da26b785316961b8](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1843/commits/32098b9add5eec20b28df8e7da26b785316961b8)  
where its commit message reads (excerpt):

    ... move restored /boot/grub2/grubenv away by default

that is done via a change of BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES  
in usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf, see the comment in default.conf  
for the reason behind why the restored /boot/grub2/grubenv  
is moved away by default.

See also in  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/release-notes-2-5)  
the entry

    Fixed, simplified, and enhanced GRUB2 installation on x86 and ppc64le architecture (issues #1828, #1845, #1847, #1437)

that lists some related GitHub issues.

To keep the restored /boot/grub2/grubenv  
set in your /etc/rear/local.conf file

    BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=()

I got the information about the usage/meaning of the `grubenv` file  
from our (i.e. SUSE's) GRUB2 maintainer and if that description is
right  
a missing `/boot/grub2/grubenv -> ../efi/EFI/redhat/grubenv` symlink  
or a missing `grubenv` file cannot cause a boot failure.

Simply put I think GRUB2 should always be able to boot a system  
without any information from a previous boot.

Accordingly I assume the root cause of your boot failure is not  
missing information from a previous boot but something else.

But I am not at all a bootloader or GRUB2 expert so I could be wrong  
and in some cases the `grubenv` file might be even mandatory  
for GRUB2 to be able to boot a system.

@rmetrich  
I guess for you a RHEL7 system recovery with ReaR 2.5 booted o.k.?

@prolly-brent  
your `rear-lnxtst2.log.gz` is only about `rear -D mkbackup`  
but what actually failed for you is `rear -D recover`.

Have a look at the section  
"Debugging issues with Relax-and-Recover" at  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
how to get a `rear -D recover` log file.

[rear-lnxtst2-2019-06-04.log.gz](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3252693/rear-lnxtst2-2019-06-04.log.gz)  
[rear-lnxtst2.log.gz](https://github.com/rear/rear/files/3252694/rear-lnxtst2.log.gz)

I updated the HP Proliant BIOS firmware to the latest level and ran the
recover again and was able to boot (or better said "able to locate the
kernel") after a rear recovery (even without the symlink in place).  
Per your request I attached the recover debug logs. I am a bit concerned
that this program is removing files that were put in place by the RHEL
installation and possible downstream negative effects of that. I will
look into using BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES to prevent this.
Thanks for the suggestions and assistance - much appreciated.

@prolly-brent  
`this program` (i.e. ReaR) even dares to modify files like /etc/fstab  
and lots of others e.g. to update UUIDs and things like that  
and - even more - `this program` recreates initrd and bootloader files  
from scratch anew and all that after the backup was restored - but
that  
is needed to get a consistent new recreated system without
old/outdated  
remainders from the original system that do no longer make sense  
or may even break the new recreated system.  
For details see the `finalize` scripts in ReaR.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2153\#issuecomment-498681818](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2153#issuecomment-498681818)  
this issue does no longer happen after a firmware update.
