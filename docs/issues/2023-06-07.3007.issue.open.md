Since a longer time it worries me  
what we could do if a disaster happens  
to our own ReaR upstream project.

As far as I know we have  
neither a risk analysis  
nor a disaster recovery plan.

Possible threats that I currently imagine:

1.  "Move":  
    GitHub gets suddenly unfriendly to Free Software projects  
    so we need to move to another git hosting service.  
    How can we keep our history that is to a greater extent  
    stored in comments of GitHub issues and pull requests?

2.  "Restart":  
    We let various kind of third-party software "do something"  
    with our sources via so called "GitHub Actions".  
    Because of Murphy's law ("anything that can go wrong will go
    wrong")  
    it will happen sonner or later that our sources get corrupted,  
    regardless if maliciously ("supply chain attack") or by accident.  
    How can we recover our sources to a clean state?  
    If our sources got completely corrupted at GitHub (including
    history),  
    how can we restart from scratch (with reasonable history)  
    at GitHub or at another git hosting service?

I do not see how setting the region where GitHub data is held  
could help with recovering from a disaster at GitHub?

Good point @jsmeix!

The region is IMHO irrelevant.

The source code is actually the least of our worries as we ship a nearly
full copy as part of our "binary" packages and all distros also archive
the full source as part of their source packages. That will allow us to
restart the ReaR project (without the history) without any preparation.

All maintainers probably have the full git checkout on multiple
computers, at least I do. That allows us to recover even with history.

Finally, we can easily add different data backup/distribution schemes:

-   commercial vendors like
    [https://www.gitguardian.com/](https://www.gitguardian.com/) offer a
    *free tier* that fits out size
-   mirror from GitHub to GitLab.com, e.g.
    [https://dev.to/brunorobert/github-and-gitlab-sync-44mn](https://dev.to/brunorobert/github-and-gitlab-sync-44mn)
-   dump the full git repo on every commit via GH Actions job and store
    that somewhere in a free storage provider

What is really important in my opinion would be to do something and then
to make sure that all maintainers are also setup as admins on the other
systems.

We also should include our mailinglist and DNS domain when thinking
about disaster recovery.

My personal primary concern is not the plain git data  
i.e. what one gets via

    # git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

because that is duplicated several times on our local computers.

My personal primary concern is all the other data on GitHub  
in particular our history that is stored in comments  
of GitHub issues and pull requests.

The comments of GitHub issues and pull requests  
provide very most of the resoning behind  
why something was changed (e.g. what had happened  
at a specific user that finally led to a change).

For example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2990\#issuecomment-1562481526](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2990#issuecomment-1562481526)  
where I would have had no idea why wipefs is called with '--force'  
if the originating issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1327)  
was no longer available.

E.g. think about  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/rear-release-notes.txt)  
when all the issues and pull requests that are mentioned therein  
would be no longer accessible or available.

How much money are we (all the maintainers together) willing to spend on
a commercial backup plan that covers that?

For backup, it is important that the backup data can be used, e.g.
restored somewhere or viewed in the backup system. Otherwise it is just
a blob of useless data.

Because SUSE does a lot of its upstream work at GitHub  
I will ask internally at SUSE about disaster recovery  
for GitHub projects where SUSE does upstream work.

@pcahyna  
I guess it is the same for Red Hat?

If SUSE and Red Hat can cover ReaR's GitHub org with their backup
procedures that would be really great, thanks a lot!

That will not cover our mailing list nor DNS domain, right?

Yes, it won't. I think you own the domain and also have access to the
mailing list, but probably nobody else can do anything with them. I'd
mostly be worried about continuity in case you can't deal with that any
more, and about transitioning ownership / access to other maintainers in
such a situation.

Sorry, but I do not own the domain - I think it is owned by @dagwieers
(to be confirmed by Dag itself)?  
About the mailing list I'm an admin of the list, but not of the storage
behind it - that is my biggest concern on this moment. Not sure who owns
it today.

@gdha  
thank you for the link to  
[https://github.com/dwyl/github-backup](https://github.com/dwyl/github-backup)

Such functionality is what I am looking for.

But because it reads

    Additionally we use Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    Simple Storage Service (S3) for storing
    the issue comment history with "high availability"
    and reliability.
    To run github-backup on your localhost you will need
    to have an AWS account and an S3 "bucket". 

I think this one is not useful for us in general  
(at least I have no plans to get an AWS account).

And the need of various secrets like private keys  
does not look very promising to me.

@jsmeix just build a kubernetes cluster with its own block storage ;-)
but then you need to cover DPR for kubernetes as well and then we are
just shifting problems

Maybe  
[https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md\#github-workflow-backup-issues-as-a-markdown-file-in-your-repo](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md#github-workflow-backup-issues-as-a-markdown-file-in-your-repo)  
could be a cheap solution for the issue/PR backup?  
The idea would be to create a dump as markdown files and host that for
free on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) or [Firebase
Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) (10GB free) or
another free hosting service.  
We can run this every night.

At least on first glance the very traditional and simple

    # w3m -no-graph https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3007 >issue3007.txt

seems to produce not too bad results.  
At least plain texts look sufficiently readable  
which is the most important thing from my point of view.
