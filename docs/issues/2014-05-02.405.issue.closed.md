Hi

I noticed that current rear master checkout does not show any network
interfaces (except of lo) in recover mode with a current Debian testing
amd64 system.

I was able to track the commit down which introduced this behavior
(using git bisect). It was first introduced in
4ff29ff439a3d9d5b46911f52e52bbe24346bd52.

My systemd version is:  
systemd 204  
+PAM +LIBWRAP +AUDIT +SELINUX +IMA +SYSVINIT +LIBCRYPTSETUP +GCRYPT +ACL
+XZ

Is systemd-udev not working on Debian?

I think not:

    pgrep -a systemd
    4524 /lib/systemd/systemd-logind

Maybe the test introduced in 4ff29ff439a3d9d5b46911f52e52bbe24346bd52
should also make sure that systemd is running?

@ypid not a bad point - do you know what `systems/systemd-logind` is
used for? I guess only login.

Thats probably it, which is also confirmed by [this
source](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-logind.service.html).

@ypid could you verify if the fix is working for you?

Seems good to me. systemd-udevd is not running on my up to date Debian
testing system.

I can confirm that the network is now configured properly on recover
with d33cc9c676b02552c12b602768c4cbf13fc03623.
