Please fill in the following items before submitting a new pull request:

##### Pull Request Details:

-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **Normal**

-   Reference to related issue (URL):

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    internally

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:

Instead of just checking the return code of sed (which is 1 even if no
patch is done)

        sed  "$sed_script" "$restored_file" || LogPrintError "Migrating filesystem UUIDs in $restored_file to current UUIDs failed";

I suggest to check if the file was really modified and print an error if
not:

        LogPrint "Patching filesystem UUIDs in $restored_file to current UUIDs"
        # Do not error out at this late state of "rear recover" (after the backup was restored) but inform the user:
        sed -i.prerear "$sed_script" "$restored_file" || LogPrintError "Migrating filesystem UUIDs in $restored_file to current UUIDs failed";

        # sed does not print an error if the pattern is not found in the file, thus we keep a backup and compare it to patched file:
        if test -f "$restored_file".prerear; then
            diff "$restored_file" "$restored_file".prerear  >&2 && LogPrintError "WARNING: File $restored_file has not been modified during UUID migration, please check if the old UUID is correct: sed script: *$sed_script *"
            rm -f "$restored_file".prerear
        fi

Please note: This will not cover the case when multiple UUID must be
updated and only one is not...  
And also, we will have false warning because some files should not be
updated (/etc/default/grub for example).  
A deeper modification might be necessary to have a sed script for each
UUID, thus we will be able to detect which one is missing when it should
be (but even in this case, false warning will appear).

@bwelterl  
thank you for your fix!  
I will have a look tomorrow (if nothing gets in my way).

I believe the selinux changes should not be there, they belong to a
different PR.

ooops thanks, the PR is only on
usr/share/rear/finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh ...

Thanks for the PR, but I am afraid this will not work as expected. What
if the file does not contain the UUID at all, therefore does not require
patching? You mention `/etc/default/grub`, but there are other cases
(there is no requirement to mount devices by UUID in fstab, you can
mount them by label or by device path), so in many cases it is entirely
OK that sed does not patch anything. Lots of false warning will be
printed and either scare the user, or will be ignored.

I have another idea for detecting these kinds of problems. Could
`mkrescue` save checksums of all the files that need to be patched,
`recover` check them before patching them, and if any checksum differs,
warn?

Regarding checksums of (config) files, cf.  
layout/compare/default/510\_compare\_files.sh

This is currently only run in case of "rear checklayout",  
cf. lib/checklayout-workflow.sh  
but we could do something like that also for "rear mkrescue".

Furthermore we could clean up things by using only the  
already existing CHECK\_CONFIG\_FILES array  
(or a more general similar array) in default.conf  
everywhere instead of hardcoded file lists in scripts like  
finalize/GNU/Linux/280\_migrate\_uuid\_tags.sh

This would also provide "final power to the user"  
when the user can specify what files to check and migrate  
if the default array setting is not what he needs.

The larger issue is what to do when a checksum mismatch is detected -
the recovered system is likely broken then and it is too late to produce
a correct/consistent backup.  
Of course, any "Print error" approach, such as the one in this PR, will
suffer from the same problem.

I think what @bwelterl intends is to only detect  
when the recovered system could be broken  
so he could manually fix things after "rear recover"  
in the still running recovery system  
in contrast to now where all looks well  
but then the recreated system fails to boot.

This pull request should be obsoleted by  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795)  
which implements a more generic check to detect  
when restored basic system files do not match the recreated system.
