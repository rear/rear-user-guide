-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

According to Borg documentation the `--prefix` parameter is deprecated
and should not be used anymore.

[https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html)  
[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/7031](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/7031)

In my logs I get this warning:

    Pruning old backup archives in Borg repository /./xxxx-backup on xxx.xxx.xx
    Warning: "--prefix" has been deprecated. Use "--glob-archives 'yourprefix*'" (-a) instead.

I'm assuming that although the BORGBACKUP\_ARCHIVE\_PREFIX="$HOSTNAME"
works for now it should be replaced for something like this?

`BORGBACKUP_ARCHIVE_GLOB="$HOSTNAME-*"`

What do you think?  
Thanks.

I am not a BACKUP=BORG user  
so I cannot actually help with BACKUP=BORG specific issues.

@llucps  
do you know since when --glob-archives is supported by Borg?  
I.e. since which Borg version is --glob-archives supported?

I ask because in ReaR we maintain backward compatibility, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style\#maintain-backward-compatibility](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style#maintain-backward-compatibility)

So we cannot replace --prefix with --glob-archives  
instead we must find some reasonable solution  
that works for older and newer Borg versions.

But we do not need to maintain backward compatibility  
for obsoleted Borg versions that are no longer supported  
by upstream Borg.

On  
[https://www.borgbackup.org/releases/](https://www.borgbackup.org/releases/)  
I found (excerpts)

    Borg 2.0 is currently in testing - do not use it for production.

    Borg 1.4 is currently in testing - do not use it for production.

    Borg 1.2 is the current stable series of Borg.
    The current release is 1.2.7, released on 2023-12-02.

    Borg 1.1 is not supported any more, please use Borg 1.2.x.
    The current release is 1.1.18, released on 2022-06-05.

    Borg 1.0 is not supported any more, please use Borg 1.2.x.
    The last release in this series was 1.0.13, released on 2019-02-15.

@jsmeix According the the release notes the --glob-archives option was
introduced in borg 1.2.2 (2022-08-20)

[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.2.7/docs/changes.rst\#version-122-2022-08-20](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.2.7/docs/changes.rst#version-122-2022-08-20)

[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/6806\#issuecomment-1170319393](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/6806#issuecomment-1170319393)
actually states that Borg 2.0 will not support the `--prefix` option any
more, so the 1.x series presumably will continue to support it.

@llucps can you tell us how much our ReaR code will have to change in
order to support Borg 2.x? If this is the only change, then we should
just adjust it. But if there are more incompatible changes then we
should maybe consider adding a `BORG2` backup method that is fully
optimised for the Borg 2.x series. We have also other backup methods
(most notably `GALAXY`) where we have multiple backup methods to support
multiple versions of the same backup software.
