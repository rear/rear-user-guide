Apparently the only usage of rear\_vol\_id was as part of the dr/recover
stages and since they have been removed, we can get rid of this. My only
concern is that if we would need this functionality at some point in the
future, it would be silly to not have this massive piece of experience
at our fingertips. Because this piece of code (how ugly it is) worked
for very old to recent distributions.

So what shall we do with this ?

The issue \#73 seems like to want to reintroduce *blkid* again, so we
might need it back to fix this issue.

Rely on git to show us the past?
