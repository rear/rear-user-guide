@lzaoral  
Wow!  
Looks "rather interesting" to me as a total ZIPL noob ;-)  
Now I have a starting point :-)  
Thank you for it!

Glad to hear that! ðŸ˜„ BTW, if you accidentally overwrite the `zipl`
configuration of your host (e.g. when using the same device for storing
the kernel and initrd) when experimenting, you can just call `zipl`
without any argument to restore it to the default values (at least on
Fedora/RHEL).
