The following line breaks serial for me on some hardware/kernels/bios
versions if ttyS0 is also used.  
This should not get added in such a case.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/6a3d0b4d5e73c69a62ce0bd209b2b38ffb462569/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/400\_use\_serial\_console.sh\#L24](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/6a3d0b4d5e73c69a62ce0bd209b2b38ffb462569/usr/share/rear/rescue/GNU/Linux/400_use_serial_console.sh#L24)

Also I still think it would be better to have an option for devices
which should be used instead of using all tty devs found. This is true
for every occurance of this search tty code.

Yes, that whole serial console code should be overhauled.

It is also rather old code that I tried to ignore as good as I could  
(in particular because I do not have serial console hardware)  
but it seems someone ;-) again forces me to finally clean up things :-)

As an additional note on this issue:  
From my understanding having `console=ttyS0,115200n8` and `console=tty0`
in the kernel line should actually work and did work for all ubuntu
versions up to and including ubuntu18. My understanding is that some
systemd and tty auto setup related bug causes the system not to start
since ubuntu20 systemd changes.

Giving the user more control over which tty devices get used is a good
idea in any case sine some may be connected to other devices/hardware
and it may also be a security concern running getty on all of them.
