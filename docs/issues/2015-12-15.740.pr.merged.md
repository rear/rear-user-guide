Rename RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT into TARGET\_FS\_ROOT to describe what it
actually is.

The former name RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/708))
is misleading.  
In the "recover" workflow it is not the root of the filesystem tree of
the recovery system  
but it is the root of the filesystem tree of the to-be-recovered
system  
i.e. it is the root of the filesystem tree of the target system of the
"recover" workflow.  
Furthermore the former name RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT is incomprehensible in
future workflows  
like the "install" workflow (see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/732))  
where the root of the filesystem tree of the to-be-installed system  
would have to be called INSTALL\_FS\_ROOT to have a meaningful name.  
Therefore the name TARGET\_FS\_ROOT is now used because  
it describes what it actually is independent of the workflow.

Did you consider `RESCUE_FS_ROOT`? It comes to my mind since it is
actually only relevant for the `mkrescue` part of ReaR.

@schlomo  
in the current sources no file of the "mkrescue" workflow  
contains 'RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT' or 'mnt/local'

<pre>
# for f in $( rear -s mkrescue | grep '^Source ' | sed -e 's/^Source /\/usr\/share\/rear\//' ) ; do egrep -H '_FS_ROOT|mnt/local' $f ; done
[no output]
</pre>

therefore I do not understand how it is relevant at all  
for the mkrescue part of ReaR.

Perhaps you got already confused by the misleading "RECOVERY"  
in 'RECOVERY\_FS\_ROOT'?

@jsmeix good point - I stand corrected.

+1 for meaningful rename :-)
