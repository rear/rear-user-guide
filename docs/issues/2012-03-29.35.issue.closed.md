Original report
---------------

installed rear 1.12 by copying etc and usr to the root file system.
edited /etc/rear/local.conf to simply have OBDR Backup on `/dev/st0` (HP
Storageworks DAT320 USB).

    OUTPUT=OBDR
    BACKUP_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
    BACKUP=NETFS

After sucessfull `rear mkbackup` i tried to boot from tape but the tape
drive ejects the tape after a while and the server boots from hdd.

I then used HP Dataprotector to test OBDR functionality and this worked.

I then formated the tape again with "rear format /dev/st0"

And made rear mkbackup again with the same options.

Now I get a bootloader, but it is the Dataprotector Bootloader(look at
the screenshot attached). But it surely cannot boot because the right
ramdisk is missing or whatever.

Logfile said this:  
2012-01-18 16:01:41 Wrote ISO Image /tmp/rear-dc-vserver.iso (39M)  
2012-01-18 16:01:41 Including output/OBDR/default/81\_write\_image.sh  
2012-01-18 16:01:41 Writing ISO image to tape  
19686+0 records in  
19686+0 records out  
40316928 bytes (40 MB) copied, 28.0842 s, 1.4 MB/s

For me it looks like the bootloader isnt written to the tape or it is
written at the wrong position?

here i am! i still have to create and dump a tape from data protector
express. then find out what is different. didnt find any specs that
shows a difference between OBDR on DAT160 and DAT320.

Hi Kai-Olaf,

We have made a few assumptions in the past regarding the OBDR
implementation that worked with the various hardware we had at that
moment.

-   Padding of 20 blocks (using zeros and blocksize of 512 bytes
    hardcoded)
-   Label at the very start of padding (blocksize of 512 bytes
    hardcoded)
-   OBDR blocksize of 2048 bytes `OBDR_BLOCKSIZE=2048`
-   Padding, label and OBDR image are written with compression disabled

It would be nice to find out how HP DataProtector writes a bootable
tape, but it could be equally useful to know whether Mondo Rescue is
doing it correctly for this tape device. Unfortunately there is no tool
(that I know of) to inspect what is written on a tape-device and in what
blocksize. If the blocksize is incorrect you get an input/output error
if I am correct. But you also get an input/output error if anything else
is wrong, so a tool that attempts various access using a permutation of
options and blocksizes would be very useful IMO.

In more than one occasion this would have helped a lot. Having access to
various tape drives would be useful too :-)

I have all DAT and all LTO drives from HP here :-) But not the time to
test them all. Tested LTO2 and DAT160 successfully. That are the drives
we currently sell to customers.

I found the time to look closer at this problem. So the problem is that
after writing the rear OBDR-header, the tape is not exactly at block
20.  
Although "mt -f /dev/nst0 tell" says "At block 20" dd cant read the ISO
Image.

Read the Header:

TAPE\_DEVICE=/dev/nst0  
OBDR\_BLOCKSIZE=2048  
mt -f /dev/nst0 tell  
At block 0.  
dd if=$TAPE\_DEVICE of=tape-rear-header4 bs=512 count=20  
20+0 records in  
20+0 records out  
10240 bytes (10 kB) copied, 12.9311 s, 0.8 kB/s

Look where we are after reading the header:

mt -f /dev/nst0 tell  
At block 20.

Ok it says 20, but when I try to dd, it first cannot read the iso:

mt -f "${TAPE\_DEVICE}" setblk ${OBDR\_BLOCKSIZE:-0}  
dd if=$TAPE\_DEVICE of=tape-rear-iso
${OBDR\_BLOCKSIZE:+bs=$OBDR\_BLOCKSIZE}  
0+0 records in  
0+0 records out  
0 bytes (0 B) copied, 0.0291118 s, 0.0 kB/s

Without rewinding or seeking I repeat the tell command, it even says 20,
but now it is at the beginning of the iso and can read it:  
mt -f /dev/nst0 tell  
At block 20.  
dd if=$TAPE\_DEVICE of=tape-rear-iso
${OBDR\_BLOCKSIZE:+bs=$OBDR\_BLOCKSIZE}  
34049+0 records in  
34049+0 records out  
69732352 bytes (70 MB) copied, 18.9389 s, 3.7 MB/s

The rear tape is not bootable when the ISO is not exactly positioned.
I've compared the functioning DataProtector Express tape, there the iso
begins exactly at block 20.

The solution for me getting a working ReaR Tape on DAT320 was to add a
line at the bottom of the WRITE\_OBDR\_HEADER Skript that seeks the tape
exactly at block 20.  
mt -f "${TAPE\_DEVICE}" seek 20

I dont know yet why the tape drive does not behave like the other one's
but so it is now.  
Best regards

Very interesting !

Small question, did you modify the device's blocksize (to 512) before
padding zeroes ? You did not specifically state that. Rear should do
that correctly though. If the `seek 20` fixes the problem, we should add
this it should not harm.

Problem is, we don't have any gear to actually test this change so are
you willing to test this on all the gear you have available ?

ReaR should only "LogIfError" because "seek" is not available on all
tape drives and in 99% OBDR works without seeking.

From the mt manual:  
... (SCSI tapes) Seek to the count block on the tape. This operation is
available on some Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape
drives...

up on a 10 years old one.

@arunmani004 Just click on the green "new issue" button and fill in the
template you see appearing.  
BTW this is the first sign of OBDR being still used since 2012...

yes, we were discussing recently that OBDR support seems broken and
nobody seems to have noticed (and we have no way to test it).

Only as a final side note in this issue here  
(I never used any tape device so what I write here is plain guesswork):

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/35\#issuecomment-898999159](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/35#issuecomment-898999159)  
contains

    ERROR: Tape in device '//dev/nst0' is not online.

which does not look like an error inside ReaR but an error in ReaR's
environment  
namely that the tape device which is needed by ReaR is "not online"  
so probably an admin may have to do something to make it "online"  
before running "rear mkbackup".

Furthermore OBDR only works with some specific HP tape devices, cf.

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/35\#issuecomment-898999159](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/35#issuecomment-898999159)  
does not tell what exact tape device is used - as far as I see.

OBDR will be declared deprecated so it could be removed later, see
