Hi,  
I've been using rear for a couple of months with debian 7.0 and kernel
3.12-1-amd64. A week ago I had problems after a system update and found
that rear cannot mount a partition due to lack of ext3 module. So I had
to rebuild the system from scratch. Am I right that rear demands a
custom build kernel in debian with ext3 fs support enabled?  
Best regards  
Dirk

Normally `ext3` or `ext4` are built into the kernel. Please verify if it
copies the kernel modules to the rear image. If not, you could add it to
the `MODULES_LOAD` array.  
Test, test and test your rear images on-front please (in a lab
environment).

Many thanks gdha!

ext3 support is not integrated by default into current debian kernels

lsmod | grep ext  
ext4 465607 5  
crc16 12343 2 ext4,bluetooth  
mbcache 13082 1 ext4  
jbd2 82560 1 ext4

I had assumed that a module that is being integrated in the rear backup
archive, has to be running on the machine, that is being backuped. I'll
try your suggestion with the MODULES\_LOAD parameter!

This was obviously no ext3 issue but I'm still stuck. Here's the log
output of `rear recover`

Any idea? I'm using the following settings in default.conf

    BACKUP=NETFS
    OUTPUT=USB
    OUTPUT_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"

The usb disk has been formatted with `rear format /dev/sdc`

@dwerner1 Could you try using `OUTPUT_URL=usb:///dev/sdc1` instead? Also
verify if `udevd` is running in rescue mode?
