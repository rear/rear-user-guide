Maybe there is/will be a more sophisticated approach to determine the
required users "automagically".  
This would be benefitial because i.e. on Ubuntu 18.04.4 I see the
`rpcbind `runs under `root` which will not lead to such an issue there.

Now I found why using `ARRAY+=( additional elements )`  
lets array things work more fail-safe, see  
the initial description of @pcahyna in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2220)  
where he wrote (excerpt):

    In the present case, a less invasive change would be
    to replace the appending to the array

       CLONE_USERS=( "${CLONE_USERS[@]:-}" daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus )

    by '+=', i.e.

       CLONE_USERS+=( daemon rpc usbmuxd usbmux vcsa nobody dbus )

    (I've verified that '+=' works properly
     even in bash 3 and 'set -ue'.)
    This would fix the present case and other cases
    where the problem lies in appending to arrays,
    but not those where the array is already initialized to ("").

@hpannenb üëç to the replacement of array operations by `+=`, even if this
is not the main point of the PR. See \#2220 , \#2223

Yes it is a bit unfortunate that we must hard-code such special
knowledge.

@pcahyna  
see
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2345](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2345)  
for a possible solution that would be simple and generic  
without endless mainenance of hard-coded special knowledge.
