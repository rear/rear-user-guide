-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    Usually this is not needed but if the worst comes to the worst  
    an easy way to specify mkfs.xfs options it is likely highly
    appreciated.

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    Currently it is not at all tested by me.  
    Currently it is meant so that @gozora can have a first look, cf.  
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1998\#issuecomment-447325672](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1998#issuecomment-447325672)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Via the new optional global MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS config variable  
    the user can specify mkfs.xfs options for all mkfs.xfs calls  
    and/or via optional device specific config variables like  
    MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS\_SDA2  
    the user can specify mkfs.xfs options only for the mkfs.xfs call  
    for that dvice (e.g. for /dev/sda2 via MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS\_SDA2)  
    where device specific config variables take precedence over  
    a global MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS config variable which  
    takes precedence over the not changed default behaviour  
    where device specific options for the mkfs.xfs calls are set via  
    `xfs_parse $LAYOUT_XFS_OPT_DIR/$xfs_device_basename.xfs`

Great, I am wondering about the following question: Why not feed the
content of the variables into the
`$LAYOUT_XFS_OPT_DIR/$xfs_device_basename.xfs` files and skip the whole
logic of sourcing the XFS options from both files and config vars? Won't
that make it simpler?

@schlomo  
Syntax of `$LAYOUT_XFS_OPT_DIR/$xfs_device_basename.xfs` and
`MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS` is not compatible.  
`$LAYOUT_XFS_OPT_DIR/$xfs_device_basename.xfs` hold plain output of
`xfs_info` which looks something like:

    meta-data=/dev/sda               isize=512    agcount=66, agsize=268435392 blks
             =                       sectsz=4096  attr=2, projid32bit=1
             =                       crc=1        finobt=0 spinodes=0
    data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=17580367872, imaxpct=1
             =                       sunit=64     swidth=576 blks
    naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
    log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=521728, version=2
             =                       sectsz=4096  sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1
    realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

and need additional parsing by ReaR `xfs_parse` function.

Where `MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS` accepts plain options for `mkfs.xfs` command
like
`-i size=512 -d agcount=4 -s size=512 -i attr=2 -i projid32bit=1 -m crc=1 -m finobt=1 -b size=4096 -i maxpct=25 -d sunit=0 -d swidth=0 -l version=2 -l lazy-count=1 -n size=4096 -n version=2 -r extsize=4096`

V.

@schlomo  
in general regarding your above questions:  
Have MIGRATION\_MODE in mind.

When XFS filesystems get recreated on same hardware  
things "just work" (except the original system is already broken).

But when things do not "just work"  
(e.g. because of different replacement hardware  
or because the original system is already broken  
as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1998](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1998))  
then we are in MIGRATION\_MODE.

My point is that MIGRATION\_MODE can be expected by the user  
(when he recreates on different replacement hardware)  
but MIGRATION\_MODE can also happen all of a sudden  
when things do not "just work" for whatever reason.

When we are in MIGRATION\_MODE and "rear recover" fails  
then ReaR should provide means so that the user can  
relatively easily recover by some manual intervention.

Currently such manual intervention is often adapting diskrestore.sh  
which is not really user-friendly (I consider code hacking within  
the recovery system in general not really user-friendly) and  
it becomes annoying and error-prone when the user has to
receate/migrate  
many systems because he would have to manually adapt diskrestore.sh  
again and again for each system.

Config variables like MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS and
MKFS\_XFS\_OPTIONS\_$device  
are meant to make the user's life a bit easier in such cases because
with  
such config variables he could do things like

    # export MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS="generic options"
    # export MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_SDA2="all options for sda2"
    # export MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS_SDB3="$MKFS_XFS_OPTIONS additional sdb3 options"
    # rear -D recover

Regarding `it should break during 'mkrescue' and not later` in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005\#pullrequestreview-185396888](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2005#pullrequestreview-185396888)

YES!  
I do fully agree.

But current ReaR is far away from that behaviour, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Developers-Guide)

Current ReaR requires to test "rear recover" on already  
available replacement hardware and see how things work,  
cf. the section "Inappropriate expectations" in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)

But sometimes (perhaps even often in practice) "rear recover"  
was not sufficiently tested (or the last test was too long ago),  
cf. `continuous validation` in  
[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster\_Recovery](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery)  
so that "rear recover" unexpectedly fails when it is a real disaster
recovery  
( according to Murphy's Law it only fails when it is a real disaster
recovery ;-)  
and then the poor user is inside the recovery system where he must  
get things back to work...

I have tested it and for me with a simple XFS it works o.k.

Now it uses LogPrint to show exceptional info on the user's terminal  
and Log when things happen as usual: "no news is good news".

If there are no severe objections I would like to merge it today
afternoon.  
Of course I could further enhance it later if needed.
