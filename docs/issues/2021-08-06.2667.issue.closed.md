-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    Compared to the official 2.6 version the current git master
    version's `rear recover` cannot entirely remove the build area. An
    orphaned `outputfs` remains causing the following warning

<!-- -->

    ...
    Running exit tasks
    Could not remove build area /var/tmp/rear.K0wbKZyga3vmP3O (something still exists therein)
    To manually remove the build area use (with caution): rm -Rf --one-file-system /var/tmp/rear.K0wbKZyga3vmP3O
    ...

-   Workaround, if any:  
    Not really required since the build area is removed anyway since it
    exists in the rescue environment only.  
    But it might be a nasty side effect (in future) and is a "change" in
    behaviour to the prior release version of ReaR.

-   Attachments, as applicable ("rear -D mkrescue/mkbackup/recover"
    debug log files):

I suppose it has something to do with @jsmeix major work (see also
commit 619a3b3ff76780e327269f73407fc25467c7801b) upwards. Anyhow there
is an empty outputfs not beeing removed thus the build area cannot be
purged in the rescue environment. As mentioned it might be kind of a
cosmetic issue rather than a real one or a works-as-designed point I
lost track of.

Thanks for the report. I think you mean my major work? It seems related
indeed, but I haven't seen it in my testing (maybe it was my oversight,
because it is a warning, not an error?)

Sorry. Obviously these were your commits. At the very end of the \`rear
recover\`\`this happens (reproducible) with the current git version.

@hpannenb  
I can reproduce it.  
After "rear -v recover" I have

    RESCUE localhost:~ # ls -ld /var/tmp/rear*
    drwx------ 3 root root 0 Sep  3 11:57 /var/tmp/rear.aYeRj4poiApK787

    RESCUE localhost:~ # find /var/tmp/rear.aYeRj4poiApK787 -ls
    26478 0 drwx------ 3 root root 0 Sep 3 11:57 /var/tmp/rear.aYeRj4poiApK787
    26849 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Sep 3 11:54 /var/tmp/rear.aYeRj4poiApK787/outputfs

I did not notice it because I always run `rear` in debug mode (usually
with `-D`)  
and in debug mode the build area is kept anyway.

Got it:  
In lib/\_input-output-functions.sh there is

    remove_temporary_mountpoint '$BUILD_DIR/outputfs' || BugError "..."

which results (with special added `set -x`) in the log

    ++ remove_temporary_mountpoint '$BUILD_DIR/outputfs'
    ++ test -d '$BUILD_DIR/outputfs'

so `$BUILD_DIR` is not evaluated (and then `$BUILD_DIR/outputfs` is no
directory).

@patrikdahlsll  
your issue seems to be specific for `BACKUP=CDM`  
because for me "rear mkrescue" and "rear mkbackup" work with
`BACKUP=NETFS`.

I am not a Rubrik CDM Cloud Data Management user  
so I cannot reproduce how it really behaves but I will try...

Thank you @hpannenb for noticing the bug and @jsmeix for fixing it,
sorry for having introduced the problem.  
@patrikdahlsll I suspect there are two different issues. And looking at
what you have provided, I suspect `.lockfile` may be the problem. Can
you please provide `/var/log/rear/rear-hostname.log` that was produced
by the failing run?

I suspect the fact that both OUTPUT\_URL and BACKUP\_URL are unset is
triggering the problem. `echo OUTPUT_URL=null >> etc/rear/local.conf`
fixes it.  
Now the question is, what is the intended semantics of `OUTPUT_URL=`
(empty, which is the default) if `BACKUP_URL=` as well (otherwise
`OUTPUT_URL` inherits the value of `BACKUP_URL` by default) and whether
it is intended to be different from `OUTPUT_URL=null`.  
Note that `BACKUP_URL=` (empty) is quite common if using external backup
methods, because they usually have no use for `BACKUP_URL`.

no need to say sorry for that little annoyance bug.  
You had cleaned up a possibly destructive mess of various scattered

To reproduce the problem in debug modes: adding `KEEP_BUILD_DIR=no` to
the configuration file will do the trick. (By default, the vale is `yes`
in debug modes, hiding the problem.)

Regarding whether or not OUTPUT\_URL and/or BACKUP\_URL must be set  
I found in `man rear`:

    An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output
    would be to add these lines to /etc/rear/local.conf
    (no need to define a BACKUP_URL when
     using an external backup solution):

    BACKUP=TSM
    OUTPUT=ISO

so it seems there are cases that are intended to work  
with both OUTPUT\_URL and BACKUP\_URL unset.

According to  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/16-Rubrik-CDM.adoc)  
it seems also `BACKUP=CDM` is meant to work  
without OUTPUT\_URL and/or BACKUP\_URL.

Hi,  
If I understand correctly you don't need any further logfiles from me
atm?

I have verified that adding to OUTPUT\_URL=null to site.conf solved the
problem as suggested.  
We have not used it with previous version of rear (2.5-something) with
CDM, we just let it drop the iso in /var/lib/rear/output/.

Current site.conf

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/hawkey:/usr/lib64/bind9-export:/usr/lib64/eog:/usr/lib64/samba:/usr/lib64/firefox"
    OUTPUT_URL=null

@patrikdahlsll  
thank you for your prompt feedback and for your workaround!

We have to find out what makes things like plain

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM

no longer work which is a related but separated issue.

`BACKUP_URL` unset (empty) is for sure supported, because many backup
methods do not make any use of it. One still needs some destination for
the output image (`OUTPUT_URL`) though. When `OUTPUT_URL=null`, ReaR
simply leaves the ISO image under `/var/lib/rear` and does not copy it
anywhere, which may be a satisfactory solution in some cases. The
question is, is `OUTPUT_URL` empty or unset intended to be the
equivalent of the literal `null`? If so, one might simply set
`OUTPUT_URL=null`, if otherwise unset, in default.conf or in some
script. This will simplify the code which would not need to deal with
the two cases: empty and `null`. See for example
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/f06e0d22eeb3bd45ad8ce0b8fce0b538e4534f93/usr/share/rear/prep/default/040\_check\_backup\_and\_output\_scheme.sh\#L69](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/f06e0d22eeb3bd45ad8ce0b8fce0b538e4534f93/usr/share/rear/prep/default/040_check_backup_and_output_scheme.sh#L69)
which correctly errors out if one uses `OUTPUT_URL=null` with `USB` but
does not complain in case of an empty `OUTPUT_URL`.  
Or
[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/f06e0d22eeb3bd45ad8ce0b8fce0b538e4534f93/usr/share/rear/output/default/250\_create\_lock.sh\#L9](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/f06e0d22eeb3bd45ad8ce0b8fce0b538e4534f93/usr/share/rear/output/default/250_create_lock.sh#L9)
which needs to be updated to use quotes around `$scheme` because
`$scheme` may be empty (which may well be the root cause of the problem
here).

@patrikdahlsll  
both issues should be solved  
since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2675](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2675)
is merged.

In particular a plain config like

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=CDM

should again work.

But I cannot actually test `BACKUP=CDM` issues, cf.  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667\#issuecomment-914281285](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2667#issuecomment-914281285)

So I would appreciate feedback whether or not  
the current GitHub ReaR master code that contains in particular  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/675eed16a5a048ace4cfdfadaa2b65c211604d88](https://github.com/rear/rear/commit/675eed16a5a048ace4cfdfadaa2b65c211604d88)
