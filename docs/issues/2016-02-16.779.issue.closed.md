After backup restore rear should move away files  
that should not have been restored - maily files that  
are created and maintained by system tools where  
a restore from the backup results wrong/outdated  
content that conflicts with the actual system.

Implementation details:

rear should not remove files (any user data is sacrosanct).  
Instead rear should move those files away into a  
rear-specific directory so that the admin can inspect  
that directory to see what rear thinks should not have been  
restored.

There should be nothing hardcoded in the scripts.  
Instead there should be a documented predefined list  
in default.conf what files are moved away by default.

There should be one single additional script that  
implements this functionality which is added to the  
"recover" workflow to be run after backup restore.

Background information:

Some files are created and maintained by system tools.

The generic traditional example of such a file was /etc/mtab.

Files that are created and maintained by system tools  
must not be restored with outdated content from a backup.

But rear must assume that the backup contains all files and  
that the backup restore restored all files.

Accordingly after the backup restore rear should move away files  
that should not have been restored.

In
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/780](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/780)
I implemented that functionality.

I tested it on SLE12-SP1 and that functionality works for me.

But my curent default.conf setting

<pre>
BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )
</pre>

seems to not solve
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/770)
because now I do no longer have real networking after recovery - I only
have the 'lo' interface but in the original system there was also
'eth0'.

Also with empty BACKUP\_RESTORE\_MOVE\_AWAY\_FILES I do no longer have
real networking after recovery so that moving
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules away is not the root cause why
I do no longer have real networking after recovery.

I should have mentioned that in the rear recovery system I do have
network and I can restore the backup from my NFS server.  
But I do not have network after rebooting into the recovered system.

Do you see any special messages via `journalctl` output related to a
missing file? According
[http://www.vcritical.com/2010/10/getting-eth0-back-in-a-sles-for-vmware-clone/](http://www.vcritical.com/2010/10/getting-eth0-back-in-a-sles-for-vmware-clone/)
we may delete the file or update it. As long that is not clear why
caused your issue we better not accept the pull request.

It seems somehow I messed up my test system because it also does no
longer work with the official SLE12 rear1172a package where it had "just
worked" in the past.

I will re-test tomorrow on new test systems (KVM/QEMU virtual machines).

All clear now for me:

On new test systems both the official SLE12 rear1172a package  
and the current upstream rear with my addons in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/780](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/780)
it "just works" on a SLE12-SP1 system - in particular I have network (I
use DHCP):

Interestingly removing /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules on my
SLE12-SP1 test systems does not change anything because it will be
recreated with exact same content after recovery:

Implemeted via
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/780](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/780)

I have tested the enhanced move away functionality so that also a whole
directory tee can be moved away by using in /etc/rear/local.conf

<pre>
BACKUP_RESTORE_MOVE_AWAY_FILES=( /var/tmp /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules )
</pre>

and for me everything "just works".

[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/784](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/784)
implements more safely remove for move away functionality so that only
the directory content is removed but the empty directory itself is kept
(e.g. useful to remove content in /var/tmp but keep /var/tmp)
