I would like to step back from personal responsibility for ReaR  
as a ReaR project maintainer with ReaR project write permissions.  
I can no longer bear personal responsibility for ReaR.  
I would like to stay but only as external contributor.  
I intend to further contribute as before (as time permits).

Since  
[http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture](http://relax-and-recover.org/documentation/security-architecture)  
I feel much relaxed because now  
we clearly describe and explain publicly  
to what extent we feel responsible for ReaR  
of course additionally limited by the GPL's  
"Disclaimer of Warranty" and "Limitation of Liability"  
and to what extent the user is responsible.
