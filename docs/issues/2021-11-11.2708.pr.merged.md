-   Type: **Enhancement**

-   Impact: **High**  
    Basically no impact on systems with a few disks.  
    Medium impact on systems with many disks (hundreds).  
    High impact on systems with very many disks (thousands).

-   How was this pull request tested?  
    I can only test on non-multipath systems with a few disks,  
    see
    [https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2708\#issuecomment-967073823](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2708#issuecomment-967073823)

-   Brief description of the changes in this pull request:  
    Get 'multipath -l' out of the function is\_multipath\_path  
    by adding a separated function is\_multipath\_used  
    that runs 'multipath -l' (which is expensive because it scans all
    devices)  
    to check if multipath is used and remembers the result in
    MULTIPATH\_IS\_USED  
    that is used in subsequent calls of is\_multipath\_used (without
    calling 'multipath -l')  
    so we can call is\_multipath\_used many times in is\_multipath\_path

The next ReaR version 2.7 should not be released  
without a fix for the root cause behind

"rear -D mkrescue" results same var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf  
as in
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2703)  
and the log shows about is\_multipath\_\* functions (excerpts)

    ++ is_multipath_path sda
    ++ test sda
    ++ is_multipath_used
    ++ type multipath
    ++ is_true
    ++ case "$1" in
    ++ return 1
    ++ is_false
    ++ case "$1" in
    ++ return 1
    ++ grep -q '[[:alnum:]]'
    ++ multipath -l
    ++ MULTIPATH_IS_USED=no
    ++ return 1
    ++ return 1
    ...
    ++ is_multipath_path sdb
    ++ test sdb
    ++ is_multipath_used
    ++ type multipath
    ++ is_true no

    ++ return 1
    ++ is_false no
    ++ case "$1" in
    ++ return 0
    ++ return 1
    ++ return 1

so to me all looks as expected.

"rear -D recover" just works for me as in \#2703  
and the log shows about is\_multipath\_\* functions (excerpts)

    ++ is_multipath_path sda
    ++ test sda
    ++ is_multipath_used
    ++ type multipath
    ++ return 1
    ++ return 1
    ...
    ++ is_multipath_path sdb
    ++ test sdb
    ++ is_multipath_used
    ++ type multipath
    ++ return 1
    ++ return 1

because there is no 'multipath' program in the recovery system  
so to me all looks as expected.

@pcahyna @rmetrich @rear/contributors  
if there are no objections I would like to merge it next Monday
afternoon.

@pcahyna  
if you know a better method than `multipath -l`  
which we should use in the new function is\_multipath\_used  
it can be done as separated further enhancement/optimization  
at any later time as you wish, cf.

@jsmeix sure, since our last discussion about multipath I have learned a
bit about it and managed to automate test machine deployments, so I will
gladly propose improvements if applicable, and do any tests that are
needed.
