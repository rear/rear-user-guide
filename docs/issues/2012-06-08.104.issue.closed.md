mkrescue fails with the following error:  
cp:
`/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib/libgsk8cms.so' and`/tmp/rear.WoQDtLpjov92Owe/rootfs/lib/libgsk8cms.so'
are the same file

There is a link to library \`/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib/libgsk8cms.so' in
/usr/lib:  
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 37 Jun 8 09:03 /usr/lib/libgsk8cms.so -&gt;
/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib/libgsk8cms.so  
The link is first copied to the target and than LibCopyTo tries to copy
the library from /usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib into a link pointing to the
same file.

Fix: Add -L option (follow symlinks) to cp to avoid symlinks in target.
Line 133 in /usr/share/rear/lib/linux-functions.

Which Rear version?

In trunk, we reworked library handling and removed LibCopyTo. Could you
test with that please? It's runnable from checkout these days.

The rear version I used: rear-1.13.0-1.fc16.noarch

The trunk version worked fine.

@kolb I am going to close this issue since we pro-actively fixed this in
the master branch. Your feedback makes it obvious we should probably
release more urgently. Nevertheless we will not release until we can do
automated tests on a multitude of distributions and configurations.

Thanks for your feedback and prompt reply !
