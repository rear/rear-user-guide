The current  
usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh  
works mostly by chance and not sufficiently fail save.

It blindly links /dev/cdrom or /dev/sr0 to
/dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER  
regardless what /dev/cdrom or /dev/sr0 actually is,  
perhaps the RELAXRECOVER labeled ISO image is attached to /dev/sr1?

And there is no proper error handling.  
If things fail it just proceeds.  
At least some meaningful error message should be shown to the user  
so that he is aware when no RELAXRECOVER labeled thingy exists.

For an example see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891\#issuecomment-411017183](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891#issuecomment-411017183)

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885)
is merged  
together with blockdev also lsblk gets included in the recovery system  
(if it exists on the original system) so that now lsblk can be used by
default to  
determine disk values and the block device structure in the recovery
system.

This can be used to enhance 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh to find out  
what kernel device nodes match RELAXRECOVER labeled thingies  
or CDROM devices in general.

For example in my recovery system  
on a KVM machine with two virtual IDE CDROM drives as in  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885\#issuecomment-410697398](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1885#issuecomment-410697398)  
I get

<pre>
RESCUE f144:~ # lsblk -i -d -o KNAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL
KNAME TYPE FSTYPE  LABEL
sda   disk         
sdb   disk         
sr0   rom  iso9660 RELAXRECOVER
sr1   rom          
</pre>

so that from this info /dev/sr0 is the right kernel device node that
should be linked  
to /dev/disk/by-label/RELAXRECOVER if such a link does not yet exist.

@jsmeix, we can also use `blkid -L <label>` for that purpose. It returns
the device associated with this label. Here is an example on one of my
system:

    # blkid -L RELAXRECOVER
    /dev/sr0

@schabrolles  
thanks for the more straightforward way to get it!

Unfortunately I had read the blkid man page that reads on my SLES12
system  
with `blkid from util-linux 2.29.2  (libblkid 2.29.2, 22-Feb-2017)`:

<pre>
It is recommended to use lsblk(8) command to get
information about block devices rather than blkid.
lsblk(8) provides more information, better control
on output formatting and it does not require root
permissions to get actual information.
</pre>

;-)

As always sleeping over it helped:

Meanwhile I think the following:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1891)  
and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/326)  
are exactly the same issue because in both cases the root cause is
that  
the /dev/disk/by-label/ directory is empty (or does not exist).

The only place where /dev/disk/by-label/$ISO\_VOLID is actually needed  
is by the mount\_url function in
usr/share/rear/lib/global-functions.sh  
when the URL scheme is 'iso' so that the only place where things can go
wrong  
is when the mount\_url function is called with URL scheme 'iso'.

Accordingly it is not needed to try to ensure in a recovery system setup
script  
that a symlink /dev/disk/by-label/$ISO\_VOLID exists that points to a
block device  
where a $ISO\_VOLID labeled thingy is attached to (that thingy is the
ReaR ISO).

The actually right place where to deal with this issue is the mount\_url
function  
when it is called with URL scheme 'iso'.

One advantage is that I do no longer need to test in the system setup
script  
the conditions when such a symlink is actually needed to avoid  
to show probably confusing 'false alarm' messages to the user.

Another advantage to deal with the issue where it actually causes an
error is  
that when the mount\_url function is called we are inside the running
'rear recover'  
where we have the full set of ReaR variables available plus the
UserInput function  
and the rear shell so that when the needed symlink is not there  
we can do a user dialog where the user can choose the right block
device  
or where the user can run the rear shell within the running 'rear
recover'  
to set up the needed symlink as he likes.

Accordingly I will move the basic code of the recovery system setup  
script 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh into the mount\_url function 'iso'
case  
plus additional enhancements there with a user dialog if things are not
o.k.  
and remove the recovery system setup script 67-check-by-label-cdrom.sh

This way I can also avoid the current awkward ways how to show  
messages to the user from a running system setup script:  
I would have to add sleep delays so that the user can actually read
the  
messages before they go away when all system setup scripts had finished.

Furthermore messages from a system setup script won't help much  
because the user can do nothing at this point because the  
system setup scripts cannot be easily interrupted:  
User dialogs in system setup scripts are awkward compared to  
user dialogs while a 'rear $WORKFLOW' runs because in the latter case  
we have the UserInput function that cannot be sourced by system setup
scripts  
because the current lib/\_input-output-functions.sh does also some  
very basic 'rear $WORKFLOW' setup like ExitTask setup and  
STDIN STDOUT STDERR redirection which is a known mess  
that would need to be cleaned up (like many other things in ReaR)  
but I find no time for things like

I will sleep once more over it  
and if nothing "appears" over night  
I would like to merge it tomorrow  
so that also @dewagner1 and @suseusr168 could test it.

With
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1894](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1894)
merged  
this issue should be fixed.
