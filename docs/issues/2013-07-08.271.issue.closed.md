Hi Team,

I have taken a rear backup (by excluding vg01) of my VM which has boot
disk as well as one more disk which belongs to vg01.  
Backup is completing well without vg01 data.

Whenever I am restoring this backup on new VM, then it only succeeds if
I am allocating vg01 disk as well.

    /etc/rear/local.conf contents are:
    [root@rhel64 ~]# cat /etc/rear/local.conf
    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://192.168.189.134/rear_bkp"
    EXCLUDE_VG=(vg01)
    [root@rhel64 ~]#

    [root@rhel64 ~]# rpm -qa | grep -i rear
    rear-1.14-3.el6.noarch
    [root@rhel64 ~]#

I just want to restore the backup without vg01.  
Is it possible?

Thanks,  
Vivek

In the `default.conf` file we find the following guidelines:

    $ grep EXCLUDE_MOUN /usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf 
    EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=()
    # NOTE: YOU MUST ALSO EXCLUDE THE CORRESPONDING MOUNTPOINTS IN EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
    # EXCLUDE_VG and EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS will get populated automatically, if needed

Thanks for the suggestion.  
I have already did this, but it didnot help me. I have only one mount
point in vg01.  
I have excluded that.  
Thanks for the reply.

@vivekpendse Can you list the `/var/lib/rear/layout/disklayout.conf`
file?

@vivekpendse the `disklayout.conf` script looks perfect. So, I don't
understand why the vg01 needs to be created. Would like to see the
`diskrestore.sh` script which is made during the recovery, is this
possible?

Hi,  
Please find below.  
I also didnot understand the issue.  
Few points which i noticed:

1.  Backup is getting restored on new disk, (when vg01 lun is not
    assigned to vm), but at the time of booting, it gives errors related
    to file systems.  
    But at the same time, if i assigned vg01 lun, then system boots
    perfectly fine.

Please find the contents of diskrestore.sh below:

Did you uncomment `/lvol1` in the `/etc/fstab` file on the recovered
system? If not, then it is normal that your system requires `vg01`.

Thanks for the reply.

When I had taken backup, that time I had mentioned vg & lv to be
excluded in /etc/rear/local.conf.  
Per your suggestion, I guess we need to comment out /lvol1 in /etc/fstab
before backing up if we don't want vg01 on targeted system.

Kindly confirm.

Thanks,  
Vivek

Commenting out on the restored system I meant, /mnt/local/etc/fstab
(before  
you reboot of course)

@gdha This may be something we should fix in Relax-and-Recover, e.g.
comment out devices/filesystems in /etc/fstab that we know have been
excluded. It seems somewhat related to \#22 (modifying /etc/fstab based
on known changes), there are probably other modifications required in
other situations. Brainstorm !
