(excerpt as needed here):

    The simple high level goal is to detect all changes in files where
    CHECK_CONFIG_FILES and FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS
    evaluate to.

(excerpts as needed here):

    My basic idea is to fully re-evaluate during "rear recover"
    CHECK_CONFIG_FILES and FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS
    and regenerate md5sums and then compare the md5sum results.
    ...
    I think correct md5sum comparison is crucial for users
    because users should be able to rely on our
    md5sum comparison to behave consistently.
    ...
    ReaR can detect when restored basic system files
    do not match the recreated system.
    ...
    I think with https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2795
    all needed code will be basically there.
    It only needs to be run in a more consistent way.

and  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796\#issuecomment-1116126796](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/2796#issuecomment-1116126796)

    I think that whole stuff needs to be overhauled and cleanly
    (i.e. more simple and straightforward) implemented like:

    1.
    Evaluate CHECK_CONFIG_FILES and FILES_TO_PATCH_PATTERNS
    to a local array of plain files and symlinks.

    2.
    Do symlink handling for the plain files and symlinks in that aray.

    3.
    Run "md5sum" for the results.

for some initial basic ideas (which are not meant as final tasks what to
do).

This issue will not be done for the (already delayed) ReaR 2.7.  
After the ReaR 2.7 release I intend to have a look - as time permits.
