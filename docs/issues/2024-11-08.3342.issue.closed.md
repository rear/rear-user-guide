ReaR maintainers action item:

    Johannes to clean up the “future” Milestone
    to remove old and forgotten stuff so that the
    milestone planning reﬂects more of our current reality

I "just blindly removed" the milestone "ReaR 999 (future)"  
from all issues which had been closed up to year 2021  
(ReaR 2.7 was released in July 2022 and I consider things  
before year 2022 as too old to explicitly care about)  
so this issues are now without a milestone set  
which is better than what it was before because  
before they had a false milestone set because  
"already closed" contradicts "for the future".

For the left issues with "ReaR 999 (future)" milestone  
I will have a closer look at each individual issue.

Currently there are 7 open and 10 closed issues  
with "ReaR 999 (future)" milestone, see

For the following closed issues with "ReaR 999 (future)" milestone  
I changed the milestone to "ReaR 2.8"  
because those are done in ReaR 2.8:

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2941](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2941)  
"Switch from bash 3 to bash 4 as minimum required bash version"

[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2928)  
"NETFS tar backup no btrfs subvolumes by default"

From this issue and from one other closed issue  
with "ReaR 999 (future)" milestone  
I removed the milestone.

For the remaining 13 issues (6 open and 7 closed)  
with "ReaR 999 (future)" milestone that milestone  
looks reasonable (or at least not wrong) to me  
so I keep it as is (at least for now), see
