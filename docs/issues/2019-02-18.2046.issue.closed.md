-   ReaR version ("/usr/sbin/rear -V"): rear-2.00-6.el7.x86\_64

-   OS version ("cat /etc/rear/os.conf" or "lsb\_release -a" or "cat
    /etc/os-release"): RHEL 7.5

-   ReaR configuration files ("cat /etc/rear/site.conf" and/or "cat
    /etc/rear/local.conf"): `BACKUP=NETFS`

-   Hardware (PC or PowerNV BareMetal or ARM) or virtual machine (KVM
    guest or PoverVM LPAR): VMware clients x86\_64

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device): x86\_64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot): BIOS

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe): local

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce
    it):  
    the customer has the issue as described in
    [https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-73-achieving-persistent-and-consistent-network-interface-naming-vmware-environments](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-73-achieving-persistent-and-consistent-network-interface-naming-vmware-environments),
    or in
    [https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2592561](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2592561)

When a new VM is provisioned it has the **ens**-style LAN interface
names instead of the older **eno**-type LAN names. The test was done on
a clone VM so that the **ens**-style has active and the ReaR image could
not active the LAN interfaces at boot time.

-   Workaround, if any:  
    manual edit the `/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/60-network-devices.sh`
    (and `62-routing.sh`) scripts and modify the LAN interface names.  
    Or, modify line:

<!-- -->

    RULE_FILES=( /etc/udev/rules.d/*persistent*{names,net}.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/*eno-fix.rules )

in ReaR script
`/usr/share/rear/skel/default/etc/scripts/system-setup.d/55-migrate-network-devices.sh`
before doing the recovery exercise.

I will prepare a PR for the skel and finalize pieces in ReaR

@rmetrich Have you seen reports within RH from customers about this
behaviour? With this little fix ReaR can deal with it - perhaps
something to add to the RH rear RPM?
