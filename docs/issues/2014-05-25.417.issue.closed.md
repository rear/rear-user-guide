Hi again

Is there a possibility to add btrfs subvolume to a rsync backup? The
problem is that rsync is called with --one-file-system which skips btrfs
subvolumes. Without --one-file-system it (tries to) includes all the
filesysems (like /proc and /dev). I did not find a configuration
parameter to add filesystems to the backup which are not listed in the
layout file (or /var/lib/rear/recovery/mountpoint\_device).

I would say for the moment *not*

All right. So I just use rsync manually to do this at the moment.
