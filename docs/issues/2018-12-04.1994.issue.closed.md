Virtualbox VM with Debian 9 started by Vagrant and deployed by
Ansible.  
Used for staging of REAR configuration.

-   System architecture (x86 compatible or PPC64/PPC64LE or what exact
    ARM device):

AMD64

-   Firmware (BIOS or UEFI or Open Firmware) and bootloader (GRUB or
    ELILO or Petitboot):

VirtualBox BIOS  
GRUB

-   Storage (lokal disk or SSD) and/or SAN (FC or iSCSI or FCoE) and/or
    multipath (DM or NVMe):

Emulated disk via VirtualBox.

-   Description of the issue (ideally so that others can reproduce it):

I deployed a fresh Debian 9 system from a Vagrant box. I installed the
standalone "borg" binary  
and installed REAR.

When booting the VM I get "Relax and Recover" as third item in the GRUB
boot menu. I can choose that and boot the system. Recovery will start to
partition the disks correctly. Then "borg" is called and quits
immediately with messages like "Failed to write all bytes for
\_bisect.so". Apparently that is caused by the root disk being full 100%
so borg fails to run.

However when I create a VirtualBox VM manually then there is space left
on "/" and recovering from the GRUB menu entry works as expected.

Booting from the ISO image works every time, too.

-   Workaround, if any:

Boot from ISO.

@gozora  
I assign it to you because it mentiones booting and Borg.

@Signum  
I know nothing at all about  
`Virtualbox VM with Debian 9 started by Vagrant and deployed by Ansible`.  
Can't you determine the available disks in that `Virtualbox VM`  
or explain what `the root disk being full` actually means?

Also `there is space left on "/"` is not really meaningful for me  
because within the running ReaR recovery system what is  
mounted at '/' is only the ramdisk of the ReaR recovery system.  
The actual system disk i.e. the target system disk (e.g. /dev/sda/)  
is not mounted at '/' within the running ReaR recovery system.  
The target system disk (e.g. /dev/sda/) gets partitioned and  
filesystems get created and those filesystems get mounted  
at /mnt/local within the ReaR recovery system while `rear recover`  
runs according to the data in disklayout.conf.

@jsmeix  
Sorry for the sparse information. It was not easy to get log files out
of the broken VM at that time.  
Would it be okay if I prepared a simple Git project with the necessary
files to run "Vagrant" in order to reproduce this issue? Or is this
asked too much? I would totally understand that.

Just as an enhancement idea: should REAR check if the recovery binary
(e.g. "borg") is available and can run before destroying the physical
disks and repartitioning them?

Typo by the wayâ€¦ I meant to say there there is *no* space left on "/".

Hello @Signum,

Honestly I've never used booting ReaR rescue system from Grub (apart
from writing couple of patches...), I simply don't like it ;-).  
I'll try to reproduce your problem and we will see.

> should REAR check if the recovery binary (e.g. "borg") is available
> ...

`borg` binary normally should be available since it is checked during
`rear mkbackup/mkrescue`.

> and can run before destroying the physical disks and repartitioning
> them?

We are talking here about disaster recovery, your system is already
destroyed :-).

I'll check what can be done in terms of pre-checks

I happen to have Fedora release 26 (Twenty Six) installed and configured
with ReaR Borg back end.  
I've let ReaR to create Grub boot entry:

    ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/45_rear ###
    menuentry 'Relax-and-Recover' --class os {
              search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 44123a90-d84b-49d9-9fb4-70664dc08174
              echo 'Loading kernel /boot/rear-kernel ...'
              linux /rear-kernel  selinux=0
              echo 'Loading initrd /boot/rear-initrd.cgz (may take a while) ...'
              initrd /rear-initrd.cgz
    }
    ### END /etc/grub.d/45_rear ###

Booted this entry and triggered `rear recover`.  
Everything works as it should.

After booting into ReaR recovery system, I've got following file system
layout:

    RESCUE fedora:~ # df -h
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    devtmpfs        374M     0  374M   0% /dev

    tmpfs           493M     0  493M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup

Then after starting `rear recover`:

Now I start to think that I did not fully understand what your problem
actually is ....

How can you have full disk, when running `rear recover`, when
`rear recover` will newly partition your disk, so it is empty ?  
Can it be that you are restoring to smaller disk than your backup
archive ?  
If so, how come that

> Then "borg" is called and quits immediately

it should take some time until your disk fills in ...

@Signum  
I use neither Vagrant nor Ansible.  
I only use KVM/QEMU virtual machines that I set up with 'virt-manager'.

I think to analyze what the root cause is here the crucial point is
not  
with what tool or stack of tools the virtual machine was set up.

I think to analyze what the root cause is here the crucial point is  
to inspect your environment (in particular your disks `parted -l` and  
your block devices `lsblk` and what is mounted where `findmnt` )  
in your new booted virtual machine before you run 'rear recover'  
to find out what the difference is between using the ReaR ISO image  
versus your boot method via GRUB.

@gozora  
because of

<pre>
I deployed a fresh Debian 9 system from a Vagrant box.
I installed the standalone "borg" binary and installed REAR.
</pre>

I have the dim feeling @Signum may try to run 'rear recover'  
from inside the target system disk (e.g. from inside /dev/sda1)  
instead of running 'rear recover' outside of the target system disk  
as usual for installation systems and/or rescue systems that run  
on a ramdisk only within the target system's main memory?

@gozora  
What I did:

-   "rear mkbackup" on $SERVER with /etc/rear/local.conf having
    GRUB\_RESCUE=yes
-   Reboot $SERVER
-   Choose "Relax-and-Recover" in the GRUB boot menu
-   Login as "root" once REAR has gone through the startup scripts
-   Find the "/" partition 100% full

I had overlooked `GRUB_RESCUE=y` in the initial description.  
I understand now how the ReaR recovery system is booted via GRUB.

@Signum  
what exactly is the "/" partition for you here?  
In the running ReaR recovery system "/" is  
a ramdisk that contains the ReaR recovery system.

@Signum can you maybe try to add more RAM to your VM?  
It might be that ReaR recovery system (the one you've booted from Grub
menu) have slightly more memory requirements then your ordinary initrd
used for regular boot ...

I tried `GRUB_RESCUE=y` on my SLES12 system  
(not with Borg but with BACKUP=NETFS using `tar`)  
and 'rear recover' (via 'Relax-and-Recover' in GRUB)  
did "just work" for me  
(with 1 GiB main memory in my KVM/QEMU virtual machine).

This is my disk usage after booting into the system:

    > df -h

    rootfs          210M  194M   16M  93% /

After calling "borg list" it instantly becomes:

â€¦and borg fails with "Failed to write all bytes for libcrypto.so.1.0.0".

It looks like BorgBackup has created a directory /tmp/\_MEIoKn9nB/ that

â€¦and that's pretty exactly 16 MB in size.

So either 210 MB is not enough for the root partition or it is not
expected that Borg creates that many files in /tmp.

@Signum that makes perfect sense.  
Standalone `borg` carries all its file and libraries in its executable
and extracts them to temporary location (mostly /tmp) upon its
execution.

I guess that you just need more RAM assigned to your VM and you are safe
...

@gozora  
You are totally right. RAM increased from 512 MB to 1024 MB and now the
RAM disk is large enough to start Borg. Oh, my. Sorry for being so
stupid not to track that down earlier. I rest my case. :)

This really seems to be a corner case. It was just unfortunate because
REAR destroys the existing partitions and then Borg fails. So perhaps it
could be checked if "borg" is executable. But in the end that's really a
minor issue.

Thanks everyone for lending me your brains.

@Signum  
thank you for your explanatory feedback what the root cause was.  
It helps us a lot to better imagine even special use-cases.

@gozora  
now I am thinking about to add another test to the recovery system  
startup scripts that checks for "sufficient" free ramdisk space in
advance  
before things fail in arbitrary weird ways later during "rear recover".

Currently I don't know what "sufficient free ramdisk space" could be  
to run "rear recover" successfully under usual circumstances.  
I guess a bit more than 16 MiB would be not too bad in general ;-)

On my KVM/QEMU system with 1GiB memory  
`df -h /` shows for the recovery system rootfs  
449M size where 228M are used (51%) and 222M are free  
before I run "rear recover" and after "rear recover" finished  
238M are used (54%) and 211M are free.

@Signum  
what does `df -h /` show for the recovery system rootfs  
before and after "rear recover" in your case?

I like to get an idea how much free ramdisk space is usually needed.

@jsmeix question of memory can be quite tricky.  
On my testing VM with Arch Linux I have really minimalist initramfs and
kernel:

    arch-efi:(/root)(root)# ll /boot/initramfs-linux.img /boot/vmlinuz-linux 
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8052959 Oct 29 19:17 /boot/initramfs-linux.img
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5875568 Oct 21 00:06 /boot/vmlinuz-linux

This means that my Arch VM will boot without any trouble with 256MB of
RAM.  
However if I run backup of Arch I have initrramfs (~200MB)

    arch-efi:(/root)(root)# ll /mnt/iso/isolinux/{initrd.cgz,kernel}
    -rw------- 1 root root 221129886 Dec  4 18:45 /mnt/iso/isolinux/initrd.cgz
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   5875568 Oct 21 00:06 /mnt/iso/isolinux/kernel

Which will fail to boot with 256MB of RAM.

This is why I think that it might be a bit hard to find universal way
how to resolve this ...

I guess @Signum was kind of lucky that he was able to boot, if his
initramfs would be ~16MB larger (e.g. by using MODULES=( 'all\_modules'
)), his ReaR recovery system would not boot at all.

@gozora  
I do not plan to abort when there is only very little free space  
but I like to show in any case how much free space there is  
(basically the `df -h /` output) and show a nice WARNING  
if there is only very little free space.

FYI:  
I did right now a recovery this way:

<pre>
# export MIGRATION_MODE=false
# rear -D recover & for i in $( seq 120 ) ; do df -h / ; sleep 1 ; done
</pre>

that shows me each second a `df -h /` output while "rear recover" is
running  
to (hopefully) detect significant space usage by some tools  
(e.g. temporary files that get deleted afterwards)  
but I found none.  
For me it increases steadily from 51% to 54% (which is 11 MiB).

@jsmeix just a short heads up on `df -h`.  
Not sure why but some of my test machines does not show `/` utilization
in ReaR recovery system:

*Arch*

    RESCUE arch-efi:~ # df -h /
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    rootfs             0     0     0    - /
    RESCUE arch-efi:~ # df -h

    devtmpfs        890M     0  890M   0% /dev
    tmpfs           997M     0  997M   0% /dev/shm
    tmpfs           997M  8.3M  989M   1% /run
    tmpfs           997M     0  997M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup

*Fedora*

    RESCUE fedora:~ # df -h /
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    rootfs             0     0     0    - /
    RESCUE fedora:~ # df 
    Filesystem     1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on
    devtmpfs          898160     0    898160   0% /dev
    tmpfs            1020272     0   1020272   0% /dev/shm
    tmpfs            1020272  8860   1011412   1% /run
    tmpfs            1020272     0   1020272   0% /sys/fs/cgroup

So yet another complication I guess ...

@gozora  
thank you so much for sharing your experience!  
You saved me from feeling hallucination because I had also experienced
the  
same both crazy `df` behaviour as you experienced within your recovery
system  
on my SLES12 KVM/QEMU virtual machine but somehow (on the same virtual  
machine with the same recovery system but booted anew for my various
attempts)  
it also "just worked" as shown in my above comments and I was wondering
about  
if I am hallucination that `df` had "just failed" for me in some other
attempts before.

Only a blind guess:  
Might those unexpected `df` failures within the recovery system  
perhaps be avoided by using `MODULES=( 'all_modules' )` ?
