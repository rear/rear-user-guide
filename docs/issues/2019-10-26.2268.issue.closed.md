    I cannot recover my ISO-Backup on UEFI platform.  
    I transfered the ISO with rufus to an USB Stick; after the boot

    the picture:

    On my other system, a legacy bios board Asrock J4205 all is fine
    without UEFI Mode.  
    Can you helb me to figure out the correct .conf?  
    All i want is to create a functional ISO backup (all-include, Boot
    and Backup)  
    On my other system, a legacy bios board Asrock J4205 all is fine
    without UEFI Mode.

Hi,

Why dont you do backup directly to usb?

[https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc\#bootable-usb-device-with-backup-to-usb](https://github.com/rear/rear/blob/master/doc/user-guide/04-scenarios.adoc#bootable-usb-device-with-backup-to-usb)

Hi gozora,  
i want to make a cronjob every 2 weeks and archive the ISOs by copying
to a NAS.  
OK, directly to USB worked after a test and reovering is successful.  
But i want to know why it is working on a legacy system and with UEFI
not.

Found the solution by myself...  
ItÂ´s necessary to convert the ISO to stick with "Universal USB Installer
v1.9.8.9" (Windows).  
There is the option to "try via DD" before choosing the ISO.  
Then booting and recovering worked fine!  
The other way is to convert directly under Linux with:

> dd if=backup.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1MB

Maybe there are other users here who are facing the same problem, so
thread can be closed or not...  
Rear is the best backup software for Linux!!!

@Schneckubuntu  
thank you for your feedback how you got things working  
for your use case.

I did not check the details here but I think  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/2210)  
looks like the same issue.

A side note FYI regarding  
using `OUTPUT=USB` but without also using `BACKUP_URL=usb://...`  
(e.g. using `OUTPUT=USB` with `BACKUP_URL=nfs//...`) see
