'mkbackuponly' does not copy its logfile to the NETFS place and  
'restoreonly' does not copy its logfile into the recovered system.

I noticed this while working on multiple backups  
cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/1088)  
but it is a general issue.

Since
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1121](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/1121)  
'restoreonly' copies its logfile into the recovered system  
via wrapup/default/990\_copy\_logfile.sh so that now after e.g.

<pre>
# rear -C basic_system -d -D recover
# rear -C home_backup -d -D restoreonly & rear -C opt_backup -d -D restoreonly & wait
</pre>

one gets in the recovered system

As far as I see making 'mkbackuponly' copy its logfile  
to the NETFS place requires either major changes  
or dirty hacks because for 'mkbackup' that happens  
via output/default/950\_copy\_result\_files.sh  
but the 'output' stange is not run for 'mkbackuponly'.

For ReaR 2-0 I will not do anything more here.

For ReaR 2.1 I would like to completely clean up the logging  
and then - I hope - things get cleanly solved everywhere.

I close the issue as "fixed" for 'restoreonly'  
and "won't fix" for 'mkbackuponly'.
