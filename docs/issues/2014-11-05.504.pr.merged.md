hi:  
this patch is related to the issue
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/483](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/483)  
when restoring drbd, we can set drbd to situation below:

1.  make local drbd primary and connect to peers, which is very
    dangerous, since it may overwrite good data of remote peer. rear ask
    for user's confirm (user need to type "yes" to enter the state). in
    this state drbd device can be written by rear, so further
    mount/restoring data of drbd device is possible.
2.  make local drbd secondary. rear didn't have this option for user.
    but it is no big deal. you can do that after restore/reboot and sync
    data from master.
3.  other state. currently rear use "drbdadm attach" to let drbd go into
    standalone state. in this state rear can not write to drbd device,
    so there is nothing need to do about it anymore. unfortunately
    "drbdadm attach" behavior is different between drbd version 8.3 and
    8.4. and upstream already confirm this is a feature, not bug. so
    "drbdadm attach" will fail under drbdadm 8.4 and restore will be
    interrupted.

in my opinion, rear seems simply use "drbdadm attach" to let drbd go to
a "nothing need to do" state. (maybe there are other use case when drbd
go into the state, but I can not think about it myslef).  
if we just want drbd go to "nothing need to do" state, we don't need to
do anything about drbd. so we may skip the "drbdadm attach" command and
let drbd at quiet state. this is what the patch do.

in theory if we let drbd go to standalone and primary state, we can
write to drbd device and prevent overwrite peer data, but the command to
do this is different between 8.3,8.4 and maybe 9.0.

and consider the real case when doing drbd node disaster recovery:

1.  there is still drbd node alive. so you just need to restore the drbd
    node and choose "nothing to do" state (press enter when rear
    recover). after reboot you sync data from remote peer.
2.  there are no other drbd node alive. so when restore you let drbd to
    to "primary" state and restore data to drbd device. since there are
    no other drbd node alive, you won't have risk to overwrite peer
    data.

so rear is enough now for each case. there maybe one thing happen: you
still have other drbd node alive, but when you restore you accidentally
type "yes" when rear ask for confirm. then you will overwrite good data
of peer. it is something like "rm -rf /\*". I hope I won't be that
unlucky administrator...
