I tried to run the system rear (rear-1.14-3.noarch.rpm) in a computer
SGI uv100 with SLES 11 SP1 and got the following error:

rear -v mkbackup

Creating disk layout  
ERROR: Unknown boot loader elilo found in '/etc/sysconfig/bootloader'

Is there any way to fix this?

Best regards,

@umcastello I noticed you closed this issue, is this no longer needed ?
Did you fix it in some way ? It would be nice to learn from your
experience :-)

The issue history states "@umcastello closed the issue 2 months ago".
That's why nobody offered to help you with this issue.

special code for SLES for the `mkbootloader` has been removed -

commit 29b7d36c430cd1b5587d21f06980e22684859369  
Author: Jeroen Hoekx <jeroen@hoekx.be>  
Date: Fri Feb 8 11:00:49 2013 +0100

    Remove special handling of Suse bootloader.

    Using the Suse saved bootloader information does not work when restoring to a
    system with a different layout.

please update your repository and try again...

@umcastello could you give rear-1.15 a try as there were some UEFI

Hi Dag,

The package dosfstools was installed.

What is the site for "rear for suse 11"?  
I need install the last version.

Regarding
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/229\#issuecomment-97048029](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/229#issuecomment-97048029)
I can explain why dosfslabel is still missing even on SLE11-SP3:

[https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=649046](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649046)
is about openSUSE 11.3 and SLE11 is basically based on openSUSE 11.1
(cf. the list of values for the suse\_version RPM macro in
[https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build\_Service\_cross\_distribution\_howto](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto))

Therefore the issue exists also in SLE11.

Unfortunaltely the issue was not fixed in any SLE11 service pack so that
dosfslabel is still missing even on SLE11-SP3.

I submittend an internal request to get dosfslabel included in SLE11.

As far as I understand it dosfslabel is only needed to recover vfat
partitions and because for UEFI Boot Loader its EFI System partition
(ESP) is a vfat partition, dosfslabel is also needed for UEFI.

Or are there more cases where rear needs dosfslabel?

@jsmeix No that is basically it - was yesterday busy with a bunch of
SLES SAP HANA systems based on SLES11SP3 and using UEFI to boot from, so
that is why dosfslabel was needed. However, as UEFI ISO creation is not
possible (see issue \#214) I disabled UEFI and to recover a one-time
boot into legacy BIOS is required. Afterwards, UEFI booting needs to be
configured manually...

Maybe in this case we will spend less total effort by removing the  
dependency on dosfslabel? mkfs.vfat allows setting the label and blkid
can  
be used to retrieve the label, with probably a bunch of other tools.

I am faster!  
;-)

I built our newest dosfstools from the Base:System development project
of the openSUSE build service in my personal playground project
home:jsmeix also for SLE11 (all SLE11 service packs and various openSUSE
versions and SLE12) for direct RPM download from  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/)

Please read  
[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:jsmeix](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:jsmeix)

For example how I installed it on my SLE11-SP3 64bit x86\_64 system:

<pre>
# wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/SLE_11_SP3/x86_64/dosfstools-3.0.27-93.1.x86_64.rpm
...
2015-04-29 17:32:45 (8.55 MB/s) - `dosfstools-3.0.27-93.1.x86_64.rpm' saved [91120/91120]
# rpm -Uhv dosfstools-3.0.27-93.1.x86_64.rpm
...
1:dosfstools  ######################## [100%]
# type -a dosfslabel
dosfslabel is /sbin/dosfslabel
dosfslabel is /usr/sbin/dosfslabel
</pre>

Note that this results a version upgrade from dosfstools 2.11 that is
originally provided (and supported) in SLE11 to dosfstools 3.0.27 and I
did not at all check if there are incompatibilities.

my .02  
When it errored out, I edited the script (All I did was comment out
the  
call for dosfslabel) told it to continue and it finished running the  
script just fine....

dosfslabel (fatlabel) is not part of dosfstools 2.11.

dosfstools 2.11 is provided up to SLE11-SP3 which means using dosfslabel
cannot work up to SLE11-SP3.

For the upcoming SLE11-SP4 we will provide a version upgrade to
dosfstools-3.0.26 (the same as we provide in SLE12) which means using
dosfslabel will work for SLE11-SP4 (and SLE12).

Regarding @RedBrick36 "comment out the call for dosfslabel":

I am not at all a sufficient expert in this area to imagine if leaving
out the call for dosfslabel may cause whatever issues elsewhere in
some/many/most? cases.

If it should work in almost all cases also without the call for
dosfslabel, a generic solution could be to test if dosfslabel can be
called and only use it if it exists.

@gdha how have you addressed a missing dosfslabel, when doing
UEFI-booting DR of SAP HANA SLES (cf.
[http://www.it3.be/2015/10/27/uefi-iso-boot-with-ebiso/](http://www.it3.be/2015/10/27/uefi-iso-boot-with-ebiso/))?
Have you installed dosfstools from the repo referenced by @jsmeix above,
or does the recovery work also without? I am concerned because of the
line in my `rear -v savelayout` log:

    /usr/share/rear/layout/save/GNU/Linux/23_filesystem_layout.sh: line 130: dosfslabel: command not found

If I actually tried also *mkrescue*, I would not ask stupid questions,
as it fails immediately with the clear message:

    # rear mkrescue
    ERROR: Cannot find required programs: dosfslabel
    Aborting due to an error, check /var/log/rear/rear-hostname.log for details
    Terminated

So you must have had dosfstools extra upgraded on your SLES11 server for
HANA recovery @gdha , right?

I am willing to obsolete the requirement of dosfstools by blkid and
mkfs.vfat, as outlined above by @schlomo , unless you guys have reasons
not to. I would post a pull request.

@pavoldomin Here is an example of a `/etc/rear/local.conf`file:

    # SAP HANA on UEFI capable systems need EFI and DOS tools.
    # SLES 11 SP3 does not have dosfslabel executable in package dosfstools-2.11-121.30.1
    # Download package with dosfslabel included from (SLES 11 SP4 and SLES 12 are fine):
    #  wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsmeix/SLE_11_SP3/x86_64/dosfstools-3.0.28-97.1.x86_64.rpm
    # and update it :
    # rpm -Uvh dosfstools-3.0.28-97.1.x86_64.rpm

    # ebiso package is available at (SLES 11 SP3):
    #  wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/gdha/SLE_11_SP3/x86_64/ebiso-0.1.4-7.1.x86_64.rpm
    # Install it: rpm -ivh ebiso-0.1.4-7.1.x86_64.rpm
    # Furthermore ebiso needs rear higher then 1.17.2 (e.g. use a development release)
    ISO_MKISOFS_BIN=/usr/bin/ebiso

    # Define backup method and location
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL=nfs://sgnt8133/var/archive

    # make sure to exclude ALL SAP HANA related volume groups and mount points
    EXCLUDE_VG=( vgHANA-data-HC2 vgHANA-data-HC3 vgHANA-log-HC2
      vgHANA-log-HC3 vgHANA-shared-HC2 vgHANA-shared-HC3 )
    BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/hana/*' )

If you would like to get rid of `dosfslabel` be my guest by creating a
patch using `blkid` and `mkfs.vfat -n label` scheme. I really don't
mind. It would save you lots of work (not to update dosfstools on all
SLES 11 systems). However, if you wish to do so - could you re-open this
issue so it is easier to track (for us). Or, perhaps, create a new
issue...

Thanks @gdha. I will indeed open separate new issues (dosfslabel is just
one of them) and submit patches for problems I am having with my current
DR tests, related with the complex uefi-booting landscape. You can
expect several pull requests coming from me next week ;)

@gdha  
I think your above example of a /etc/rear/local.conf  
for SAP HANA on UEFI capable systems  
would make perfect sense to be added into  
the new usr/share/rear/conf/examples directory  
(cf.
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/681)).

@gdha  
right now I copied dosfstools and ebiso to the openSUSE Build Service  
project Archiving:Backup:Rear to make them avaialbe at the same  
place where rear is:

<pre>
$ osc copypac -e home:gdha ebiso Archiving:Backup:Rear ebiso
$ osc copypac -e Base:System dosfstools Archiving:Backup:Rear dosfstools
</pre>

I will check how they build there.

If they build sufficiently there, I will adapt the URLs in  
your above example of a /etc/rear/local.conf  
for SAP HANA on UEFI  
and add it into the new  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples directory

Building dosfstools and ebiso in OBS Archiving:Backup:Rear  
looks fine:

They should be automatically published in a few hours  
which makes the RPMs available under  
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup:/Rear/)

@gdha  
when
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/683](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/683)
is o.k. for you,  
I can merge it.
