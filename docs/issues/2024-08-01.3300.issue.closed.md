Wouldn't be ncie to have in `SLES_LINUX.conf` an example for
`SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER`?

That is:

    $ cat /usr/share/rear/conf/SUSE_LINUX.conf 
    # some scripts need this
    COPY_AS_IS+=( /etc/sysconfig/network/config /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/functions )

    # uncomment for Secure Boot
    # SECURE_BOOT_BOOTLOADER="/usr/lib64/efi/shim-sles.efi"

`/usr/lib64/efi/shim-sles.efi` is in fact symlink to
`../../share/efi/x86_64/shim-sles.efi`.

The ReaR scripts in usr/share/rear  
are not meant as user config files so  
usr/share/rear/conf/SUSE\_LINUX.conf  
is not the right place for user config settings.

We have example user config files in  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/

What matches most from the file name is  
usr/share/rear/conf/examples/SLE11-SLE12-SAP-HANA-UEFI-example.conf  
which is the only one with UEFI in the file name.

Probably setting SECURE\_BOOT\_BOOTLOADER is no longer  
required with current ReaR upstream master code, see  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3306\#discussion\_r1735815475](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3306#discussion_r1735815475)  
so this issue is perhaps meanwhile obsolete.

@jirib Are you satisfied with above replies and updates in the example
configs?

With  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3276](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3276)  
plus  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3306](https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/3306)  
plus the updated SUSE documentation for SLE HA15 SP6  
[https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084\#issuecomment-2330953577](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/3084#issuecomment-2330953577)  
this issue should be sufficiently fixed.
