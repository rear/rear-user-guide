# Welcome to the Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) User Guide Documention pages

This is the home for the Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) User Guide Documention and everybody is welcome to improve the documentation.

This is a sub-project of [Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)](http://relax-and-recover.org/) to finally get a decent ReaR User Guide using:

- all pages are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide)
- use [mkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to create the site
- use the ReadTheDocs theme supported by mkdocs
- use docker to automatically build the site on the fly (while we edit the content before we publish)
- use GitHub Pages to automatically build the site and publish on [https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/](https://relax-and-recover.org/rear-user-guide/)
- anybody can provide comments and/or ideas via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide/issues)
- by clicking on the *feedback* link on the bottom of each page will bring you to a new GitHub issue
- anybody may create [pull request](https://github.com/rear/rear-user-guide/pulls) which may (or may not) be accepted

However, there is a catch, as with the main project we work on this voluntarily (for free), but the progress may be really slow due to the fact we still have to work for a living.

!!! note "Faster creation of documentation"
