# A bit of history

Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) was not the first project in its kind. Around the year 2000 there were two major Open Source Linux Disaster Recovery projects available:

- [Make CD-ROM Recovery (mkcdrec)](https://mkcdrec.sourceforge.net/) - First released in November 2000 by Gratien D'haese, who was the sole author. In 2012, Gratien officially stopped working on mkCDrec to focus entirely on developing ReaR.
- [Mondo Rescue](http://www.mondorescue.org/) - First released around 1999 (needs verification) by Hugo Rabson, the original author. Later, Bruno Cornec took over as the lead and continues in that role to this day.

The Linux Disaster Recovery project mkCDrec underwent a complete rewrite by Gratien D'haese and Schlomo Shapiro in 2006, leading to the creation of Relax-and-Recover (ReaR).

ReaR 1.7.25, released in mid-2010, marked a significant breakthrough for the project as the number of downloads skyrocketed after SuSe included it in its HA portfolio. A few years later, in mid-2015, ReaR 1.17.2 was incorporated into the core of the RedHat RHEL portfolio. Since then, we have lost track of how many people use ReaR daily or weekly, as both SLES and RHEL maintain their own branches of ReaR in their distributions.


When I remember other funny things I will add it to this history page.
